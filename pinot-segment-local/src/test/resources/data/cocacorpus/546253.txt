@@8537945 @1737945/ <h> The three principles of Islamic finance explained <h> Author : Published : 24 May 2005 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The principle that income can be derived from the time value of money ( that is , by placing money at the disposal of another person and receiving an increased return at some stage in the future ) has been a part of conventional financing for time immemorial . We know it as interest on loans and it has been as much part of our lives as earning a daily living . <p> Interest on a loan remains payable , irrespective of whether the cause or venture for which the money was advanced is successful or not . It means that a person can make money out of the mere fact that they have money and another has not . Some may say that there is an inherent injustice in a system where money is seen as a mere commodity to make more money . The old adage that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer certainly does seem to ring true in instances where debtors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks declare large profits in favour of a select few shareholders . <p> The concept that money is a commodity in itself that need not be invested into an underlying commodity to show a return has also played an important part in the development of a global financial system , where return on capital is measured on how well one can leverage positions as well as the application of derivative-based financial methodology . The art of making money out of nothing at all has been perfected in this regard but there is no doubt that the uncertainty , the highly leveraged exposures and the speculative nature of some of these financial tools have at times led to catastrophic results and devastating experiences for many . <p> These are some of the reasons that Muslims all over the world are turning in increasing numbers towards Islamic finance to provide them with a more reasonable and divinely moral approach to their financial affairs . <p> Background <p> Islam has a set of goals and values encompassing all aspects of human life , including social , economic and political issues . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interested only in salvation in the hereafter , rather it is a religion that organizes one 's life completely . The body of Islamic law is known as Sharia , literally meaning a clear path to be followed and observed . <p> The Sharia is not a codified body of law . It is an abstract form of law capable of adaptation , development and interpretation . The Sharia does not prescribe general principles of law , instead it purports to deal with specific cases or transactions and sets out rules that govern them . <p> The Sharia developed through four main Islamic juristic schools ( Hanafi , Maliki , Shafi and Hanbali ) and is derived from two primary sources , the Quran ( the transcription of God 's message to the prophet Mohammed ) and Sunna ( the living tradition of the prophet Mohammed ) , in addition to two dependent sources : ijma ( consensus ) and ijtihad /qiyas ( individual reasoning by analogy ) . <p> Islamic banks must have a religious committee made up of high-calibre religious scholars . This Sharia board has both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's practices are in line with the Sharia . <p> The prohibition of all sources of unjustified enrichment and the prohibition of dealing in transactions that contain excessive risk or speculation are among the most important teachings of Islam in establishing justice and eliminating exploitation in business transactions . Accordingly , Islamic scholars have deduced from the Sharia three principles that form the benchmark of Islamic economics and that distinguish Islamic finance from its conventional counterpart . <p> The prohibition of interest <p> The prohibition of usury or interest ( riba ) is the most significant principle of Islamic finance . Riba translates literally from Arabic as an increase , growth or accretion . In Islam , lending money should not generate unjustified income . As a Sharia term , it refers to the premium that the borrower must pay to the lender along with the principal amount , as a condition for the loan or for an extension in its maturity , which today is commonly referred to as interest . <p> Riba represents a prominent source of unjustified advantage . All Muslim scholars are adamant that this prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difference between interest-bearing funds for the purposes of consumption or investment , because Sharia does not consider money a commodity for exchange . Instead , money is a medium of exchange and a store of value . <p> Profit and loss sharing <p> Profit and loss sharing ( PLS ) financing is a form of partnership , where partners share profits and losses on the basis of their capital share and effort . Unlike conventional finance , there is no guaranteed rate of return . Islam supports the view that Muslims do not act as nominal creditors in any investment , but as partners in the business ( that is , essentially an equity-based financing ) . The justification for the PLS financier 's share in profit is their effort and the risk they carry , because their profit would have been impossible without the investment . If the investment makes a loss , their money is lost . <p> Gharrar <p> Any transaction that involves gharrar ( that is , uncertainty and speculation ) is prohibited . Parties to a contract must have knowledge of the subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement tainted with gharrar is an agreement to sell goods that have already been lost . <p> Financing techniques <p> Islamic scholars have approved certain basic types of contracts as being compliant with the principles of Islamic finance , which Islamic banks can use to attract funds and provide financing in an Islamic way . <p> Mudaraba ( finance by way of trust ) <p> Mudaraba is a form of partnership in which one partner ( rab-ul-amal ) provides the capital required for a project while the other party ( mudarib ) manages the investment using its expertise . Although similar to a partnership , a company need not be created , so long as the profits can be determined separately . Profits from the investment are distributed according to a fixed , pre-determined ratio . The capital provider carries the loss in a Mudaraba contract unless it was due to the mudarib 's negligence , misconduct or violation of the conditions pre-agreed upon . <p> In a mudaraba , the management of the investment is the sole responsibility of the mudarib , and all assets acquired by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Mudaraba contract eventually permits the mudarib to buy out the rab-ul-amal 's investment and become the sole owner of the investment . <p> Mudaraba may be concluded between an Islamic bank , as provider of funds , on behalf of itself or on behalf of its depositors as a trustee ( this has a different meaning to the English law concept of trustee ) of their funds , and its business-owner clients . In the latter case , the bank pays its depositors all profits from the investment , after deducting its intermediary fees . It may also be conducted between a bank 's depositors as providers of funds and an Islamic bank as a mudarib . <p> Musharaka ( finance by way of partnership ) <p> Musharaka is often perceived as an old-fashioned technique confined in its application to small-scale investments . Although it is similar to the Mudaraba contract , it is different in that all parties involved in a partnership provide capital towards the investment . <p> Profits are shared between partners on a pre-agreed ratio , but losses are shared in exact proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to invest wisely and take an active interest in the investment . Moreover , in musharaka , all partners are entitled to participate in the management of the investment , but are not required to do so . This explains why the profit-sharing ratio is mutually agreed upon and may be different from the investment in the total capital . <p> Murabaha ( cost-plus financing ) <p> Murabaha is the most popular form of Islamic financing . Within a murabaha contract , the bank agrees to buy an asset or goods from a third party at the request of its client , and then re-sells the goods to its client with a mark-up profit . The client purchases the goods either against immediate payment or for a deferred payment . <p> This technique is sometimes considered akin to conventional interest-based finance . However , in theory , the mark-up profit is quite different . The mark-up is for the services the bank provides - seeking and purchasing the required goods at the best price . Furthermore , the mark-up is not related to time because , if the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark-up does not increase due to delay and remains as pre-agreed . Most importantly , the bank owns the goods between the two sales and so assumes the title and the risk of the purchased goods , pending their resale to the client . This risk involves all risks normally contained in trading activities , in addition to the risk of not making the mark-up profit , or if the client does not purchase the goods from the bank and whether they have a justifiable excuse for refusing to do so . <p> Ijara ( leasing ) <p> Ijara is defined as sale of manfa'a ( that is , the right to use goods ) for a specific period . It is similar to a conventional lease . Under Islam , leasing began as a trading activity and then much later became a mode of finance . Ijara is a contract under which a bank buys and leases out an asset or equipment required by its client for a rental fee . <p> During a pre-determined period , the ownership of the asset remains with the lessor ( that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it continues to give the service for which it was rented . Likewise , the lessor assumes the risk of ownership , and in practice seeks to mitigate such risk by insuring the asset in its own name . Under an ijara contract , the lessor has the right to re-negotiate the quantum of the lease payment at every agreed interval . This is to ensure that the rental remains in line with market leasing rates and the residual value of the leased asset . <p> Under this contract , the lessee ( that is , the client ) does not have the option to purchase the asset during or at the end of the lease term because this is considered under the Sharia to be tainted with uncertainty . But this object may be achieved by means of a similar type of contract , known as an ijara wa iktina ( hire-purchase ) . In a hire-purchase situation , the commitment on the part of the lessee to buy the asset at the end of the rental period , at an agreed price ( with the rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the price ) , is established at the outset . <p> Salam ( advance purchase ) <p> Salam is defined as forward purchase of specified goods for full forward payment . This contract is regularly used for financing agricultural production . <p> Istisna'a ( commissioned manufacture ) <p> Istisna'a is a new concept in Islamic finance that offers future structuring possibilities for trading and financing . One party buys the goods and the other party undertakes to manufacture them , according to agreed specifications . Islamic banks frequently use Istisna'a to finance construction and manufacturing projects .

Under existing laws , foreign investors could only participate in the governing body of a public utility ( as directors ) to the extent that their proportionate share in the capital ( which is currently capped at 40% ) , and in no event can they be executive and managing officers of the public utility .

From the end of 2002 until October 2011 the Central Bank gradually loosened some restrictions , before starting to strengthen them again as a consequence of the global economic crisis and the depletion of its foreign exchange reserves . <p> Foreign exchange restrictions are not only imposed by the Central Bank but , in practice , also by the Argentine Tax Authority , through tax regulations . Foreign exchange and tax-related regulations are very detailed and specific and are frequently being modified . <p> Notwithstanding the regulatory foreign exchange and tax , in addition , since October 2011 , foreign exchange transactions have been generally subject to de facto restrictions , preventing local financial entities or exchange houses from processing operations of their clients that would otherwise be authorised pursuant to regulations . <h> Foreign exchange restrictions <p> Under the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowers have the obligation to transfer to Argentina foreign currency proceeds of such transactions with non-Argentine residents , or funds disbursed abroad and to sell them in the Argentine exchange market . Through these obligations , the government is trying to ensure the supply of foreign currency in the foreign exchange market . <p> Argentine residents are only allowed to buy foreign currency and to transfer it abroad if they are part of a cross-border transaction . The regulations contain a list of items regarded by the Central Bank as falling within the scope of cross-border transactions and establish specific requirements for each item . In general , cross-border transactions include transactions performed between Argentine and non-Argentine residents ( such as import of goods or services , or payment of dividends to foreign shareholders ) . Moreover , Argentine residents are rarely allowed to buy foreign currency to keep it outside Argentina or within the country with accumulation or saving purposes . Finally , non-Argentine residents are allowed to buy foreign currency in order to repatriate their investments subject to the prior compliance of a number of requirements . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand of foreign currency in the foreign exchange market . <p> The exchange rate in the foreign exchange market is determined for the supply and the demand of foreign exchange currency . This notwithstanding , the Central Bank not only intervenes in the market by establishing the obligation to sell the foreign currency and curtailing the ability to buy it , but also by selling and purchasing foreign currency by its own account . <p> The main requirements applicable to the inflows and outflows of the foreign exchange market are explained below . <h> Inflows of funds <p> Argentine exporters are obliged to bring into Argentina and exchange for Argentine pesos the export proceeds within a certain timeframe which varies depending on the exported merchandise ( in general between 30 and 365 days ) , since each tariff position in the nomenclature schedule has a different term . An extension of the term can be requested by the exporter and granted by the authorities in special cases . <p> In principle , the terms and their eventual extensions are only applicable to exports made as a consequence of sales made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made between related companies exporters are obliged to bring and exchange the export proceeds within 30 business days . <p> Oil , gas and mining importers which have formerly been granted with partial or total exceptions are obliged to repatriate all their export proceeds . <p> Argentine residents that provide services to non-Argentine residents are also obliged to bring into Argentina and sell in the foreign exchange market the amount in foreign currency collected for consideration of the services . <p> Argentine borrowers that receive loans or any other financial indebtedness from foreign lenders are required to bring into Argentina the funds received and sell them for Argentine pesos within 30 days . Moreover , a financial loan with non-resident parties ( including inter-company loans ) should have a minimum tenor of 365 days as from the date the loan proceeds are transferred into Argentina . Finally , at the time the borrower transfers the proceeds of the loan into Argentina , unless subject to one of the applicable exceptions , a compulsory non-transferable US dollar-denominated deposit must ordinarily be made in an Argentine bank for at least 30% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not earn interest , will have a minimum term of 365 days , and can not be used as collateral for any transaction . Subject to compliance with certain regulatory requirements , the following transactions are exempted from constituting mandatory deposit before referred : ( i ) foreign loans to finance Argentine imports and exports ( foreign trade financing ) ; ( ii ) loans to the Argentine residents and local entities ( excluding banks and other financial entities ) with an average duration of at least two years ( calculating principal and interests payments ) to the extent funds are used exclusively for investments in non-financial assets ; ( iii ) loans granted by multilateral and sovereign credit agencies ; iv ) financing obtained to repay foreign financial debts , when the proceeds of the loan entering into Argentina are used simultaneously to repay such foreign debt ; ( v ) financing obtained for investments in long-term foreign assets , when the proceeds of the loan entering into Argentina are used simultaneously for such investment ; and ( vi ) financing obtained for initial public offering of debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct investments from non-Argentine residents are , in principle , not obliged to transfer the foreign currency to Argentina , but should do so to ensure their ability to repatriate those investments abroad . At the time that the investment is brought into Argentina , a compulsory non-transferable US dollar-denominated deposit must be in principle made in an Argentine bank for at least 30% of the amount of the investment proceeds . This mandatory deposit has the same characteristics of the one described in the paragraph above . Its aim is to discourage short-term investments . <p> Foreign investment can be classified as either direct investments or portfolio investments . Direct investments comprise real estate investments and participations in local companies of at least 10% of the ordinary shares or voting rights , while portfolio investments are participations below this cap , debt securities of Argentine issuers , holdings in Argentine pesos and deposits in Argentine banks . Direct investments are in general exempted from the compulsory deposit requirement subject to compliance with formal regulatory requirements ( for example , the company receiving a capital contribution must file its registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange transaction and must prove the effective registration within a specific timeframe ) . Both direct investments and portfolio investments should exceed 365 days in order to be repatriated , unless a specific exception applies . <h> Outflows of funds <p> Argentine residents may pay imports abroad through the Foreign Exchange Market subject to compliance with formal requirements which include the holding of the special authorisation granted by the Argentine Tax Authorities ( described in detail below ) . At the time of clearing customs , importers are obliged to appoint a local bank which will be the entity in charge of controlling the payment of such import . <p> Argentine residents are allowed to purchase foreign currency and transfer it abroad for paying services rendered by non-Argentine residents subject to compliance with formal requirements and provided that the suppliers are not related parties or companies located in low-tax jurisdictions . In the latter cases , the prior approval of the Central Bank is needed unless the amount to be wired does not exceed $100,000 per year . Approval is rarely obtained . The formal requirements related to the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions consist in the submission before the bank intervening in the wiring of the funds of a legalised copy of the underlying contracts , a certification of the registration of the contracts in the applicable registries ( transfer of technology registry , for example ) and an external auditor 's report certifying the actual rendering of the service , the existence of the foreign debt and the reasonability of the price . <p> Argentine residents are allowed to remit profits and dividends to foreign equity holders when resulting from annual financial statements certified by external auditors . To the extent that profits or dividends are declared in annual financial statements certified by an external auditor , Central Bank regulations do not differentiate between dividends paid as a result of retained earnings of previous fiscal years or from the net income of the last fiscal year approved . <p> Argentine residents are allowed to make payments of financings granted from abroad subject to compliance with the requirements referred to above . <p> Non-Argentine residents are allowed to repatriate investments ( either by the sale of the shares of the investment vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or capital reduction of the local investment vehicle ) made in Argentina subject to compliance with the requirements referred to above . Further to such requirements , portfolio investments are also subject to a monthly cap of $500,000 and are required not to be located in a low-tax jurisdiction . When the case does not comply with these requirements , the repatriation is subject to the prior authorisation of the Central Bank , which is rarely granted <p> Argentine residents , including individuals and legal entities incorporated or registered in Argentina , are prevented from buying foreign currency in order to make direct or portfolio investments abroad and also to keep in the country for saving purposes . These transactions are subject to the prior authorisation of the Central Bank , which is rarely granted . <p> Argentine residents are not allowed to enter into and to buy foreign currency to make payments abroad under derivative transactions with non-Argentine residents without the prior authorisation of the Central Bank , unless an exemption applies . Among the exemptions are one available for derivatives governed by Argentine law and that provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that serve to hedge certain features of external debt or international trade transactions of Argentine residents . <h> Reporting obligations <p> Argentine residents are allowed to purchase foreign currency and transfer it abroad for paying indebtedness in general ( imports , services , dividends voted and not distributed , financial debt , and so on ) , provided the debt has been duly informed to the Central Bank pursuant to a special reporting regime . This regime establishes the obligation to inform to the Central Bank their indebtedness ( debt outstanding for more than three months ) in relation to non-Argentine residents on a quarterly basis . <p> Certain transactions ( such as direct investments received by Argentine residents from abroad , or repatriation of investments by non-Argentine residents ) are also subject to prior compliance with another special reporting regime . This regime regulates the information to be provided to the Central Bank by non-Argentine residents with direct investments in Argentina , and by Argentine residents with direct investments abroad . The reporting requirements establish different limits to determine the degree of obligation ( optional or compulsory ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be said that non-Argentine residents are obliged to inform direct investments in Argentina that are more than or equal to $500,000 , while Argentine residents are obliged to inform the direct investments or real estate held abroad that are more than or equal to $1 million . Participation in local and foreign corporations is calculated at the book value of the net worth of each relevant corporation . The value of non-Argentine residents ' or Argentine residents ' real estate is calculated at their fiscal value . <p> Special software provided by the Central Bank will be made available through the financial institutions in order to comply with these reporting regimes . <p> In addition to the regulatory requirements set by the Central Bank regulations , the bank or foreign exchange office intervening in the foreign exchange transaction has discretionary powers to request further proofs to show the authenticity of the transaction including its nature and amount .

Afterwards , upon a report of the Central Bank , the file is submitted to the federal criminal courts for resolution . <p> As an alternative to the foreign exchange purchase procedure , it should be mentioned here that the market has developed a securities exchange mechanism that enables to obtain an amount of foreign currency abroad with an amount in pesos held in Argentina .

There are certain restrictions related to import and services payments . <p> The restrictions consist of the obligation to file a special affidavit statement previous to all imports and services contracted from foreign residents ( there is no definition of " services " , but the regulations list a broad range of concepts covered by the system , including intellectual property licences ) . The obligations are locally known as DJAI , which stands for declaraci=n jurada de autorizaci=n de importaci=n ( affidavit statement for import authorisation ) and which is effective as from February 1 2012 ; and DJAS , which stands for declaraci=n jurada de autorizaci=n de servicios ( affidavit statement for services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 . <p> DJAIs must be filed in most cases , except for the following exceptions : re-imports of merchandise temporarily exported , imports made under the samples regime , imports made under the special customs regime for substituting defective materials , donations , diplomatic shipments , courier and postal shipments , and imports exempted from duties and taxes .

The main operators in the banking market are credit institutions . The Spanish term entidad de crTdito or credit institution refers to intermediaries operating in credit markets which , on a regular basis , receive funds from the public and use those funds on their own to grant loans or enter into similar transactions . <p> There are three types of credit institution in Spain : banks which are public limited liability companies ; saving banks ( cajas de ahorro ) , which are set up under a special legal form for non-profitable purposes although they operate as banks ; and credit co-operatives , which were originally set up to provide banking services for their own members but have now gained some flexibility as to who they may provide services to . <p> There are also credit financial institutions ( establecimientos financieros de crTdito ) , which consist of what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as finance leasing companies , building societies and money market houses . Royal Decree 692 of April 26 1996 regulates these types of institutions . <p> Setting up a bank <p> The setting up of a bank in Spain is subject to a prior non-discretionary administrative authorization from the Ministry of Economy and Finance . <p> This authorization is also required to incorporate a branch by a company not residing in a European Union member state . <p> Banks in Spain must take the corporate form of public limited liability companies and must have an initial capital of 18 million in registered shares , which must be fully subscribed for and paid up in cash . They must have their registered address or head office in Spain . <p> The basic steps for setting up a bank in Spain are the following : <p> 20% of the minimum corporate capital has to be deposited with the Bank of Spain ( Banco de Espaa ) either in the form of cash or securities . <p> If authorization is granted the act of incorporation must be carried out before a Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incorporation gives rise to a 1% tax on the share capital . <p> After payment of incorporation tax the deed of incorporation is filed with the Commercial Registry . <p> The bank must also be entered into a special administrative register kept by the Bank of Spain <p> Qualifying holdings in credit institutions <p> Spanish law on qualifying holdings differs in some respects from other European legislation . A qualified holding exists where the shareholder holds or intends to hold 5% or more of the capital or voting rights of the bank in question or if the intended holding would allow the shareholder to exercise control over the bank . All acquisitions of qualified holdings have to be notified to the Bank of Spain , which can object to the acquisition within three months if it considers the acquisition unsuitable . There is also an obligation to notify if the acquisition takes the shareholder above thresholds of 10% , 15% , 25% , 40% , 66% or 75% of the share capital or voting rights . <p> General control and supervision <p> Two separate institutions supervise the banking and securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Spanish Comisi=n Nacional del Mercado de Valores ( CNMV ) , the Bank of Spain , Spain 's central bank , supervises the country 's credit institutions and banking system . The Bank of Spain is completely independent and not subject to the Spanish government 's orders or instructions . In 1999 the Bank of Spain was integrated into the European System of Central Banks . <p> The Bank of Spain is therefore subject to EU Treaty regulations and must follow the European Central Bank 's regulations and instructions . The European Central Bank has exclusive authority over monetary policy , and the fulfilment of the said policy is carried out through the national central banks . <p> The Bank of Spain acts as supervisory authority and has the power to impose administrative penalties on credit institutions and their directors or managers who infringe the provisions of the 1988 Act on Discipline and Intervention in Credit Institutions , as amended . Infringements are divided into three categories : <p> Very serious infringements which include carrying out operations reserved for credit institutions without authorisation , failure to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include carrying out individual operations that fall outside the corporate object of the institution in question , failure to comply with obligations relating to cash deposits or other obligations deriving from monetary controls and failure to keep proper reserves ; and light infringements this is a catchall category and includes all infringements , which do not fall within the other two categories . <p> Penalties vary according to the seriousness of the infringement and may result in the revocation of authorisation to operate as a credit institution and/ or fines of up to 1% of the credit institution 's own funds . Directors or managers responsible for the infringement(s) may be fined up to 60,000 and suspended from their posts for up to three years . <p> Foreign credit institutions <p> One of the most significant steps in the process of implementing EU banking legislation in Spain was the 1994 Act that implemented the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive and introduced a single banking license under which credit institutions authorized to operate in one EU member state are also authorized to operate throughout the EU . <p> Credit institutions from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities provided they are authorized in their home state for the operations they intend to carry out in Spain . <p> Article 52 of the 1988 Act on Discipline and Intervention in Credit Institutions , which was amended to implement EU banking directives , lists the activities which can be carried out by branches of credit institutions from other EU Member States ( which differs slightly from the list in Annex II of the Directive ) : <p> Issuance and administration of means of payment such as credit cards , travellers ' cheques and bankers ' drafts <p> Issuance of guarantees and similar undertakings <p> Trading in the interbank markets <p> Trading on own account or on account of customers in negotiable securities , money market instruments , foreign exchange , financial futures and options and exchange and interest rate instruments <p> Participation in issues of securities , mediation in their sale on own account or on account of the issuer and the underwriting of issues <p> Portfolio management of securities <p> Preparation of commercial reports <p> Safe custody services <p> EU credit institutions can also provide services directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to do so immediately after the Bank of Spain receives notification from the authorities in the institution 's home state , which must list the activities to be carried out in Spain . <p> Credit institutions based in another EU member state acting directly or through branches or subsidiaries in Spain must also respect regulations adopted in the interests of the general public which have been passed by either the national government , the autonomous regions or local authorities , as well as Spanish provisions for the supervision and organization of credit institutions . <p> Financial credit institutions from outside the EU may also wish to operate in Spain either by offering services from an establishment abroad or by way of a permanent presence in Spain in the form of a subsidiary , branch or representative office . As regards subsidiaries the same considerations apply here as those which apply to the setting up of domestic credit institutions . <p> Branches of non-EU foreign credit institutions can be established using a procedure similar to that for setting up a domestic credit institution . The minimum funding for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be deposited with the Bank of Spain . <p> Two other considerations are relevant to the setting up of subsidiaries or branches by credit institutions from non-EU member states : compliance with the reciprocity principle and prior authorization from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance ( which , as set out above is not required for branches of EU credit institutions ) . <p> In the case of both EU and non-EU foreign subsidiaries or branches , prior administrative screening is necessary if the foreign investment involved exceeds 3 million . <p> Bank insolvency <p> The Bank of Spain may intervene in a credit institution and replace directors and managers in exceptional circumstances , which threaten the institution 's funds , stability , liquidity or solvency until the crisis is resolved . The intervention can be at the request of the directors , a minority of the shareholders or on the initiative of the Bank of Spain itself .

The purpose of the fund is to pay to holders of deposits held in the credit institution a given maximum amount in cases where the credit institution is declared bankrupt or goes under administration .

Its aggregate savings exceed its domestic investment . It therefore is a net exporter of capital . Most of this capital is pooled by institutional investors and a substantial part of it is invested in securities issued abroad . In the past , these securities were often financial innovations ( such as asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations ) that had been developed in New York and London . Investors were driven by the need to combine a safety comparable to government bonds with the yield they required because of the returns promised to their own investors . Decisions were often taken primarily on the basis of ratings . The securities were mostly governed by New York and English law and the structures relied on special purpose vehicles , limited recourse and different tranches of risk . <p> The financial crisis has accelerated another trend . Foreign issuers increasingly use German techniques and concepts . These are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law jurisdictions ) . But they have a long tradition in Germany ( as well as in some other jurisdictions such as Denmark ) where they have existed for several hundred years and have become a symbol of safety and reliability : Pfandbriefe , or covered bonds , and specifically covered bonds in the form of a peculiar German debt instrument ( essentially a hybrid between a bond and a loan ) the German **25;0;TOOLONG . <p> The prestige of the Pfandbrief in Germany can hardly be overestimated . It was emphasised again at the height of the financial crisis when the federal government said in the official reasoning of the stabilisation legislation that Pfandbriefe are " safe already " , that in its " more than 200-year history " there has never been a default on a Pfandbrief and that " the federal government will ensure that this remains the case also in the future " . This was not a formal guarantee ( which would have been harmful for the Pfandbrief because it would have turned it into a government bond ) but it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the VertrauenserklSrung ? the declaration of trust . <p> It is against this background that a debt instrument that used to be seen as a less than glamorous predecessor of structured finance became a model for other jurisdictions . Issuers from many jurisdictions were attracted and made an effort to issue instruments which were as close as possible to the German original . Often new covered bond legislation was introduced to ring-fence the cover pool in the event of an insolvency of the issuer . Other jurisdictions relied on structural or contractual solutions , namely cover pools held by a separate entity which then issued a guarantee . This resulted in a functional equivalent to the Pfandbrief since it created the same combination of an unlimited recourse to the issuer and privileged access to the cover pool . Moreover , specialised regulatory supervision was introduced in order to satisfy the criteria applicable to fund investors and German institutional investors . <h> N-what ? <p> One of the new concepts foreign issuers encountered was the **25;27;TOOLONG ? a word that most non-German-speakers find impossible to pronounce . This key obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of the documentation for a Canadian issuer ) the idea was born to call the instrument an N bond or N covered bond . <p> N bonds are very peculiar German debt instruments . They are not bearer bonds but are very different from English or New York law-governed registered bonds as well . The old practice of calling them German law registered bonds is therefore misleading . It is true that N bonds typically involve registers of bondholders . These are kept either by the issuer or by a registrar on behalf of the issuer . This is , however , merely a question of market practice . In order to issue an N bond , a register is not required . What is required is a physical certificate issued in the name of the investor . An N bond thus is a debt instrument which evidences an obligation of the issuer and is made out in the name of the creditor . Hence the German term Namensschuldschreibung which means " name bond " . The obligation of the issuer is not transferred by delivery of the certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan . For this purpose the N bond will usually be accompanied by a form of assignment agreement in the same way as a syndicated loan . N bonds may be assigned fully or partially which means that they are split up into several N bonds ( each evidenced by a new certificate ) . The terms and conditions of N bonds will also typically provide that the transfer requires registration of the new bondholder(s) in the register which is kept by the issuer or a registrar . Upon assignment , title to the certificate passes to the new creditor by operation of law . Each new creditor is then entitled to a new certificate being issued in its name . <p> N bonds are not securities in the narrow sense ( in the sense that the right evidenced by the instrument passes when title to the instrument is transferred ) . N bonds are securities only in a wider sense , namely in the sense that , at least in principle , the certificate is needed to enforce the rights of the bondholder . For a number of important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are treated like loans . <p> Given their similarity to loans , N bonds may not be cleared in a clearing system . Since clearing is usually a requirement for listing they may not be listed either . N bonds are not actively traded . Most investors are buy and hold investors : they intend to hold the N bonds until maturity . The transfers which do occur are mostly those from the bank involved in the placement of the N bond to the initial purchaser or from an initial purchaser to its subsidiaries ( for example within a group of insurance companies where the investment is then allocated to subsidiaries ) . N bonds are not deposited with securities depositories . They are kept in physical form by the investor . There are no global N bonds . They are definitive physical securities made out in the name of each investor . <p> At first sight , the absence of an active secondary market may appear to be a disadvantage . However , it is precisely this which attracts investors because it justifies what investors find most attractive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have to be marked-to-market . From an accounting perspective , they are treated like loans and can be shown in the balance sheet at amortised costs . Fluctuations in the market value result in hidden gains or losses , thus reducing volatility . It is hardly surprising , therefore , that the financial crisis has given a further boost to N bonds . According to Bundesbank statistics , the majority of all outstanding Pfandbriefe are now in N bond form and a large number of foreign issuers have started to include N bonds in their covered bond programmes or have started to issue them on a standalone basis . <h> N bonds and Schuldscheine <p> N bonds should not be confused with another similarly illiquid German debt instrument , the German certificate of indebtedness , or Schuldschein , which benefits from the same accounting treatment . Also hybrids between bonds and loans , Schuldscheine are even closer to loans . Unlike N bonds which constitute bonds ( Schuldverschreibungen ) for purposes of the German Civil Code , Schuldscheine are loans also for purposes of the Code and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 10 years if the rate of interest is fixed . As regards unsecured debt it is therefore common to issue a Schuldschein for maturities below 10 years and N bonds for longer maturities . Pfandbriefe or covered bonds under the covered bond regime of other jurisdictions may only be issued in N bond form ( irrespective of the maturity ) since a Schuldschein will not meet the first and most basic requirement of any covered bond , namely that it be a bond . <h> Regulatory features <p> Although a bond for purposes of the Pfandbrief Act and foreign covered bond legislation , N bonds are not securities for purposes of the Prospectus Directive . They therefore do no require a prospectus under the German implementation of the Prospectus Directive or that of another member state of the European Union . There is national German legislation imposing a prospectus requirement , among other things , on a public offer of N bonds . However , N bonds are merely offered to professional investors and are usually privately placed so that one or more exemptions from the prospectus requirement are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not generally exempted from the definition of deposit taking ( the raising of repayable moneys from the public ) . A public offer of N bonds in Germany ( especially to retail investors ) would thus require a German banking licence covering deposit taking or an equivalent licence from another member state of the European Union which could be used as a European Passport . Retail investors do not buy N bonds , however . The key advantage of N bonds , namely their accounting treatment , is not relevant for retail investors . The typical institutional investors who buy N bonds are not regarded by the German financial services authority ( the BaFin ) as belonging to the general public for these purposes . <p> The investors ( predominantly German insurance companies and pension funds ) buy N bonds almost exclusively as part of their restricted assets ( assets especially ring-fenced for the benefit of policy holders in the event of an insolvency of the insurance company or pension fund ) . This means that N bonds need to include a waiver by the issuer of set-off against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , investors must comply with the Investment Regulations for the Restricted Assets of German Insurance Companies . Investors will typically want to ensure that the N covered bonds satisfy the criteria of covered bonds under these regulations . This means that the issuer has to be a credit institution , that the proceeds are invested in assets ring-fenced for the benefit of the bondholders and that the assets are sufficient to cover the liabilities under the covered bonds during their entire maturity . Moreover , specialised covered bond regulation and regulatory supervision is required . This does not mean that the ring-fencing of the assets has to be based on statutory provisions ( such as special insolvency laws ) . A ring-fencing based on structural solutions ( especially cover pools held by separate entities which provide a guarantee ) is sufficient if it is accompanied by specialised regulatory provisions . <h> Governing law <p> Although there is no provision in the Pfandbrief Act requiring this , Pfandbriefe ( be it in N bond or bearer form ) are only issued under German law . When foreign covered bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond form the question arose whether N bonds could be governed by the laws of the issuer 's jurisdiction . However , the practice has become to issue N bonds exclusively under German law . N bonds are very peculiar German law instruments for which there is usually no equivalent in other jurisdictions . Moreover , German law N bonds are seen as more attractive by German institutional investors . <p> Combining a German law governed N bond with a covered bond regime under foreign law presents a number of special challenges . In order to be attractive for German investors the N bond has to be as similar as possible to a Pfandbrief in N bond form while issuers , rating agencies and local regulators will want to ensure that it is , as far as possible , a functional equivalent of the covered bonds issued under local law . Given the very different legal characteristics and practical mechanics of N bonds , these two objectives can not easily be reconciled , especially in the jurisdictions where the covered bonds rely on structural and contractual arrangements . Covered bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are convened across different series of covered bonds . Neither of these features are found in German Pfandbriefe . Additional contractual arrangements may be necessary in order to ensure that the position of N bondholders is the same as that of the holders of covered bonds under the local law of the issuer . The N bonds may or may not be described in prospectuses that are produced with respect to the covered bonds in bearer form . They may also be issued purely on a standalone basis . It may be advisable to produce additional German language documentation and sales material in order to ensure a successful placement . Since N bonds are privately placed with institutional investors , the issuance process will typically involve a much more active dialogue between investors , arrangers and issuers than is typically the case where bearer bonds are issued through the clearing systems . This is a new experience for many issuers , but is part of an effort which allows them to diversify their funding sources or allow , placements of covered bonds which otherwise may not be possible or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( especially German ) institutional investors make the majority of their fixed income investments in N bond form and will not consider covered bonds in any other form . Many foreign issuers ( including many UK issuers ) have already taken advantage of this and it is likely that the trend towards N covered bonds will continue .

But regulations affect the attractiveness of their guaranteed funding . <p> Commercial banks ' activity in project finance has hit hurdles under Basel III . Longer-term capital is now more expensive for banks , and products to take financings off balance sheets " such as project bonds " have been slow to take off in some emerging markets . <p> ECAs and multilateral banks were expected to make up some of the shortfalls . But demand for their services , which involves guaranteeing commercial banks ' loans , might change following new Basel regulations . <p> " My sense is that the leverage ratio and liquidity standards of Basel III have had the most impact on the project finance market , " said Azad Ali , counsel at Shearman &amp; Sterling . <p> KEY TAKEAWAYS <p> Although ECA-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-Basel III , new regulations may affect the attractiveness of guaranteed loans ; <p> The leverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio are expected to affect commercial banks ' participation in the project finance market ; <p> The net stable funding ratio ( NSFR ) has not yet received a lot of attention because it will not be implemented until January 1 2018 . However , Ali predicted that it will be crucial for project finance . <p> The NSFR requires that banks hold a minimum amount of stable funding that matches up with the liquidity characteristics of their assets and activities to reduce funding risk . <p> That 's difficult for project financings , which are of longer duration and would require backing by costly and longer-dated funding . " Instead of raising capital to strengthen the capital base , we 've instead seen disposals of project finance portfolios , " Ali added . <p> ECA-backed debt is not exempt . Sources agreed that ECAs and multilaterals will come under closer scrutiny under the NSFR . <h> " Not all ECAs are equal under the new normal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , " said Gabriel Mpubani , senior associate at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer . <p> Under the Basel II regime , the major ECAs were generally assumed to have the same risk profile as their sovereigns , so their products were perceived to have no risk . But , he added , the assessment is now more sophisticated . " If an ECA does n't have a full legal backstop , its products are independently risk-weighted " usually above zero " making them less attractive to the market , " he said . <p> Those with full backstops may benefit ; claims on sovereigns and multinational development banks can count as high-quality liquid assets . If they receive a zero percent risk rating , they can form part of a liquid assets buffer " assuming that they have a sovereign backstop . <p> Leverage ratio <p> While Basel II largely focused on risk-weighted capital allocation , Basel III 's new leverage ratio does n't take into account risk-weighting , said Mpubani . This has a potentially detrimental effect on the capital cost attractiveness of ECA-backed projects . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees and insurance products , and that ECA-covered debt has a better risk profile than similarly-situated but uncovered debt , " he added . As a part of the leverage ratio , there 's no consideration that the risk of default may be very low . <p> He believed that there should n't be much impact in terms of risk-weightings because the standardised approach to credit risk has n't changed from Basel II to Basel III . <p> He expected regulatory arbitrage from individual jurisdictions in determining the leverage ratio . Some jurisdictions have more lenient constraints in terms of the leverage ratio , and as a result their banks have been more active in the space left by those who are reducing the size of their project finance portfolios . <p> " It would n't surprise me that the multinationals are riding the crest of that wave by filling the gaps created in the market , " he said . <p> What 's next <p> Project bonds are increasingly popular because they can remove long-dated project finance assets from banks ' books . While greenfield project bonds remain innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinance projects , which avoids issues such as construction risk . <p> " Instead of going back to the bank market , borrowers are moving to the bond markets , " said Etienne Gelencser , partner in Shearman &amp; Sterling 's Tokyo office . <p> If some of those project bond tranches receive high ratings , they are able to count for liquidity buffers " an advantage of bonds over longer-dated financings . <p> Asian ECAs , however , will remain an important part of the financing landscape . Mpubani said : " I would suggest that Asian ECAs are , overall , in a better position than those European ECAs that can only provide cover but still need commercial banks to intermediate with that cover . " <p> This is because those banks still have to count the cost of Basel III on their capital costs and the wider attractiveness of any ECA cover , particularly when lending over longer tenors , he added . On the other hand , direct lending Asian ECAs can deploy their capital directly and more comfortably take a broader view on the capital regime .

These events were accompanied by substantial changes to our banking and financial laws . <p> Regulation of the Mexican financial services industry is characterized by these key features : <p> each financial institution can only engage in the operations it is expressly authorized to carry out , but all types of financial institutions may be controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as universal intermediation and differs from the universal banking model that consolidates various operations into a single institution , and from other systems that separate investment banking from commercial banking and/or insurance activities ; <p> unlike financial systems that have dual regulatory authority , or federal laws for certain intermediaries and state law for others , regulatory power is exclusively entrusted to the Mexican federal authorities and legislation ; <p> majority foreign investment is permitted for institutions incorporated in countries that have signed trade agreements with Mexico . Such institutions must set up a subsidiary in Mexico and are not allowed to open branches ; and <p> cross-border financial services are restricted for providers and liberalized for consumers . <p> Financial institutions <p> Financial institutions engage in financial intermediation and/or the provisions of financial services . Mexican financial institutions fall into the following groups , depending on the operations they are authorized to engage in : <p> The banking sector is based on commercial banks ( instituciones de banca mltiple ) , which are privately owned ; development banks ( instituciones de banca de desarrollo ) , which are controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ; and public development trusts . <p> Both commercial and development banks can engage in a wide range of operations with the public at large . They take funds from the public through deposits , loans and public offerings of securities . Banks may grant all types of loans ; enter into leasing and factoring operations ; invest in shares of other companies ( subject to several restrictions ) ; and provide a number of services like their participation as trustees and bondholders representatives . <p> Banks also engage in limited securities transactions , including intermediation with government and banking debt securities , and restricted derivatives transactions . Chequing current accounts can only be serviced by banking institutions while other products may , to some degree , be supplied by other financial institutions . <p> Even though development banks can perform the same operations as commercial banks , they do not operate at the retail level .

The IPAB can also intervene with banks in case there is a default in the support programmes . <p> Consumer Protection CommissionThis Consumer Protection Commission was also created in 1999 together with the IPAB . Its main purpose is to protect the interest of consumers . The Commission mediates between customers and banks , and can arrange conciliation or arbitration to solve disputes between banks and its customers , although such arbitration is not compulsory .

Hyundai Motor Group 's November purchase of $10 billion of real estate in Seoul 's Gangnam district was funded by three companies " Hyundai Motor , Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis " and prompted a renewed focus on board input and shareholder rights . The family behind Samsung was also active at the end of last year , listing Cheil Industries " its de facto holding company " on the Korea Exchange as part of its restructuring . <p> A chaebol is a large family-owned conglomerate , typically in which one chairman maintains control over multiple companies . The businesses often have complex interlocking ownership structures , and investors remain concerned about the possibility of related party transactions or actions that benefit the controlling family rather than individual shareholders . A so-called chaebol discount even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea are working to improve corporate governance and transparency within chaebol and other listed companies . One of these is the Korea Corporate Governance Service ( KCGS ) , a research institute that provides environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) ratings , proxy voting and socially responsible investment ( SRI ) consulting , among other services . It was established in June 2002 by four founding member organisations : the Korea Exchange , Korea Financial Investment Association , Korea Listed Companies Association and KOSDAQ Listed Companies Association . The Korea Exchange utilises its ESG evaluation data to publish its Socially Responsible Indices every September , encouraging companies to voluntarily improve their governance and lead shareholder-friendly management practices . KCGS also provides proxy voting services to institutional shareholders including the National Pension Service . <p> IFLR speaks with KCGS researchers about their work in both improving corporate governance within Korean listed companies , as well as improving ESG and SRI awareness in the country . <h> What are the criteria for which KCGS evaluates corporate governance ? <p> KCGS has evaluated the corporate governance of all KOSPI and KOSDAQ-listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2014 . The corporate governance evaluation comprises 100 multiple choice questions spanning five categories : protection of shareholder rights , board of directors , disclosure , audit system , and dividends . Each question can score between one to seven points , and the full score is 300 points . <h> " Large shareholders " including their related parties " should be responsible for their management 's behaviour " <p> Of these assessment categories , the protection of shareholder rights category has the largest weighting . KCGS evaluates whether firms have **29;54;TOOLONG policies , their ownership structure and the related party transactions ( RPT ) that may be happening between chaebol 's ' family members or affiliated companies . The policies that belong to this first subcategory include : cumulative , postal and electronic voting ; prior notice of shareholder meetings ; reaching the upper limit on the issuance of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants ; staggered boards ; golden parachute ; and a supermajority voting condition in the case of M&amp;A activity or CEO dismissal , among other considerations . <h> How does KCGS evaluate related party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more corporate-governance friendly than others ? <p> To maintain consistency in our evaluations , KCGS considers ownership structures based on the total shareholding rate with five criteria : <p> 1 ) total shareholding of registered executives excluding the largest shareholder and his family members ; <p> 2 ) total shareholding of outside directors ; <p> 3 ) total shareholding of the affiliated firms in a conglomerate ; <p> 4 ) total shareholding of the largest single shareholder and his family members ; <p> 5 ) total shareholding rate of the shareholders who hold shares greater than five percent of the total shares and are neither the largest shareholder nor his related parties . <p> Aside from this quantitative evaluation method , it is important that large shareholders " including their related parties " should be responsible for their management 's behaviour , as most of them participate in management of the company . <p> We also evaluate the internal transactions within or among the conglomerate member firms with six criteria , being the ratio of : <p> 1 ) the total value of transactions between the evaluated firm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluding related entities ) ; <p> 2 ) the total investment amount to the affiliated companies to the company 's net worth ; <p> 3 ) the total amount of payment guarantees and mortgage offer to the net worth ; <p> 4 ) the total amount of transaction between the evaluated firm and its related entities to the net worth ; <p> 5 ) the revenue induced by the affiliates to the total revenue of the company ; <p> 6 ) the purchase amount induced by the affiliates to the gross purchase of the company . <p> Korean chaebol conglomerate firms tend to show high internal-transaction rates , which can damage fair competition . We recommend firms minimise internal transactions and establish a holding company or execute a vertical integration . <p> So far , KCGS has awarded S-Oil Corp , Doosan Heavy Industries &amp; Construction and KB Financial Group as the companies with the best corporate governance in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . <h> What are some trends on corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) and socially responsible investment ( SRI ) in Korea ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ? <p> CSR and SRI are sprouting in Korea , and there is a gap between the interest shown by large-caps and small- or middle-caps . Multinational firms with potential customers and investors across the globe are sensitive to the public interest and try harder to put their efforts in CSR . They are verified by running an independent team or a committee solely designed for CSR . The total number of listed Korean firms that published CSR report has been growing ; it was 49 in 2009 , but had increased to 68 in 2011 , and then 77 for the period of January 2012 to April 2013 . Although most CSR reports are quite informative , with verification by third-party assurers and alignment with GRI 3.1 or G4 guidelines , they mainly focus on social and environmental issues while corporate governance issues usually take up only two to six pages . <p> The total net asset size of SRI in Korea is estimated to be over KRW 7 trillion ( $6.44 billion ) as of April 2013 . Public pension funds such as the National Pension Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SRI-friendly investment infrastructure in Korea . SRI-themed trustee investment size of NPS is about KRW 5.13 trillion , which takes up over 72% of the total SRI . That is followed by Korea Teachers ' Pension with KRW 146 billion , Government Employees Pension Service with KRW 120 billion , and Korea Postal Savings Fund with KRW 40 . Some private asset management firms sell SRI-themed public offering funds with the total net asset size of KRW 1.63 trillion , and there are two SRI-themed exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) in the domestic market with a total valuation of KRW 13.9 trillion . <h> How could corporate governance in Korea improve ? What are some of the changes that KCGS most frequently recommends ? <p> In the 2012 presidential election President Park Geun-Hye campaigned on a theme of economic democratisation " a slogan which emphasised regulating chaebol conglomerates to lessen the gap between haves and have-nots , and establishing a fair market economy through tough law enforcement . But regulatory reforms have been limited to some extent by chaebols ' strong opposition . <h> " Regulatory reforms have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The amendments to the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act ( Capital Markets Act ) in May 2013 enforced the requirement for listed companies to disclose the remuneration of individual directors and executive officers who receive an amount equal to or higher than KRW 500 million . Other amendments put an end to the shadow voting system from 2015 onwards ; through shadow voting , companies were able to meet the quorum requirement to pass resolutions with the help of the Korea Securities Depository , which cast votes on behalf of absent shareholders in proportion to the actual votes . Last December the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) amended the decree of Capital Markets Act letting firms utilise shadow voting for the next three years , until 2015 , in the case of introducing the electronic voting as well as the proxy solicitation . <p> In April 2013 the FSC formed the Financial Company Governance Improvement Taskforce , which formulated a plan to strengthen the role of board of directors by making them more responsible for risk management , and establish and disclose a remuneration system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 2014 , the FSC released the draft Corporate Governance Code for Korean financial institutions . This required them to publish a more detailed corporate governance annual report and explain their current governance under a comply-or-explain requirement to promote the monitoring activities within the market , planning to assess the forementioned corporate governance annual report through the assessment-specialised institution . After the 20-day public consultation period , the FSC released the Corporate Governance Code for Korean financial institutions with some amended content concerned with a director candidate nominating committee . <p> KCGS recommends firms build a more shareholder-friendly environment by introducing electronic and cumulative voting so that more shareholders cast votes , and make it easier for minority shareholders to propose agenda items at annual grand meetings ( AGMs ) . Additionally , KCGS recommends that firms adopt the comply-or-explain method when they publish their annual reports or sustainability reports based on best practice codes , such as KCGS 's ESG best practice code . <h> Are you seeing an increasing trend of shareholder activism in Korea ? How does KCGS contribute to that ? <p> We believe shareholder activism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting schemes became effective on January 1 2015 . So far most institutional investors have consistently voted in favour of the board of directors , which results from a lack of understanding and infrastructure to produce advice for exercising voting rights properly . However NPS , along with some asset management firms and minority shareholders , has made an increasing number of proposals in shareholder meetings . The total number of listed firms ' AGM agenda items proposed by shareholders in 2013 was 41 " nearly three times the 15 agenda items proposed in 2008 . <p> KCGS strongly believes that institutional investors should not follow the passive attitudes of investors trading shares , and exercise their voting rights to increase their customers ' benefits through becoming actively involved in monitoring management activities of target investment companies and making decisions as a representative of customers .

The gross-up clause thereby shifts the tax burden from the creditor to the debtor , which must then pay by withholding the amount of the tax due by the creditor . <p> Before the adoption of the Tax Code , this issue , on compensating a non-resident lender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated by the Law of Ukraine on the Taxation of the Profits of Entities ( No 334/94-BP , December 28 1994 , still partially in effect ) , which expressly prohibited such compensation . <p> Since the relevant provision had arguably vague language , however , in practice contractual tax gross-up clauses were always inserted into cross-border loan agreements . <p> In response to this practice , the State Tax Administration , in its Letter No 14086/5/22-5016 , clarified its official position on the possibility of using such gross-up clauses for cross-border transactions , by expressly prohibiting them . Although the letter expressly referred only to cross-border loans , it was thought also to be applicable to all cross-border transactions . Nonetheless , many Ukrainian lawyers continued to take the position that this letter was merely an opinion that could be disagreed with and ignored ( see this firm 's IFLR briefing of June 3 2010 ) . <p> Apparently in response , the prohibition on the gross-up clause has been expressly included in Article 161 of the Tax Code . Article 161 prohibits the insertion of gross-up clauses into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nonetheless included in a cross-border contract is voidable . As a consequence , the National Bank of Ukraine should refuse to register agreements which contain such gross-up clauses ( for which registration is required for payments to be made abroad in accordance with applicable exchange control rules ) , and the servicing bank ( the bank through which payments abroad under an agreement must be made by a resident debtor under Ukrainian exchange control rules ) should refuse to make transfers abroad based on such agreements . <p> There still appear to be some possible ways to avoid or mitigate the negative consequences from the prohibition of contractual tax gross-up clauses in cross-border agreements . One possible solution , especially in the context of a fixed-rate loan agreement , would be to include in the cross-border loan agreement a fee ( for example , an arrangement fee ) payable to the foreign creditor that might roughly equal to the total amount lost through the withholding tax on interest . Borrowers might want a proportional reduction of this upfront fee in case of prepayment of the financing . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the full interest that would otherwise be due on a financing . Under Ukrainian exchange control laws and NBU regulations , however , if the amount of the fees paid for services exceeds 100,000 ( $132,000 ) , a certificate of Price Expertise of the State Informational and Analytical Monitoring Centre for External Commodity Markets is required for transfer of the excess amount abroad , which in practice may be time-consuming and sometimes difficult to obtain . <p> Another possible solution to avoid the effects of the prohibition on gross-up clauses is , at the outset , to increase the interest rate due on the financing to the extent necessary in order for the bank to receive a sufficient interest income after withholding . On this basis , there would be no extra withholding to respond to , and thus no need for a gross-up clause , unless the applicable withholding tax would be subsequently increased , which could be addressed by making this a ground for early termination . Under Ukrainian law , though , there are limitations on the maximum interest rates allowed for cross-border loans : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euros and US dollars , 11% per annum ; for medium-term fixed-rate loans for one to three years in euros and US dollars , 10% per annum ; for short-term fixed-rate loans for less than one year in euros and US dollars , 9.8% per annum ; and for a floating interest rate , three-month Libor in US dollars plus 750 basis points . If such interest rate limitations are exceeded , a loan agreement may not be registered , and payments may not be made abroad under it . ( These interest rate limitations also previously could limit the effectiveness of gross-up clauses , which was not always understood by lenders . ) <p> As a consequence of the cited restrictions on fees for services and the interest rate limitations , and the relatively high interest rates set for most Ukrainian borrowers , the solution to mitigate the effects of the gross-up clause prohibition will usually be a combination of the two approaches , by imposing additional fees and higher interest rates . If the lender only reacts to the gross-up problem when registration is refused for its agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the withholding tax , this will appear to be done to replace the tax gross-up clause and may consequently be subject to attack as a disguised attempt to shift the tax burden and violate the prohibition on Ukrainian borrowers bearing the Ukrainian withholding tax on their lenders .

@@8537980 @1737980/ <h> Futej &amp; Partners <h> Address <h> Telephone <h> Fax <p> There are no prevailing legal requirements as to how many employees must be represented by a trade union for the union to be able to play a role within a Slovak company . Unions only need to satisfy the requirements for the establishment of a civic association ( that is , at least three members ) , after which employers must communicate with the union in the statutory manner . This communication includes consulting with the union each time the employer unilaterally terminates employment , or seeking the union 's approval for issuing new work rules . <p> The employer has no choice but to accept the formation of a trade union on its premises . From a practical standpoint , this first of all means that the employer must provide a space equipped as necessary and free of charge , and must permit the designated employees to conduct their activities and carry out the duties of employee representatives . In any event , the chief role of the trade union is to negotiate collective agreements where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In reality , however , a trade union only has influence over an employer if a sufficient number of employees have joined . This is for the most part felt in collective bargaining , where the trade union represents the interests of all employees , regardless of whether they are union members . If the trade union has the support of the absolute majority of employees , and meets other statutory conditions , then if a collective agreement can not be agreed upon with the employer , the union may declare a strike . In the past , a strike was more or less a last resort in the majority of companies in Slovakia and rarely ever occurred , but there is now social pressure to raise wages , and strikes or readiness to strike are becoming more common . Employers are trying to prevent this , even by initiating legal actions . It is possible for employers to apply for an injunction to interrupt an unlawful strike , whereby the court would order the trade union to interrupt all activities that could compromise the operations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts tend to dismiss these applications because the employer is unable to prove impending harm . <p> The presence of more than one trade union within a single employer is also common practice , as is another form of employee representation " the works council . Unlike a trade union , the works council does not have the right to collective bargaining or the right to enter into collective agreements . This is because the works council has no legal personality , and therefore can not enter into contracts or be a party to any lawsuits . <p> Sometimes the employer actually initiates the formation of a trade union , whether to eliminate a trade union that was formed previously or as a preventative measure to reduce the risk of the formation of an outside trade union . If an outside trade union were to try to come in , the deciding factor as to which union prevailed would be which of them had the support of most employees , as that union would be the one to enter into collective bargaining . However , it is also possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this situation , if no agreement were reached , the employer would negotiate with the trade union that had the most members . <p> In cases where an employer has both a trade union and a works council , the two bodies would share competencies in accordance with law . The trade union has the right to co-decision making , which means it has the right to grant or deny consent as dictated by law in cases where the employer does not have the right to make decisions without the consent of the employees . The works council retains the right to consultation " this would apply in cases where the law did not require the consent of employee representatives , but only a formal consultation . Both of these bodies have the same right to information in respect of the employer . The right to information includes information about the company 's economic and financial situation and the projected development of its activities . It does not mean , however , that the employer must divulge all information concerning its economic and financial situation . The employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or may demand that such information be held in confidence . The trade union also has the right , as opposed to the works council , to inspect safety and health protection at work . If the union finds serious problems with the company 's machines and equipment , the union can demand a work stoppage until the problems are resolved . <p> The details concerning the rights of employee representatives are typically set out in the collective agreement . For example , the collective agreement may set out the duty of the employer to notify employee representatives at certain intervals about average wages or the number of employees , or the conditions of the monitoring activity of the trade union .

This is mainly achieved by a providing for a set of strict mandatory rules on the circumstances which may lead to dismissal . <p> In particular , while a worker can decide at any time to hand over his resignation , with the only limit that he has to respect the notice period set forth by law or by the applicable National Collective Employment Contract , an employer has no such a freedom . <p> INPIDUAL DISMISSALS <p> There are two ways in which the employment contract can be terminated : <p> a ) with immediate effect for a just cause , consisting of a cause which does not allow for the continuation of the employment relationship even on a provisional basis ( Article 2119 cc ) . Therefore , the existence of just cause may entail termination without notice ( examples are gross insubordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) for a justifiable reason ( art . 3 Statute no. 604 of July 15 1966 ) , which may be subjective or objective : <p> - " subjective " , consists of a serious failure to comply with the employee 's contractual obligations ( the seriousness of the non-fulfilment is to be decided by a judge : examples of justifiable reason are repeated and unjustified absence from work , serious damage to the employer 's property , working without permission within the plant for third persons and insubordination ) ; or <p> - " objective " , justified by economical reasons inherent in the production activity , the organization of work and its proper functioning , with a notice period ( Employment Tribunals have reiterated the principle that the termination of the employment contracts due to the liquidation of an enterprise constitutes termination for an objective justifiable reason ( see for example Court of Cassation no.9147 of September 15 1997 ) . <p> DISCIPLINARY DISMISSAL <p> If the dismissal is caused by a failure by the employee to observe his legal duties or contractual obligations , a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so called disciplinary dismissal ) . The employer must : <p> send the employee a letter immediately before the dismissal , setting out what the employee did , and describing the facts on which the dismissal will be based ( facts which happened months ago can not be used as a just cause because the reaction must be immediate , even if not related to the date of the fact but with the date on which the employer discovered the fact ) ; <p> wait for the employee 's reply : he has to send it within five days ; <p> send the employee the dismissal letter , explaining why the employer did not accept his justification . <p> Failure to comply with this procedure will result in the nullity of the dismissal . <p> REMEDIES IN CASE OF UNJUSTIFIED DISMISSAL <p> The consequences of the dismissal in the case where the judge declares it to be unfair depend on the number of people employed by the enterprise , as follows : <p> if there are no more than 60 employees in total on Italian territory , or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a choice between making a new contract or paying an indemnity . This indemnity may vary between two- and-a-half and six months of remuneration . <p> In all other cases , the employee can obtain reinstatement and an indemnity for damages which covers the period between the invalid dismissal and the reinstatement order , with a minimum of five months salary . Instead of the reinstatement itself , the employee can choose , after the reinstatement order , to obtain , a sum of money equal to 15 months salary plus the indemnity for damages ( Article 18 of the Workers ' Statute ) . <p> Pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code , in any case of termination of the employment relationship employers have to pay TFR , even if there is a just cause : this is equal to the sum of each annual salary Pided by 13.5 . Therefore TFR has to be paid at the termination of the contract ( although the employer and the employee can make an agreement that it will be paid every month or every year during the execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the balance sheet . No social security contributions have to be paid on it . <p> Under the terms of Article 2120 , unless otherwise provided by collective agreements , the annual remuneration for the purpose of the calculation of the TFR , includes all sums , including the equivalent of compensation in kind , paid in connection with the employment on a basis other than an occasional one and excluding that which is paid by way of an expenses refund . Therefore only expenses refunds and payments made for reasons unrelated to the employment relationship ( eg unforeseeable or chance events ) , are to be excluded when determining the TFR . In fact , according to judges ' opinion every payment made by the employer to the employee has to be considered as salary even if not specifically related to the employee 's contractual obligation . <p> NOTICE PERIOD AND INDEMNITY IN LIEU OF IT <p> If there is no just cause for the dismissal , the employee has the right to receive noticed . It is possible to pay the employee an indemnity in lieu of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately and does not work out his notice period . <p> It should be noted that the majority of the judiciary takes the view that the notice period can not be converted by the employer to an indemnity in lieu without the consent of the employee . This means that where the employee does not give his consent to the conversion , the employment relationship will continue until the end of the notice period . As a consequence , those events which can suspend the notice period ( such as illness ) will defer the course of the notice period -and therefore the termination of the employment relationship ( with any relevant consequence such as the payment of the salary ) - until the interrupting cause comes to cease . <p> The length of the notice period depends upon the number of years the employee has worked ; the length of the notice period also depends upon the job classification , and level and qualifications of the employee . According to Article 2121 , the indemnity in lieu of notice shall be calculated by computing the commitions , bonuses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other compensation of a continuing nature , excluding what is paid by way of reimbursement of expenses . Finally , it should not be forgotten that social security contributions have to be paid by the employer on the indemnity in lieu of notice . <p> COLLECTIVE DISMISSALS <p> Implementing the directive of the EEC of February 17 1975 , Statute no. 223 of July 23 1991 has greatly modified the discipline of collective terminations in Italy . <p> Section 24 of the above statute defines collective dismissals ( redundancy ) , in all the economic areas , as that which is enforced as a consequence of a reduction or transformation of activities or labour . <p> The definition of collective dismissal requires that five dismissals have to be served within the jurisdiction of a given province . In each case the law is applicable to all the terminations that occur within the same period -provided as 120 days- and in the same territorial jurisdiction which are in any way connected to the same reduction or transformation . In order that collective terminations are considered as such , the law establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently , for those companies that do not reach such numeric limits , terminations will always be considered inPidual , even if they are multiple . Dismissals can be served only at the end of a three month procedure which starts with the notification of a social plan to the unions . Workers to be dismissed must be chosen according to criteria determined by the law or by collective agreements . <p> Another case for which a special regulation is provided -- which is not technically speaking a collective dismissal but is treated as redundancy -- is the " lay-off on CIGS " ( Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria or Wages Guarantee Fund ) . This kind of dismissal , provided for by section 4 , subsection 1 , takes place if , while the CIGS programme is continuing , the company decides it can not assure it will be able to reinstate all the workers who have been suspended and it can not resort to any alternative measures . In this case the consequences would be the same as those of the collective termination , but the numeric limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLLECTIVE DISMISSAL <p> As for the procedures that need to be applied , a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter . A brief outline of those procedures is nevertheless set out below . <p> The employer must give written notice ( containing specific information prescribed by the law ) to the representatives of the labour union at the company , as prescribed in Section 19 of the Workers ' Statute , and to the pertaining labour associations . If there are no such representatives , notice should be given to the labour associations that belong to the labour confederations with larger representatives on a national scale . <p> Within seven days from the date of receipt of the above notice , at the request of the union 's representatives and the pertaining labour associations , the parties meet to discuss and analyse the possibility of employing all or part of the redundant workforce in different ways , within the company , including the implementation of solidarity contracts and flexible forms of administration of the work time . Such procedures must be completed within 45 days ( 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The company must give written notice to the Labour Office regarding the results of the negotiations and specifying the reasons in the event of a negative outcome . In the event of reaching a trade union agreement , pursuant to Article 5 , the procedure will be complete and the employees may be dismissed and placed on the mobility list ( Mobilita ) . Where the parties do not reach an agreement , the Director of the Labour Office must summon them for a last negotiation . This period may not last longer than 30 days ( 15 if the number is less than ten ) . <p> Whether the parties reach an agreement or not , " the company is entitled to lay off both its white and blue collar workers and the redundant work force by giving written notice of the lay-off to each one of them with due " . Furthermore , the company must compile a written list of the laid-off workers , stating their names , place of residence , qualifications , hierarchy , age , family charges , and a detailed description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list must be sent to the Labour Office , to the Regional Commission of Employment and to the pertaining labour associations . <p> The selection of the workers to be placed on mobilita must be done according to the technical , productive and organizational needs of the company . In doing so , the criteria stipulated in the contracts between the unions and the employers must be strictly followed , or , in the absence of these , the company must adhere to those set out in previous interconfederal agreements such as family charges , old age , techical-productive and organizational demands . <p> As to the consequences of failure to comply with these provisions , firstly the law states that failure to give written notice and non-compliance with the procedure will render the lay-off ineffective . The redundancy is however void only in the case of violation of the selection criteria . Consequently , the provisions set forth in section 18 of the Workers ' Statute become applicable , making it possible for the worker to be reinstated in his or her position .

For example , Thrunet listed its ADRs on Nasdaq in 1999 during the internet bubble ( although it was later delisted ) while companies like G-market , Gravity and Pixelplus listed on Nasdaq in the mid-2000s . Since the mid-2000s , however , listings in the US became less popular among Korean issuers ( like other non-US issuers ) , due in part to the tightened corporate governance standards and certification requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act . Instead , Korean companies seeking to raise money from foreign investors sought other listing venues such as London or Singapore . For example , STX Pan Ocean listed its shares on the Singapore Exchange in 2005 and Lotte Shopping listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange and the Korea Exchange simultaneously in 2006 , which raised $3.7 billion . <h> Amendment to listing rules <p> In 2007 , the amendment of the listing rules in Korea that permitted Korean companies listing on the Korea Exchange to offer their shares to foreign investors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' equity financings from foreign investors . Since then , most of the large IPOs in Korea , such as the IPOs of Samsung Life , the largest ever by a Korean issuer , Samsung Card , Mando , Hi-mart and CJ HelloVision , featured an overseas tranche which was offered to institutional investors in the US and other foreign countries . The growth of the Korea Exchange in size and the recognition of it as a reliable market among foreign institutional investors also contributed to this trend . <p> The table on the page opposite shows IPOs listed on the Korea Exchange which included an international tranche . <h> International offerings : pros and cons <p> From the issuer 's point of view , selling shares to international investors in its IPO has both pros and cons . The primary benefits of offering the shares to international investors include the positive effect on pricing by bringing in a larger pool of investors and the opportunity to broaden the international shareholder base . International institutional investors also tend to hold the shares for a longer period than retail investors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These benefits are mostly highlighted in larger offerings , where it is necessary to find sufficient demand for the offering beyond the amount of capital available in the domestic market . <h> " The primary benefits of offering the shares to international investors include the positive effect on pricing " <p> On the other hand , international offerings increase the risk of investor lawsuits under US or other securities laws that may be more investor friendly than the Korean law . International offerings also entail the additional cost of preparing offering documents in English in accordance with the international standard , the fees of international counsel and accounting firms and expenses for global roadshows . Accordingly , only the large IPOs , usually with an offering size of more than $300 to $500 million tend to have an international tranche . For this reason , most of the issuers that chose to have an international tranche were established companies affiliated with large Korean conglomerates , or chaebols , rather than start-up companies . <h> Underwriting procedures <p> As these offerings are sold to both Korean and international investors , issuers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean securities firms , as underwriters . They enter into two separate underwriting agreements with the issuer " a standard Korean-style underwriting agreement covering the entire offering and an international underwriting agreement covering the international tranche . While the offering mechanics and subscription procedures are set out in the Korean underwriting agreement , the international underwriting agreement contains standard representations and warranties of the issuer , US-style indemnity provisions for misstatements or omissions contained in the disclosure documents , and typical closing conditions and termination provisions found in international securities offerings . In order to comply with Korean regulations , underwriting agreements are first signed at the time of filing the Korean securities registration statement , which are subject to the confirmation of pricing and signing of the final underwriting agreement . The final underwriting agreement with the final price is signed immediately after pricing . <p> In addition , two sets of offering documents are prepared . For Korean investors , a Korean securities registration statement including a Korean prospectus , is filed with the Financial Supervisory Service of Korea ( FSS ) , which is the regulator overseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular is prepared in accordance with the international market standards , including English financial statements prepared under Korean international financial reporting standards ( IFRS ) and management 's discussion and analysis ( MD&amp;A ) of the financial information . Considerable effort is taken to ensure that the Korean offering document is consistent with the international offering document , as any inconsistent statement could increase legal risk . In this process , certain sections of the offering circular , such as the risk factors and MD&amp;A are often translated into Korean and included in the Korean prospectus . <p> As with many other countries , the Korean prospectus is reviewed by the FSS , and sometimes the FSS provides material comments that can delay the offering process . Therefore , it is essential to prepare the prospectus carefully and build a cushion into the timetable to reflect any material comments from the FSS . In addition , the Korea Exchange reviews the eligibility of the issuer 's shares for listing before the offering process begins and sometimes it takes a considerable amount of time to clear the Korea Exchange 's review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other country and sold only to institutional investors outside of Korea relying on Rule 144A/Regulation S under the US Securities Act . <p> Some of the peculiar aspects of the Korean IPO process can raise issues in the context of the international offering . In Korean IPOs , the shares start trading a few days after the closing , which can be up to two weeks after pricing . The investors are exposed to any adverse developments affecting the issuer during this period , while they are not able to trade the shares . Another Korean regulatory requirement that often raises issues is the requirement to include underwriters ' valuation of the issuer in the Korean prospectus , which underwriters can be uncomfortable with . <p> IPOs on Korea Exchange with an international tranche <p> Issuer <p> Industry <p> Year <p> Size ( $ million ) <p> Int'l Offering Format <p> 1 <p> Samsung Card <p> Credit card <p> 2007 <p> 530 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 2 <p> STX PanOcean <p> Shipping <p> 2007 <p> 545 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 3 <p> Tong Yang Life Insurance <p> Life insurance <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beverage <p> 2009 <p> 545 <p> Reg S only <p> 5 <p> SK C&amp;C <p> IT services <p> 2009 <p> 500 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 6 <p> Korea Life Insurance <p> Life insurance <p> 2010 <p> 1,650 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 7 <p> Samsung Life Insurance <p> Life insurance <p> 2010 <p> 4,525 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 8 <p> Mando <p> Auto parts <p> 2010 <p> 460 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 9 <p> Hyundai HCN <p> Cable TV <p> 2010 <p> 80 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 10 <p> Hi-Mart <p> Retail <p> 2011 <p> 390 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 11 <p> CJ HelloVision <p> Cable TV <p> 2012 <p> 270 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 12 <p> Hyundai Rotem <p> Industrial <p> 2013 <p> 575 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 13 <p> Samsung SDS <p> IT services <p> 2014 <p> 1,100 <p> 144A/Reg S <p> 14 <p> Cheil Industries <p> Leisure and fashion <p> 2014 <p> 1,410 <p> 144A/Reg S <h> Looking ahead <p> It is expected that large Korean IPOs will continue to include an international tranche because it can bring in additional demand for the offering .

If the Korean equity market conditions improve , we may be able to see an increase in the number of sizeable IPOs from Korea , including those of chaebol-affiliates , privatisation of state-owned enterprises and start-up technology companies . <p> Another recent trend of overseas equity financing involves secondary listings of global depositary receipts on foreign exchanges , such as the Singapore Exchange , by companies already listed on the Korea Exchange . In 2011 and 2013 , OCI and Youngone issued global depositary receipts ( GDRs ) in this manner , which enabled them to issue shares at better prices than in domestic offerings . In 2014 , Hanwha Chemical and Industrial Bank of Korea also issued GDRs that were listed on the Singapore Exchange and the Luxembourg Exchange , respectively . While these GDRs are initially listed in foreign exchanges , most of them are soon converted back to the original shares and traded on the Korea Exchange .

The term encompasses matters concerning the federal goods and services tax ( GST ) , Canada 's various provincial sales taxes ( including the recently implemented harmonized sales tax or HST " see below ) , Canadian customs duty and excise taxes , and trade-related matters involving the domestic and international supply of property and services . <h> GST/HST <p> The GST/HST is Canada 's multi-level , value-added tax , and applies to virtually any good , service , or intangible supplied in Canada , with the main exceptions being specially defined zero-rated supplies and exempt supplies ( see below ) . The 7% GST portion applies to all taxable supplies made in or otherwise imported into Canada . An additional 8% HST was introduced on April 1 1997 on property or services which are supplied in or imported into Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , or Newfoundland , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favour of a model fully harmonized with the federal GST ( hence it is called the GST/HST ) . <p> The GST/HST is levied at each stage of the production and distribution chain , with the obligation to charge , collect and remit GST/HST to the Canadian government being on the supplier ( eg the vendor ) of the particular good , service or intangible involved . Where a person acquiring the property or service ( and paying the GST/HST ) uses the input for consumption , use or supply in the course of its business activities , it is generally able to recover the GST/HST paid in the form of an input tax credit . <p> Vendors making zero-rated supplies ( eg certain exported goods and services , prescription drugs , medical devices , basic groceries , etc ) do not charge tax on their supplies , and are able to recover the tax paid on their inputs . The result is that there is zero tax being borne by the final consumer of zero-rated items . Vendors making exempt supplies ( eg certain financial services , healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public sector bodies , etc ) do not charge tax on their supplies , but are precluded from recovering the tax paid on their inputs . As a result , a partial tax burden is passed on to the final consumer , even though no tax applies on its acquisition of these exempt goods and services . <p> Most suppliers of taxable property and services in Canada must register to charge , collect and remit the GST/HST . While this is the general rule , one major exception exists for non-residents , who are exempted from registration provided they do not otherwise carry on business in Canada . Non-residents can still voluntarily register for the GST/HST in certain instances , which will allow them to recover GST/HST paid on purchases in or imports into Canada . However , as a tradeoff non-resident GST/HST registrants generally must post security with the Canadian government for their anticipated collection obligations , and adhere to the strict accounting , reporting and administrative obligations imposed on all GST/HST registrants . <h> Provincial sales &amp; use taxes <p> While Nova Scotia , New Brunswick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimes in favour of participation in a harmonized federal model , there are six remaining Canadian provinces levying provincial sales and use taxes : British Columbia , Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec , and Prince Edward Island . Alberta , Canada 's other province , does not levy a sales and use tax ; nor do Canada 's two territories , The Yukon and The Northwest Territories . With the exception of Quebec , the sales and use taxes in these provinces are imposed on the sale or importation of goods , and on certain limited services . <p> In recent years , cash-strapped provinces have tended to increase the range of goods and services subject to tax . However , given that most transactions involving services are still not taxed , and that transactions in real property and/or intangibles are also generally not taxed , this means the provincial sales tax regimes continue to apply to a much narrower tax base than the GST/HST . Purchasers are generally required to pay retail sales tax at the time of a sale of goods and services , unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eg for basic groceries , books , production equipment ) , and the vendor is required to collect and remit the tax . Persons bringing taxable goods into a province for their own use are generally required to self-assess and remit the tax directly to the province . <p> Quebec represents a slightly different situation , in that the tax base in Quebec has been substantially harmonized with the federal GST/HST . However , some important differences do still exist between the GST/HST and Quebec Sales Tax . <h> Customs law <p> Customs law generally controls how goods cross Canada 's borders , both by imposing duties , taxes and other levies on imported goods , and by prohibiting or restricting the import of certain other goods , such as firearms . Customs duties are imposed on imported goods through the Customs Act and Customs Tariff . The Excise Act imposes certain excise taxes on imported goods . <p> Goods entering Canada from abroad must first be classified under Canada 's tariff classification regime . That regime is based on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System ( the HS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major trading partners , including the US , the EU , and Mexico . Once classified , the correct tariff treatment must be determined , because several tariff treatments potentially apply depending on the origin of the goods .

This has resulted in considerable litigation , particularly in the royalties area , and even legislative amendments to implement provisions not found in the valuation rules of other GATT signatory countries . <p> While duties and taxes are generally imposed on imported goods , the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff also contain a wide range of programmes designed to relieve imported goods from duties and/or taxes , for a variety of policy reasons . These programmes include duty drawbacks and duty remission . Drawbacks return duties and/or taxes on goods which are used in a specified manner ( eg machinery and parts used in certain production processes , goods either incorporated into exported goods or consumed in their production , etc ) .

As a signatory to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , Canada has also recently taken steps to ensure that its tariff classification , valuation , and rules of origin provisions are consistent with the WTO . <h> International trade <p> Commodity tax overlaps and includes many issues relating to the international trade of goods and services , and would include , for example , anti-dumping and countervailing duties , imposed under the Special Import Measures Act ( SIMA ) , and issues relating to NAFTA . <p> ' Dumping ' generally occurs where an exporter sells goods for export at a price lower than they charge in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material injury occurs to Canadian producers .

This recommendation was accepted by the Canadian government , along with most of the other substantive recommendations . <p> Canada , the US and Mexico are signatories to NAFTA , which is a comprehensive agreement dealing with many key aspects of trade between the parties . Among its other objectives , NAFTA also provides preferential duty treatment for goods which originate in a NAFTA territory or which are significantly produced in the NAFTA territory .

A foreigner may assume the role of director ; but when the director is conccurently the legal representative of the company , the foreigner director must have permanent residence in Vietnam . <h> 3 . Investment approval <p> a ) The regulator/s ' name , factors it must consider when making its decisions , and how much discretion it has ; <p> The Prime Minister has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This power is shared with the Ministry of Planning and Investment , which has overall responsibility to approve and manage FDI . Other ministries are vested with either the right to approve , or to comment on certain aspects of , an FDI project , depending on the specific industry . <p> b ) Any investment caps and other legislative restrictions ; <p> With its accession to the WTO , Vietnam has opened its economy to foreign investment and reserved only limited sectors where FDI is subject to a phased-out schedule before complete market opening . However , Vietnam does provide more favourable treatment to foreign investors from certain countries , such as Japan , where bilateral investment agreements exist . <p> c ) Which party must notify and when/if notification is mandatory or voluntary ; <p> To obtain approval for FDI projects in Vietnam , foreign investors must apply and submit an application dossier at the relevant licensing authority . The licensing authority has a certain level of discretion in approving or rejecting the application . <p> d ) What information must be included with notification and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two categories . The first category includes information about the investor , for instance , the investor 's corporate record details , and the individual representing the investor . The second category includes information about the company to be set up , and a description of the project to be implemented by the company . Under the second category , the most important information is the amount of capital to be contributed , and the business lines to be engaged . <p> The licensing authority does not charge to review the application dossier . <p> e ) How long does the review and approval process take , and are there any fast-track options ; <p> There is no fast-track option . The time for review and the approval processes vary . For sectors where the FDI project must first obtain the Prime Minister 's approval , it may take up to 6 to 12 months . The registration procedure takes roughly half a month ; the evaluation procedure takes roughly four months . <p> f ) Is there the ability to consult on a named or unnamed basis ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consultation can be conducted via meeting , telephone , or written documentation . <p> g ) Does notification/review occur pre- or post-closing , and are there any pre-or post-filing requirements unique to FDI ; <p> The assessment and review by the authorities are conducted after the full application dossiers have been submitted . If the application is successful , an IC is issued . <p> h ) What is the position if no response is received on an application for approval and are there any rights of appeal from disapproval ? <p> Investors may lodge a claim in case no response is received on their application , or in case of disapproval . A response is usually given within 15 business days of receipt . <h> 3.2 Briefly explain the investment restrictions for any special/restricted sectors . <p> For investment projects involving sectors or activities which may affect the environment ( for instance , manufacturing ) such projects are likely required to be located in an industrial zone , and may require an environmental impact evaluation report . <p> For certain service sectors listed in the WTO commitments , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market opening timeline . From January 2014 , most of the restrictions on FDI in service sectors under the WTO commitments will be relaxed or removed entirely . <p> For projects involving import , export and distribution services , investors must come from WTO member countries , provide proof of financial strength , and have sufficient relevant experience in these sectors . <p> For very special services such as banking , insurance , finance , and securities , FDI approval is subject to higher scrutiny , requiring the satisfaction of more stringent conditions . <p> The Vietnam Competition Authority has oversight over competition matters . Save for some exemptions stipulated by law , a merger , acquisition or consolidation which likely results in a combined market share between 30% and 50% of the relevant market must obtain approval . A combined market share greater than 50% is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances . <p> There are no deadlines or fees to submit a notification of a merger ( subject to review ) . The clearance process requires the submission of a file containing a number of items , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of goods and services , and a report on relevant market share . The entire file must be notarised , consularised , and translated into Vietnamese . A written response will be provided within 45 days after the file has been received , which may be extended twice , for a maximum of 30 days each time , for complex transactions . <h> 4.1 Tax and grants <h> 4.1 Are there tax structures and/or favourable intermediary tax jurisdictions that are particularly useful for FDI into the country ? <p> Both domestic companies and foreign invested companies are governed by the same tax framework . Vietnam has bilateral tax avoidance treaties with some countries , of which the treaty with Singapore enables Singapore investors to be exempt from capital gains tax in Vietnam . <h> 4.2 What are the applicable corporate tax rates ? <p> A company is generally subject to the corporate tax rate of 22% from January 1 2014 until December 31 2015 , and 20% from January 1 2016 onward . Lower tax rates may apply to enterprises meeting specific conditions set forth in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDI tax incentive schemes in place ? <p> Projects in encouraged sectors and located in areas of socio-economic difficulty , economic zones , and hi-tech zones , may enjoy the following : ( i ) exemptions from certain import duties ; and ( ii ) reduction or exemption on corporate income tax . <h> 4.4 Other than through the tax system , does the government provide any other financial support to FDI investors ? <p> In addition to tax incentives , qualified investment projects may enjoy lower rates , reduction , or exemption on land rents or land use levies . <h> 5 . Operating locally <h> 5.1 What is the most common governing law of contracts and local business language ? <p> Vietnamese law remains the most common governing law of contracts . <p> The most common business language in Vietnam is Vietnamese and , for transactions involving foreign elements , English is the dominant foreign language . <h> 5.2 Explain any local content or local participation requirements relevant to foreign investors . <p> As a member of the WTO , Vietnam is bound by the Agreement on Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local content or local participation applies . <h> 5.3 How difficult is it for foreign investors to secure expatriate visas for shareholder representatives and workers ? <p> Business visas for temporary stays in Vietnam are relatively simple . However , employment visas for foreign workers are getting tougher to obtain . Recently , Vietnam changed the visa laws . Any company planning to employ foreign workers must now undergo a rigorous review process before the foreign worker can apply for a work permit and resident card . The term for a work permit was reduced from three to two years . <p> Vietnam has strict foreign exchange control measures . Apart from very few exceptions , all transactions in Vietnam must be conducted in the local currency " the Vietnam dong " or risk being invalidated . <h> 5.5 Does the country prohibit domestic companies from doing business in any foreign jurisdictions ? <p> Vietnam does not prohibit its domestic companies from doing business in any foreign jurisdiction , but requires the company to obtain an offshore investment licence . <h> 6 . Legal and regulatory framework <h> 6.1 Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of ? <p> The key pieces of legislation governing FDI are the Law on Enterprises and the Law on Investment . In addition , foreign invested companies are subject to compulsory annual financial audits. <h> 6.2 What challenges if any do investors find in getting certainty around local law and regulation ? <p> Vietnamese laws are sometimes vague , ambiguous , and inconsistent . In such cases , the relevant authorities should be consulted to assist with interpretation . <h> 7 . Dispute resolution <h> 7.1 How efficient are local courts ' enforcement and dispute resolution proceedings , and are there any procedural idiosyncrasies foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> Commercial disputes can be resolved in court or , if agreed by the disputing parties , through arbitration . While it usually takes two rounds of court review ( trial and appeal ) before a judgment is considered final , an arbitration award is immediately final and binding when rendered . <p> During court proceedings , Vietnamese is the required language of communication , both verbally and in writing . The application of foreign law is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages during the proceedings , and the application of non-Vietnamese laws . <p> The courts usually hear and decide cases within 24 months or less . The length of arbitration proceedings varies depending on the parties ' terms of engagement and the governing arbitration rules . <p> The enforcement of judgments or arbitration awards is governed by the Law on Civil Judgment Enforcement . In practice , enforcement may be delayed due to lack of qualified personnel and any back logs . <h> 7.2 Do the courts of the FDI jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> A judgment granted by a foreign court can be recognised and enforced in Vietnam on a reciprocal basis , so long as the judgment does not violate basic principles of Vietnamese law . <p> Vietnam is a signatory to the New York Convention on the Recognition of Arbitral Awards . Therefore , recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards may be sought in Vietnam . Arbitration awards from countries that are not members of the Convention may be recognised and enforced if there is reciprocity between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 7.3 Are judgments and arbitration awards from Vietnam generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> The issue of whether court judgments from Vietnam are enforceable in other jurisdictions is case specific , depending on the laws of the enforcing country . Judgments in Vietnam are rendered after the parties have presented their arguments in a hearing on the merits . Under such circumstances , many courts around the world would typically enforce the judgment subject to typical grounds for non-recognition such as fraud or the local laws require reciprocity . Vietnam is not a signatory to any treaty on the recognition of foreign judgments . <p> In contrast , Vietnam is a member of the New York Convention on the Recognition of Arbitral Awards , meaning such awards from Vietnam should readily be recognised and enforced in other member jurisdictions . <p> Bui Ngoc Hong is a partner of LNT &amp; Partners .

Regulators have been looking into issues created by Reg NMS and HFT , but are now facing greater outside pressure to act . <p> " My concern is if this becomes a political problem that Congress attempts to solve , it 's hard to see how it will be beneficial for the market , " said Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equities market venue . <p> So far the current SEC commissioners , none of who voted on Reg NMS , have taken a less reactionary approach , but it is yet unclear if any new regulation will consider the information that was overlooked in 2005.

It is important to note that these structures are not equivalent to guarantees ; <p> Investors remain concerned about the enforceability of these deeds in a restructuring scenario , but these credits remain popular with investors looking for higher yields and China exposure . <p> In October Chinese real estate company became the first A-share company to list a bond without a guarantee by utilising a keepwell deed and deed of equity interest purchase undertaking ( EIPU ) . <p> Other Chinese real estate companies have since mirrored the Gemdale structure to tap the dim sum and US dollar-denominated bond markets . But as Chinese companies must clear regulatory hurdles to receive approval to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore subsidiary " usually Cayman incorporated . Investors are thereby structurally subordinated in a restructuring scenario . <p> Investors ' scepticism about such subordination is growing . But the global search for yield may keep them purchasing these bonds . <p> Keepwell deed <p> What ? <p> Keepwell deeds are intended to give comfort to the investor that a parent company will support the offshore subsidiary issuing the bonds . It is a contractual obligation between the supporting and supported company . It merely suggests willingness to keep the issuer solvent and is not subject to approval by mainland authorities . <p> They are not new structures , and counsel have stressed that investors are well aware of the difference between a keepwell deed and a guarantee . <p> But with a keepwell deed , the issuer 's parent company undertakes to the trustee of the bonds to ensure that the issuer stays solvent and has sufficient liquidity . The parent company also in certain instances undertakes that the issuer will retain certain financial ratios during the tenor of the bonds . <p> Why ? <p> This is because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keepwell deed is for a breach of contract , which is different from a debt claim under a guarantee . <p> " Under PRC law , the keepwell deed " if properly drafted " does not require PRC regulatory approval as it is not a guarantee , " she added . <p> If the company fails to fulfill its commitment to maintain sufficient levels of equity and liquidity to service obligations to the offshore bondholders , it constitutes an event of default . <p> However this is a way for real estate companies to attract international investors in the debt markets without requiring extensive Chinese regulatory approvals . <p> For Chinese companies to guarantee bonds , the country 's State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( Safe ) must approve the notes post-pricing so that the company can pay interest in principal offshore renminbi during the tenor of the bonds . This is seen as risky as the bond has already been priced when it applies for registration . <p> Although Chinacos such as China Railway Group and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology have applied for and received guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equity interest purchase undertaking <p> What ? <p> The other structure of interest in the Beijing Capital Land deal is the EIPU , first used in the RMB bond issue by the offshore subsidiary of Gemdale Corporation . <p> " We understand that this technique has previously been used in direct investments or private equity transactions but not in a capital markets bond issue , " she added . <p> Deeds of EIPU are increasingly supplementing keepwells , in a bid to bridge gaps in bond repayment amounts . <p> Heng explained that under an EIPU the parent company in China will undertake to buy assets of an offshore subsidiary 's onshore companies . This creates a channel for onshore funds to come from the parentco in China . If there is a default under the bonds , the parent will identify onshore assets in the form of equity interests in companies , which they can purchase from the offshore issuer and its offshore subsidiaries . <p> However , she noted , the completion of the purchase is subject to the relevant Chinese regulatory approvals at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors concerns that they do not have recourse to the company 's onshore assets . <p> Under the undertaking , the onshore parent company will purchase the assets of the offshore issuer and its offshore subsidiary for a price that will cover any debt obligations of the offshore issuer . <p> This structure circumvents the National Development and Reform Commission approvals required if a Chinese company wants to provide an offshore subsidiary for more funds . Because this structure involves the onshore subsidiary purchasing onshore assets , only the approval of China 's Ministry of Commerce and Safe would be required . <p> The report added the corporate governance track record and reputation of the issuer in both onshore and offshore funding markets , was a key consideration . <p> Fitch said that the treatment of the instrument rating will necessarily be on a case-by-case basis , because this evaluation requires significant judgment . <p> In a March report titled ' FAQ on Credit-Support Structures Used for Chinese Offshore Bonds , ' Moody 's concluded that given weaknesses that apply generally for keepwell agreements , the relatively new nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such arrangements on the Mainland , the agency is unlikely in most circumstances to rate the subsidiary at the same level as the parent . <p> But investors are uncertain of how these structures will be enforced . Restructuring lawyers warn that the deeds may not be enforceable in the event of a restructuring , and that it depends on whether the parent company is committed to supporting its subsidiary . <p> Neil Weller , director of alpha strategies at Blackrock , speaking at Euromoney Conferences ' Global Offshore Renminbi Funding Forum earlier this month , agreed that the key issue around these covenants was that a lot of the structures were untested . <p> " Companies have broken covenants , or they have n't been enforced , " he said . " It 's as important to understand a company 's intentions and management 's commitment to investors rather than just the precise legal terms of the document .

The government is also keen to attract foreign capital into other sectors such as land and sea freight , tourism , real estate , health , urban development , information technology and software development . <p> It should be noted that while Kuwait is a geographically small country , it is a wealthy country with a relatively open economy and self-reported crude oil reserves of approximately eight percent of world reserves . Petroleum accounts for nearly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 95% of government income .

Article 4 of the Competition Law provides that any ' agreements , contracts , practices or decrees , which are harmful to free competition , are prohibited ' and persons in a ' control position ' are further prohibited from engaging in certain enumerated transactions that are considered anti-competitive , or abuse their control position . A control position is defined in the law as a : ' position through which a person or a group of persons , that work with each other directly or indirectly , can control the products market . This is through possessing more than 35% of the volume of the intended market ' . The law further regulates mergers and acquisitions that could potential affect free competition . Article 8 provides for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisitions that will lead to a control position or increase an existing control position , to notify the Competition Authority who will examine the proposed action and either permit or reject the same .

All laws can be accessed from the Official Gazette archives . There are also a number of online resources that are frequently updated with the latest laws and amendments . However , there are ministerial resolutions that are frequently issued by ministries that may not be as readily available . These would typically require attendance at the particular government department to access them . <h> 7 .

Litigation matters are typically lengthy , as matters are generally referred to the Experts Division before they are considered by a judge . <h> 7.2 Do the courts of the FDI jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> Parties to a contract may grant jurisdiction to foreign courts over disputes that arise from their agreements . This however , does not prevent Kuwaiti courts assuming jurisdiction in certain circumstances . Additionally , Kuwaiti courts will only enforce foreign judgments if there is reciprocity of enforcement of judgments between the country that issues the judgment and Kuwait . <p> Kuwaiti law also recognises arbitration as a form of dispute resolution . Kuwait is party to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards , and should therefore recognise and enforce foreign arbitral awards rendered in a country which is also a party to the Convention . <h> 7.3 Are judgments and arbitration awards from the FDI jurisdiction generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> Ahmed Barakat is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law with Honours at Cairo University , Egypt ( 1981 ) and his Masters of Law in International Law and Business Transactions at New York University , US ( 1984 ) .

Before the amendment , the basic salary for this purpose was legally capped at MOP14,000 ( $1,800 ) . <p> The revision of this provision , which was considerably out of step with the socioeconomic reality of Macau , had been under discussion , and tried to accommodate the workers ' wish to end the legal limit provided with the more conservative position of employers ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did not accept removing an indemnity ceiling . <p> With the revision of the law , the maximum sum of compensation for unfair dismissal of the employee rose from MOP168,000 to MOP240,000 , as a result of the increase in the reference amount of the maximum monthly basic pay of MOP14,000 to 20,000 . <p> In addition to increasing the reference value for calculating the indemnity for unfair dismissal to a maximum of MOP20,000 ( unless a higher value was agreed between employer and employee ) , the update of said reference value should now occur every two years . This is in contrast to the previous legal wording , which only dictated the update of the reference value in accordance with the ' evolution of economic development ' . <p> However , pressure to change the labour law will persist , particularly with regard to the limitation of the multiplier for the purposes of compensation for unfair dismissal ( at present 12 times the basic salary , regardless of the duration of the employment relationship ) .

Those regulations however , did not go so far as to permit foreign players to engage in cross-border activities . Foreign companies were effectively locked out from making investments if they did not have a physical presence in China . <p> The next decade of economic liberalization resulted in big increases in the number of foreign invested enterprises ( FIEs ) being established . They took the form of equity joint ventures ( EJV ) , cooperative joint ventures ( CJV ) , or wholly foreign-owned enterprises ( WFOE ) . <p> In the wake of these changes , regulations were adopted that set the stage for joint venture companies to be established through M&amp;A transactions . A regulatory framework for these activities was created , where none existed before . <p> China 's accession to the World Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field in China for foreign investors , by further opening previously closed sectors of industry to foreign investment . <p> By gradually lifting restrictions on foreign players , particularly in the service sector , and increasing the number of industries where WFOEs are now allowed , the Chinese government has well and truly let the foxes into the hen house . It has also altered the need for foreign investors to resort to using joint ventures companies involving a Chinese partner . <p> In this changing landscape have joint ventures suddenly become passT ? <h> The Catalogue for foreign direct investment <p> To implement its WTO commitments , from time to time China promulgates an updated version of the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment . The Catalogue classifies foreign direct investment projects into three categories : encouraged , restricted and prohibited . All foreign investments that are not included in the Catalogue are permitted . The level of approval for the project and the availability of tax holidays are both derived from this all-important classification . <p> The Catalogue , together with the applicable regulations in each sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corporate form for project companies . In limited liability companies ( LLCs ) , which include EJVs , CJVs and WFOEs , registered capital is exchanged for equity interests . In contrast the registered capital of companies limited by shares ( CLS ) is divided into shares . However , investors ' liabilities in both types of companies are capped at their contributions to the registered capital . <p> A CLS possesses a striking similarity to western stock companies . It is governed by a board of directors under the supervision of its shareholders assembly . In contrast to LLCs , no decisions in a CLS need the unanimous consent of its shareholders . Also , a CLS may be listed on a PRC stock exchange . <p> Depending on the provisions of the Catalogue , the exact form of an LLC ( either an EJV or a CJV ) may either be allocated or left to the investors ' discretion . While the rules governing both entities are slightly similar , the regulations applicable to CJVs offer some additional benefits , including more flexibility for the investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , EJV regulations are firm on the point that both the number of directors and the division of profits should strictly reflect the investors ' shareholdings . This requirement does not exist for CJVs , which allow investors to arrange voting rights and the dividend rights differently . CJVs are commonly recognized as useful tools for infrastructure or energy projects where investors wish to get together on terms that are not commonplace in China . <p> Investors might also elect to establish a CJV that has no separate legal identity to investors . In this situation , each investor is responsible for contributing to the venture , paying its own taxes on profits derived from the venture , and bearing its own liability for risks and losses . However , this category of CJV is rare . <p> Often , instead of being a business option , resorting to a joint venture is an obligation . The Catalogue frequently gives no other choice to foreign investors who wish to invest in a wide range of industries ( life insurance , energy , construction of transportation facilities , higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was noteworthy for the Interim Foreign Investment Project Ratification Administrative Procedures promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) . The Procedures provide that foreign investment projects will be dealt with as follows , depending on their level of total investment ( including increases in capital ) and classification in the Catalogue : <p> Projects with either : ( i ) a total investment of $100 million or more in the encouraged or permitted categories ; or ( ii ) $50 million or more in the restricted category , must be reported to NDRC for ratification . <p> Applications for projects that are either : ( i ) in the encouraged or permitted categories and have total investment amounting to $500 million or above ; or ( ii ) are in the restricted category and have total investment amounting to $100 million or above , will be submitted to the State Council for final verification after initially being examined and verified by the NDRC . <p> Encouraged or permitted category projects where the total investment is below $100 million and restricted category projects where the total investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NDRC . These restricted category projects must also be ratified by NDRC at the provincial level . <p> As far as the approval process is concerned , recent proposals have been made by several ministries aimed at boosting control and approval conditions for foreign investment in certain industries . They include shipbuilding , nuclear activities , and equipment for the petrochemical and steel industries . <p> To circumvent this hurdle , foreign investors often decide to select a Chinese ally to dissuade administrative bodies from raising difficulties or delaying the approval of the project . Chinese partners also frequently undertake to supply both the joint venture and the foreign investor with market knowledge , contacts and legal and political information that would ordinarily be out of reach to the foreign party . These types of obligations can greatly assist with approval processes and formalities as well the smooth operation of the company . <p> In particular , land use rights needed by the joint venture might already be owned or could be acquired faster by the Chinese partner than by a foreign company wishing to establish an FIE as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese investor is in a better position to champion the rights of the joint venture than the joint venture itself , should difficulties arise in the course of operations . <h> Establishment by acquisition <p> Foreign investment in China has traditionally taken the form of greenfield joint ventures . Yet after 2003 , the popularity of M&amp;A transactions skyrocketed among foreign investors wishing to enter the Chinese market immediately or to control their supply chains in China . <p> Foreign investors have two options when purchasing equity : either investing in an FIE or in a Chinese company with no foreign investment . This Chinese company is then transformed into an FIE after the acquisition . <p> Any acquisitions require the approval from Ministry of Commerce ( Mofcom ) or its local branches . Additional approval from agencies in various sectors of the economy might also be required . For example , transactions in the banking sector must get a green light from the China Banking Regulatory Commission , while transactions in the insurance sector require the China Insurance Regulatory Commission 's approval . <p> In this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions ( Provisions on the Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors ) . Those revised regulations will require new regulatory approvals for transactions involving offshore special purpose vehicles . <p> After an investment project is approved , the investors can proceed with registering the project company with the administration for industry and commerce . This agency will also issue a business licence to the joint venture , which is needed before the joint venture company can open for business . <h> Means and amount of contributions <p> Joint ventures and WFOEs have a limited capacity to become indebted . As a result , their registered capital must never be less than a certain proportion of their total investment . In this context , total investment refers to the sum of the registered capital and the amount of the company 's medium- and long-term debts ( see Table 1 ) . <p> Capital contributions can be made in cash , patented and unpatented technology , materials and equipment or other property rights .

The New Law governs domestic companies but also supplements the laws and regulations applying to FIEs . If there is a conflict between the provisions in the regulations on foreign investment and the New Law , the regulations prevail . Consequently , the New Law only applies to joint ventures in areas where the existing regulations on FIEs are silent . <p> For example , the New Law makes a general provision broadening the range of methods by which investors can contribute to registered capital in companies . Contributions of " non-cash assets which have a monetary value and are legally transferable " can now account for up to 70% of the new company 's total registered capital . However , the New Law does not specify whether non-cash assets include shares . Unfortunately , as a result , this new rule will not benefit foreign investors establishing joint ventures until changes are made to the current FIE regulations . However it will immediately benefit foreign investors establishing CLS , as regulations for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a business perspective , the management structure EJVs and CJVs is similar . Both function with a board of directors ( or a joint management committee for a CJV ) and a general management department that is supervised and directed by the board of directors . However , these entities also share many characteristics of a partnership in that the parties appoint directors roughly in proportion to the investors ' respective shares . There is no concept of a shareholders meeting where the power is concentrated at board level . <p> In practice legal-person CJVs typically adopt the board of directors model . The CJV law also permits management of a CJV to be delegated to a third party with government approval . This arrangement has been the standard mode of operation for the hotel industry . It has the potential to be used in other industries as well , although it is not common . <p> Associations with a Chinese partner can become tricky when unanimous decisions by the board required for the following are not obtained : <p> amendments to the articles of association ; <p> termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital ; and <p> mergers or divisions ; <p> Negotiating an exit from a joint venture company could be problematic as transfers of equity interests require : ( i ) partners ' consent ; ( ii ) waivers of pre-emptive rights ; and ( iii ) approval from Mofcom or local agencies . <p> Lastly , it is true that the parties generally negotiate the events that will trigger the termination of a joint venture . However , as a practical matter , termination usually requires action by consensus embodied in a unanimous board resolution . Even where parties are obliged to make sure their appointed directors approve a resolution in agreed circumstances , they could still instruct their directors to breach these obligations and drag their feet on the exit process . <h> Tax aspects <p> From a taxation perspective , the selection of a joint venture or a WFOE is neutral . FIEs and other foreign enterprises that are present in China and engaged in production activities are subject to foreign enterprise income tax ( FEIT ) at the rate of 33% . Reforms to the FEIT system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 24% or 25% . No particular timetable for this change has been announced , but it will probably not come into effect before 2007 . <p> FIEs are able to take advantage of systems of national and local tax incentives depending on their locality and activities . The most common incentives include , for FIEs engaging in manufacturing activities , a two-year exemption followed by a three-year 50% FEIT reduction starting from the first profit-making year . <p> Tax relief may be also obtained for investments in certain industries , localities or zones , such as in western China . However , these tax incentives are expected to evaporate in line with the FEIT reforms . The good news for FIEs established under the current FEIT regime is that they are expected to be able to keep their current tax benefits after the reforms are completed . <p> Foreign investors who are not present in China , might have FEIT of around 10% withheld from certain income streams including interest from loans , rental income and royalties from trademarks or copyrights . <h> Joint ventures still of use <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with joint ventures , namely irregular tax treatment and possible snags in unanimous decision-making . <p> Another element that foreign investors should take into account is how the costs and economic risks linked to the investment project can be shared . Foreign investors whose financial capacity and expertise of the Chinese market are satisfactory can afford to set up a WFOE on their own when a joint venture is not mandatory under the Catalogue . <p> However , all these things might also influence the foreign investor 's decision to team up with a Chinese partner who can contribute assets and put precious knowledge and market shares in the basket of the foreign investor , which would otherwise be unreachable . From this perspective , the establishment of a joint venture in association with a valuable Chinese partner will always have some practical benefits compared with WFOEs . <h> David Boitout <h> Gide Loyrette Nouel <p> David Boitout has been the managing partner of the Shanghai office since January 2004 .

The litigation , settled in mid-May , left some interesting legal questions unanswered , such as the general enforceability of financing commitment letters and availability of specific performance in that context . It is reported that the settlement entailed a lower price for Clear Channel stock under the revised merger arrangements and regarding debt facilities , a lower debt amount and increased pricing . The other financing terms were consistent with the commitment letter . <p> English and Australian courts have awarded specific performance to enforce merger and lending obligations . Bidders and banks that enthusiastically commit themselves in bid situations with limited outs should take care . They may well be forced to close the deal . <h> No financing out <p> In November 2006 , Clear Channel entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms had signed a financing commitment letter with their banks to fund the acquisition . The commitment letter attached a medium-form term sheet and included the preparation of fully-negotiated facility documentation as a condition precedent to funding . There was no market material adverse change ( market Mac ) condition precedent in the term sheet . <p> During negotiations to finalise the facility documentation , an email between the banks discussing their intention to renege on the financing commitment was reportedly leaked to Bain/THL . The banks had also allegedly admitted that funding the deal would result in immediate mark-to-market losses on day one , and that they were trying to recut the deal . <p> Part of this included a reopening of some fundamental points ? reducing the six-year facilities to three years , preventing the revolving credit facility from being used to repay existing debt , and prescribing unrealistic baskets for various negative covenants . On March 26 2008 , Bain/THL launched proceedings in the Supreme Court of New York against the banks , alleging breach of contract , fraud , deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merger agreement if their financing fell through ( there was no financing out provision ) . It was imperative for them that the banks would supply financing , regardless of whether market conditions changed between the signing of the deal and the time when the banks were obliged to fund . <p> The merger agreement had a clause giving the buyer recourse to the remedy of specific performance but expressly excluding it as a remedy for sellers . The exclusive remedy for the sellers was the reverse termination fee . There was no corresponding specific performance clause in the commitment letter . <h> Allegations <p> The plaintiffs sought to specifically enforce the binding commitment made by the banks to fund the merger . Their case included the following claims : <p> There was no uncertainty about the commercial terms of the commitment letter : they were agreed in the term sheet . As for the remaining terms , the agreement was that they would be no less advantageous than provisions that appeared in Bain/THL sponsor precedent transactions . <p> There was no market Mac condition precedent . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsening credit market conditions in 2007 . They demanded terms in the final documents that were materially different from those in the commitment letter . The plaintiffs argued that if such conduct went unchecked , the banks would have succeeded in reallocating the market risk they had agreed to assume in the commitment letter to the purchasers . <p> The unique aspects of the Clear Channel business meant that the appropriate remedy was specific performance of the banks ' obligation to fund . <p> The banks ' defence included the following points : <p> The negotiation of a final set of transaction documents was a condition precedent to funding of the transaction . <p> The central premise of the plaintiffs ' request for specific performance of the commitment letter called for the banks to lend money pursuant to documents that still had to be negotiated . This involved judicial intervention in complex commercial negotiations , which is unworkable and unprecedented . <p> Specific performance of a contract to lend money is contrary to New York law . <h> UK and Australian law <p> Specific performance is a discretionary equitable remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contractual obligations according to the agreed terms . <p> For specific performance to be awarded , there must be at a minimum : <p> An enforceable contract . In the context of financing commitment documents , although the agreement is usually subject to negotiation of full documents , the essential terms of the agreement should be settled at the commitment stage . <p> Valuable consideration provided by the plaintiff . <p> A breach of contract constituted by a failure to perform obligations , or an anticipatory breach by the defendant . <p> Equity will not grant specific performance if an award of damages at common law will provide enough compensation . But the adequacy of damages is not the sole point to be considered . The court 's discretionary considerations include the type of contract and the circumstances under which the contract is made . Readiness and willingness of plaintiffs to complete their own obligations under the contract , whether any impossibility , futility , illegality , delay , hardship or unfairness , or uncertainty surrounding the performance of the contract would result , and whether the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are all discretionary considerations the court weighs up in determining whether to grant specific performance . <p> For our purposes , performance of a contract could be impossible or futile because a condition precedent ( such as a market Mac clause ) has not been satisfied in the financing documents or the merger agreement . However , the order for specific performance could also be made conditional on the satisfaction of the conditions precedent . <h> Damages not always enough <p> A contract for the purchase of shares is a particular type of circumstance where an award of damages may well be an inadequate remedy . A contract for the sale of shares will be enforceable if the shares are not readily available in the market . It will be enough if plaintiffs can show that they would have difficulty in obtaining them by other means . <p> Specific performance of a takeover agreement was awarded by the New South Wales Supreme Court in Lionsgate Australia Pty v Macquarie Private Portfolio Management . In that case the takeover agreement included a specific performance clause , to which the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been awarded in the context of purchasing and selling shares , in Eid v Al-Kazemi and Baker v Potter for instance ? neither of these cases involved an agreement with an explicit specific performance clause . <p> Orders for specific performance of loan contracts have not readily been granted . The general view has been that damages should be an adequate remedy because the subject matter of the contract is pecuniary and should be easily obtainable by other means . As always , there are exceptions to the rule ? when the plaintiff 's enterprise would be lost if the defendant were not to fulfil its promise , for example . <p> Other instances are when the loan agreement is more than a mere contract for the loan of money because the loan is part of a wider arrangement with sequential responsibilities . In Wight v Haberdan Pty a mortgagee was ordered to fund the plaintiff 's purchase of real estate . The loan contract was held to have been part of a larger transaction including contractual obligations normally amendable to an order for specific performance . A contract to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v Barton in similar circumstances . <p> From this , it could be argued that the place of the financing commitment in an overall buyout transaction , along with the tight state of credit markets , take the matter out of the ordinary category of loan agreement and make a decree of specific performance more readily attainable . <h> Jittery market <p> Specific performance is by definition a discretionary remedy . The inclusion of a specific performance clause means that the parties have given express contractual acknowledgment of the inadequacy of damages as a remedy . That is something to which a court will have regard . To date , we have not seen the use of specific performance clauses in financing documents . It will be interesting to see whether they will become more common in this unstable deal environment . The interaction of a specific performance clause with any reverse termination fee provision , Mac clause , financing out provision , and other conditions precedent in the agreements should be carefully considered to ensure that they achieve the desired effect . <p> A more concrete way for borrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing of binding financing commitments and funding is to have commitment letters with long-form detailed term sheets ( as opposed to short-form or medium-form term sheets ) or interim facility agreements . Interim facility agreements developed in the UK and Europe to bridge this gap ; they are essentially short-term bullet facilities ( lasting between 30 and 90 days ) to ensure funding availability . <p> The bullet maturity provides the necessary incentive for private equity sponsors to refinance it promptly with the permanent facilities . Interim facility agreements made their appearance in Australia with KKR 's purchase of BIS Cleanaway from Brambles Australia in 2006 . The transaction was funded by the interim facility . Although interim facility agreements are not yet a regular feature in this market , the jittery lending climate may well see an increase in their use . <p> By Yuen-Yee Cho and Victoria Todd of Mallesons Stephen Jaques <p> On January 1 2009 some changes to the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act ( Auenwirtschaftsgesetz , AWG ) will come into effect that are likely to have a significant impact on foreign investors wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime , any such acquisition by foreign investors may trigger the right of the German Federal Ministry of Economics to investigate and even prohibit the transaction . <h> The reform <p> Who is affected ? <p> Under the Foreign Trade and Payments Act , investors from non-EC countries that do not belong to the European Free Trade Association ( EC plus Switzerland , Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein ) and that acquire shares representing 25% or more of the voting stock of a German company may have their acquisition investigated by the Federal Ministry of Economics . Shares held by companies controlled by the acquirer ( by holding at least 25% of the voting stock ) are treated as if they were held by the acquirer itself . Shares that are subject to voting agreements are also assigned to the acquirer . <p> If the Ministry comes to the conclusion that Germany 's public order or national security are threatened by a transaction , it may prohibit the acquisition . Unfortunately , the Act does not contain any definition of public order or national security , so the Act brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its scope . If the Ministry decides that a transaction falls within the scope of the Act , it may order that the acquisition ( which may already be consummated ) be reversed . The Ministry may also choose only to prohibit the exertion of voting rights of shares held by the foreign investor , thus restricting the investor 's influence on the German target . <p> How long does it take to reach a decision ? <p> Foreign investors are under no obligation to file their transaction with the Federal Ministry of Economics . However , they may do so after signing and will , in that case , receive a final decision on whether the transaction will be prohibited within one month . If the transaction is not filed with the Ministry , it may start an investigation on its own account within three months after the consummation of the transaction , with the effect that the transaction is put under the condition precedent of the Ministry 's approval . The Ministry will immediately inform the investor of its decision to investigate the acquisition , which triggers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The acquirer will be informed about the specific data required by the Ministry through an announcement in the Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) . The investigation must be completed within two months of receipt of the transaction data . <p> Aims and criticism <p> The reform seeks to protect sensitive branches of German industry such as the energy , telecom and military sectors . Potential threats are perceived to come from state-controlled funds ( in particular from China , the Emirates and Russia ) that may be used to influence German politics via investments in German key enterprises . State-controlled foreign corporations have also been classified as potentially dangerous . <p> The reforms have attracted much criticism . For example , the new powers granted to the Ministry of Economics are suspected of infringing the freedom of capital movement as guaranteed by Article 56 of the EC Treaty . The European Commission is planning to examine the Act for its reconcilability with Article 56 and the freedom of establishment ( Article 49 ) . Also , the scope of the Act is considered to be unreasonable because it not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations but foreign investors in general . Any private equity investor wishing to invest in Germany may find his transaction being investigated by the Federal Ministry of Economics . <p> The problem for foreign investors <p> The main problem is the legal uncertainty for foreign investors . If an investor has successfully completed a transaction , it may still be subject to investigation for a period of three months after the closing date . A further two months may pass until the Ministry has completed its investigation . The result may be that the transaction is prohibited and the acquisition must be reversed . This uncertainty is unacceptable for the seller , buyer , target , financing banks and employees of the target company . <h> Recommended course of action <p> Foreign investors wishing to acquire 25% or more of the voting stock of a German company should therefore adhere to the following guidelines . <p> Informal enquiry before signing <p> A foreign investor can contact the Federal Ministry of Economics before he signs a share purchase agreement on a confidential and informal basis in order to find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally taken if a bidder wishes to know the position of the German Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt fnr **29;150;TOOLONG , BaFin ) on a takeover process . There are no guidelines on how such an informal approach should be made , though any informal contact bears the risk that information may be leaked . A seller is therefore unlikely to agree to such contact . <p> Filing for investigation after signing <p> Therefore , a foreign investor should voluntarily file the transaction with the Federal Ministry of Economics immediately after signing a share purchase agreement . He should refrain from filing only if he and the seller are in no doubt that the transaction does not qualify for an investigation by the Ministry . If the investor intends to file the transaction , the share purchase agreement should contain a clause that makes the clearance of the acquisition by the Ministry a condition precedent for the obligation of the parties to consummate the transaction . After the Ministry has received all relevant data , it has one month to decide whether it will prohibit the consummation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with the Ministry on which information it needs in order to come to a decision as quickly as possible . It appears likely that an investor will , in most cases , be able to get a decision before the German Federal Cartel Authority ( Bundeskartellamt ) has cleared the transaction .

Those rules provide for a separate obligation to disclose substantial shareholdings for persons who effectively have the discretionary power to exercise the voting rights associated with equity securities of Swiss issuers listed on a Swiss exchange , or foreign issuers that are primarily listed on a Swiss exchange , whenever the voting rights are not exercised directly or indirectly by the beneficial owner ( article 120 ( 3 ) of the Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading of June 19 2015 , Financial Market Infrastructure Act ( FMIA ) , SR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruling of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court holding that a previous incarnation of this rule with a narrower focus did not rest on a sufficient statutory basis ( decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court 2C98/2013 of July 29 2013 ) .

And indeed the financial sector is one of the pillars of the Swiss economy . Switzerland is widely considered a haven for savers , with stable political and economical conditions , and an efficient infrastructure , and is one of the world 's preferred financial centres . In 2000 the estimated proportion of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) contributed by the financial sector as a whole came to 10.9% . <p> A traditional strength of the Swiss financial centre is asset management , which at the beginning of the new millennium made up over half of the banks ' total added value . In this business domain Switzerland holds a leading global position . In recent years , the value of assets managed in customer accounts in national banks amounted to SFr3,000 to SFr4,000 billion ( $2,486 to $3,314 ) . Foreign customers accounted for more than 50% . Of all assets held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight percent to 10% of all assets , that is , SFr300 billion to SFr400 billion , are managed by external asset managers ( EAMs ) . According to an assessment by the Association of Swiss Asset Managers , there are 2,000 to 2,500 EAMs employing up to 7,000 people in Switzerland . So external asset managers are key players both for banks and for clients . <p> Minimal state regulations for external asset managers <p> EAMs act as independent enterprises and manage customers ' assets as professionals without forming part of a bank . The 1990s offered private bankers that had strong ties to customers a good environment to open up their own businesses as EAMs . So EAMs are often boutique firms employing seasoned bankers , and other specialized professionals such as lawyers or trust officers . External asset managers advise their customers in the management and investment of funds ; in particular they provide portfolio management services against payment of a fee . In this limited business field they offer the same services as banks and brokers . <p> Whereas securities dealers are governed by the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banks are regulated both by the Swiss Banking Act ( SBA ) and the Sesta , external asset managers are not subject to strict market regulation , with the exception of the legislation to combat money laundering . As with banks and securities dealers , EAMs qualify as financial intermediaries and are , in this capacity , subject to the Money Laundering Act ( MLA ) , which came into force in 1998 and imposes a comprehensive framework legislation concerning obligations of due diligence on financial intermediaries , such as the identification of the customer and the beneficial owner . <p> Apart from that , state regulatory frameworks are largely missing . As a consequence of this loose regulation , some claim that specific provisions , such as Art 11 Sesta , apply to EAM indirectly , that is , by analogy . Article 11 Sesta defines specific duties to be complied with by the financial services provider . These duties include the obligation to disclose to clients the risks associated with certain types of transactions , the duty of diligence by ensuring the best execution of the clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last but not least , the obligation of loyalty by ensuring that in any potential conflict of interests the client 's interests are not adversely affected . Although some courts by now have applied Article 11 Sesta to the EAM analogously , the applicability remains disputed . <p> Against this background , it is obvious that EAMs , in comparison with their competitors ( banks and securities dealers ) , must only comply with a minimum of regulations . In particular , until today , EAMs have not been monitored by a government watchdog , and the self-regulatory professional association of the EAMs has no strong means of sanctioning misbehaving members . It comes as no surprise that experts , among them the IMF under its Financial System Stability Assessments , think that the EAMs profit from unjustified competition advantages and should be subjected to prudential supervision . <p> As a consequence of these critical voices , the Swiss government appointed an expert commission ( Group Zufferey ) to render a report , which was presented in November 2001 . The experts recommended that EAMs be subject to a comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimmerli ) was commissioned to set out a report and to draft a bill for the organization of the Federal Financial Market Supervision . In February 2005 , Group Zimmerli submitted its report on the prudential supervision of EAMs , introducing brokers , and foreign exchange traders . The experts say that a differentiated approach should be taken , and that , before a bill should be drafted , the Federal Council should take a fundamental decision whether or not to subject all financial intermediaries to state supervision or whether , alternatively , self-regulatory bodies should be put in place . According to the experts , a need for immediate regulatory action was spotted only with respect to the supervision of asset managers of foreign collective investments . Thus it will take some time before state monitoring of EAMs will become law , if at all , but asset managers of foreign collective funds might become subject to monitoring soon . <p> Contractual aspects of the EAM business <p> Many banks have substantial business with external asset managers and maintain special business units for that purpose . Services formerly provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it is important to understand the main differences between a traditional bank/customer relationship and the situation where the customer has appointed an EAM . On first sight the following principles apply to EAM customers : <p> The EAM , not the bank , is responsible for the definition of the investment strategy and the portfolio management . <p> The customer relationship management is in the hands of the EAM , so the bank plays a passive , mainly administrative role and has no direct contact with the customer . The banks even delegate compliance matters , for example , customer identification , to the EAM . <p> Box 1 <p> Custodian/administration contract between customer and bank . <p> Portfolio management mandate between customer and EAM , including a power of attorney in favour of the EAM vis a vis the bank , to manage the funds . <p> Based on a ( limited ) power of attorney , the EAM is representing the customer vis a vis the bank . There are no specific contractual agreements between the EAM and the bank , except framework agreements . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a triangle ( see box 1 ) . <p> Given this triangular contractual relationship , customers sometimes have difficulties in deciding who to address in specific situations , in particular when it comes to disputes about losses . The following explanations will she 'd some light on the rights and obligations of the parties involved . <p> External asset manager/customer : portfolio management contract <p> The legal relationship between the EAM and its customer is normally governed by a portfolio management agreement , which usually contains detailed rules on the portfolio strategy , the reference currency and the fee structure . In regard to fees the concepts vary between pure flat-fee arrangements and fully performance-oriented fee schedules . A large number of EAMs use as a role model for their contracts the Guidelines of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission for Asset Management Contracts and/or the standards of the Swiss Association of Asset Managers . The Swiss Association of Asset Managers advises to put in writing specific customer instructions that do not fall into the normal scope of asset management , for example , the right to take loans , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to charge fees to the account directly . <p> Portfolio management contracts are interpreted pursuant to the provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations ( CO ) on mandates . A number of EAMs joined the Swiss Association of Asset Managers . The Association has published Rules of Conduct to be adhered to by its members . A violation of the Rules of Conduct could result in the exclusion of the misbehaving member . But the Rules of Conduct not only apply to members , the courts also referred to them as an industry standard . By referring to the Rules of Conduct , the courts have developed extensive case law on the EAMs ' duty of diligence , duty to disclose the risks involved with specific transactions and duty to avoid conflicts of interest . <p> External asset manager/bank : retrocession payments <p> To keep administrative efforts low , EAMs regularly concentrate on a few banks that take the role of custodian and provide the administrative platform for the customers ' assets . <p> In principle , no formal agreements are required to define the relationship between EAMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis a vis the bank from a power of attorney given by the customer empowering the EAM to manage the funds . Due to developments in recent years , the banks and the EAMs have , however , started to regulate their legal relationship in framework agreements , usually pertaining to all customers of the EAM that have an account with the respective bank . As a rule , the more assets placed by the EAM 's customers with the bank , the more favourable the conditions become under the framework agreement . <p> In the framework agreement , the bank requires from the EAM confirmations relating to compliance matters in the combat against money laundering ; in this context the banks often delegate the duty to identify the customer to the EAM . Further , the framework agreement sets out the EAM 's obligation to adhere to specific investment principles and to inform customers of any risks associated with the investments . Framework agreements also regularly foresee that the bank will not be liable for the quality of the services provided by the EAM and the performance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake to keep e-banking platforms and research tools at the EAM 's disposal . Furthermore , different models of compensation for the EAM 's services will be found . Because work formerly done by the banks is now outsourced to the EAMs , some banks share commissions earned with trades on the customers account with the EAM . This type of compensation is referred to as retrocession or soft money . Some say that retrocession payments create conflicts of interests between the EAM and the customer . For example , a conflict of interest would arise if the EAM were making unnecessary transactions to increase its own revenues . To avoid such situations , some banks have started to eliminate retrocession payments and , instead , directly reduce commission rates . Whether this will result in lower costs for the customers remains to be seen . In the absence of retrocession payments , the EAM will probably increase the fees payable under the portfolio management contract . Today , it is widely accepted that , for the sake of transparency , the EAM should disclose to the customer that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in the customer claiming a refund . <p> Customer to bank direct contact rare <p> The customer maintains the account and the portfolio with the bank and so has to sign all pertaining account opening forms and agreements . However , once the account is opened , and sometimes not even at the occasion of account opening , the customers often have no direct contact with the bank , because the bulk of the account and portfolio handling is performed by the EAM . The bank is also reluctant to approach the customer directly ; it rather communicates with the customer through the EAM . <p> To enable the EAM to become active and to perform under the portfolio management agreement , the customer provides the EAM with a power of attorney to represent it towards the bank . Of course , the power of attorney is mostly limited to investment instructions ; normally , withdrawals and certain derivatives as well as OTC transactions are disallowed . <p> Losses and liabilities <p> As long as the portfolio is doing well and the EAM is making money for its customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generating losses , customers often want to know whether they can hold anybody liable . <p> The EAM 's liability <p> The Swiss Federal Supreme Court sets high standards of diligence to be observed by the EAMs . Court decisions often make reference to the respective guidelines of the Swiss Federal Banking Association and the Association of Swiss Asset Managers . <p> The EAM must ensure that the investment strategy suits the customer 's needs . Before defining the investment strategy , the EAM must familiarize itself with the customer 's financial situation ( the know-your-client rule ) , and the risk profile and suitable strategy should be defined based on this analysis . If the customer wants an investment strategy that is not in line with its risk profile , the EAM , to avoid liability , must advise the customer accordingly . The courts have even affirmed liability when the EAM correctly informed on the risks of an investment but , at the same time , had pretended unrealistic profits . If the EAM defines an inadequate strategy and losses occur , the EAM will , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the EAM must adhere to the investment profile set out in the portfolio management agreement . Deviations from the contract , combined with losses , form the grounds for liability claims . The EAM should also ensure that the customer is continuously informed . It might become liable if it fails to do so , because a lack of information deprives customers of the chance to cut their losses . <p> The bank 's liability <p> As set out above , the bank merely provides the administrative platform for the banking transactions . Therefore , as a general rule , the bank is only liable for the diligent execution of the transactions and the proper processing and functioning of the deposit and account . Nevertheless , quite often the banks become the targets of liability claims by customers that have suffered damages . One of the more obvious reasons is the solid solvency ( deep pockets ) of banks , as opposed to the meagre capitalization of the EAMs and their lack of professional liability insurance . <p> The bank must not allow the EAM to exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . If the power of attorney is exceeded and losses occur , the bank will be jointly liable with the EAM . If the EAM exceeds the power of attorney without the bank knowing , the bank can not be held liable . In other words , the bank has no obligation to monitor the EAM . The bank is also not necessarily obligated to interfere if the EAM transacts business of which the customer 's economical benefit is doubtful . But in this context many questions are controversial and , depending on specific surrounding circumstances , the bank could find itself in a minefield , in particular if it becomes a question whether the bank acted in good or bad faith . <p> Under aspects of liability it might also become problematic for banks if they do not maintain enough organizational and economical distance from the EAM . In such instances , the customers might claim that they considered the bank and the EAM as a unity . In particular , the EAM might be deemed as an assistant of the bank if it shared offices with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bank 's meeting rooms or if there were another economical interweaving that made the EAM appear as not sufficiently independent from the bank . Banks are well advised if they draw - for everybody - a line between their and the external asset manager 's organization and administration .

The amendment to the Banking Act will enable a Japanese bank to conduct foreign bank agency services for foreign banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to obtain the prior approval of the FST . <h> Foreign bank branch regulations <p> As mentioned above , foreign banks may operate banking business in the Japanese market , either through their Japanese branches or Japanese banking subsidiaries . However , the regulations on foreign bank branches under the Banking Act are not necessarily the same as those on foreign bank subsidiaries . To put it simply , the regulations on foreign bank branches are looser than those on foreign bank subsidiaries in some aspects . <p> The amendment to the Banking Act will tighten the regulations applicable to foreign bank branches in order to protect their depositors and to ensure the stability of the financial system . It will take into account the need for international cooperation in any cross-border recovery and resolution planning of financial institutions , and the necessity to avoid excessive impediments to the business models of foreign bank branches . <p> An outline of the revision to the regulations governing foreign bank branches under the amendment to the Banking Act is as follows . <p> Licensing standards on foreign bank branches <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated capital which apply to domestic banks under the Banking Act , the business scope of foreign bank branches are regulated in the same manner as domestic banks . Furthermore , there are no regulations specific to foreign bank branches that limit risks associated with transactions conducted by the branches , including fund transfers to the head office . <p> For the purpose of ensuring the financial soundness of foreign bank branches , the following licensing standards for foreign bank branches will be clarified by the amendment to the Banking Act and the relevant ordinances : <p> the amount of assets equivalent to the stated capital of the foreign bank branch is 2 billion ( $19.6 million ) or more , and is sufficient for the sound and efficient performance of the business proposed in the licence application ; <p> the foreign bank branch is expected to record a profit for a single business year by the time three business years have passed since the commencement of its business ; <p> the foreign bank branch is able to perform its business in an appropriate , fair , and efficient manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of securing officers and employees with sufficient knowledge and experience relevant to its business , the system for ensuring appropriate business management ; and <p> the particulars and methods of business of the foreign bank branch are appropriate for the protection of depositors and maintenance of stability of the financial system . <p> Supervisory guidelines issued by the FST will also be amended to provide additional licensing standards to supplement the above . The amended FST guidelines will also provide ongoing supervisory viewpoints for foreign bank branches ( after being licensed ) from a prudential perspective , including the viewpoint in supervising the situations of fund transfers to their head office . <p> Asset reservation within Japan <p> Under existing regulations , foreign bank branches are required to record 10% of their net income as retained earnings , and to accumulate such income until it reaches 2 billion . In addition , they are required to reserve assets equivalent to the amount of retained earnings within Japan . However , from the perspective of ensuring financial soundness and protecting depositors , it would appear that the regulation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after net income has been earned . <p> Therefore , instead of the existing regulation , the amended Banking Act requires foreign bank branches to continuously reserve assets equivalent to the amount of the minimum capital requirement for domestic banks ( 2 billion ) within Japan in certain forms such as loans to the Bank of Japan , cash , Japanese government bonds and Japanese local government bonds . This amendment is scheduled to be phased in over a two-year period beginning on April 1 2014 . The minimum amount of assets required to be reserved within Japan will be : ( i ) the higher of 1 billion or the amount of retained earnings for the period from April 1 2014 to March 31 2015 ; ( ii ) the higher of 1.5 million or the amount of retained earnings for the period from April 1 2015 to March 31 2016 ; and , ( iii ) 2 billion yen from April 1 2016 . <p> Obligation to provide information to depositors <p> Deposits held by foreign bank branches are not covered by deposit insurance in Japan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the main issues discussed in the draft process of the amendment to the Banking Act , but it was concluded that it is appropriate to continue a study on the enrollment of foreign bank branches into the deposit insurance system in Japan as a future issue . Therefore , deposits held by foreign bank branches will still not be covered by the deposit insurance system in Japan , even after the amendment to the Banking Act takes effect . Moreover , under the existing Banking Act , foreign bank branches are not obliged to explain to depositors that deposits held by foreign bank branches are not covered by the deposit insurance system in Japan or specify information on the risks to depositors in the event that the foreign bank fails . <p> Therefore , with respect to the acceptance of deposits by foreign bank branches , the amended Banking Act will require an explanation by the foreign bank branches on the following matters ( and other information found to be useful to their customers for the purpose of protection of depositors in Japan ) : ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the deposit insurance system in Japan ; and , ( ii ) in the event that the foreign bank fails , repayments may not be swiftly made , even supposing that deposits are ( partially ) refunded . <p> Order and obligation to maintain assets in Japan <p> Under existing regulations , the FST is authorised to order foreign bank branches to maintain a certain portion of their assets in Japan if they deem it necessary for the protection of depositors in Japan or otherwise in the interests of the public . When foreign bank branches violate this rule , a responsible person of the relevant foreign bank branch is subject to fines up to 1 million under the existing Banking Act . <p> To ensure the effectiveness of such orders , the amendment to the Banking Act will raise the penalty for violations of FST orders to imprisonment with work of up to one year or fines of up to 3 million , and aside from the responsible person , the relevant foreign bank branch may be fined up to 200 million . <p> Act on Special Measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is authorised to trigger special liquidation proceedings for foreign bank branches . That is , the financial regulator is authorised to revoke the licences of foreign bank branches , and in such instance , the foreign bank branch will automatically go into special liquidation proceedings . The financial regulator is also authorised to file a petition to the court for commencement of special liquidation proceedings for foreign bank branches . On the other hand , the financial regulator is not authorised to file a petition to the court for commencement of reorganisation proceedings , rehabilitation proceedings or bankruptcy proceedings for foreign bank branches . The Act on Special Measures Concerning Reorganisation Proceedings of Financial Institutions ( Act on Special Measures for Reorganisation ) authorises the financial regulator to petition for commencement of these three insolvency proceedings for domestic banks , but the Act on Special Measures for Reorganisation is not applicable to foreign bank branches . <p> To protect the rights of depositors in Japan and ensure the smooth progress of the proceedings , the Act on Special Measures for Reorganisation will be amended together with the Banking Act to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court for commencement of reorganisation proceedings , rehabilitation proceedings or bankruptcy proceedings for foreign bank branches as well . <h> Business scope of banks ' subsidiaries in overseas M&amp;A <p> The Banking Act provides a regulation on the business scope of subsidiaries that can be owned by Japanese banks . For the purpose of this regulation , subsidiaries are defined as companies the majority of whose voting rights are held directly or indirectly by Japanese banks . The business scope of Japanese banks ' subsidiaries is limited to financial or other certain business under the Banking Act . <p> The FST guidelines also provide a regulation on the scope of business that can be conducted by Japanese banks ' subsidiary companies and affiliated companies . For the purpose of this regulation , subsidiary companies are defined as entities that are substantially controlled by Japanese banks . The scope of subsidiary companies is generally the same as that of subsidiaries under Japanese accounting standards , and is broader than that of subsidiaries under the Banking Act . Affiliated companies are defined as entities , over which Japanese banks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the finance , operations or business policy through certain relationships . The scope of affiliated companies is generally the same as that of affiliated companies under Japanese accounting standards . Japanese banks are required under the FST guidelines to limit the business of their subsidiary companies and affiliated companies within the same business scope as their subsidiaries under the Banking Act . <h> " Deposits held by foreign bank branches are not covered by deposit insurance in Japane " <p> In this regard , when a domestic bank and foreign bank compete to acquire another foreign financial institution , the former is put in a disadvantageous position , as it is required to state in the terms and conditions of the bid that it will sell the target financial institution 's subsidiaries that are not eligible under the Japanese Banking Act . This hinders the overseas business expansion of domestic banks . <p> In order to develop an environment that facilitates the international expansion of banking groups , while maintaining the existing regulations on the business scope of domestic banks ' subsidiaries , the amended Banking Act will permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Banking Act for a period of five years , in cases where such indirect holding occurs as a result of the acquisition by the domestic banks of foreign financial institutions such as foreign banks , foreign insurance companies and foreign securities companies . <p> The grace period of five years may be extended on a yearly basis , with approval by the FST . The approval will be granted when : ( i ) the FST deems it difficult to dispose of the shares in such ineligible companies within the grace period , taking into consideration the situation of the financial markets or capital markets or other matters in the local country ; or when , ( ii ) the regulator deems it necessary for the acquired foreign financial institutions and their business operations to continue the holding of such ineligible companies . <p> The regulation on the business scope of Japanese banks ' subsidiary companies and affiliated companies under the FST guidelines will be amended in line with the above amendment to the regulation on the business scope of subsidiaries under the Banking Act . <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct M&amp;A transactions to acquire foreign financial institutions without the immediate exclusion of ineligible companies from the scope of the acquisition . <p> Author biography <p> Atsushi Sakai <p> Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu <p> Atsushi Sakai is a partner at Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu .

In the Dutch market , a variety of funds are used , depending , for instance , on the intended investor category , the underlying investments , the desired tax , accountancy or regulatory treatment , and the organizational requirements of the participants or the sponsor . This article focuses on fund structures suitable for both non-Dutch resident investors and domestic investors . <p> For example , the Dutch stichting pooling vehicle is widely used by institutional investors and is very effective for foreign pension funds and other tax-exempt entities . It is completely tax transparent and potentially outside the scope of any Dutch regulations . <p> Dutch investment companies , usually in the form of a naamloze vennootschap ( NV ) , are common vehicles for the retail market , and are both publicly traded on the Amsterdam Exchanges and unlisted . They can be structured as qualifying fiscal investment institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double tax treaty protection in respect of cross-border investments . In other words , the investment company will enjoy favourable tax treatment for investments under a double tax treaty ( such as reduction of withholding tax rates ) , while there is no corporate tax liability at the level of the fund itself . Usually such investment companies will be subject to supervision by the Dutch Central Bank and require a licence . <p> An open fonds voor gemene rekening is a mutual fund which can be set up as a mezzanine structure ; it has both stichting pool and investment company characteristics . <p> From January 1 2001 , the Dutch Individual Income Tax Act will be changed completely . Dutch resident private individuals will be taxed on a deemed return rather than on their actual investment income . As a result , the so-called growth funds " investment companies fully subject to Dutch corporate tax and intended to protect investors from any personal income tax by not paying any dividends " will become obsolete . <p> Also from January 1 2001 , new provisions apply to certain dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the so-called reinvestment reserve , dividend withholding tax will no longer be due . The abolition of dividend withholding tax on these dividends is especially beneficial for foreign investors , and makes fiscal investment companies potentially very interesting as alternatives to , for instance , Luxembourg SICAVs . <p> Stichting pools <p> The stichting pool is a structure that is normally used by institutional investors . A stichting is a Dutch tax-exempt legal entity and does not have any shareholders . The institutional investors will contribute cash or contributions in kind , such as securities , to the stichting . In exchange for their contribution , the investors are entitled to a pro-rated part of the assets of the stichting . The assets of the stichting constitute the actual investment pool ( if you like the fund ) . The stichting will keep a register in which it administers the entitlements of the participants to the pool . Further , it will hold the underlying assets on behalf of the investors . The stichting itself does not actively manage the portfolio and will enter into contracts with asset managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio . Formally , however , the stichting holds the assets in its own name on behalf of the investors , which in essence means that the stichting is the legal owner of the underlying assets . Therefore , to secure their claims on the assets , the investors will require the stichting to be strictly passive and thus bankruptcy remote . <p> Regulatory <p> In principle , the pool qualifies as an investment institution within the terms of the Investment Institution Supervision Act ( Wet toezicht beleggingsinstellingen or Wtb ) . However , provided the participants qualify as professional investors within the terms of the Wtb , the pool is exempt from supervision by the regulator , the Dutch Central Bank . Also , no prospectus is required . The sponsor marketing the investment in the pool would generally qualify as a securities intermediary under the Securities Markets Supervision Act 1995 ( Wet toezicht effectenverkeer or Wte ) . When securities intermediaries offer their services in or from the Netherlands , they must obtain a licence from the Dutch Securities Board . However , a number of exemptions could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU Investment Services Directive . <p> Tax status <p> For tax purposes , the stichting is a transparent entity , provided it has a passive and formal role as holder of the assets only . As a result , the investors are effectively in the same position as if they were directly investing in the underlying assets . To ensure that the pool itself will not be taxable for Dutch corporate income tax purposes , the transferability of units is limited . Units can be made freely redeemable . Provided adequate consent procedures are put in place for the admission of additional participants after the formation of the fund , no Dutch capital tax is due on contributions to the stichting or the pool ( capital tax is a one-off 0.9% duty on capital contributions ) . <p> NVs with fiscal investmentinstitution status <p> The NV is one of the two common types of Dutch bodies corporate with a capital divided into shares ( the other is the besloten vennootschap or BV ) and is comparable to an English PLC , French SA or German AG . <p> Provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can obtain the special corporate tax status of a fiscal investment institution . The paragraphs below on the regulatory and tax aspects of the NV fiscal investment institution would in principle also apply to BVs and open fondsen voor gemene rekening ( hereafter called open mutual funds ) . <p> Regulatory <p> Under the Wtb , it is prohibited to solicit or obtain , in or from the Netherlands , moneys or other goods , beyond a restricted circle , in exchange for units of an unauthorized investment institution or to offer units of such an investment institution . This means that investment institutions , which offer units to investors in or from the Netherlands outside a closed group of investors , require a licence from the Dutch Central Bank . The Dutch Central Bank grants authorization on request to an investment institution if the applicant shows that it meets all requirements in respect of expertise and trustworthiness , financial resources , management and the information to be furnished to the investors and to the public in a prospectus . <p> There is an exemption from licence requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will exclusively be offered to professionals , ie persons who trade or invest in securities in a commercial or professional capacity ( such as pension funds ) . <p> Tax status <p> The Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act contains a specific provision granting a 0% corporate income tax rate to fiscal investment institutions . There are various conditions that have to be met to obtain the status of a fiscal investment institution . The main ones are in the field of maximum stakes held by taxable corporate investors , as opposed to private individuals and tax-exempt entities ( for which latter categories the tax facility was originally intended ) . These requirements are somewhat more relaxed for fiscal investment institutions listed on the Amsterdam Exchanges than for those that are not . Capital contributions to a NV fiscal investment institution are subject to the 0.9% Dutch capital tax . <p> One of the main characteristics of the fiscal investment institution regime is that a fiscal investment institution is obliged to distribute its yearly income to the shareholders within eight months of year-end . The background of this obligation is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position more or less equal to that of making a direct investment in the underlying assets , in which case the investors would have received the relevant income themselves ( the 0% corporate tax rate for the fund has the same background ) . After January 1 2001 , however , actual dividends are tax-free in the hands of Dutch resident individuals , who will then be taxed on a deemed return ( 4% at a tax rate of 30% ) on the net average value of their investment assets . Nevertheless , for the fiscal investment institution , the obligation to distribute remains . Contrary to income received by the fund , capital gains ( whether realized or unrealized ) do not have to be distributed . They can allocated to the so called reinvestment reserve . <p> Dividends paid by the NV fiscal investment company are subject to 25% dividend withholding tax .

Other than the one-off capital duty , the NV fiscal investment institution would then result in virtually no taxation at fund level . <p> Further , the main advantage over , for instance a Luxembourg Sicav , would be that , generally , fiscal investment institutions enjoy tax treaty protection , thus receiving favourable foreign tax treatment in respect of returns on cross-border investments , such as the reduction of withholding tax on dividend and interest income , and protection against source country taxation on capital gains .

However , as mentioned above , it can also qualify as a fiscal investment institution and benefit from the 0% corporate income tax rate . An open mutual fund is a fund whereby the transfer of units is free , ie not subject to the consent of all participants in the fund . <p> As opposed to the situation with NVs , mutual funds that are open for corporate income tax purposes can be structured so as to remain outside the scope of Dutch capital tax .

It combines the absence of both Dutch corporate income tax and capital tax , while retaining the potential benefits of the Dutch tax treaty network . <p> Conclusion <p> The Netherlands offers various possibilities to structure investment vehicles , that are effective from a legal , tax and regulatory viewpoint for the needs of both private individuals and institutional investors .

@@8538051 @1738051/ <h> Tax considerations in structuring US-based private equity funds <h> Author : Published : 24 Jan 2002 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> In forming a US-based private equity fund , the fund sponsor must address tax and other structuring issues at four levels : the investor level , the fund level , the portfolio investment level and the fund manager level . This article principally addresses the investor level tax issues that a fund sponsor will typically face when determining what type of entity the fund will be and in which jurisdiction it will be formed . <h> CASE SCENARIO <p> A group of US-based investment professionals ( the sponsor ) seek to organize a group of US and non-US investors to invest in a private equity fund ( the fund ) with a view to making equity investments principally , although not exclusively , in the US . Investments may be made in a broad range of businesses eg mature , start-up , industrial , financial , technological and biochemical . Investments typically will be held for the medium to long-term , will include some management rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to improve performance of the respective businesses and sell at a profit after holding an investment for several years . <p> The target investor group will include local and foreign institutions ( pension funds , insurance companies , charities and foundations ) , individuals , governmental entities and perhaps other private equity funds . <p> A typical business arrangement for the fund would be as follows : The sponsor would be paid a flat management fee ( eg 1% of committed capital ) and also would be entitled to a share of the profits ( typically 20% after investors have realized a preferred return on and the return of their capital invested ) on the overall investment portfolio . <h> INVESTOR LEVEL ISSUES <p> In structuring the fund , there is a basic set of investor expectations that must be met , as well as issues specific to particular investor groups . <h> TAX OBJECTIVES OF MOST US INVESTORS <p> Most US investors will share the following common tax objectives when investing in the fund : <p> the fund itself should not bear tax ; <p> passthrough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of tax on capital gains ( as described more fully below ) ; <p> minimization of phantom income ( ie the allocation of profits to the investor that are included in the investor 's taxable income without the receipt of cash ) ; <p> no tax-reporting obligations in non-US jurisdictions ; and <p> no tax on gains in non-US jurisdictions or , if taxes are incurred , the ability to credit those taxes against US tax on the gain . <h> SPECIFIC TAX OBJECTIVES OF CERTAIN US INVESTORS <p> In addition , there are certain specific requirements unique to certain classes of US investors , particularly pension plans , private foundations , charitable trusts and other tax-exempt investors . <p> Unrelated business taxable income ( UBTI ) concerns : Certain US investors who are generally exempt from tax in the US are taxable in respect of UBTI . In this context , UBTI will not include dividends , interest and capital gains from the fund 's investment activities , but will include all or a portion of the income that the fund earns from investments that are in whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed income ( UDFI ) ) . UBTI may also include business income allocable to the fund from , for example , an operating partnership in which the fund is an investor . Charitable remainder trusts are particularly sensitive to UBTI and UDFI because receipt of an allocation of any such income causes the trust to be taxable on all of its income . <p> The sponsor will generally be required under the fund 's limited partnership agreement to avoid or minimize UBTI , or may be required to give certain investors the right to opt out of UBTI-generating investments . Alternatively , US tax-exempt investors may be given the option of investing in the fund through a non-US feeder corporation established primarily for non-US investors , eliminating the flow-through of taxable income to the tax-exempt investor . <p> Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 considerations : As a consequence of ERISA 's complex rules and high standards of conduct , many fund sponsors attempt to structure their funds to be exempt from ERISA 's requirements . The two most utilized exceptions for commingled private equity investment funds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating company ( VCOC ) and real estate operating company ( REOC ) ) and " significant participation " exception ( also referred to as the 25% test ) . If benefit plan investors ( eg pension funds , IRAs , insurance company separate accounts , and non-US pension funds ) account for 25% or more of fund capital the fund will not satisfy the 25% test exception . In that case , the fund 's governing documents generally will require the sponsor to operate the fund so that the fund qualifies under ERISA regulations as a VCOC or REOC . Very often the structure needed to be employed to comply with the VCOC or REOC rules conflict with the structure being utilized to achieve tax objectives . Careful consideration of these often competing objectives should be taken . <h> TAX OBJECTIVES OF MOST NON-US INVESTORS <p> Most non-US investors will share the following common tax objective when investing in the fund : <p> no US taxation of gains ; <p> by investing through the fund , the investor 's tax position in the investor 's home jurisdiction is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio company directly ; and <p> anonymity , ie no obligation to disclose the identity of the fund 's investors to taxing authorities . <h> SPECIFIC TAX OBJECTIVES OF CERTAIN NON-US INVESTORS <p> In addition , there are certain specific requirements unique to certain classes of non-US investors . <p> Non-US pension funds : Unlike their US counterparts , there is no special exemption from US tax for non-US pension funds as a matter of US tax law ( and similar rules may apply in other jurisdictions in which the fund invests ) . However , treaties may eliminate withholding tax on dividends and interest that otherwise may be applicable . These investors may be particularly sensitive to the transparency issues , discussed below , potentially relevant to taxation in their home jurisdictions and the jurisdictions in which the fund invests . <p> Special needs investors : Certain investors have unique structuring requirements arising from laws in their home jurisdictions . For example : <p> in order to avoid penalties under the German Foreign Investment Act , German investors may be required to participate in fund investments through a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co KG ) that co-invests with the fund ; <p> French and Netherlands investors need to invest in a vehicle that is transparent for home jurisdiction tax purposes and possibly for treaty purposes ; and <p> foreign governments and their controlled entities are exempt on investment income from US securities but taxable in respect of income from commercial activities . These investors may need to invest through a co-investing fund that excludes tainted income or have the right to opt out of certain investments if the government investor is a controlled entity . <h> BASIC US TAX REGIME APPPLICABLE TO NON-US INVESTORS <p> The basic US tax regime applicable to non-US investors in US-based private equity funds is that they are exempt from taxation on gains from portfolio investment activities , making the United States a tax haven of sorts for foreign private equity capital . United States tax law provides that a private equity fund that is investing or trading for its own account is not engaged in a trade or business in the United States , even if the fund is managed in the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also necessary to consider the tax laws of the state and city where the sponsor is located , as different rules may apply , potentially subjecting the fund to state or city tax liability . However , many states and cities , including New York state and New York City , follow the federal treatment . <p> The significance of this basic US tax regime for non-US investors is that : <p> gains generally are exempt from US tax ( but see the overriding exceptions below ) ; <p> dividends are subject to statutory withholding at 30% , reduced under any applicable income tax treaty between the US and the non-US investor 's home jurisdiction , provided that certain basic information about the non-US investor has been provided to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) under new IRS rules ; and <p> interest on portfolio indebtedness is exempt from withholding tax , assuming that the information referred to above is provided . ( Interest on indebtedness will not be exempt from US withholding tax if the recipient owns 10% or more of the voting power of the issuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fund or investor level ) . Interest that is not exempt under the portfolio debt exemption may be exempt under a treaty if certification rules similar to the dividend withholding certification rules are satisfied . <p> There are a number of overriding exceptions to the basic rule exempting non-US investors or a non-US feeder corporation from US taxation , each of which apply in circumstances where the fund is deemed to be engaged in a trade or business and therefore subject to tax . These categories of exceptional taxable income include : <p> gain on sales of shares of a US Real Property Holding Corporation ( USRPHC ) under the FIRPTA rules ; <p> financing activities ( Mezzanine funds and funds that invest in distressed bank loans or similar securities that may involve loan origination , loan syndicate participation , secondary market purchases of revolving loans , commitment or other funding fees and participation on creditor committees raise unsettled questions as to whether such programs constitute exempt investing or taxable financing activities. ) ; and <p> fees from portfolio companies . <p> The fund 's partnership agreement usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories of exceptional taxable income , other than fees from portfolio companies , which typically , although not completely without risk , are permitted to be earned by the sponsor and then offset in whole or in part against management fees . <h> CHOICE OF ENTITY AND JURISDICTION <p> The base case " Delaware limited partnership <p> As outlined above , US investors will prefer that the fund is structured as a partnership or entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes . Partnerships are not taxable entities for US tax purposes ; instead , each partner includes in its gross income its distributive share of partnership income based generally upon the partnership agreement ( hence the reference to partnerships as passthrough entities ) . Furthermore , a partnership will pass through to the partners the character of its income . As the fund generally will derive most of its gains from securities held for more than one year , US partners who are individuals will be subject to tax on their share of such fund 's gains at favorable long-term capital gains rates . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general partner to receive a performance-based allocation of partnership profits ( called a carried interest ) . ( More recent funds have permitted the sponsor to waive management fees in exchange for an increased profits interest . ) If structured properly , the receipt of the carried interest by the general partner at the inception of the fund will not be a taxable event for US tax purposes . Further , an allocation ( and related distribution ) to the general partner in respect of its carried interest of partnership gains results in favorable tax treatment for the sponsor compared to the receipt of performance-based fee compensation . <p> Non-US investors may not want to invest in a US partnership due in part to confidentiality concerns . ( While the fund will not be subject to tax , it will be required to file an annual partnership return with the IRS , attaching a schedule K-1 for each limited partner reflecting that limited partner 's share of the partnership 's income and losses for the year . ) These investors may invest in the fund through a foreign " feeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which in turn invests in the fund . The use of the foreign feeder generally will ensure that the non-US investor 's identity will not have to be disclosed to any taxing authority . <p> Note , however , that the foreign feeder entity may conflict with anti-tax haven legislation in the investor 's home jurisdiction and may cut off treaty benefits ( for example , with respect to dividends from the United States ) . As a result , non-US investors are typically given a choice , based on individual circumstances and concerns , to invest either directly in the partnership vehicle or through a feeder vehicle . Alternatively , it may be necessary to offer certain investors the ability to invest in a parallel or co-investment vehicle , which itself acquires an interest in portfolio companies alongside or in parallel with the fund , as discussed below . <p> Diagram A is an example of a basic private equity fund structure with a single Delaware limited partnership and an offshore feeder corporation for non-US investors . <p> Factors affecting the choice of jurisdiction <p> US investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fund . Typically , especially if the sponsor is a US-based organization , the fund will be structured as a US limited partnership because of the developed body of US partnership law . However , a number of factors may cause the sponsor to consider forming the fund in a non-US jurisdiction : <p> Investment Company Act considerations : The fund typically will be structured to avoid registration under the US Investment Company Act of 1940 . If the sponsor is seeking to avoid registration by restricting the number of investors in the fund to not more than 100 , using a non-US jurisdiction provides an advantage . Under the Investment Company Act , non-US investors will count toward the 100-person limit if the fund is a US-based entity , but they will not count if the fund is formed in a non-US jurisdiction . Similarly , if the fund relies on the so-called qualified purchaser exemption , the asset-based qualified purchaser test must be met by all investors in a US-based fund , but only by US investors if the fund is formed in a non-US jurisdiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , because of the manner in which investors are permitted to transfer or redeem interests in the fund , the fund would be characterized as a publicly traded partnership for US tax purposes , organizing the fund in a non-US jurisdiction may be prudent ( although publicly traded partnership issues are not likely in most private equity funds ) . <p> Non-US portfolio investment activities : If the fund intends to invest in non-US corporations , use of a US partnership could be detrimental to US-taxable investors and the sponsor . Understanding this issue requires an understanding of the US tax treatment of US shareholders of controlled foreign corporations ( CFCs ) . A CFC is a foreign corporation owned ( directly , indirectly or under applicable attribution rules ) more than 50% by vote or value by US persons who own at least 10% of the corporation 's voting power . Gain recognized by a US shareholder on the sale of the shares of a CFC will be recharacterized and taxed as ordinary income ( at higher rates than capital gains ) to the extent of the CFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign corporation is a CFC ( that is , whether it has a majority of US shareholders ) , a US partnership is treated as a single US shareholder ( regardless of whether any of the partners in the partnership are US persons ) . By comparison , a partnership that is organized in a non-US jurisdiction will not itself be treated as a US shareholder for CFC determination purposes ( even if all of the partners in such partnership are US persons ) . Instead the US ownership of a foreign portfolio company owned by a non-US partnership is determined at the partner level , as though each partner owned an interest in the portfolio company in proportion to its interest in the partnership . Thus , by organizing the fund as a non-US partnership , the likelihood that a foreign portfolio company acquired by the fund would be classified as a CFC might be remote . ( Note that the general partner of the non-US partnership also should be organized as a non-US entity . ) <p> Unless the sponsor insists on utilizing only one investment vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor to establish alternative investment vehicles when necessary to accomplish a regulatory or fiscal objective that can not be achieved by the US fund . Such alternative investment vehicles include parallel partnerships formed to avoid CFC status of a particular foreign portfolio company , as the need arises . However , use of the parallel vehicle to address CFC issues might perhaps be subject to challenge if the performance results of the " main " fund and the parallel vehicle are aggregated ( as investors would expect ) . <p> Diagram B is an example of a private equity fund structured with a basic parallel vehicle . <p> Even without regard to the issues US investors present , non-US investors may have concerns about investing through a US limited partnership . As noted earlier , one such concern involves the disclosure requirements that may be applicable to non-US investors in the fund , although this concern could be addressed with the use of a non-US feeder vehicle . More significantly , a US limited partnership may present tax problems for certain non-US investors in their home jurisdictions , where favourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle applying home jurisdiction ( rather than US ) legal principles . For instance , the UK , the Netherlands and France require transparency of a partnership or hybrid entity in order for an investor who is a resident of those jurisdictions to obtain more favorable tax treatment of capital gains . While each of those jurisdictions recently appears to recognize the transparency of a US limited partnership , such recognition may not apply for all purposes . For example , France may not permit treaty claims for non-US investors in a US partnership and may not recognize the transparency of a US partnership with respect to French investor treatment . In addition , in the absence of transparency in the investor 's home jurisdiction , the investor may be deprived of the ability to claim benefits under a treaty the United States maintains with the investor 's home jurisdiction under the US hybrid entity rules . <h> ALTERNATIVE JURISDICTIONS AND CO-INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES <p> After considering all of the above factors ( or where a parallel fund is utilized ) , consideration might be given to organizing the fund in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cayman Islands . Each of these has a limited partnership law that is in substance very similar to Delaware partnership law . However , use of such an entity does have potential problems . For instance , certain non-US investors may be disadvantaged in their home jurisdictions due to anti-tax haven legislation in such jurisdiction , which could result in denial of certain otherwise available , favorable home jurisdiction tax treatment or income imputation . In addition , certain jurisdictions in which the fund may invest might impose penalties on tax haven residents investing in the jurisdiction . Others might deny transparency to such entities with the results outlined earlier . Finally , while US investors generally will be indifferent to the use of a non-US partnership , additional reporting will be imposed on US investors with respect to an investment in a non-US partnership . <p> Organizing the fund in certain other non-US jurisdictions may avoid these issues while also addressing any issues raised by the use of a US limited partnership . These possible compromise jurisdictions include the UK and Canada . Each of these jurisdictions has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Delaware or the tax haven jurisdictions . For instance , UK limited partnership law currently limits the number of partners permitted in the partnership to 20 ( although recent proposed amendments would eliminate this limitation ) . Canadian partnership law construes participation in management of a partnership narrowly , which in certain circumstances may cause the sponsor and even limited partners participating on an investor advisory committee to risk losing their limited liability protection . Transparency issues further complicate the stacking of non-US partnerships for purposes of using feeder vehicles or selecting a jurisdiction for the sponsor 's vehicle . <p> Additional co-investment entities may be required for certain non-US investors . For instance , as mentioned earlier , German investors who invest in non-German investment funds that are not registered , or white funds , under German law will be subject to significant tax penalties . Those penalties could be avoided if the sponsor forms a special-purpose GmbH &amp; Co . KG for German investors , which would co-invest with the fund ( subject to certain limitations ) . French and Dutch investors may require similar special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France or the Netherlands , respectively . <p> Diagram C is an example of a parallel and co-investment structure with separate feeder entities and parallel fund vehicles designed to accommodate the needs of non-US investors . <h> CONCLUSION <p> The presumptive use of US and tax haven partnerships as effective vehicles for private equity funds requires close scrutiny in light of the myriad tax concerns such entities may raise for fund investors . Fund sponsors need to be able to balance the need for legal certainties against the different tax needs of investors as dictated by tax rules in the investors ' home jurisdictions , as well the tax regimes of jurisdictions in which the fund 's target portfolio companies are located . The evolution of tax regimes throughout the world to deal with hybrid entities and the increased focus of such regimes on perceived tax haven abuses continue to challenge previously accepted norms . However , with careful planning , even special-needs investors should be able to invest in pooled private equity opportunities on a tax-effective basis .

@@8538054 @1738054/ <h> UK : Natural gas comes of age <h> Author : Published : 1 Jun 2011 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> For many years , natural gas has been the less important hydrocarbon in the oil and gas business , but recent times have seen a potential change . Many indications suggest that natural gas is gaining a higher profile in the commerce and politics of the oil and gas business . Some would even go so far as to say that we are entering the age of natural gas . <p> The difficulties of containing and transporting natural gas meant for many years a limitation of markets to those closest to the points of production . But the development of ever-longer pipelines and , particularly , the growth of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) have enabled natural gas to reach ever more distant markets . While pipeline distances are inevitably limited , this is not the case with LNG which , over the last decade , has seen its traditionally regional and separated markets move towards a more homogenous , single , global market . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets for oil and natural gas with natural gas prices in the United States and Europe coming to reflect the value of natural gas in its own right . Perhaps more significantly , the growing development of unconventional gas ( in the form of shale gas and coal seam gas and often close to major consumer markets ) has also led to a concentration on natural gas in its own right . <p> The natural gas reserves of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East have long constituted the world 's major reserves but remain comparatively distant from the traditional consumer markets of the United States , Europe , Japan and Korea and the developing markets of China and India . But this balance has been thrown into doubt by the recent and rapid development of the US shale gas business . Whilst a number of developments are at early stages , the current view is that these unconventional gas reserves are very considerable and have the potential to move the projected supply and demand balance in the US from one of recent shortage to one of future abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long lead-time for LNG developments particularly , a number of production facilities intended towards deliveries to the United States are now likely to have to find alternative markets for their production . Also , Australia is seeing a considerable enhancement of its LNG production capability with an increase of its LNG production from the traditional natural gas reserves of Western Australia as well as the development of new LNG production facilities in Queensland . This represents the commercialisation of coal seam gas reserves with intended sales towards , primarily , North Asian markets . These effects on supply and demand in the world 's LNG sector are combining to create a more global market in natural gas , as well as a connection in the prices of LNG among the previously segregated markets of the Americas , Europe and North Asia . <p> Some recent transactions are also showing how gas is becoming the focus of strategic deals . One example is the entry by BP into a joint venture with Reliance Industries in relation to the gas market in India . This deal sees BP 's participation in upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint-venture arrangement for the marketing of gas and LNG within India . <p> The pace of recent development of the world 's LNG markets contrasts with the pace of development of major cross-border pipeline links . These arrangements are necessarily dependent on treaty arrangements among the relevant states , whether as producers or consumers of natural gas , or transit states in-between . The development of cross-border pipelines from Egypt to Israel and among the states of the former Soviet Union towards Europe provide examples of the long time needed to put in place the required political arrangements as well as the commercial arrangements allied to the long-term sale and purchase of natural gas through those pipelines . <p> The oil and gas business has long had a close interrelationship with politics and geo-politics and periods of change have meant uncertainty for the oil and gas business over time . This has been the case over recent years with increasing state participation in their petroleum sectors , whether at the same time as investments are made or over time , with moves towards resource nationalism in many jurisdictions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direct interference or , in case of a number of OECD states such as the UK , Australia and Israel , the changing of tax rates and fiscal terms . These steps may also lead to distortions in markets , with a notable example being seen in the Middle East where a combination of domestic subsidised energy prices and a prioritising of export resources are contributing to a need to import LNG into a region of plenty . <p> Both oil and gas are traditional fuels for the purposes of power generation and it is natural gas which has been taking a leading role in this sector over recent years . To some extent this may be a necessary response to an inability to commercialise or use associated natural gas otherwise , but it is also the case that natural gas is an environmentally cleaner fuel and with pressures in all jurisdictions towards the reduction of emissions and the management of carbon production , natural gas has been making a role for itself as a preferred fuel for power generation . This move towards increasing gas-fired power generation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in states with existing nuclear industries as well as new-comers . <p> This progress may well now be re-assessed in light of the accident at the Fukushima plant in Japan . While it is early days in the assessment of the accident , the reduction in nuclear capacity in Japan has led to increased local supplies of LNG in the short term and a wider mood of questioning nuclear developments pending greater certainty over matters of safety and sustainability in the longer term . While there is no questioning of the place of nuclear generation in the world 's future energy supply , it seems that developments are likely to slow in the near term with natural gas being the most likely ( and generally abundant ) replacement fuel . <p> Although the techniques and operations of the United States ' shale gas business and Australia 's coal-seam gas business are much influenced by the local legal and political regimes in those jurisdictions , the developments which are taking place there are likely to have broader application . Already , other jurisdictions , particularly those in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves are seen to hold great promise for China and India , both of which have traditionally been import-dependent . <p> There are legal and regulatory as well as operational and technical challenges in these on-shore developments , but these seem less onerous than those in off-shore environments where the challenges of deep-water exploration and production are growing . The recent accidents at the Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Montara field offshore Western Australia have led to a re-evaluation by many states of the terms on which drilling ( and particularly deep-water drilling ) should take place . More broadly , there are also consequences for the granting of drilling permits , HSE requirements , operational practices and the availability and terms of insurance cover . <p> These rapid and profound changes in the markets ( and the supply-and-demand balance ) of global natural gas are presenting new challenges for international oil companies , national oil companies , governments and consumers around the world .

In an increasingly global world , however , it has become more and more popular to legislate for extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction . One of the key areas where extraterritorial legislation has been introduced " and enforced " is in respect of white collar offences such as bribery , money laundering and breach of financial sanctions . <p> Within the two main categories of offences in this area " bribery and money-laundering " the UK and US have pioneered various forms of long-arm jurisdiction . <h> Bribery offences <p> The UK Bribery Act 2010 ( UKBA ) captured worldwide attention for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of non-UK bribery was not new . In fact , such jurisdiction had been introduced in the UK on February 14 2002 , when it was made an offence ( by sections 108 and 109 of the Anti-terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 ) for a UK national or UK incorporated entity to pay a bribe overseas . This extension of the UK 's traditional territorial jurisdiction was prompted , in part , by criticisms of the UK 's compliance with its obligations under the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions . <p> ( It should be noted here that although the UKBA , its predecessor legislation and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 apply in a similar way in England and Wales , and in Scotland and Northern Ireland , these are separate jurisdictions and the enforcement approach in each jurisdiction may be different . ) <h> " The FCPA has for many years been the most significant extraterritorial anti-corruption statute in the world " <p> When the UK anti-corruption regime was reformed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from July 1 2011 , UK bribery offences can be committed overseas by anyone with a " close connection " to the UK . This includes not only UK nationals and UK entities , but also persons " ordinarily resident " in the UK . Although there is no statutory definition of this concept , it was not expected that it would catch temporary residents , but rather those with some element of continuity , order or settled purpose ( as stated in the Law Commission 's ' Reforming Bribery ' report No 313 of 2008 ) . <p> In addition , and much more significantly , the UKBA introduced a new corporate offence of failing to prevent bribery , which has super-extraterritorial reach . Controversially , this can catch non-UK companies in respect of their non-UK activities . <p> A commercial organisation will be exposed to liability under the corporate offence if a person performing services on its behalf ( A ) pays a bribe with the intention of winning or retaining a business advantage for the commercial organisation . Commercial organisations within the scope of this offence include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on a business , or part of a business , in any part of the UK " ( UKBA , s.8(5) ( b ) ) . <p> By way of example , suppose a French company ( F ) had a branch office in the UK . F would be a commercial organisation by virtue of carrying on part of its business in the UK . If an agent or employee of F paid a bribe in Timbuktu , to a Timbuktu official , for the benefit of F 's head office in France , the corporate offence could be triggered " notwithstanding that the conduct had no nexus whatsoever to the UK . <p> This has led to a significant focus on the meaning of " carrying on a business or part of a business " , as well as the widespread introduction of anti-corruption programmes by companies who believe they may be subject to the offence , as it is a defence to the corporate offence for a company to prove that it had adequate procedures designed to prevent A from engaging in bribery on its behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on a business " . Non-binding guidance produced by the Ministry of Justice suggests that a common sense approach will be adopted and jurisdiction will only arise over a foreign entity if they have a " demonstrable business presence " in the UK . Similarly , the Director of the Serious Fraud Office has suggested that enforcement action will only be taken against foreign entities if their activities have an effect on ' UK Plc ' . <p> The ultimate arbiters will , however , be the courts " as and when a prosecution is brought . No such prosecutions had been brought at the time of writing , although a number of cases are reported to be under investigation . <h> Extraterritorial enforcement of UK anti-corruption laws <p> Prosecutions arising from alleged acts of bribery outside the UK have , under the pre-UKBA regime , been brought to date only against UK-incorporated entities , typically on the basis of carefully drafted plea agreements ( such as in Mabey &amp; Johnson ) or on the basis of guilty pleas to alternative offences such as books and records offences contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example ) . <p> Where foreign subsidiaries of UK parent entities have been involved in corrupt conduct , prosecutors have instead pursued civil proceedings ( often settled on a negotiated basis ) against the UK parent . Under this mechanism , where a prosecution is impracticable , or a conviction unlikely , designated prosecutors can obtain a civil recovery order from the High Court to recover any property located in the UK which is shown , on a balance of probabilities , to be or to represent property obtained through unlawful conduct . There have now been a handful of such cases , although the deployment of civil recovery orders as an enforcement tool in the corruption context has been the subject of some controversy . <h> US anti-corruption law <p> Turning to the US , there is a long-standing presumption in US law that " legislation of Congress , unless a contrary intent appears , is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States " ( EEOC v Arabian American Oil Co. , 499 U.S. 244 , 248 ) . This presumption can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative intention that legislation should be applied outside of the US . <h> " When the UK anti-corruption regime was reformed , jurisdiction was extended even further " <p> One example of such extraterritorial legislation is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) . First enacted in 1977 , the FCPA has for many years been the most significant extraterritorial anti-corruption statute in the world . Its far-reaching scope has been thrown into the spotlight by the dramatic growth in the number of FCPA enforcement actions in the last decade , many of which have been brought against foreign entities and individuals . <p> The FCPA contains a prohibition on bribery , and books and records and internal control requirements . The latter requirements have extraterritorial scope , but apply only to US issuers ( companies with relevant securities listed in the US ) and are enforced through the imposition of ( sometimes very significant ) civil penalties . The criminal element of the statute is the bribery prohibition . <p> The FCPA criminalises the corrupt provision of anything of value to foreign ( non-US ) officials in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Broadly speaking , the anti-corruption provision applies to US persons and businesses ( so-called domestic concerns ) , foreign issuers on the US stock exchanges , and foreign individuals or entities in respect of acts undertaken in the US ( traditional territorial jurisdiction ) . <p> The anti-corruption provision has an obvious extraterritorial effect in the sense that it seeks to prohibit payments made to foreign public officials . It does not follow that it automatically applies to any payments made outside of the US , however . Subject to what is said below , the provision has a jurisdictional means restriction which , in general terms , requires the perpetrator to make use of so-called interstate commerce or US mails in furtherance of a corrupt payment . In practice , this restriction has been interpreted very broadly , so as to include virtually every form of modern communication such as placing a telephone call , sending an email , text message , or fax for , to , or through the US , as well as sending a wire transfer from or to a US bank or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . <p> In addition , the US authorities have established extraterritorial jurisdiction over violations of the anti-corruption provision on four separate theories . <p> First , since 1998 the FCPA has contained alternative jurisdiction provisions that specifically proscribe bribery committed by US persons outside of the US . This type of alternative jurisdiction is based on the nationality of the perpetrator , and applies to US nationals and to businesses organised under US law . It does not otherwise extend to US residents or to non-US companies which have some place of business in the US . <p> Secondly , and as noted above , the FCPA anti-corruption provision applies to non-US persons who undertake any act in furtherance of the corrupt payments within the US ( traditional territorial jurisdiction ) . The US authorities have interpreted this to cover minor or pass-through acts , including wire transfers through US correspondent bank accounts ( which are relied on for the majority of US dollar transfers between foreign countries ) and email traffic through US domains . Given the prevalence of the US financial system and internet infrastructure , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons and businesses . <p> Thirdly , the US authorities have also aggressively applied the legal theories of agency and vicarious liability in order to regulate the conduct of foreign subsidiaries , joint venture partners , third-party consultants and other intermediaries used by domestic concerns or issuers . In determining whether liability can be established under an agency theory ( that is , in determining if the US principal is liable for the agent 's actions ) , the fundamental characteristic the US authorities typically consider is the extent of control exercised over the agent " including knowledge and direction of the agent 's actions . Further , under the traditional US principle of respondeat superior , a domestic concern or an issuer can be liable for corrupt acts undertaken by its employees within the scope of their employment and which are intended , at least in part , to benefit the domestic concern or the issuer in question . <p> Finally , a foreign individual or entity may be found liable for aiding and abetting an FCPA violation , or for conspiring to violate the FCPA , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in furtherance of the corrupt payment whilst in the US . In these cases , the US courts will generally have jurisdiction over the foreign individual or entity as long as they have jurisdiction over another party participating in the FCPA or conspiracy violation in question . <h> The extraterritorial enforcement of the FCPA <p> The net result is that the scope of the FCPA is very expansive . Similarly , the US authorities have taken an aggressive approach to extraterritorial enforcement of FCPA . <p> One example is the enforcement actions in respect of the Bonny Island Project , in the course of which four joint venture partners were found to have paid bribes to secure construction contracts in Nigeria . Only two of the four joint venture partners prosecuted were either a domestic concern or an issuer , but the US authorities claimed jurisdiction also over the remaining two joint venture partners on the basis that the foreign partners served as the agents of the domestic concern partner through the joint venture , and thereby aided and abetted the scheme . In the relevant settlement documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York-based banks could also be considered as a basis for exercising territorial jurisdiction . <p> There is limited clarity as to how the US courts would approach the extraterritorial application of the FCPA because cases are usually settled . A recent judicial decision suggests that the US courts might be more conservative than the US enforcement agencies in asserting jurisdiction over foreign defendants " a US court recently declined to exert personal jurisdiction over a German national on the basis that he did not have the required minimum contact with the US as required under the Constitution ( SEC v Sharef , 11 Civ. 9073 ( February 19 2013 ) , Dkt . Entry No. 33 ) . In reaching this conclusion , the court took the view that neither receiving a phone call from the US nor depositing bribe payments in a New York bank provided sufficient evidence of conduct directed towards the US . Another recent case suggests , however , that the US courts may exercise jurisdiction over a person who authorises a bribe , directs the concealment of a bribe or plays a role in falsifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because such actions are viewed as " directed to deceiving US shareholders " ( SEC v Straub , 11 Civ. 9645 ( February 8 2013 ) , Dkt . Entry No. 48 ) . <p> Overall , the US authorities can be seen to have aggressively expanded the FCPA 's jurisdictional reach to include a range of foreign individuals and entities , as well as US domestic concerns . It remains to be seen how the US courts will reconcile this expansive approach with the presumption against extraterritoriality . <h> The extraterritorial reach of US money laundering offences <p> Another area of US law with extended extraterritorial scope is the anti-money laundering regime . <h> " UK law enforcement agencies may seek to rely on the extended extraterritorial reach of secondary and inchoate offences " <p> In the wake of 9/11 , the so-called Patriot Act ( Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 , Public Law 107-56 ) introduced additional extraterritorial elements to the US anti-money laundering statutes , including the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow US jurisdiction to be exercised over money laundering offences committed by non-US persons which involve a financial transaction taking place , in whole or in part , in the US . As explained above , this concept is very broadly interpreted . Jurisdiction may also be exercised over non-US persons handling property that has been subject to forfeiture by a US court order ( including assets located outside the US ) , as well as over any non-US financial institution that maintains a bank account at a US financial institution " which would include the majority of financial institutions . <p> The Patriot Act also grants US authorities the ability to subpoena non-US banks that maintain correspondent accounts in the US , and to request records related to such correspondent accounts ; including records maintained outside of the US relating to the deposit of funds into foreign banks . <p> In addition to extending the extraterritorial reach of US money laundering offences , the Patriot Act requires US banks managing accounts for non-US persons to establish relevant policies and procedures designed to detect and report suspicious activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means to extend their own anti-money laundering standards to foreign affiliates of US banks that conduct US dollar transactions . One such example is the record-breaking fine imposed on HSBC at the end of 2012 for alleged anti-money laundering violations , which stem in part from the actions of HSBC 's Mexican entity . <p> A further extraterritorial aspect to US money laundering offences is provided by the treatment of certain foreign crimes as predicate offences . Thus , the money laundering offences criminalise transactions involving the proceeds of a range of foreign crimes ( including murder , kidnapping , bribery , drug trafficking and the like ) , irrespective of whether or not that predicate conduct could be prosecuted under US law . <h> The extraterritorial reach of UK money laundering offences <p> Contrary to popular belief , the substantive money laundering offences created by the UK 's Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 " acquiring the proceeds of crime , being involved in money laundering arrangements , transferring the proceeds of crime , and so on " do not have the same extraterritorial scope as the UKBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laundering activity to have occurred in the UK . By contrast to the UKBA , jurisdiction is not triggered on a nationality basis . <h> " UK extraterritorial jurisdiction has been dramatically extended by the new corporate offence in the UKBA " <p> The money laundering offences do , however , have indirect extraterritorial reach , in that ( similarly to the US approach ) , a money laundering offence can be committed by dealing in the UK with the proceeds of non-UK predicate conduct . The predicate conduct covered by the UK money laundering offences is very broad : it comprises any criminal conduct in the UK or any overseas conduct which would have amounted to a criminal offence if it had taken place within the territory . ( This is subject to a rather badly drafted carve out relating to the dealings with the proceeds of non-serious lawful overseas conduct , which was introduced by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 " the so-called overseas conduct defence ) . <p> In addition to the substantive money laundering offences , the Proceeds of Crime Act creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable grounds to suspect that a person is engaged in money laundering . The failure to report offence applies only to persons working within the UK regulated sector ( which includes , but is not limited to , UK financial institutions ) . The failure to report offence also has an indirect extraterritorial element , in that the suspected money laundering activity which is required to be reported can be money laundering taking place overseas ( subject to a variant of the overseas conduct defence ) . The only necessary UK nexus is that the information on which the suspicion is based was obtained in the course of UK regulated business . <h> The extraterritorial reach of UK accessory and inchoate liability <p> A final point to note in relation to the UK regime is that UK law enforcement agencies may seek to rely on the extended extraterritorial reach of secondary and inchoate offences to prosecute overseas bribery , money laundering , or indeed other white collar offences . <p> Conspiracy is an important example of this type of liability . A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily involve the commission of an offence . An offence of conspiracy is committed under the Criminal Law Act 1977 as soon as the agreement is entered into " it is not necessary for the criminal conduct to actually take place . A number of bribery cases have been prosecuted as conspiracies ; Innospec , for example , was prosecuted for conspiracy to corrupt foreign officials ( R v Innospec Ltd 2010 Lloyd 's Rep. F.C . 462 ) . <p> The jurisdictional rules applicable to prosecuting conspiracies are not straightforward . Some examples of conspiracies over which the English courts have jurisdiction include : <p> an overseas conspiracy to commit an offence in England and Wales ; <p> a conspiracy in England and Wales to carry out a course of conduct overseas , if a party to the conspiracy ( or their agent ) did any act in relation to , or in pursuance of , the conspiracy within the territory and the overseas offence would also be an offence if it had been committed in England and Wales ( section 1A Criminal Law Act 1977 ) ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be triable in the courts in England and Wales on the basis of extraterritorial jurisdiction ( section 1 Criminal Law Act 1977 ) . <p> Secondary offences of aiding and abetting , counselling or procuring also have some extraterritorial scope ; as long as the principal offence falls within the jurisdiction of the English courts , they will also have jurisdiction over a secondary party to the offence . Acts undertaken after October 1 2008 which are capable of encouraging or assisting an overseas offence are also triable as offences in England and Wales in certain circumstances ( sections 44 " 46 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 ) . The detail of these rules is outside the scope of this article , but will always need to be considered , in advising on liability , if a corruption or money laundering incident in a company 's overseas business is discovered . <h> Time will tell <p> The US FCPA has been on the horizon for long enough to be familiar to most multinational businesses , but its ever more frequent use against non-US companies is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law develops , its interpretation will continue to be driven by settled enforcement actions , and thus by the US authorities ' expansive view of its jurisdictional scope . <p> Although UK extraterritorial jurisdiction is of more recent vintage , it has been dramatically extended by the new corporate offence in the UKBA , which may in turn provide a template for future extensions of extraterritorial liability in other statutory contexts . It remains to be seen how aggressively this offence will be prosecuted , or how broadly its extraterritorial reach will be interpreted by the courts ; but it unquestionably exposes non-UK companies to potential liability for acts which take place wholly outside the UK . <p> Similarly , foreign entities should be aware that US and UK money laundering offences can be committed by dealing with the proceeds of foreign offences . <p> The author would like to thank Hebert Smith Freehills ' senior associate , Anna Bradshaw , and associate Geng Li for their assistance with this article <p> Susannah Cogman is a partner in Herbert Smith Freehills ' corporate crime and investigations team .

During this period , the private equity ( PE ) market has rapidly expanded , both in size and importance . As of the end of 2013 , registered domestic PEFs numbered 237 and the total capital commitments reached W44 trillion ( $43 billion ) . Further , in today 's depressed M&amp;A market , where large corporations are reluctant to engage in deals due to risk concerns , PEFs have become integral players in driving deal volume , and their importance is underscored by their being party to virtually all the big M&amp;A deals in recent times . In this and in other ways , the tenth anniversary of the introduction of PEFs in Korea represents an important marker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first wave of Korean PEFs , which generally have a 10-year term , is taking place and offering a means of exit for investors . Equally significant , and a sure sign of the PE market 's maturation in Korea , is that as a result of the liquidation of the first Korean PEFs established in 2004 , the PE firms that have served as general partners ( GPs ) are now being assessed according to their performance in the market . <h> " A sure sign of the PE market 's maturation is that as a result of the liquidation of the first Korean PEFs , firms that have served as GPs are now being assessed according to their performance in the market " <p> When the PEF scheme was introduced in Korea in 2004 , the Korean government laid out a plan to develop Korean PEFs in three phases . They were to be tailored to the circumstances in Korea and distinguished from their global counterparts . The first phase would separate PEFs from general private funds in a two-track system and regulate PEFs with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax the regulations on PEFs while maintaining the two-track system . The third and final phase would do away with the two-track system and regulate PEFs and general private funds in the same manner , removing any special regulations . In 2013 , the Korean government proposed amendments to the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act ( FSCMA ) , which included changes to the existing PEF scheme . Although the proposed amendments to the FSCMA mainly relate to the revitalisation of the M&amp;A market in response to the economic recession after the global financial crisis in 2008 , the proposed changes to the PEF scheme can be seen as heralding the second phase of the Korean government 's developmental plan for Korean PEFs.The proposed amendments to the FSCMA relating to PEFs can be separated into three major categories . The first is the replacement of the existing registration requirements with a mere reporting requirement . This is a major change that facilitates the process of establishing PEFs , and should the proposed amendments be approved by the National Assembly , it is anticipated that the government regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased regulation of PE firms acting as GPs , due to the need for sup plemental regulatory measures to address potential issues resulting from simplifying establishment procedures for PEFs . The third involves asset management restrictions ; the two-track system of regulation is maintained , with the proposed amendments greatly relaxing the restrictions for general private funds while maintaining asset management restrictions for PEFs . <h> Simplifying establishment procedures for Korean PEF <p> The existing FSCMA requires PEFs to be registered with the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) , a financial regulatory body in Korea , before commencing their business . Accordingly , GPs are required to register the PEF with the FSC after the PEF 's incorporation , and they are prohibited from managing its assets or proceeding with investing activities before proper registration . The registration procedures generally take one month , during which time the FSC examines in detail compliance with proper establishment procedures and satisfaction of all requirements for PEFs . <p> The proposed amendments to the FSCMA abolish the existing registration requirement for PEFs and stipulate a subsequent reporting requirement instead . By virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business , including asset management and other investment activities , immediately after their incorporation , which will be of great convenience to GPs . Of course , the relevant governmental authority may examine PEFs after the fact and demand corrective measures if subsequent examinations find that they are in violation of applicable laws . <p> The complicated procedures for establishing PEFs are often cited as a major factor in discouraging their use as investment vehicles . Therefore , if implemented , such amendments are expected to have a positive effect in enhancing the viability of PEFs for use in M&amp;A and other investment transactions . <h> Strengthening registration requirements for GPs <p> The proposed amendments to the FSCMA make establishment procedures less burdensome for PEFs , while simultaneously strengthening registration requirements for GPs . This difference stems from the need to protect investors from the prospect of unqualified GPs participating in the PE market due to the relaxation of PEF establishment procedures . <p> Registration requirements for GPs in the proposed amendments to the FSCMA require that GPs be registered with the relevant governmental authority before establishing the PEFs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in order for GPs to be so registered : ( i ) GPs must have equity capital of more than W100 million ; ( ii ) GPs ' executives must not have a criminal record for the preceding five-year period ; ( iii ) GPs must satisfy certain requirements as asset managers ; and , ( iv ) GPs must possess internal control systems for the prevention of conflict of interest . Additionally , the proposed amendments to the FSCMA stipulate good financial standing and social credibility for GPs as further conditions for registration . Details of these conditions are to be included in the proposed amendments to the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA and supplemental legislation , which are scheduled to be issued at the end of 2014 . Considering examples from other similar legislation , the good financial standing requirement may deal with issues of capital adequacy ratio , liquidity ratio , asset quality , social credibility , criminal records of executives , and relationship with insolvent financial institutions . <h> Regulation of asset management by PEF <p> The proposed amendments to the FSCMA do not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingly , asset management by a PEF is basically limited to buy-out investments such as : ( i ) investment in 10% or more of the total number of outstanding voting stocks ; or ( ii ) investment in less than 10% of the total number of outstanding voting stocks that enables the PEF to exercise de facto control over the major business of a target company , including the appointment and dismissal of executives . A PEF may also use 50% or more of its assets for buy-out investments within two years of the partners ' contribution ( the two-year rule ) . In addition to the two-year rule , other regulations on asset management by PEFs , such as the restriction on mezzanine investment , the six-month rule and the restriction on the investment with options , are maintained . <p> Restriction on the mezzanine investment <p> While PEFs are permitted to use their assets for mezzanine investments , such as investments in convertible bonds ( CBs ) or bonds with warrants ( BWs ) , such investments do not fall under the category of buy-out investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may convert CBs or exercise the warrants of BWs within two years of the partners ' contribution . <h> " If they are approved by the National Assembly , supplemental legislation will be amended accordingly . Then , Korean PEFs will have clearly entered the second phase of development " <p> Six-month rule <p> PEFs must satisfy the buy-out investment requirements within six months of acquiring shares in a certain company . If the PEF fails to satisfy the requirements , it must sell the shares they have acquired . Further , PEFs must continue to own the shares for more than six months after satisfying the buy-out investment requirements . <p> Restriction on investment in options <p> PEFs are prohibited from managing their assets by lending money , and accordingly the investment in options as lending is prohibited . For example , PEFs are not permitted to acquire put options which have similar qualities as a loan , with the put options becoming exercisable after a certain time and the exercise price amounting to principal and certain additional profits . <p> However , there are some minor changes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the buy-out investments . Most significantly , the limitation in securities investment for the purpose of maintaining an investment portfolio is enhanced from 5% to 30% of the total assets of the PEF . Further , investment in derivatives for hedging foreign exchange risk is also permitted by the proposed amendments to the FSCMA . <p> Meanwhile , the regulations on conflict of interest between PEFs and GPs have been elaborated in the proposed amendments to the FSCMA . Under the existing FSCMA , transactions between PEFs and GPs are permitted with the consent of all the PEF partners , and beyond such rule , the conflict of interest is regulated by the fiduciary duty of GPs . However , in accordance with the proposed amendments to the FSCMA : ( i ) any transaction between a PEF and GPs ( or specially related persons to GPs ) is prohibited in principle , except when such transaction takes place on a stock exchange , or when such transaction is clearly favourable to the PEF ; ( ii ) PEFs are prohibited from acquiring securities issued by GPs ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially related persons to GPs is permitted only up to a certain limit . Additionally , proposed amendments to the FSCMA stipulate regulations on the participation of specially related persons to GPs as limited partners in a PEF . <h> Regulation on the use of SPC <h> " The complicated procedures for establishing PEFs are often cited as a major factor in discouraging their use as investment vehicles " <p> As explained earlier , various restrictions are applied with respect to asset management by a PEF . However , PEFs may get around such restrictions by using a special purpose company ( SPC ) . For example , the PEF may invest their entire assets in an SPC , which may in turn use the assets in a manner prohibited for PEFs , such as lending money . As the investment of PEFs in SPCs falls under the category of buy-out investments , the SPC can be misused by the PEF to avoid restrictions on asset management . As a result , the FSCMA stipulates certain requirements for an SPC when used by a PEF , and restrictions on asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure the effectiveness of such regulations , PEFs are not permitted to invest in a newly established company , since it is hard to distinguish a newly established company from an SPC . <p> Regulations on the use of an SPC are maintained under the proposed amendments to the FSCMA , although there have been strong requests from market players to abolish such restrictions . The proposed amendments , however , do relax some restrictions on SPCs . The PEF may : ( i ) make use of two-level SPCs ; and ( ii ) invest in a newly established company other than the SPC permitted by the FSCMA in order to acquire a business . If approved , the proposed amendments to the FSCMA will have the effect of further stimulating PEFs ' M&amp;A activities . <h> Next steps for the FSCMA amendments <p> The process of gathering opinions and feedback from industry professionals and the public on the proposed amendments to the FSCMA has been completed , and they will shortly be sent to the National Assembly for a vote . If they are approved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the FSCMA and the Regulations on Financial Investment Business , will be amended accordingly . Then , Korean PEFs will have clearly entered the second phase of development , as planned by the government 10 years ago when it implemented the PEF scheme .

" That seemingly simple question can prove very complicated to answer . We summerize below the financial statement requirements that apply when a foreign private issuer offers securities to the public in the United States , list its securities for trading in the United States or files a US annual report . We also briefly discuss financial statements in connection with unregistered transactions . ( For ease of illustration , we have assumed below that the issuer 's fiscal year is the calendar year. ) @qwx115045 <p> This is usually the most difficult challenge for foreign private issuers seeking to access the US public markets .

Furthermore , where a material acquisition has occurred or is probable , S-X Rule 11-01 generally requires pro forma financial information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent interim period.237 <p> The term " business " is defined in S-X Rule 11-01(d) to include an operating entity or business unit , but excludes machinery and other assets that do not generate a distinct profit or loss stream.238 Acquisitions of related businesses are treated as a single acquisition for purposes of the significance tests . Businesses are considered " related " if they are owned by a common seller , under common management , or their acquisitions are conditional upon each other or a single common event . The term " probable " is interpreted to mean more likely than not . The SEC staff has taken the general view that an acquisition becomes probable upon the signing of a letter of intent.239 <p> Whether financial statements for recent and probable acquisitions must be included in the filing also depends upon the significance of the acquisition . Significance of an acquired business is evaluated under S-X Rule 1-02(w) based upon three criteria : <p> the amount of the issuer 's investment in the acquired business compared to the issuer 's total assets ; <p> the total assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets ; and <p> the pre-tax income240 from continuing operations of the acquired business compared to the issuer 's pre-tax income from continuing operations ; <p> in each case , based on the issuer 's most recent audited financial statements.241 <p> Generally : <p> if the acquired business exceeds 20% of any of the three significance criteria , then one year of audited financial information is required , as well as the interim financial information that would be required for the issuer ; <p> if it exceeds 40% , then two years of audited and interim financial information is required ; and <p> if it exceeds 50% , three years of audited and interim financial information is required . @qwx115045 <p> These determinations are often difficult and should be addressed by the issuer and its accounting firm before commencing the offering process . @qwx115045 <p> The rules require the amounts used to be determined on the basis of US Gaap rather than local Gaap or IAS ( as used by the issuer or the acquired company ) .242 However , foreign private issuers typically make the calculation in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their primary financial statements ( that is , local Gaap or IAS ) . <p> ( ii ) Financial statement requirements <p> The table on the following page summarizes the financial statement requirements in connection with acquisitions . @qwx115045 <p> If financial statements for an acquired business are required , the acquired company 's auditors may not be qualified ( or willing ) to have their audit report filed with the SEC . The auditors may also be unfamiliar with the procedures required under US Gaas . The additional work required to get those financial statements into compliant form can be a significant timing issue . <p> One notable exception to these rules is that below the 50% significance level , no audited financial statements are required in a registration statement for probable acquisitions or for completed acquisitions consummated up to 74 days before the date of the offering.243 <p> Acquisition scenario <p> Reporting requirement <p> 1 . Individual acquisition at or below the 20% significance level . <p> 2 . Individual acquisition ( or multiple acquisitions of related businesses , as described above ) in excess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . Multiple acquisitions of unrelated businesses below the 20% significance level individually , but aggregating in excess of the 50% level of significance . <p> 4 . Individual acquisition ( or multiple acquisitions of related businesses , as described above ) in excess of the 40% significance level , but not above the 50% level . <p> 5 . Individual acquisition above the 50% significance level . <p> 6 . Securities being registered in an offering to stockholders of the acquired company ( such as a stock-for-stock merger ) . <p> 1 . No requirement to include audited financials . <p> 2 . Audited financials for the most recent fiscal year and unaudited financials for any interim periods will be required , as specified in S-X Rules 3-01 and 3-02 . <p> 3 . Audited financials for the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods required for a substantial majority of the individually insignificant acquisitions required . <p> 4 . Audited financials for the two most recent fiscal years ( including one balance sheet ) and any interim periods required . <p> 5 . Three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any interim periods required for all completed and probable acquisitions at this level of significance . However , financial statements for the earliest of the three fiscal years required may be omitted if net revenues reported by the acquired business in its most recent fiscal year are less than $25 million . <p> 6 . Three years of financial statements ( including two balance sheets ) of the business to be acquired in the transaction are generally required and in most cases the most recent fiscal year must be audited.244 @qwx115045 <p> Notwithstanding this exception , market practice is typically to include financials for any acquisition above the 20% threshold as soon as it has become probable and to require at least a one-year audit , even if the 74-day grace period has not yet expired . <p> Compliance with these rules is also facilitated by the S-X Rule 3-06 exception that allows a single audited period of nine to 12 months to count as a year for an acquired business . <p> Staff Accounting Bulletin 103 ( SAB 103 ) provides a special interpretation of S-X Rule 3-05 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aggregation of discrete businesses that remain substantially intact after acquisition ( that is , industry roll-ups ) . ( SAB 103 recodifies , with slight modifications , Staff Accounting Bulletin 80 . ) SAB 103 allows first-time issuers to consider the significance of businesses recently acquired or to be acquired based on the pro forma financial information for the issuer 's most recently completed fiscal year . <p> While compliance with this interpretation requires an application of SAB 103 's guidance and examples on a case-by-case basis , the policy is to allow currently insignificant business acquisitions to be excluded from the financial statement requirements while still ensuring that the registration statement will include not less than three , two and one year(s) of financial statements for not less than 60% , 80% and 90% , respectively , of the constituent businesses of the issuer.245 <p> Note that the permitted age of financial statements of acquired or soon-to-be acquired businesses is the same as for the issuer itself.246 This means , for example , that the audited annual financial statements of the acquired business may not be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Notwithstanding the requirements outlined above , under S-X Rule 3-05(b) ( 4 ) ( iii ) , separate financial statements for the acquired business do not need to be presented once the operating results of the acquired business have been reflected in the issuer 's audited consolidated financial statements for a complete fiscal year ( a full audit cycle ) unless the financial statements have not been previously filed by the issuer or unless the acquired business is of such significance to the issuer that omission of such financial statements " would materially impair an investor 's ability to understand the historical financial results of the registrant. " 247 <p> ( iii ) Operating real estate <p> The acquisition or probable acquisition of operating real estate is subject to an additional set of disclosure requirements under S-X Rule 3-14 . S-X Rule 3-14 addresses income-producing real estate such as apartment buildings and shopping malls . ( In comparison , where real estate is incidental to the service provided by a business , such as a hotel , S-X Rule 3-05 alone would apply . ) Generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for the three most recent fiscal years for any such acquisition or probable acquisition that would account for 10% or more of the issuer 's total assets . S-X Rule 3-14 also prescribes certain variations from the typical form of income statement and allows for only one year of income statements to be provided if the property is not acquired from a related party and certain additional textual disclosure is made.248 <p> ( iv ) MD&amp;A <p> Whenever historical financial statements of an acquired business ( or probable acquisition ) are included in a registration statement , the issuer should consider whether a separate MD&amp;A section discussing those financial statements is appropriate.249 Although there is no specific line item requiring that a second MD&amp;A be included , it is not uncommon for issuers to interpret Securities Act Rule 408250 as requiring a full discussion and analysis of the financial statements of an acquired business ( or probable acquisition ) , particularly where it exceeds 50% on any of the three significance criteria discussed above . <p> ( v ) Pro forma financial information <p> As noted above , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 11 requires : <p> a condensed pro forma balance sheet as of the end of the most recent period for which a consolidated balance sheet is required ( unless the transaction is already reflected in that balance sheet ) ; 251 and <p> a condensed pro forma income statement for the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period ( unless the historical income statement reflects the transaction for the entire period ) .252 <p> The SEC will permit the inclusion of additional pro forma information that does not comply with S-X Article 11 if this information is required by a foreign regulator.253 In that case , the issuer must indicate clearly what the presentation represents , state that the information does not comply with Article 11 and explain why the information is being included.254 @qwx115045 <p> The SEC 's pro forma rules permit adjustments that are directly related to the acquisition and related financing transactions . Adjustments for expected synergies and cost savings that are not expressly mandated by the acquisition documents will generally not be permitted . @qwx115045 <p> The SEC 's pro forma financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules or accounting requirements , which need to be considered carefully in any multi-jurisdictional offering . @qwx115045 <p> Even if pro forma adjustments for an acquired business are not required because the financial statements of the acquired businesses are not required to be included in the prospectus , the underwriters will often request that the adjustments resulting from such an acquisition nevertheless be included in the pro forma financial information . This in turn will require accountants ' " comfort " on the historical information for the acquired company included in the pro forma presentation . <p> ( vi ) Reconciliation to US Gaap <p> The financial statements provided for an acquired foreign business may be prepared using local Gaap or IAS , but must be reconciled to US Gaap when the acquired business is at or above the 30% level for any of the significance tests.255 The pro forma financial information should either be prepared on a US Gaap basis or on a local Gaap or IAS basis accompanied by a quantified reconciliation to US Gaap.256 <p> GUARANTOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS <p> A guarantee of a security ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself a security that must be registered under the Securities Act , absent an applicable exemption . As a result , under S-X Rule 3-10(a) , the general rule is that guarantors are required to present the same financial statements as the issuer of the guaranteed securities.257 Fortunately , S-X Rules 3-10(b) to ( f ) contain a number of important exceptions that permit issuers to disclose financial information about guarantors in a summary format using a footnote to their financial statements.258 Although the footnote approach can involve a fair amount of effort , it is far less burdensome than providing separate audited financial statements for every guarantor , which would of course be prohibitively expensive in many cases . <p> S-X Rules 3-10(e) and ( f ) go even further , dispensing with any additional information requirement for guarantors in the case of a parent company issuer that does not have independent assets or operations if all of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are " minor . " 259 US Gaap reconciliation is required in the footnote when the parent 's financial information is prepared under a different set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of S-X Rule 3-10 as they apply to the following five common situations : <p> parent company issuer of securities guaranteed by one or more subsidiaries ; <p> subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by parent company and one or more other subsidiaries of parent company ; and <p> recently acquired subsidiary issuer or subsidiary guarantor . @qwx115045 <p> A standstill period after a default before investors can pursue a guarantor ( as is common in upstream guarantee structures in Europe ) will not satisfy the full and unconditional requirement , and will result in a requirement for separate financial statements . <p> Guarantee scenario <p> Financial statement requirements <p> 1 . Parent company issuer of securities guaranteed by some or all of issuer 's subsidiaries , where : <p> the subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned261 by the parent company issuer ; <p> the guarantee is full - the amount of the guarantee may not be less than the underlying obligation ; 262 <p> the guarantee is unconditional - holders must be able to take immediate action against the guarantor after a default on the underlying obligation ; and <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple guarantors ) .263 <p> 1 . No separate financial statements for subsidiaries required under S-X Rules 3-10(e) and ( f ) if the parent 's financial statements are filed for the periods required and they include an audited footnote with condensed , consolidating financial information264 for each such period , with separate columns for : <p> the parent company ; <p> the subsidiary guarantor ( or subsidiary guarantors on a combined basis ) ; <p> any non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis ; 265 <p> consolidating adjustments ; and <p> total consolidated amounts . <p> Note 2 to S-X Rule 3-10(e) and Note 1 to S-X Rule 3-10(f) allow a conditional exemption from providing the footnote if the parent company has no independent assets or operations , the non-guarantor subsidiaries are " minor , " and there is a footnote to this effect in the parent financial statements that also notes that the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several . Under S-X Rule 3-10(h) ( 5 ) , a parent company has " no independent assets or operations " if each of its total assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cash flows from operating activities ( excluding amounts related to its investment in its consolidated subsidiaries ) is less than 3% of the corresponding consolidated amount . <p> the operating subsidiary issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor ; <p> the guarantee is full and unconditional ; and <p> no other subsidiary of the parent is a guarantor . <p> 2 . No separate financial statements for operating subsidiary required under S-X Rule 3-10(c) if the parent 's financial statements are filed for the periods required and they include an audited footnote with condensed , consolidating financial information267 for each such period , with separate columns for : <p> the parent company ; <p> the operating subsidiary issuer ; <p> any non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis ; 268 <p> consolidating adjustments ; and <p> total consolidated amounts . <p> This exception is also available if an operating subsidiary issuer meets these requirements except that the parent is a co-issuer with the subsidiary , rather than a guarantor . <p> the finance subsidiary issuer is 100% owned by the parent company guarantor ; <p> the guarantee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent is a guarantor . <p> 3 . No separate financial statements for finance subsidiary required under S-X Rule 3-10(b) if the parent 's financial statements are filed for the periods required and they include an audited footnote with : <p> a statement that the finance subsidiary issuer is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of the parent and the parent has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities ; and <p> additional disclosure under S-X Rule 3-10(b) ( 4 ) relating to limitations on the ability of the issuer and guarantor to obtain dividends and loans from their subsidiaries . <p> This exception is also available if a finance subsidiary issuer meets these requirements except that the parent is a co-issuer with the subsidiary , rather than a guarantor . <p> 4 . Subsidiary issuer of securities guaranteed by parent company and one or more other subsidiaries of parent company - applies to both operating and finance subsidiaries , where : <p> the issuer and all subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned by the parent company guarantor ; <p> the guarantees are full and unconditional , joint and several ; 270 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantor . <p> 4 . No separate financial statements for subsidiaries required under S-X Rule 3-10(d) if the parent 's financial statements are filed for the periods required and they include an audited footnote with condensed , consolidating financial information271 for each such period , with separate columns for : <p> the parent company ; <p> the subsidiary issuer ; <p> the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis ; 272 <p> any non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis ; <p> consolidating adjustments ; and <p> total consolidated amounts . <p> This exception is also available if a subsidiary issuer meets these requirements except that the parent is a joint and several co-issuer with the subsidiary , rather than a guarantor . <p> the subsidiary has not been included in the audited consolidated results of the parent company for at least nine months of the most recent fiscal year ; and <p> the purchase price or net book value ( as of the most recent fiscal year end prior to the acquisition ) , whichever is greater , of the subsidiary ( or group of subsidiaries that were related prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the securities being registered . <p> audited financial statements for the subsidiary 's most recent fiscal year prior to the acquisition ; and <p> unaudited financial statements for any required interim periods . 273 <p> Requirements apply even if ( i ) the recently acquired subsidiary would otherwise be eligible for the use of condensed consolidating footnote presentation or ( ii ) S-X Rule 3-05 would not require financial statements . <p> INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD <p> S-X Rule 3-09 generally requires that registration statements and annual reports include audited financial statements for significant investments in less-than-majority-owned investees that are accounted for under the equity method . S-X Rule 3-09 applies whether the investee is held by an issuer , a subsidiary or another investee.274 <p> Significance for these purposes is evaluated under S-X Rule 1-02(w) based on the following two criteria : <p> the amount of the issuer 's investment in and advances to the investee compared to the total assets of the issuer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis ; and <p> the equity of the issuer and its other subsidiaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to that income of the issuer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.275 <p> These tests are performed as of the end of each year presented in the issuer 's financial statements . <p> Full audited financial statements as of the same dates and for the same periods as the audited consolidated financial statements of the issuer are required where the equity investee meets either of the two criteria above at the 20% or greater significance level.276 For equity investees or non-consolidated subsidiaries which meet any of the three S-X Rule 1-02(w) criteria at the greater than 10% but not more than 20% significance level , S-X Rule 4-08(g) requires the presentation of summary financial information as described by S-X 1-02(bb) . Financial statements of equity investees that are prepared under local Gaap or IAS do not have to be quantitatively reconciled to US Gaap unless either of the two criteria is greater than 30% ( calculated on a US Gaap basis ) .277 A description of the differences in accounting methods is required , however , regardless of the significance levels.278 <p> INDUSTRY GUIDES AND OTHER TRANSACTION-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 801 of Regulation S-K , the SEC publishes the following six industry guides which require enhanced disclosure of financial and operational metrics for issuers in certain industries:279 <p> Guide 2- Disclosure of oil and gas operations : requires disclosure of reserve estimates , sales and production costs per unit , numbers of productive wells , developed and undeveloped acreage , drilling activity , and delivery commitments ; <p> Guide 4- Prospectuses relating to interests in oil and gas programmes : requires enhanced disclosure relating to the offering terms and participation in costs and revenues among investors and others , as well as a ten-year financial summary of any drilling programmes by the issuer and its associates , including recovery on investment for investors in those programmes ; <p> Guide 5- Preparation of registration statements relating to interests in real estate limited partnerships : requires a summary of the financial performance of any other real estate investment programmes sponsored by the general partner and its affiliates ; <p> Guide 6 - Disclosure concerning unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of property-casualty insurance underwriters : requires disclosure of details of reserves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims and claim adjustment expenses of the issuer , its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries and equity investees exceed 50% of the common stockholders ' equity of the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries ; and <p> Guide 7- Description of property by issuers engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations : requires disclosure of information relating to each of the mines , plants and other significant properties owned or operated ( or intended to be owned or operated ) by the issuer , including location of the property , brief description of the title , claim or lease to the property , a history of previous operations , and a description of the present condition and operations on the property . @qwx115045 <p> Compiling the information required by these industry guides may be a significant undertaking , and the auditors should coordinate with the issuer 's financial and operating management early in the process if an industry guide applies to an offering . <p> ( ii ) Supplemental schedules for certain transactions <p> S-X Rule 5-04 requires a number of supplemental schedules for particular industries and circumstances . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with the registration statement or annual report . The schedules include : <p> Schedule I- Condensed financial information of registrant ( known as " parent-only " financial statements ) : requires condensed balance sheets and statements of income and cash flows on a non-consolidated basis if as of the end of the latest fiscal year the amount of restricted net assets of subsidiaries exceeds 25% of the issuer 's consolidated assets . Restricted net assets are the issuer 's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries ( after inter-company eliminations ) which as of the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans , advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party ( that is , lender , regulatory agency , foreign government etc ) ; 280 <p> Schedule IV- Mortgage loans on real estate : requires real estate operating and investment companies to disclose details of each mortgage loan which accounts for 3% or more of the carrying value of all of the issuer 's mortgages ; and <p> Schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure as to liabilities on property-casualty insurance claims if the issuer , its subsidiaries or 50%-or-less owned equity basis investees have such liabilities . However , the schedule may be omitted if reserves for unpaid property-casualty claims and claims adjustment expenses did not , in the aggregate , exceed 50% of common stockholders ' equity of the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the beginning of the fiscal year . <p> SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC OFFERINGS <p> ( i ) Item 17 and Item 18 <p> Form 20-F provides two levels of financial statement disclosure : Item 17 and Item 18 . Item 18 requires a more thorough adaptation of the financial statements to US Gaap and the requirements of Regulation S-X than does Item 17.281 According to the SEC , the distinction between Items 17 and 18 is based on a classification of the requirements of US Gaap and S-X into those that specify the methods of measuring the amounts shown on the face of the financial statements , and those prescribing disclosures that explain , modify or supplement the accounting measurements.282 Disclosures that are required by US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished for Item 17283 ( although they may need to be disclosed under MD&amp;A ) . <p> Compliance with Item 17 is required for annual reports and for Exchange Act registration statements in connection with listings in the United States , while registration statements under the Securities Act in connection with public securities offerings generally require compliance with Item 18.284 Foreign private issuers may voluntarily report under Item 18 for all of their filings with the SEC. @qwx115045 <p> Many foreign private issuers listing existing securities in the United States comply with the more extensive requirements of Item 18 , even if they have no plans to file a registration statement to sell new securities in the United States in the future . The secondary market and securities analysts generally require the additional information for comparability to other issuers . <p> The following is a list of disclosure items that are often required by Item 18 and therefore necessary to be included in any financial statements contained in a public offering registration statement under the Securities Act : <p> disclosure of unconditional purchase obligations or other commitments and guarantees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shares under option and option price ; <p> description of property , plant and equipment under capital leases ; <p> components of pension expense and description of the plans ; <p> disclosure of related-party transactions , including the monetary value of such transactions ; <p> a schedule of debt repayments over the next five years ; <p> disclosure of possible loss contingencies that have not been recognized in the financial statements ; <p> disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments ; and <p> information on income taxes . <p> In addition , information on sales , assets and operating profit by business segment and geographic area must be provided . <p> ( ii ) Segment reporting <p> Under Item 18 , in addition to all the consolidated financial information required to be included in a registration statement , companies in more than one line of business may also be required to include separate revenues and operating data for each line of business . This requirement is a function of whether the company 's business is comprised of more than one segment . S-X Rule 3-03(e) and Item 101(b) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each segment , as defined by US Gaap . <p> The Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 131 ( SFAS 131 ) , " Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , " provides detailed guidance for when a business constitutes an operating segment and how its discrete financial information must be reported . Generally , an operating segment is a component of a larger enterprise : <p> that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses ( including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same enterprise ) ; <p> whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise 's chief operating decision maker285 to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance ; and <p> for which discrete financial information is available . <p> The aim of segment reporting is to align public financial reporting with a company 's internal reporting in order to permit financial analysts and the public to see the overall enterprise the way management sees it . Whether an issuer considers its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific and often depends on factors such as economic similarity , the similarity of the products or services sold , the nature of the production process , customer type , distribution methods , and the regulatory environment for the business . The determination is very subjective and is often the subject of much discussion with the company 's accountants and , through the SEC comment process , with the SEC . The most critical factor in determining whether an issuer has more than one segment is how management runs its business.286 <p> Once a segment has been identified , the issuer must provide information about the segment if it meets any of the following 10% thresholds : <p> its reported revenue ( including both sales to external customers and intersegment sales ) is 10% or more of the combined revenue ( internal and external ) of all reported operating segments ; <p> the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10% or more of the greater , in absolute amount , of ( 1 ) the combined profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments that did report a loss ; or <p> its assets are 10% or more of the combined assets of all operating segments ; <p> A company with more than one segment in excess of these size requirements must disclose information for each such segment including the revenues from external customers , a measure of profit or loss287 and the total assets attributable to that segment , as well as a reconciliation to the corresponding consolidated amounts . Additional information on items such as equity investments and capital expenditures may be required under SFAS 131 if such amounts are reviewed by the company on a segment basis . For interim periods , disclosure must include revenues , a measure of profit or loss for each segment , reconciliations and material changes to total assets . Financial disclosure for segments will typically be included in the financial statements and be cross-referenced as part of a discussion on operating segments in MD&amp;A.288 The effect of these requirements is to force disclosure of profitability by segment , which many issuers are reluctant to do for competitive reasons . @qwx115045 <p> The identification and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the offering process as the time to prepare such information , the effect on textual disclosure and the impact on enterprise valuation may all be significant . Although the requirement for segment reporting is usually considered only when a company is issuing securities for the first time , the issue should be revisited if the company has entered into new business lines or if management has begun to analyze its business in a new way that may impact the original segment analysis . Because the guidance of SFAS 131 is complex and its application very fact-specific , it is important to begin an early dialogue with the accountants when there may be segment reporting issues . <p> ( iii ) Coverage ratios <p> Under Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K , any registration statement covering debt securities must include the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and any registration statement covering preferred stock must include the ratio of combined fixed charges and preference dividends to earnings . Coverage ratios must be included for each of the last five fiscal years and for any interim periods presented . If the proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to repay outstanding debt or to retire other securities and the change in the ratio would be 10% or greater , a pro forma ratio must be included for the most recent fiscal year and the latest interim period presented . <p> ( iv ) Financial statements for secured offerings <p> S-X Rule 3-16 generally requires separate audited and interim financial statements for an issuer 's affiliate if the securities of that affiliate are pledged as collateral for the offering and those securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for the securities being registered . Securities of the affiliate are deemed to constitute a substantial portion of the collateral if the aggregate principal amount , par value , or book value of the pledged securities ( as carried by the issuer ) , or the market value of the pledged securities , whichever is the greatest , equals 20% or more of the principal amount of the securities that are being secured . <p> If this test is met , the affiliate must file the same financial statements that it would be required to file if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need to be filed if they are otherwise separately included ( which may be through incorporation by reference , if incorporation is otherwise permitted ) in the filing individually or consolidated with the affiliate 's subsidiaries . <p> ( v ) Other customary information <p> In addition to the formal requirements of Form 20-F and Regulation S-X , it is customary in a public offering to include certain other information in the registration statement that may be material or convenient for investors in considering the financial condition of the issuer . <p> SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA <p> A page of summary financial data is routinely included in the summary box of the registration statement . Although there are no specific line item requirements for this key marketing page , it usually contains income statement , balance sheet , and other financial data for the last three to five fiscal years and the most recent interim period ( as well as the comparable interim period in the prior year ) similar to that required on the " Selected financial data " page appearing later in the disclosure document . Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heading such as " Other financial data . " These metrics will vary with the type of issuer ( for example , comparable store sales for a retailer , capital expenditures for a manufacturer , or subscriber numbers for a cable television company ) .289 <p> RECENT RESULTS <p> Item 8B of Form 20-F requires disclosure of whether or not any significant change has occurred since the date of the annual financial statements , or since the date of the most recent interim financial statements included in the document.290 The registration statement must also be updated to include any audited or interim financials that become available before the anticipated effective date.291 That information need not be reconciled to US Gaap , although a narrative disclosure about differences in accounting principles is required and material reconciling items that have not been previously addressed in the filing must be quantified.292 Comparative prior periods are not required.293 <p> Whether or not recent results are required in the registration statement , it may also be desirable from a marketing perspective to include a summary of recent financial results in the summary box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisable to include recent results disclosure to avoid any negative surprises for investors when the full quarterly ( or semi-annual ) numbers become available . For example , the issuer may be aware that its sales are trending down in the current quarter , or that significant charges will be taken in connection with an acquisition after it closes . Even if analysts may be anticipating such an event , it is preferable to disclose this information in the registration statement itself to avoid a risk of future litigation . At the roadshow meetings , prospective investors will be asking about the results for a quarter or six-month period just or almost completed and presenting information in the offering document will facilitate a discussion of these results.294 <p> RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS <p> To the extent material , the likely consequences of material recent developments may also be disclosed in the summary box or the MD&amp;A . For example , it is customary to discuss a material recent or proposed acquisition in the MD&amp;A section of the offering document , whether or not audited financials of the acquired or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often result in a discussion of the impact of pending or recent acquisitions on margins , debt levels etc , in a section of the MD&amp;A labeled " Overview " or " Impact of the acquisition " or a similar title . The textual disclosure may include a discussion of any special charges or anticipated synergies expected to result from the acquisition or other pending event . <p> SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN UNREGISTERED TRANSACTIONS <p> As noted above , unregistered transactions do not require the filing of a registration statement or a reconciliation to US Gaap . And unregistered transactions impose few ( if any ) specific financial information requirements . For example , Regulation S has no financial statement requirements at all , while Rule 144A has only very modest financial information requirements . It is hence not possible to provide a precise answer to the question of what financial statements must be included in an unregistered transaction . <p> Foreign private issuers tend to take a flexible approach to financial statements in unregistered transactions depending on a variety of factors , including the type of transaction , local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations and other marketing issues . For example , in the case of debt offerings which are intended to be followed in a matter of weeks by a registered exchange offer , buyers of the offered securities will receive full Securities Act disclosure shortly after the closing . Most practitioners accordingly elect to provide substantially the same disclosure to prospective purchasers before the closing whenever possible . In other instances , unregistered transactions have excluded a good deal of the finer elements of the financial information requirements , such as some of the details of the required guarantor footnotes described above and some of the details of executive compensation . <p> The bedrock principle is that the financial information provided to investors in the United States must meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 . In other words , the financial information must not misstate material facts or an omit material facts needed to make the included information not misleading . 
@@8538064 @1738064/ <h> 1 . Overview of FDI in the jurisdiction <h> 1.1 Which countries are the principal sources of FDI into your jurisdiction ? <p> In recent years , the most important sources of FDI in Brazil have been the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , China , Germany , Japan and France . The total investment received by Brazil in 2012 was around $65 billion . <h> 1.2 What are the key sectors in your jurisdiction which attract , or the government is seeking to attract , FDI ? <p> The Brazilian government has implemented several official programmes over the last few years to foster specific sectors of the national infrastructure . It has set up public auctions for the management of airports , ports , roads and railways by private companies . Recent discoveries of huge deposits of oil on the Brazilian coast will require investment in infrastructure , the naval industry , oil refinery and professional education . Further , major international events to be held in Brazil such as the Fifa World Cup and Olympic Games , in 2014 and 2016 respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , security and hotels . <h> 1.3 Is the government generally supportive of FDI ? Which government , and regional , bodies are responsible for driving FDI in your jurisdiction ? <p> The Brazilian economy is receptive to FDI , which is demonstrated by the steady growth of foreign investments in the country and a modern legislation that guarantees reliability and safety to investors . The central bank issues rules on the formalities that must be complied with regarding FDI . In addition , the Ministry of Development is in charge of enhancing foreign trade through customs regulations . <h> 2.1 Investment vehicle <h> 2.1 What are the most common legal entities and pass-through vehicles used for FDI in your jurisdiction , and how long do they take to become operational ? <p> Brazilian law offers several kinds of entities to run a business . The most popular ones are the limited liability company ( Limitada ) and the corporation ( An(nima) . The shareholders of these companies enjoy limited liability and , therefore , do not have their personal assets exposed to occasional failures of the business ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The Limitada provides for a more flexible operation , with fewer administrative burdens , which makes it suited to less complex businesses . On the other hand , the An ( nima is regulated by more complex and rigid rules of management and operation , and is recommended for more intricate enterprises . The An ( nima may also be used to gather funds from a wide range of investors when registered as a publicly-held company with the Brazilian Securities Commission ( CVM ) . However , both entities may be used for small or big businesses , regardless of the amounts involved . <p> These companies usually require 30 days to be created . <h> 2.2 What are the key requirements for establishment and operation of these vehicles which are relevant to FDI ? <p> The creation and operation of companies controlled by foreigners do not generally differ from the ones controlled by Brazilian citizens , as Brazilian law prohibits any kind of discrimination related to the origin of the capital . <p> The officer of any Brazilian company must be resident in Brazil . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must apply for their permanent visa . To do this , the foreign shareholders need to invest R$600,000 ( $258,300 ) for each officer . This amount may be lowered to R$150,000 if the company creates at least 10 new jobs within the following two years . <p> Any investment in a Brazilian company must be made through the execution of exchange agreements in order to allow the proper banking transfer and its registration with the Brazilian central bank . <h> 3 . Investment approval <p> a ) The regulator/s ' name , factors it must consider when making its decisions , and how much discretion it has ; <p> b ) Any investment caps and other legislative restrictions ; <p> c ) Which party must notify and when/if notification is mandatory or voluntary ; <p> d ) What information must be included with notification and what is the review fee ; <p> e ) How long does the review and approval process take , and are there any fast-track options ; <p> f ) Is there the ability to consult on a named or unnamed basis ; <p> g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any pre- or post filing requirements unique to FDI ; <p> h ) What is the position if no response is received on an application for approval and are there any rights of appeal from disapprovals ? <p> Brazilian law provides that foreign capital is subject to the same regulations applicable to national capital . Therefore , due to the free inflow and outflow of proceeds , no approval is required for foreign investments regarding exchange issues . Any foreign investment must be registered with the Central Bank in a declaratory fashion . <h> 3.2 Briefly explain the investment restrictions for any special/restricted sectors . <p> Foreign investment is generally allowed in Brazil , and no specific authorisation from the Government is required . <p> There are a few exceptions : <p> Foreign capital is not allowed in nuclear energy activities . <p> Foreign capital is not allowed in health care services , except when specifically permitted by law . <p> Foreign capital is not allowed in post office services . <p> Foreign participation is limited to 30% in Brazilian press and broadcasting companies . <p> Opening of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation of foreign individuals or legal entities in the corporate capital of Brazilian financial institutions are prohibited , except when specifically authorised by the Brazilian President . <p> Foreign participation in voting shares is limited to 20% in Brazilian airline companies and depends on prior approval from the Civil Aviation Agency ( although the constitutionality of this limitation is subject to debate ) . <p> Acquisition of rural properties within the border strip ( 150km alongside inland borders ) depends on prior approval from the National Security Council . <p> Acquisition of other rural properties is subject to certain conditions and limitations . <p> Regardless of whether foreign investors are involved or not , activities in various regulated sectors will be subject to specific rules and conditions , including approvals and supervision by the relevant regulatory agency ( for example , insurance , telecommunications , energy , oil and gas , water and sanitation ) . <p> The authority responsible for overseeing competition clearance is the Administrative Council for Economic Defence ( CADE ) which analyses material M&amp;A cases that may jeopardise competition . The submission of an operation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition precedent in M&amp;A operations , is mandatory in the event that one of the companies involved has achieved revenues of at least R$750 million in the previous year , and the other company has achieved at least R$75 million . Upon the submission , CADE will render its decision in 240 days , extendable for 90 additional days . <h> 4 . Tax and grants <h> 4.1 Are there tax structures and/or favourable intermediary tax jurisdictions that are particularly useful for FDI into the country ? <p> Brazil exempts dividend income , even if earned by foreign investors . Therefore , it is uncommon to find tax structures that are more favourable for FDI into Brazil than a simple contribution to capital . <p> Some double taxation treaties provide for a tax-sparing credit in connection with dividends , interest and royalties , particularly the treaties with European countries , such as the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg and Spain . Thus , depending on the investment structure , such treaties may be favourable . <p> As to debt financing , interest expenses are deductible for corporate income tax ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as detailed below . Interest income is subject to a 15% withholding tax ( IRRF ) and to transfer pricing ( usually Libor London Interbank Offered Rate plus 3.5% spread ) . Payments to blacklisted jurisdictions are subject to IRRF at a 25% rate . Thin capitalisation limitations also apply at a 2:1 ratio ( 0.33:1 ratio if the beneficiary is located in a blacklisted jurisdiction ) . <p> Short-term foreign loans are also subject to IOF/FX , at a six percent rate . If the term of the loan is superior to 360 days , principal and interest payments are subject to zero percent rate IOF/FX . <p> There are 30 double taxation treaties in force . Brazil has not ratified any bilateral investment treaties to date . <h> 4.2 What are the applicable corporate tax rates ? <p> The corporate tax rates vary according to the profit calculation regime elected by companies incorporated in Brazil . If the companies are obliged to report their income under the Actual Profits regime ( with an annual revenue of more than R$78 million or with any foreign income earned throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) rate is 15% , plus 10% on any amount of the profits exceeding R$20,000 , multiplied for the months of the taxable period . Also , the profits are subject to the social contribution on net profits ( CSLL ) at a rate of nine percent ( except for financial institutions , which are subject to a CSLL of 15% ) . In addition , Brazilian companies under the Actual Profits regime are subject to the non-cumulative social contributions on total revenues ( PIS and COFINS ) , which total a creditable rate of 9.25% on the corporate gross revenue for the taxable period . <p> If the Brazilian company chooses to be under the Presumed Profits regime ( with an annual revenue of R$78 million or less ) , its profit margins are statutory , and they range from 8% to 32% depending on the category of earned income . On this statutory basis , the applicable IRPJ rate is 15% , plus 10% on any amount of the profits exceeding R$20,000 multiplied for the months of the taxable period . Also , a statutory basis of 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of CSLL , which is imposed at a rate of 9% . Brazilian companies under the Presumed Profits regime are also subject to the cumulative PIS and COFINS , which total a non-creditable rate of 3.65% on the corporate gross revenue for the taxable period . <p> If , however , the Brazilian company is qualified as a small enterprise , it may be eligible for reporting its profits under the Simplified Regime ( Simples ) . The IRPJ , CSLL , PIS and COFINS rates for this regime vary between zero and 1.6% . <p> Brazilian companies in the Actual and Presumed regimes are subject to a tax for severance indemnity fund ( FGTS ) of 8% and to a payroll tax ( INSS ) of 20% . In Simples , while the FGTS rate remains at 8% , the INSS rate is reduced to 4.6%. <h> 4.3 Does the government have any FDI tax incentive schemes in place ? <p> There are several tax incentives in Brazil , depending on the industry and location of the investment , such as the Manaus Free Trade Zone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automotive industry . <p> Aside from such incentives , states and municipalities will usually provide value-added tax ( ICMS ) and services tax ( ISSQN ) incentives for FDI in the fields of energy , logistics and transportation . These incentives have become more widespread due to the preparation of Brazil for the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016. <h> 4.4 Other than through the tax system , does the government provide any other financial support to FDI investors ? <p> The Brazilian Development Bank ( BNDES ) provides some benefits to Brazilian companies , but most of such benefits are directed to Brazilian-owned investments . States may also provide financial incentives , especially if the investment is relevant for the public interest and generates local jobs and income . Municipalities also provide such incentives . Please note that they are limited by their budgetary constraints . <h> 5 . Operating locally <h> 5.1 What is the most common governing law of contracts and local business language ? <p> Brazilian law is used in agreements between Brazilian parties ( even if they are controlled by foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and location of the parties usually determines the selection of governing law ( for example New York law , English law ) . Negotiations involving foreign parties are normally carried out in English . <h> 5.2 Explain any local content or local participation requirements relevant to foreign investors . <p> As a general rule , no local content or local participation requirements apply , except in specific cases and industries when provided by law ( for instance , local content rules in certain oil and gas activities and local participation in airport management ) . <h> 5.3 How difficult is it for foreign investors to secure expatriate visas for shareholder representatives and workers ? <p> The issuance of visas by the Ministry of Labour ( MTE ) usually takes 60 days . Business visas allow a 90-day stay in Brazil per year for the purpose of representation of foreign shareholders . There are also specific work visas for temporary purposes , such as for the rendering of services and technical assistance . <p> There are no foreign currency or exchange restrictions applicable to the Brazilian currency ( Real : R$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from doing business in any foreign jurisdictions ? <p> Brazilian companies are free to carry on business in foreign jurisdictions. <h> 6 . Legal and regulatory framework <h> 6.1 Are there any other FDI-specific laws that foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> No <h> 6.2 What challenges if any do investors find in getting certainty around local law and regulation ? <p> Local laws and regulations are generally stable and well known , although their interpretation may be subject to heated debate , and court decisions may vary accordingly . <h> 7 . Dispute resolution <h> 7.1 How efficient are local courts ' enforcement and dispute resolution proceedings , and are there any procedural idiosyncrasies foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> Brazil has not ratified any bilateral or multilateral investment treaties , so foreign investors may not commence investment-treaty arbitrations against the state . <p> On the other hand , commercial arbitration , both domestic and international , has become widespread , and is now an efficient dispute resolution mechanism for contracts of higher value or complexity . <p> For disputes subject to resolution before judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legality , a final , enforceable , decision may take years to be obtained , being subject to a plethora of appeals and reviews . <h> 7.2 Do the courts of the FDI jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> Brazil is party to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards <p> Foreign judgments ( including foreign arbitral awards ) become effective in Brazil solely on confirmation by the Superior Court of Justice . The confirmation proceeding does not entail a review of the merits of the decision , since its purpose , among others , is to ensure that formal aspects were observed , that the party against whom an award is being enforced had been granted a full right of defence , and that no fraud or violation of Brazilian law has occurred throughout the proceedings . <h> 7.3 Are judgments and arbitration awards from the FDI jurisdiction generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> Brazil 's membership of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards affords Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Convention member states as foreign awards do in Brazil . <p> Moreover , Brazil is party to several multilateral and bilateral treaties on the recognition of foreign judgments and administrative acts , including , among others , the OAS Inter-American Convention on the Extraterritorial Validity of Foreign Judgments and Arbitral Awards and the Mercosur Protocol on Jurisdictional Assistance and Cooperation Regarding Civil , Commercial , Labor and Administrative Matters . <p> Darcy Teixeira Junior assists domestic and international clients from various industries through his work as partner in the corporate law and mergers and acquisitions practice groups at TozziniFreire Advogados .

This is in addition to the seven-year investment promotion strategy ( 2015 to 2021 ) announced on December 3 2014 , which introduced new incentives for investments both within Thailand and overseas .

But this did n't impede the final approval which makes Telef=nica Deutschland/E-Plus a landmark decision , and not just for the sector . <p> " It was the first four to three consolidation in a large member state and in the most important national industry in Europe , " said Michael Bauer , Brussels-based partner with CMS Hasche Sigle which advised Telefonica Deutschland . " It 's now very difficult , for the Commission or national authorities , to block a four to three consolidation . " <p> A common argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , but at least four are needed for a larger market " like Germany 's . Yet the only other three to four deal in European telecoms - Hutchison Whampoa 's EC-approved takeover of Orange in 2012 " did lead to price rises in Austria 's mobile industry . <p> " After that , the Commission was criticised by various sources and so we knew from the beginning that it would not use the Austrian decision as a blueprint , " said Bauer . " It made it clear from the beginning that it would be complicated . " <p> Remedies precedent <p> Given the size of the German market , it is difficult for the EC to impose a more stringent standard in other member states . Attune to this , other media companies are now understood to have started talks elsewhere in Europe . <h> It 's now very difficult , for the Commission or national authorities , to block a four to three consolidation <p> In addition to the three to four precedent , the remedy package also sets a benchmark for European mergers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early October 2013 , the case team conducted an intense nine-month investigation before announcing its conditional clearance on July 2 2014 . <p> The remedy package included two post-deal commitments , and an upfront requirement which had to be satisfied before final approval . The pre-completion remedy was to sell 30% of the combined company 's network capacity to up to three mobile virtual network operators ( MVNO ) . <p> MVNOs provide mobile services , but they lease rather than own their own their networks . The condition 's rationale is to promote the presence of MVNOs which will compete with the combined company . <p> It took three months of difficult and detailed discussions involving the monitoring trustee to satisfy the condition and secure final EC approval . <p> The monitoring trustee is a person approved by the EC to investigate whether the merging parties ' proposal to satisfy an upfront remedy is satisfactory . In Telefonica/E-Plus , that process took two months , which is longer than expected , and involved heavy scrutiny of the deal with the MVNOs . <p> " The trustee report is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the trustees have ever prepared , " said Bauer . <p> Commission criticisms <p> Despite the outcome , Bauer has queried some of the Commission 's processes during the approval process . Like in other large mergers , the parties supported their case by claiming the merger will improve efficiencies in the market . <p> While the EC undertook an extremely detailed economic analysis of the efficiencies in this deal , Bauer believes this is an area in which the regulator must improve . " In difficult cases , more and more parties are trying to make this argument . But the Commission is still very reluctant to accept it , and I believe it still does not have a convincing set of criteria of when they will accept efficiencies , " he said . <p> " Based on the existing criteria they may in fact always deny efficiencies which should not be the idea of this concept .

But the EC refused . <h> I believe it still does not have a convincing set of criteria of when they will accept efficiencies <p> Bundeskartellamt president Andreas Mundt believes the EC 's conditions do not eliminate the competition concerns raised by the merger . <p> " This will certainly make for a very interesting field experiment in Germany , " he said in an emailed statement , querying whether tariffs will increase and the merged entity will invest in network expansion . <p> " In any case it is also interesting here that the US regulation authorities are steadfastly trying to prevent the reduction of four national mobile operators in the US to only three in future , " he added . <p> Financing <p> The 8.55 billion ( $10.9 billion ) merger was financed by bank facilities and a $4.7 billion rights issue by Telefonica Deutschland . <p> To ensure its parent Telefonica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with KPN , it fully subscribed to its rights under the issuance . <p> Given its size , the deal had to be ready to hit the market whenever there was a proper window , while also being coordinated with the merger approvals . <p> Capital market fundraisings for large acquisitions with completion uncertainty can create sensitivities around scoping and diligencing of a target which the issuer does not yet own . <p> There are questions around how to describe the company and address its financials in the prospectus . There are also issues around how much confidential and price-sensitive information can be shared with a competitor pre-merger , given competition law considerations and commercial ramifications if the combination does n't close . <p> Deal counsel said this was one of the rights issue 's major hurdles . <p> " It 's always a challenge to balance the release of information and what goes into the prospectus , " said CMS 's Daniel Winterfeldt , who advised the issuer .

@@8538074 @1738074/ <h> How to buy a Japanese company <h> Author : Published : 28 Jan 2003 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> For foreign buyers , acquiring a Japanese company - like much in Japan - is a process that can be both very familiar and very strange . <p> Acquisition structure <p> OptionsThere are at least four basic ways for a foreign buyer to acquire a Japanese company : ( i ) share sale ; ( ii ) merger ; ( iii ) asset sale ; or ( iv ) business transfer . Western investors would probably not distinguish between an asset sale and a business transfer , but in Japan they are considered different transaction structures . The pros and cons of each of the four structures are not much different in Japan . <p> Share saleThe buyer acquires the shares of the target company . This is a simpler transaction than either a business transfer or asset sale . Because the target company is acquired , the buyer inherits all assets and liabilities of the company . The buyer can not pick and choose among the assets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . When the buyer wants the employees this is fine , but when the buyer does not , termination of employees will be a delicate issue . <p> MergerIf the buyer already has a Japanese subsidiary , it can be merged with the target company . Both must be Japanese companies ; a Japanese company can not merge with a foreign company . Either company can be the surviving entity , except that the disappearing company can not have a negative net worth . Public notice is required by statute . <p> Asset saleThe buyer acquires assets of the target company . This is a more complex transaction but allows the buyer to acquire only desired assets without inheriting liabilities . The buyer may also avoid hiring employees of the seller that it does not want . There is no statutory notice requirement to shareholders or creditors . <p> Business transferIn a business transfer , the buyer acquires the target business from the seller . Under both the Commercial Code and court precedent , " a business " ( eigyo ) is defined as all or a substantial part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business purpose . The principal difference of a business transfer from an asset sale is that in the case of a business transfer the buyer typically acquires all assets , liabilities , employees and goodwill of the target business . The business transfer structure is flexible in terms of inclusion or exclusion of assets , liabilities , contracts and other elements of the business to be transferred . This structure was typically used when the buyer wanted to acquire a division of a Japanese company , but spin-offs ( kaisha bunkatsu ) have recently become feasible as another ( and often preferable ) structure for acquisition of a division . There is no statutory notice requirement to shareholders or creditors . <p> Corporate authorizationThe requisite corporate authorization for the transaction differs with the form of the transaction . <p> Share saleAlmost all private Japanese companies have a provision in their articles of incorporation requiring approval of the board of directors for transfer of shares . This means that the board of the target company must approve the acquisition , in addition to the board of the seller . In Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . When the shareholders have decided to sell , the management of the target company usually follows the will of the shareholders , but the theoretical risk exists that management could refuse to approve the share sale and block the transaction . <p> MergerWith minor exceptions , approval by the board of directors and two-thirds shareholder approval is required for both the Japanese acquisition entity and target company . Objecting shareholders of the disappearing company have the right to receive the fair market value of their shares in cash rather than accept shares of the surviving company . Objecting creditors of the disappearing company have the right to receive payment of their accounts receivable . However , these rights are rarely exercised in practice . <p> Asset saleEven if the assets represent all or substantially all of the assets of the selling company , approval by the board of directors of the seller is sufficient , provided the assets do not constitute a business . Neither shareholders nor creditors have statutory objection rights to an asset sale for fair market value ( although they may have contractual consent rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business transfer are more stringent than for an asset sale . In a business transfer , if the business transferred represents all of the business of the selling company , then approval by the board of directors and two-thirds shareholder approval is required for both the Japanese seller and the buyer . If the transferred business represents only a substantial part of the business of the seller , but the transaction is still a business transfer rather than an asset sale , then approval by the board of directors and two-thirds shareholder approval by the Japanese seller ( but not the buyer ) is required . Finally , if the business transferred represents less than a substantial part of the business of the seller , board approval is sufficient for both seller and buyer . The seller must purchase the shares of its objecting shareholders at fair market value , but creditors of the transferred business do not have statutory objection rights ( they may still have consent rights by contract ) . <p> Choice of acquisition vehicleA share sale provides the most flexibility when choosing an acquisition vehicle because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign company . To acquire a Japanese business by means of business transfer or asset sale , usually the buyer must create or already have a Japanese company that can acquire and operate the business . Although theoretically a branch of a foreign company registered in Japan may also serve as the purchaser , tax and employment issues make it impractical for most businesses in Japan to operate as a branch office . Moreover , Japanese customers and employees often wish to deal directly with a Japanese entity , as a foreign company branch office can give the impression of only a temporary foray into the Japanese market . <p> If a Japanese company is the acquisition entity , and if the acquisition is a share sale , asset sale or business transfer , there is a procedural obstacle if the buyer 's entity is less than two years old . Under the Japanese Commercial Code , if a Japanese company acquires assets for more than 5% of its paid-in capital within two years after its incorporation , and these assets existed at the time of its incorporation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must follow a cumbersome court-supervised valuation procedure . Failure to follow the court procedure means the sale is void . The valuation procedure involves appointment of a third party to review the value of the transferred assets/business and then report to the court . The procedure can take between two and four months , and there is no guarantee that the appraiser will agree with the price negotiated by the parties . This results in delay and uncertainty about whether and when the sale as negotiated can be consummated . <p> It is simple to avoid this obstacle in a share sale transaction because a foreign entity can be used as the acquisition entity . However , in a business transfer or asset sale where the acquisition entity usually must be a Japanese company , buyers are often forced to locate and acquire a Japanese company that is more than two years old to use as the acquisition entity . Finding a dormant , clean entity can be an impediment to the transaction . The Commercial Code restrictions will be relaxed in April 2003 , but this structural issue will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Government filing requirementsGovernment filing requirements may be triggered by the acquisition , depending on the size , form and substance of the acquisition . For example , if a foreign buyer owns substantial assets in Japan directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries or branch offices , a filing with the Japan Fair Trade Commission may be triggered . Another example is that foreign investments in certain industries such as broadcasting and telecommunications may require an advance filing with the Bank of Japan . It is important for foreign buyers to examine in advance whether governmental filings may be triggered by the transaction . <p> Pre-packaged bankruptcy structuresIn the current economy , many acquisitions involve distressed or insolvent Japanese companies . Buyers often want the assets but not the liabilities , and often wish to select the employees they will hire . But there are several impediments to accomplishing these goals . For example , even after transferring assets or an entire business , the seller may continue to have the obligation to retain the employees . Moreover , existing creditors may not permit the seller to transfer assets ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To overcome these obstacles , pre-packaged bankruptcy structures are beginning to emerge . The most promising is the newly adopted corporate reorganization ( minji saisei ) procedure . Under fast-track procedures informally adopted by the Tokyo District court , it is possible for a private company to file for corporate reorganization and obtain court approval for a pre-negotiated sale of assets or a business within a timeframe of as little as one month , assuming no significant creditor objections arise . The buyer and seller can agree on which assets will transfer , and the buyer can make employment offers to only the desired employees . Contracts , however , can not be transferred without the consent of the counterparty , unless the contracts authorize such transfer without consent . The seller 's creditors are left to share in the sale proceeds and whatever is left of the seller 's assets . It remains to be seen whether creditors will begin to more actively assert their rights in these informal , fast track proceedings . <p> Tender offersWhenever the target is a publicly traded Japanese company , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting company for securities regulation purposes in Japan , the tender offer rules may be triggered . <p> Due diligence <p> Most Japanese target companies have had no experience with legal due diligence . Often , the assumption is that due diligence means only financial due diligence , and no thought has been given to legal issues . The reaction of target companies to legal due diligence requests has ranged from cooperation to an emotional refusal to disclose , even when the acquisition is friendly . <p> How the request for legal due diligence is made is important . It can be helpful to explain why legal due diligence is necessary , the buyer 's confidentiality commitment , and the benefit to the seller from disclosure of known legal issues . To ensure the target personnel understand what documents are sought , the document request itself should be in Japanese ( or bilingual format ) . Once the target personnel understand the need for legal due diligence , and are comfortable with the confidentiality arrangements , cooperation from private Japanese companies tends to be good . Experiences with public companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence must be determined for each target company and type of acquisition . There are generally three levels : <p> All Japanese companies are required to register certain corporate information with their local Legal Affairs Bureau . These records ( tokibo ) are available for public inspection . The public data includes the names and terms of the directors , securities ( including stock options ) issued by the company , and amount of paid-in capital . In addition , securities filings by Japanese companies that are either publicly traded or are reporting companies for securities regulation purposes are available from certain government offices and bookstores . Electronic filing of securities reports is not yet required , but there is an online source called EDINET LONG ... where certain filings can be obtained . <p> Well-organized Japanese companies will have numerous internal regulations that are binding on the company , its employees and shareholders . Important regulations that should be reviewed before acquiring a Japanese company include : ( i ) Board of Directors Regulations ( torishimariyakukai kisoku ) ; ( ii ) Work Rules ( shugyo kisoku ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitei ) ; and ( iv ) Share Handling Regulations ( kabushiki atsukai kitei ) . <p> Several years ago , when acquisitions of Japanese companies were still rare , target companies would sometimes refuse to provide any due diligence access to their records on the grounds that the Commercial Code grants certain limited information rights to shareholders , and therefore outsiders could not legally be granted access even to such limited information . This was a serious obstacle previously , but the theory seems to have weakened in the face of market forces and the practical need to complete transactions . <p> Employment issues <p> Foreign buyers often plan to reduce headcount at the target company to improve earnings . Legal protection for employees , however , remains high in Japan , and the standards for termination of redundant employees are almost impossibly high for an acquirer . As a result , where the buyer does not want to retain all of the employees , employment issues may become the most difficult aspect of the transaction . <p> Removal of directorsThe first thing a buyer will often do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors with its own personnel . The legal status of director and employee are distinct in Japan . Usually directors of Japanese companies have two-year terms . A director is not a protected employee and can be removed from office by a two-thirds shareholder vote at any time . If removed without cause , however , there is some legal authority stating that the director can claim as damages his/her salary for the remainder of the term . In addition , the director will be entitled to severance compensation in accordance with the Director 's Retirement Regulations of the target company . <p> Transfer of employeesIn a share sale transaction , the shareholder changes but the employees remain employed by the target company . If the buyer wants the business but not the employees , this can be a serious drawback to the share sale structure . <p> In the case of a business transfer , individual employee consent is required to transfer the employee to the buyer . If the employee will not agree to the transfer , the seller must find other employment for the employee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employment is not considered grounds for dismissal of the rejecting employee . <p> The case where the buyer does want the employees and the seller is insolvent presents a different problem . The business transfer structure is problematic because there is some legal authority finding that former employees of the transferred business have an implied right to continue their employment with the buyer . Care must be taken to avoid this result . <p> The case where the buyer wants the business and wants to retain all of the employees is easier , especially if the transaction is structured as a share sale , since that structure does not require employee consent . If the transaction is a business transfer , however , there is uncertainty as to whether key employees will consent to the transfer , especially if , as often happens , the work rules or pension benefits of the buyer differ from those of the seller . Negotiations are necessary with each key employee . This uncertainty can be an obstacle to the transaction . <p> In the case where the buyer does not want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the business transfer or asset sale structures work well since they allow the seller to transfer only the assets and goodwill of the business without transfer of employees . <p> Change of working conditions and benefitsJapanese companies with more than 10 employees are required to maintain detailed Work Rules that spell out the working conditions and benefits of the employees . The Work Rules are adopted by the company , and are legally binding on the company and the employees . <p> In a share sale , the buyer will inherit the Work Rules of the company , for better or worse . In a business transfer or asset sale acquisition where the employees transfer to the buyer , they become subject to the buyer 's Work Rules . However , it may be difficult to obtain their consent to the transfer if the buyer 's Work Rules are worse for the employees than the seller 's Work Rules . The seller may have to compensate employees to gain their consent to transfer to the buyer . <p> PensionsThere are several forms of pensions in Japan , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one type of pension . Although there have been recent changes to allow portable pensions , Japanese company pensions are generally not yet portable . <p> As a result , in the case of a business transfer or asset sale , the seller may be obligated to pay out the transferring employee 's accrued pension benefit at the time of the transaction . It is also rare to see Work Rule provisions allowing new employees to have grandfathered seniority , and therefore the employee may be required to restart seniority with the buyer .

While some market observers suggest that a recovery is under way , emiratisation programmes remain a key government priority . Emiratisation is typically seen in governmental or quasi-governmental entities , such as government ministries or state-owned banks . <p> On November 29 2010 the Ministry of Labour released Ministerial Resolution 1187 of 2010 ( MR 1187 ) , which represents an effort to increase the participation of UAE nationals in private sector professional roles . <p> MR 1187 provides a carrot-and-stick approach to a number of labour market initiatives put forward by the Ministry of Labour in recent years . In addition to setting forth penalties and black points for violations of labour regulations , MR 1187 provides an incentive for private sector emiratisation by reducing the bank guarantees companies are required to provide for sponsored employees . <p> In brief , MR 1187 classifies companies into three classes based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ) has a workforce comprised of at least 20% " professional employees " ; ( ii ) meets the minimum wage requirements for each of the three types of professional employees ( as defined by the Ministry of Labour ) ; and ( iii ) employs not less than 15% UAE nationals in its professional staff . The Emirati employees must also be registered in the state-run pension and social security programmes . <p> Class 2 organisations are divided into three sub-categories based on the level of " cultural diversity " of the staff . A company whose level of non-compliance with cultural diversity standards is ( i ) less than 25% falls in Class 2A ; ( ii ) between 25% and 50% falls in Class 2B ; and ( iii ) greater than 50% falls in Class 2C .

In addition to stipulating the applicable fines , companies violating UAE labour regulations , such as failing to implement the UAE 's Wage Protection System or violating the midday work ban , receive black points that can result in the reduction of a company 's rating . Certain offences , such as making a false emiratisation claim , providing substandard employee accommodation or committing human trafficking offences will result in a company being immediately relegated into Class 3 . <p> MR 1187 is designed to work in concert with Cabinet Resolution 26 of 2010 ( CR 26 ) which regulates company classification and bank guarantees that a company must deposit with the Ministry of Labour with respect to its employees . <p> Class 1 firms are exempted from providing bank guarantees , while all other classes must post Dhs3,000 ( $817 ) per employee , to a maximum of Dhs1.5 million for Class 2A ; Dhs3 million for Class 2B ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class 3 . For a large organisation , a higher class rating can result in a significant reduction in the bank guarantee requirement . <p> Emiratisation programmes in the private sector are often impractical and difficult to implement . However , the approach to emiratisation in MR 1187 and CR 26 is more business friendly than the government mandated employment of nationals elsewhere in the Gulf region . <p> It remains to be seen how effective MR 1187 will be in achieving the Ministry of Labour 's stated objective of increasing professional jobs available to UAE nationals or in increasing regulatory compliance by UAE companies .

Along with a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 21% , the most important changes concerned taxes on dividends , to be implemented progressively beginning January 1 2017 . <p> While Slovakia is re-introducing dividend tax after more than 12 years , health insurance contributions will no longer be payable on dividends paid out from profits generated for tax periods from January 1 2017 onwards . <p> In terms of changes in tax legislation , dividends may be divided into two categories : ( i ) dividends on profits generated after January 1 2017 ( new dividends ) ; and , ( ii ) dividends on profits generated between 2004 and 2016 but paid out after January 1 2017 . <p> The first category concerns dividends paid on profits generated in tax periods beginning after January 1 2017 . The amended legislation lays down two different rates for these dividends , either seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether the taxable person is ( i ) a natural person or legal person ; and , ( ii ) whether the taxable party is resident in a contracting state or a non-contracting state . A contracting state is a state with which the Slovak Republic has concluded a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation or an agreement on the exchange of tax information . <p> Lenka Paluchov <p> Byung Sung Park <p> Rudolf Sivk <p> The seven percent tax rate is applied to dividends paid to natural persons who are tax residents in the Slovak Republic or tax residents in a contracting state . This would apply , for instance , to dividends paid by a company that is a tax resident in Slovakia to a shareholder who is a natural person tax resident in Slovakia or the UK ( as a contracting state ) . <p> Dividends paid to legal persons are generally not taxed , except where the dividends are paid ( i ) by a Slovak tax resident to a tax resident of a non-contracting state , or vice versa ( ii ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax resident . In these cases , even legal persons as recipients of dividends are subject to dividend tax at the rate of 35% . If dividends are paid by a tax resident company in Slovakia to a tax resident of Belize , the dividends are taxed at 35% regardless of whether the latter resident is a legal person or natural person . This is because Slovakia has not concluded a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation or an agreement on exchange of tax information with Belize . The 35% rate is also applicable where the payer of the dividends is a tax resident in a non-contracting state " again , Belize , for example " and the dividends are paid to a tax resident in Slovakia ( once again without any differentiation between legal and natural persons ) . <p> The amendment reduces the paperwork burden for dividend recipients not resident in Slovakia who receive dividends from a Slovak tax resident . These recipients will not have to file a tax return in Slovakia , as tax on the dividends will be withheld by the Slovak dividend payer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident in Slovakia ( Slovak companies ) will pay dividends to recipients net of taxes . <p> Since concluded international treaties take precedence over national law , in cases where there is a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation between states , the dividends will be taxed under the regime governed by that agreement , regardless of Slovak legislation . <p> The second category of dividends , on profits generated between 2004 and 2016 that will be paid out after January 1 2017 , is subject to the legislation in effect at the end of 2016 . This means that these dividends will not be taxed , but in some cases may be subject to payment of health insurance contributions . For the sake of entirety , dividends on profits generated : ( i ) between 2004 and 2010 are not subject to any health insurance contributions ; ( ii ) between 2011 and 2012 are subject to health insurance contributions of 10% ; and , ( iii ) between 2013 and 2016 are subject to health insurance contributions of 14% . Health insurance contributions are calculated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the amount on which these contributions must be paid is capped at 53,000 ( $56,000 ) . <p> Following the adoption of this amended legislation , after January 1 2017 it will be necessary to differentiate between dividend recipient and dividend payer . Tax residents of states with which Slovakia does not have a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation or an agreement on exchange of tax information will be at a substantial disadvantage .

@@8538091 @1738091/ <p> Brazil is an emerging country with a promising perspective regarding investment and growth .

Among the many investment opportunities highlighted in the media , the country has just discovered huge oil reserves and will host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games . It is not a surprise that Brazil is the major recipient of foreign direct investment in Latin America . <p> Besides having an investment grade economy , Brazil has a well structured legal environment for receiving foreign investors . It is interesting to she 'd light on its network of trade and tax treaties , its stable regulatory framework and its mature judicial system , which brings security to private enterprise . <p> The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission ( CVM ) has full authority to regulate and oversee the local capital markets , including regulating some issues regarding M&amp;A transactions by publicly-held companies i.e. those companies that have publicly issued securities ( valores mobilirios ) . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on the matter , which is measured by the offering of the valores mobilirios to the public or not . Thus , when valores mobilirios are offered on a private basis , the prospective investor may require such information from the offeror as the investor deems necessary to make an investment decision . <p> To the extent that it does not raise public issues , the State will have little or no interest in regulating such a transaction . However , when the same investment opportunity is offered to the public , the offer requires regulation and supervision to prevent the dissemination of harmful practices in the local markets . In this context , it is a duty of CVM to review the public offers of investments in valores mobilirios , as well as many transactions and market practices , by openly held companies . The purpose of CVM ? s review is therefore to assure that a prospective investor will be able to rely on adequate , sufficient and reliable information in order to operate . <p> The Brazilian Central Bank ( BACEN ) has authority to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign exchange controls and foreign investment into the country . It is also responsible for the analysis of M&amp;A transactions involving financial institutions . <p> In what regards foreign capital , BACEN requires the registering of all resources entered in the Brazilian territory ( whether via lending , direct investment or capital market investments ) in its electronic system ( SisBacen ) . Brazil allows complete freedom of movement of capital , and so BACEN ? s foreign investment role is merely to check that transactions are legal . <p> Foreign investment in Brazil does not require previous authorisation from the BACEN , but it must be electronically registered with BACEN through the system RDE-IED ( Electronic Declaratory Registration ? Direct Foreign Investment ) within 30 days . Information about the investor , the receiver and the characteristics of the investment are to be provided to the BACEN through the RDE-IED . Remittances ( dividends and reduction of capital ) , changes in the corporate structure ( spin-offs and mergers ) and reinvestments should also be registered with the RDE-IED . <p> Upon registration , the BACEN provides a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank handling the transfer of funds in any and every remittances ( outbound ) and new investments ( inbound ) .

The repatriation of capital also does not require previous approval from the BACEN . However , the central bank may deny the repatriation if the balance sheet of the Brazilian company shows a negative net worth ; in this case , the BACEN considers that the investment was diluted . <p> Finally , the Brazilian Antitrust System is responsible for overseeing all conduct that may result in market power concentration . The Economic Law Secretariat at the Ministry of Justice ( SDE ) , the Administrative Council of Economic Defense ( CADE ) and the Economic Monitoring Secretariat at the Ministry of Finance ( SAE ) play an important role in protecting private enterprise and the economy from conduct that could result in abuse of market power . All relevant M&amp;A transactions shall be subject to merger notification 15 days after the first bidding act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the final saying in the analysis . <p> Significant progress was made by the antitrust authorities concerning mergers review , especially by reducing the review period with the adoption of timesaving measures . In order to accomplish that goal , a fast-track procedure for some mergers ( i.e. the entering of a foreign company ) was introduced in Brazilian antitrust analysis of M&amp;A transactions , as well as joint antitrust review by two antitrust authorities ( SEAE and SDE ) in cases of complex operations . <p> The criteria used by the antitrust authorities when analysing M&amp;As is very clear and follows the Mergers Guidelines , which was published by the two Secretariats in charge of merger review . Brazilian authorities follow the same criteria used by most jurisdictions where merger control is relevant . This includes market dominance and a substantial lessening of competition , as well as the best bractices recommended by OECD and the International Competition Network . <p> Repression of abuse of dominance is enforced in Brazil by use of the rule of reason , which focuses on the effect caused by the abusive conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding restriction to competition . Thus , a stronger effort has been adopted in anti-cartel enforcement . <p> Also , a bill that amends antitrust law is about to be approved and major changes are to be expected , such as unification of the three existing antitrust authorities and adoption of a pre-merger review . <p> Brazilian law sets forth many ways of structuring foreign investments depending on investors ? intentions and scope of business . Among the many corporate forms set forth by the Brazilian Civil Code , companies are mostly incorporated as limited liability companies ( sociedades limitadas ) or corporations ( sociedades an(nimas) . Generally , the incorporation of a limited liability company implies smaller costs ( due to the inexistence of many restrictions , such as publication of financial reports and lax business record requirements ) . It is also more flexible in terms of corporate arrangements and fits better for most foreign controlled companies . On the other hand , the incorporation of a company offers a more sophisticated framework while also implying many restrictions to shareholders and officers .

Tender offers are irrevocable and are usually carried out through public auctions , with direct participation of a financial institution that guarantees the obligations assumed by the bidder . The offered price may increase during the auction , provided that the bidder assures payment of the increased price to those who have accepted the previous offer at a lower price . At the seller ? s discretion , payment may be immediate or on credit and may consist of currency or exchange of shares or both . <p> On the other hand ( for either closely or publicly-held corporations ) , in a private negotiation the managements of both companies freely bargain over the terms , future management and legal form of the transaction . Price terms and conditions are flexible and vary upon negotiation , while break fees are not mandatory . <p> It is important to note that if the target in a private negotiation is a publicly-held company , market disclosure requirements must be observed ( according to CVM Instruction No. 358/02 ) and the transaction must eventually be registered with CVM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of a mandatory tender offer ( articles 254-A of the Corporations Act and CVM Instruction n. 361/02 ) . Under Brazilian law , the violation of disclosure and tender offer requirements/ procedures is considered a serious infringement . It is thus subject not only to warnings and fines , but also to more severe penalties such as : ( i ) officers may be forbidden from holding office for up to 20 years ; and ( ii ) buyers may be prevented from trading in the Brazilian market . <p> CVM Instruction 358/02 states that any shareholder who achieves a direct or indirect shareholding of 5% or more ( in any specie or class of shares in a given publicly-held corporation ) must disclose certain information . This includes the purpose of the investment and aimed shareholding . Such a shareholder must also disclose this information every time his/her shareholding surpasses 5% in any specie or class of shares in that company . It is important to highlight , however , that unless offers/bids are made by means of a tender offer , which is essentially public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aforementioned threshold is reached , or ( ii ) control of the company is transferred . <p> On the subject of funding , Brazilian law does not impose restrictions on the structuring of M&amp;A transactions ? with investment through debt , equity and intellectual property permitted . Where taxation is concerned , there are no thin capitalisation rules or any kind of restriction for the deduction of relevant interest paid abroad , provided that such expense is considered necessary for the business of the Brazilian company . However , Brazil is in the process of introducing thin capitalisation rules that will be stricter in relation to investment vehicles located in low tax jurisdictions . <p> Although quite complex , the Brazilian tax system is not biased against foreign investment . The system is designed to promote investment , and even M&amp;A transactions , as there are allowances for capital expenditures , exemption of dividends and goodwill amortisation . Additionally , as tax is distributed among the Federation , the States and the Municipalities , investors may benefit from tax competition in attractive places for investment . <p> Under Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . The business income tax base is the net profits before tax , adjusted for a few additions and exclusions , with the law demanding efficient and attested bookkeeping . Losses in a year can be fully offset with profits of the same year . Offsetting losses of a given year with profits of future years is subject to certain limitations . <p> Beyond paying dividends to their shareholders , Brazilian companies may also credit and/or pay interest on equity to them . That is another sort of shareholder remuneration . Interest on equity is subject to withholding at the rate of 15% ( or 25% if the beneficiary is resident in a tax haven ) . Interest on equity is a deductible expense . <p> Businesses whose revenues do not exceed R$48 million ( US$27 million ) a year , or R$4 million a month , and who are not engaged in financial services and do not receive profits from foreign sources , can opt to be taxed under the presumed system . The presumed system represents a simpler way to calculate the business tax due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the gross revenue established by law for each business sector . For example , in the service industry the presumed profitability is 32% of gross revenues . <p> The choice of the more economic and efficient system depends on each case and demands a specific analysis of the business planning of the company . <p> In conclusion , Brazil is rightly considered one of the most promising investment destinations due to its many business opportunities and stable regulatory and legal framework .

And while participation of local finance and banks in financing projects and infrastructure is key , international companies and capital also need to be mobilised . This opens a host of issues that corporates and financial institutions alike need to consider when carrying out African deals.2 <p> " Buyers and sellers need to think about the human risk first " who do we have on the ground that knows the market " and about the potential for developing long-term relationships , " Simon Nasta , general counsel at FBN Bank told delegates . " A key issue to bear in mind is also the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk and economic risk . " <p> According to Mark Storrie , senior underwriter for emerging markets M&amp;A at AIG , Africa should not be seen as a single territory but as 54 different markets , each with their own specific risks and legal/regulatory landscape to navigate . In addition , in areas such as anti-bribery and corruption ( ABC ) , it will be necessary to consider extra-territorial legislation such as the US FCPA and the UK Bribery Act . <p> As such , there are many acquisitions and infrastructure projects that fail because the parties can not agree on the allocation of risk in the relevant jurisdiction , particularly where a buyer is entering into an unfamiliar territory . <p> Resource nationalism is also a problem with local governments unilaterally gaining additional control over a country 's resources , to the detriment of foreign buyers or investors ; <p> But the private insurance market has stepped in to provide an alternative third party to have a recourse against in the event a transaction goes off the rails . <p> One of those risks is so-called natural resource nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over a country 's resources - which can manifest itself in several ways : changes in codes overseeing a specific sector ( mining for example ) , changes in tax regimes or in equity stakes in a project or company , all to the benefit of the government . The insurance market has had to adapt to this growing transactional risk . <p> It 's now also possible to get cover for political risk ( terrorism or strikes for instance ) in most African countries . But the requirement in many francophone countries that have adopted the ConfTrence Interafricaine des MarchTs d'Assurances ( Cima ) code to have 50% of the insurance cover sourced onshore can be problematic . <p> The Cima code may have been implemented to develop the local African insurance market , but concerns remain as to the creditworthiness of some insurers , as well as to their ability to pay in the event a claim is lodged . <p> " As a party to a transaction , you can get some stability provisions included in contracts , " noted Norton Rose Fulbright partner Christophe Asselineau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms in the event something happens . " <p> He added that in some cases , the private insurance market has stepped in to provide an alternative third party to have a recourse against in the event a transaction goes off the rails . While 10 years ago the range of products available and risks covered were both quite narrow , they have evolved to cover a range of transactional risks which have emerged when doing business in Africa . <h> " While participation of local finance and banks in financing projects and infrastructure is key , international companies and capital also need to be mobilised " <p> According to figures provided by Storrie , nearly 20% of deals that AIG has insured globally between 2011 and 2015 have resulted in a claim , up from 14% for the period to 2014 . Of those , discounting small claims , more than half involved a claim in excess of $1 million . <p> " This may be due to a greater willingness to claim against a third party insurer than another transaction party , " he said , noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim against the management warrantors , who they are relying upon to run the target business " . <p> However , amid growing due diligence and ongoing formalisation of best practices , there is still a sense that business standards are n't necessarily as high in some African jurisdictions than in other countries .

" <p> According to Asselineau , it 's sometimes difficult to ascertain what the law is in some countries . " For instance , it may be the case that in some jurisdictions , the Official Journal outlining new legislation is not published , " he said .

" <p> It 's clear that compromises have been made . Risk retention for example , a key bone of contention for many market participants , has been maintained at five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Paul Tang , who spearheaded the proposal on behalf of the parliament , had proposed increasing risk retention to 20% - which others had said would make originating ABS unappealing . <p> As was the case in earlier drafts , the simple , standardised and transparent ( STS ) securitisation label and subsequent preferential capital treatment is only available to securities originated within the EU , and there is no equivalence regime included within the proposals . <p> KEY TAKEAWAYS <p> European market participants have welcomed the long-awaited agreement of legislators on a new regulatory framework for securitisation , which involves preferential capital treatment for assets deemed simple , transparent and standardised ; <p> The proposal looks substantially and materially different to what was first pitched in September 2015 , but is broadly sensible ; <p> To the great relief of the market , risk retention has been maintained at five percent ; <p> There is no equivalence regime at present , which raises some issues surrounding Brexit ; <p> Lawyers have stressed the importance of consistency across member states and appropriate timing . <p> When STS was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where market participants complained of a protectionist regime that shut out external markets for no clear reason . <p> " The US approached securitisation reform in a different way , in broad terms tidying up the market more on the asset side than purely through greater regulation of securitisation itself , " explained Ingram . <p> " Consequently , to then add another layer of qualifying types of transactions is just not a logical direction for them to go in , " he added . <p> Plus , the US simply does not need preferential treatment for its securitisation market , which has not suffered the same reputational and regulatory challenges as in Europe . <p> A much bigger concern surrounding equivalence is of course Brexit . But given the current incredibly early stage of EU-UK negotiations , it makes sense not to tackle equivalence just yet . <p> Previously included restrictions on cross-border investments have also been dropped from the proposal .

Pablo Portugal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that he never saw the ban as desirable or necessary in the first place . <p> " Stringent capital requirements make resecuritisations largely uneconomic anyway , so they are rare , " he said . " It 's understandable that the Parliament wanted to include a ban , subject to appropriate definitions and exemptions , but important facets of this need to be clear in the texts . " <p> Meanwhile David Shearer , securitisation partner at Norton Rose Fulbright in London said he is concerned that the finalised proposal will give member states an opportunity to goldplate their own frameworks " including the possibility of introducing criminal or administrative sanctions . <p> " If that does occur it will create a web of compliance issues that could discourage cross-border securitisation and runs contrary to the stated aim of the CMU , " he added . <p> While the news has been unanimously welcomed , this is by no means the end of the road for securitisation practitioners .

The Federal Council proposes in part very severe restrictions . For this reason , the Federal Council is not formally proposing to implement the most controversial changes relating to commercial properties and listed real estate companies , but rather is putting them up for discussion only . <h> Commercial properties <p> The most far reaching proposal relates to commercial properties , specifically , properties used for commercial or business purposes ( offices , production , logistics , retail , hotels , and so on ) . It is proposed that these commercial properties would again be subject to the Lex Koller . Persons abroad would thus be excluded from acquiring commercial properties in Switzerland in the future . The only exception would be where an owner uses the property for his own business activities and does not lease the property to third parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koller that was enacted in 1997 .

The Federal Council is again putting this up for discussion , proposing that persons abroad would no longer be permitted to acquire shares or other equity securities in listed real estate companies . As stock exchange trading does not allow determining the nationality of a buyer , this change could result in listed real estate companies having to delist their shares from the stock exchange " with all the corresponding negative consequences for shareholders . <h> Real estate investment funds <p> Under current law , foreigners may acquire shares in Swiss real estate investment funds if the shares are regularly traded on the market . In its bill , the Federal Council proposes to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares listed on a Swiss stock exchange .

The law even allows for foreign banks and insurance companies to acquire the real estate property they have financed through foreclosure proceedings . The Federal Council now proposes that the right to acquire the property in a foreclosure will only apply to foreign controlled banks and insurance companies that have their head office ( corporate seat ) in Switzerland , and not to foreign banks and insurance companies that are based abroad . In the future , real estate financings by foreign banks and insurance companies would therefore have to be carried out by a Swiss subsidiary if the lenders want to retain the right to acquire the financed property in foreclosure proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are treated like Swiss citizens under the current law and therefore are not subject to any restrictions when acquiring Swiss real estate .

Today , no permit is required for such an acquisition . The Federal Council now proposes to subject the acquisition of a primary residence to a permit requirement , thus complicating the acquisition process . <p> In addition , the Federal Council proposes that third state nationals must sell their primary residences within two years after they leave Switzerland or stop using the property as primary residence . <h> Transitional law <p> The proposed rules will apply to transactions that are signed or closed after the new law enters into force .

These reforms have rested on the following fundamentals : a flexible , decentralized approach to corporate management and oversight ; expanded rights for minority shareholders ; and a system of financial auditing that is increasingly independent and transparent . Against this backdrop , this article outlines the current landscape of corporate governance in Korea . <p> Corporate Structure <p> Under the Korean Commercial Code the most common type of company , the chusik hoesa , typically referred to as a joint-stock company , has the following standing organs : <p> the general meeting of shareholders ; <p> the board of directors ; <p> the representative director ; and <p> the statutory auditor <p> The general meeting of shareholders is the supreme policy-making organ of a company and determines fundamental corporate matters .

The statutory auditor supervises the management of the company 's business and audits the company 's accounts . <p> The Code does not expressly provide for a corporate president , chief executive officer , treasurer , or secretary , positions common under the corporate law of the United States and other jurisdictions , although it does not prohibit a company from conferring such titles and creating such positions by the inclusion of appropriate provisions in the Articles of Incorporation or through regulations adopted by the general meeting of shareholders or the board of directors . <p> General Meetings of Shareholders <p> Composition <p> The general meeting of shareholders is a standing organ mandatory for all joint-stock companies including those with a sole shareholder .

Nonetheless , its powers are circumscribed to those matters specifically provided for in the Code or the articles of incorporation of the company . Depending on the importance of the corporate action in question , a simple majority , super-majority or unanimity consent will be required , as prescribed in the Code . <p> Certain matters such as election of directors or declaration of dividends , must be authorized by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders , which refers to a resolution adopted by a majority of the shares present , representing one-fourth or more of the total number of the shares issued . The company 's articles of incorporation may make the voting requirement more stringent , but may not relax the requirement . <p> Other fundamental corporate actions such as an amendment of the articles of incorporation , merger , or transfer of an important business asset require a super-majority and must be authorized by a special resolution of the shareholders , which must be adopted by two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing one-third or more of the total number of shares issued . <p> Still other corporate actions require the unanimous consent of all of the company 's shareholders . For example , any release of a promoter , director or statutory auditor from a liability owed to the company requires such unanimous shareholder consent . <p> Korean legal commentators generally agree that a company may specify in its articles of incorporation additional matters to be resolved at a general meeting of shareholders even if the Code provides that such matters are to be resolved at a board of directors meeting , unless the nature of the matter makes this impractical . Therefore , a company has discretion as to which additional matters are to be subject to resolution by a general meeting of shareholders , by virtue of an appropriate provision of the company 's articles of incorporation . <p> Convocation , voting and resolution <p> The general meeting of shareholders may be convened by a resolution of the board of directors .

In such a case , the non-breaching party may be entitled only to seek the indemnity from the breaching party as provided in the shareholders ' agreement . <p> Board of Directors and Representative Director <p> Election and dismissal <p> The directors are appointed or dismissed by the general meeting of shareholders . Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation of the company , any shareholder who owns 3% or more of outstanding shares may request the company to elect the directors by means of cumulative voting when a shareholders meeting is convened for the purpose of electing 2 or more directors .

However , any such internal limit or restriction on this power of representation is not effective against a bona-fide third party acting in good faith . <p> Joint representative director system <p> A company is permitted to have more than one representative director . If a company elects to have multiple representative directors , in principle , they represent the company independently . However , the board of directors may choose to require that the representative directors serve as joint representative directors who are required to act jointly in exercising their power . <p> Meetings and resolutions <p> In principle , directors must physically attend board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors may be convened by means of a telecommunications system transmitting and receiving live audio and video communications , whereby all directors participate in the meeting .

Unless the articles of incorporation provides a more stringent requirement , all actions and resolutions of the board of directors are adopted by the affirmative votes of a majority of all the directors in attendance at the board of directors meeting . <p> Statutory Auditor <p> Authority <p> By law , each company must have one or more statutory auditors , who serve as an independent watchdog over the management of the company .

These mechanisms for enhanced corporate responsibility include a regime of minority shareholders ' rights , outside director requirements , audit requirements , prescribed directors ' fiduciary duties , a mandatory disclosure system and restrictions on self-dealing . <p> Minority Shareholders ' Rights <p> Minority shareholders in Korea have a progressive degree of rights afforded to them in accordance with their share ownership ratio . In this context , the Code sets out various thresholds at which prescribed rights are triggered for privately held companies , and the SEL sets less stringent thresholds for many of the same rights applicable to publicly-traded companies . Examples of the types of rights afforded minority shareholders include : ( i ) the right to bring actions to unwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new shares or merger ; ( ii ) the right to bring derivative actions ; ( iii ) the right to inspect books and records ; ( iv ) the right to apply to court for removal of a director or suspension of a director 's authority ; and ( v ) the right to apply for dissolution of the company . <p> In addition , under the Code and SEL , a shareholder ( both of common and preferred shares ) who objects to certain important resolutions passed by the general meeting of shareholders such as merger or business transfer has a right to demand that the company purchase the shareholder 's shares at a price determined pursuant to the process prescribed by law . <p> Finally , a movement to grant minority shareholders and other interested parties class action rights has recently taken shape . On December 27 2001 , President Kim Dae Jung submitted a bill to the National Assembly which would grant minority shareholders the right to bring a class action suit when : ( i ) they suffer damages in a securities-related transaction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial audits , imperfect , misleading or false disclosures in entering such transaction . At present , however , the fate of the bill remains uncertain . <p> Outside Directors <p> An outside director is defined as a non-standing director who is not affiliated with the controlling shareholders or the management of the company . <p> The SEL requires that at least a quarter of the board of directors of a company listed on the Korea Stock Exchange be outside directors . Further , Korea Stock Exchange-listed companies whose assets total 2 trillion Won or more must have not less than three outside directors , who will account for not less than half of the total number of its directors . Companies listed on KOSDAQ are subject to the same requirements with limited exceptions . <p> The SEL provides that publicly traded companies with assets of not less than 2 trillion Won must establish an Outside Directors Recommendation Committee which will recommend candidates for outside directors to the companies . <p> Audit System <p> Audit committee <p> At their discretion , privately-held companies may establish an audit committee that functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the audit committee will be a subcommittee of the board by the resolution of the board of directors . On the other hand , publicly-traded companies whose total assets are 2 trillion Won or more are required to organize an audit committee . Similar to the statutory auditor , the audit committee serves as a watchdog over the directors ' management of the company and may inspect the company 's financial data . However , unlike the statutory auditor , who is elected by the shareholders and is therefore independent of the board of directors , the audit committee members are members of the board of directors . In this manner , the audit committee can achieve greater accountability while preserving adequate authority in relation to majority shareholders and senior officers . <p> External audit <p> Under the Joint Stock Company External Audit Law , if a company 's total assets for the preceding fiscal year were 7 billion Won or more , the company must appoint an outside accounting firm as an independent auditor within the first four months of a new fiscal year , with the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as the independent auditor of the company . The appointed independent auditor will be authorized to conduct a financial audit pursuant to the statutory requirements under the Joint Stock Company External Audit Law . <p> Internal accounting management system <p> The Corporate Restructuring Promotion Law ( CRPL ) enacted on August 14 , 2001 , and effective as of September 14 , 2001 , requires that a company whose total assets for the preceding fiscal year were 7 billion Won or more adopt an Internal Accounting Management Regulation at its board of directors meeting and appoint one of its full-time directors as the Internal Accounting Manager . <p> The Internal Accounting Regulation must include , among others : ( i ) methods for recognizing , measuring , classifying , recording and reporting financial information ; ( ii ) methods for controlling and correcting errors in financial information ; ( iii ) matters relating to internal cross-checking , such as periodic inspection and adjustment of financial information ; ( iv ) methods for managing the books , retaining financial information , and preventing forgery , alteration and damage ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preparation and public announcement of financial information ; and ( vi ) other relevant items as determined by presidential decree . <p> The external auditor of a company must review the implementation and enforcement of the foregoing system and include the audit results in its annual report . <p> Directors ' Fiduciary Duties <p> In Korea , as in most contemporary jurisdictions , directors owe certain fiduciary duties to the company and , arguably , to the shareholders . As fiduciaries , directors bear a duty of due care , considered that of a good manager , to their company . Breach of such duty can result in both civil and , in extreme instances , criminal liability . <p> Further , under certain circumstances , directors may bear liability to third parties who incurred damages due to the directors ' willful misconduct or gross negligence with respect to their duties to the company . <p> Finally , under the Code , if there is someone ( including a controlling shareholder ) who is not a registered director but is deemed to fall into one of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of registered directors mentioned above : ( i ) a person who instructs a director to conduct business by using his influence over the company ; ( ii ) a person who conducts business in person under the name of a director ; or ( iii ) a person other than a director who conducts the business of the company by using a title which may be recognized as being authorized to conduct the business of the company , such as honorary chairman , chairman , president , vice-president , executive director , managing director , and director . <p> Disclosure System <p> Disclosure of corporate and accounting information constitutes the practical foundation of the check-and-balance mechanisms adopted by Korean laws aimed at achieving accountability and transparency . <p> In this connection , a company is required to keep its financial statements , business reports and audit reports ( plus external audit report , if applicable ) and any ancillary documents at its principal office and the branch offices for a certain prescribed period . Additionally , the balance sheet of a company once approved by the general meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apart from these general requirements , the SEL : ( i ) provides strengthened and extensive disclosure requirements applicable to an initial public offering , securities transactions and business and corporate affairs or performance of a publicly-listed company and ( ii ) imposes severe sanctions against violations of the foregoing . <p> Restrictions on Self-dealing <p> To prevent conflicts of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest , under the Code , shareholders or directors who have personal interests in a particular agenda issue may not exercise their respective voting rights with regard to any resolution on such agenda at the general meeting of shareholders or the board of directors meeting . <p> Further , the consent of the board of directors is required for transactions between a director and the company for the director 's account or for the account of a third party . <p> Conclusion <p> Looking forward , Korea 's regime of corporate governance will likely evolve in the same manner as it has in the past : at times gradually and incrementally , as the needs of an increasingly open private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic fashion in response to pivotal events such as the financial crisis . What remains clear is that irrespective of the pace of progress , Korea has demonstrated its commitment to responsible corporate governance based upon the principles of transparency and accountability .

Most of the M&amp;A activity took place in the mining sector and 2012 saw , among other M&amp;A deals , three significant transactions including : <p> the sale by Anglo American of Scaw South Africa , a leading South Africa-based integrated steel maker , to an investment consortium led by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and Anglo American 's partners in Scaw South Africa , being Izingwe Holdings , Shanduka Resources and the Southern Palace Group of Companies ; <p> Toronto- and Johannesburg-listed First Uranium 's sale of its Ezulwini gold and uranium mine to Chinese-owned Gold One and its subsidiary Mine Waste Solutions to AngloGold Ashanti ; and <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minerals ( following its acquisition of an additional 37% from fellow miner BHP Billiton ) . I would prefer not to number these as they are not listed in any particular order and they are certainly not the only deals <p> In one of the largest potential deals to date , the property sector saw the offer by Redefine Properties for all of the property assets held by Fountainhead Property Trust and the subsequent , and competing , offer by Growthpoint Properties for the same assets . At the date of this article , Redefine had withdrawn its offer . Meanwhile , in the financial services sector , ABSA purchased from Barclays all of its African businesses . <h> Legislative framework <p> The South African M&amp;A legislative framework consists primarily of the Companies Act 2008 , the Listings Requirements of the JSE , the Competition Act 1998 and the Exchange Control Regulations , which are enforced by the Foreign Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank . <p> The Companies Act 2008 came into force on May 1 2011 and replaced the Companies Act 1973 in its entirety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to much-needed modernisation of South Africa 's corporate law framework . Among other things , it introduces the concept of the so-called fundamental transaction , a term which is used to describe : ( i ) a scheme of arrangement ; ( ii ) the statutory merger or amalgamation procedure ; and ( iii ) the disposal of all or a greater part of the assets or undertaking of a company . The Companies Act 2008 has also widened the scope for minority protections and has introduced dissenting shareholder appraisal rights . <p> The takeover regime is contained in sections 117 to 127 of the Companies Act 2008 and the Takeover Regulations , which have replaced both the Securities Regulation Code on Takeovers and Mergers and the Rules of the Securities Regulation Panel . The Takeover Regulation Panel , a body established in terms of the Companies Act 2008 , has replaced the Securities Regulation Panel . The takeover provisions apply to regulated companies ( which are all public companies and private companies in certain instances ) whose securities are the subject of an affected transaction or an offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public company in South Africa are by means of a fundamental transaction and a takeover offer . <h> Fundamental transactions <p> A scheme of arrangement is governed by section 114 of the Companies Act 2008 and is the most commonly used method of obtaining control of a company in a recommended offer . A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure whereby a company makes an arrangement with the holders of any class of its securities by way of , for example , a consolidation of securities of different classes , a division of securities into different classes , an expropriation of securities from the holders , exchanging any of its securities for other securities , a re-acquisition by the company of its securities or a combination of the above and a company can effectively bring about almost any kind of internal re-organisation , merger or de-merger using a scheme of arrangement . A scheme can only be proposed between a company and its shareholders ( and not also with its creditors , who are now dealt with separately in section 155 of the Companies Act 2008 ) ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert to compile a report for the board and the holders of the company 's securities concerning certain information as set out in the Companies Act 2008 , and a scheme only needs to be sanctioned by the court in limited circumstances . Therefore , once the scheme has been approved by shareholders , all shares subject to the scheme are compulsorily acquired by the offeror . <p> Amalgamations or mergers , otherwise referred to as a statutory merger or business combination , are governed by sections 113 and 116 of the Companies Act 2008 . An amalgamation or merger is a statutory procedure and was introduced to facilitate flexibility with regard to business combinations and restructurings . An amalgamation or merger is essentially a transaction or set of transactions in terms of which two or more companies merge to form one company which holds all assets and liabilities of the merging or amalgamating companies " it is not possible to cherry pick assets and liabilities when using amalgamation or merger proceedings : all assets and liabilities of the merging or amalgamating companies must transfer to the new/merged company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the parties to the proposed amalgamation or merger must enter into a written agreement setting out certain statutory information concerning to the proposed amalgamation or merger . Second , the amalgamation or merger must be approved by the shareholders of each amalgamating or merging company . Third , before the amalgamation or merger can be implemented , the board of each company involved in the amalgamation or merger must be satisfied that the solvency and liquidity test will be met . Although such a procedure has certain advantages ( principally , the automatic transfer of all assets and liabilities of the target ) , the method has not proved popular in the context of public offers , primarily due to creditor notification obligations and creditor review rights at the end of the process . Accordingly , statutory mergers are more popular in the context of internal re-organisations . <p> The disposal of all or a greater part of the assets or undertaking of a company is governed by section 112 of the Companies Act 2008 . This is where control of a company is obtained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by purchasing the whole or greater part of the business or assets of the target . <h> Approvals for fundamental transactions <p> In terms of section 115 of the Companies Act 2008 , a company may not enter into or implement a fundamental transaction unless that transaction has been approved by a special resolution adopted by persons entitled to exercise voting rights in relation to such transaction ( excluding voting rights controlled by an acquiring party or a person related to an acquiring party or a person acting in concert ) at a meeting at which the requisite quorum is present . The Companies Act 2008 sets as the requisite quorum 25% of all voting rights entitled to be exercised on the particular transaction . The quorum may be changed , however , in the company 's constitutional document ( the memorandum of incorporation ) . <p> In addition to obtaining shareholder approval , if a regulated company proposes to enter into a fundamental transaction , that company may not enter into or implement that transaction unless the Panel has issued a compliance certificate in respect of the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exempted the transaction ( in terms of section 119(6) ) . The Panel will typically grant an exemption in circumstances where there is no reasonable potential of the fundamental transaction prejudicing the interests of existing securities holders , the cost of compliance is disproportionate relative to the value of the fundamental transaction , or granting the exemption is otherwise reasonable and justifiable in the circumstances having regard the principles set out in sections 117 to 127 of the Companies Act 2008 and the Takeover Regulations . <h> Minority protections and dissenting shareholder appraisal rights <p> A company may not implement a resolution which approves a fundamental transaction if that resolution was opposed by at least 15% of the shareholders and any person who voted against the resolution requires the company to seek court approval for implementation of the resolution , or if any person who voted against the resolution is granted leave by the court to have the transaction reviewed . The court may grant a person who voted against the resolution leave to have the transaction reviewed if the applicant is acting in good faith and appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution , the court may set aside the resolution if the resolution is manifestly unfair to any class of the company 's securities or if it can be proved that the vote is materially tainted by conflict of interest , inadequate disclosure , the failure to comply with the Companies Act 2008 and the memorandum of incorporation or other significant and material procedural irregularity . <p> In addition , if a shareholder notified the company in advance of the intention to oppose a special resolution to approve a fundamental transaction and was present at the meeting and voted against that special resolution , if the transaction goes ahead , that shareholder may exercise its appraisal rights by demanding that the company pay that shareholder , in cash , the fair value for all of the shares held by that person . <h> Takeover regime <p> As mentioned above , takeovers are governed by sections 117 to 127 of the Companies Act 2008 and the Takeover Regulations . A takeover offer is most commonly used where the offer is not recommended ( that is , in a hostile bid situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not common . <p> The takeover provisions apply where a regulated company proposes to enter into an affected transaction or where an offer is made with respect to a regulated company . <p> An affected transaction includes : <p> a fundamental transaction ; <p> the acquisition or disposal of , or announced intention to acquire or dispose of , a beneficial interest in securities amounting to 5% , 10% , 15% , or any further whole multiple of 5% , of the issued securities of a particular class of securities ; <p> the announced intention to acquire 100% of the securities of the company ; <p> a mandatory offer ; and <p> a compulsory acquisition ( which includes the acquisition of securities in any manner and a buy-back by a company of its securities ) . <p> An offer means a proposal of any sort , including a partial offer , which , if accepted , would result in an affected transaction . There are four categories of offers under the Companies Act 2008 : mandatory offers , comparable offers , partial offers and general offers . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , otherwise known as a squeeze out or compulsory acquisition , is governed by section 124 of the Companies Act 2008 and provides that where an offer for all of the securities of a regulated company is accepted by the holders of at least 90% of those securities ( excluding securities held by the offeror , related or inter-related persons or parties acting in concert ) , the offeror can compulsorily purchase the shares of the non-accepting shareholders on the same terms as applied to securities holders who accepted the initial offer . A non-accepting shareholder can apply to court for an order prohibiting the compulsory acquisition or , alternatively , making the compulsory acquisition subject to certain conditions . The compulsory acquisition may be prohibited if the objecting shareholder is able to convince the court that the offer is unfair or that there are special conditions requiring the court to make such an order . <p> Mandatory offers are governed by section 123 of the Companies Act 2008 and that section requires a mandatory offer to be made for the remaining shares in a target if a bidder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inter-related parties and any concert party ) increases to 35% or more . Under the Companies Act 2008 , a further mandatory offer is not triggered by the acquisition of further securities at the 40% , 45% or 49.5% level and so the Companies Act 2008 abolishes the so-called creep provisions under the Securities Regulation Code . <p> The Companies Act 2008 introduces as an affected transaction the acquisition of or disposal of 5% , or any multiple of 5% , of a beneficial interest in securities of a regulated company and requires that any such acquisition and disposal must be disclosed to that regulated company . This disclosure obligation applies whether or not the acquisition or disposal results in a mandatory offer or other type of affected transaction . <h> Antitrust and exchange control regulation <p> The parties to large and intermediate mergers must obtain prior merger approval from the South African competition authorities before the transaction can be implemented . Small mergers are those which fall below the prescribed thresholds and do not usually require competition authority approval . In certain circumstances , however ( usually where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lessen competition ) , the competition authorities can investigate a small merger within six months of implementation of that merger . <p> If the parties to a merger have combined assets or annual turnover in into or from South Africa of at least R560 million ( approximately $61.1 million ) and if the target firm has assets or turnover of at least R80 million , the transaction must be notified as an intermediate merger . If the parties to a merger have combined assets or annual turnover of at least R6.6 billion and the target firm has assets or turnover of at least R190 million , the transaction must be notified as a large merger . <p> A filing fee of R100,000 is payable in respect of intermediate mergers . For large mergers , the fee is R350,000 . <p> For many years , South Africa has had a system of exchange controls in place aimed at regulating the flow of capital into and out of the country . These controls , which are set out in the Exchange Control Regulations 1961 , have often played a significant role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly cross-border transactions , are structured . In recent times , these exchange controls have been gradually relaxed with the intention that they will ultimately be abolished . <h> Corporate governance <p> Corporate governance measures in South Africa generally consist of largely non-binding codes of governance referred to as the King Codes . The first two of these were published some years ago , while King III was published in September 2009 and came into operation on March 1 2010 . A Practice Note to King III which deals with fundamental and affected transactions has been published in order to ensure that directors are aware of their responsibilities and duties in respect of mergers , acquisitions and amalgamations . For the first time in the context of the King reports , the practice note sets out certain generally accepted principles of good governance which are intended to supplement the Takeover Regulations . <p> These principles include that directors must disclose any conflict or potential conflict of interest in relation to any contemplated affected transaction and that , in an affected transaction , an offeree company board must consist only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected transactions the application of the directors ' fiduciary duties must be extended to include the general body of the company 's relevant shareholders ; <p> In addition , the independent board must have the requisite knowledge to ensure that a fully informed opinion regarding the affected transaction ( specifically including an opinion as to the offeree company 's value ) is provided to the relevant shareholders . The independent board should do all things necessary to satisfy itself that an offeror is able to perform in terms of an affected transaction and , in recommending an affected transaction , must give consideration to and state that it has exhausted all reasonable endeavours to satisfy itself that the consideration offered could not be bettered by pursuing an alternative viable deal . <p> Other key principles are that offeree companies must appoint independent competent advisers ; negotiations should be kept confidential and , if confidentiality is breached , relevant information should be disclosed ; shareholders of different classes , types and rights to shares should be treated comparably ; and non-conflicted directors should drive the process from both the offeror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets , with a particular focus on energy and mining transactions , and extensive experience of broad-based black economic empowerment transactions .

Acquisitions are those forms of business transactions where the shares in or control of a company is taken over by persons who , prior to the change in shareholding or control , did not possess such shareholding or control . <p> The size and the number of mergers and acquisition ( M&amp;A ) activities taking place in India are insignificant compared to those in developed countries . However , there seems to be a growing trend towards such M&amp;A activities in India . The main reasons for this increase in M&amp;A activity may be the changes that have taken place over the last decade in the country 's legal , policy and regulatory framework , such as : <p> amendments to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1969 ( MRTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain government approval for effecting M&amp;A transactions in certain large or dominant undertakings ( the test for dominance was based on the value of assets or the market share ) ; <p> amendments to the Companies Act 1956 in 1996 , providing for the free transferability of shares , thus reducing the grounds on which the board of directors of a company may refuse to register a transfer of shares ; <p> progressive changes effected in the country 's industrial licensing policy " based on the provisions of the Industries ( Development and Regulation ) Act 1951 ( ID&amp;R Act ) " resulting in a reduction in the number of industries requiring licences to less than 10 . The strict licensing regime had resulted in the creation of inefficient and non-viable small industrial units in sectors that were subject to licensing ; <p> progressive changes effected in the government 's foreign direct investment ( FDI ) policy since 1991 " government approval for FDI is now required only in a handful of sectors , and in all other sectors a foreign investor can take part in FDI without obtaining approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> introduction of the Depositories Act 1996 providing for the dematerialization of shares in listed companies ; and <p> framing of various regulations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) , including the SEBI Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations 1997 ( Takeover Regulations ) that govern substantial acquisitions of shares in listed companies and takeovers of listed companies . <p> The trend towards M&amp;A is more perceptible in certain sectors such as : ( i ) the consumer goods sector where companies want to rapidly gain market share ( eg Tata Oil Mills merging with Hindustan Lever Limited , a subsidiary of Unilever ; Coca Cola taking over Parle Products ) ; ( ii ) the banking and financial sector , where size is increasingly becoming important and Reserve Bank of India is prescribing stricter norms in relation to the capital requirements of banks ; ( iii ) sectors where more players ( than the optimum numbers ) came to operate due to the industrial licensing policy of the government , resulting in a need for a consolidation of industrial capacity ( the cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 players controlling 110 million tonnes of capacity " 40 of them are marginal players each with around 1 million tonne capacity . Similar problems are being faced by the steel industry due to fragmentation of capacity ) ; and ( iv ) sectors where the need for high technology is becoming very important ( such as the telecommunications and pharmaceutical sectors ) . In addition to the foregoing , another major reason for this increase is that the M&amp;A activities that are taking place globally are triggering events in India in the form of mergers with or takeovers of subsidiaries in India . <p> The current legal and regulatory framework <p> The Companies Act <p> Mergers <p> Mergers of companies can be effected only with the prior approval of a three-quarters majority of the shareholders of each of the companies participating in the merger , and only as sanctioned by the relevant court . The court , before sanctioning a scheme of merger , will take into account the views of all interested parties , including the creditors , government and employees . <p> Under the Companies Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company whereas the transferor can be a foreign company . However , the scheme of the Companies Act and other applicable legal and regulatory provisions would clearly imply that cross border mergers involving Indian companies ae not feasible under the current framework . <p> Acquisitions <p> There are no provisions in the Companies Act that directly govern acquisitions . However , there are some restrictions ( sections 108A-108I of the Companies Act ) that relate to the transfer of shares in certain companies if such transfers would result in the creation of a dominant undertaking ( as defined under the MRTP Act ) , or an increase in the dominance of a dominant undertaking , or where the transferor was holding more than 10% of the share capital of the company prior to such a transfer . Such transactions require the approval of the central government . It may be noted that these provisions may seem out of place now , since the concept of dominant undertaking is of little relevance , even under the MRTP Act as far as M&amp;A activities are concerned . Where the acquirer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of specified percentages of the paid-up share capital and free reserves of the acquirer , then the acquisition may only be made following a special resolution ( special resolutions are resolutions passed by shareholders holding three-quarters of the share capital who are present and voting at a meeting ) passed by the shareholders of the acquirer . <p> Under sections 409 and 250 , the Company Law Board ( CLB " a quasi-judicial body constituted by the central government under the Companies Act for the administration of company law ) may pass orders preventing a change in the board of directors of a company , or restrict transfer of shares in a company that could prejudicially affect the affairs of a company . These are ways in which the existing management of a company may be able to resist a takeover attempt . <p> The Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 ( FEMA ) and FDI policy <p> Mergers <p> Under the current leal and regullatory framework , it is not feasible to have Indian companies as party to cross- border mergers . To achieve a merger involving an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an Indian entity and effect a merger of the entity with the Indian company , or ( ii ) acquire another Indian entity and thereafter effect a merger of the acquired Indian entity with the other Indian entity . <p> To set up an Indian entity , the foreign company may require approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board of the Government of India ( FIPB ) if the case is not covered under the automatic approval route prescribed by the Indian government . Under current FDI policy , no approval from the FIPB will be required for a foreign company to subscribe for shares in Indian companies unless : <p> industrial licensing applies to that sector ; <p> the foreign investor has or had a previous joint venture or collaboration in India with any other <p> the foreign investor wants to acquire existing shares from any other shareholder rather than investing in a fresh issue of shares ; or <p> where automatic approval is not permitted in that sector ( like in civil aviation ) . <p> Acquisitions <p> Foreign companies will be able to acquire shares in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares in an Indian company by a foreign company from a shareholder resident in India will require prior approval from the FIPB . The Indian company in this regard will support the application to the FIPB . This would imply that hostile takeovers of Indian companies by foreign companies are almost impossible . Following the receipt of FIPB approval , the foreign company will be required to make an application to the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) giving details of the price at which the shares will be acquired together with the valuation of shares . <p> The Takeover Regulations and the Listing Agreement <p> Mergers <p> The Listing Agreement ( an agreement entered into between a company whose shares are listed on stock exchanges with the stock exchange ) requires companies whose shares are listed on stock exchanges to make relevant and timely disclosure of price-sensitive information .

In addition , the SEBI may grant an exemption from the provisions of the Takeover Regulations in certain cases , based on the facts of the case . Under the Takeover Regulations , there are some obligations on the part of the acquirer and the target company . <p> Obligations to disclose : any person who has acquired more than 5% of the shares or voting rights in a company must , within four days , disclose this fact to the target company and the target company must in turn disclose this to the stock exchanges .

There are detailed provisions in the Takeover Regulations in relation to the contents of the public offer , specific timelines for the completion of various activities , and general obligations of the acquirer . <p> Industries ( Development and Regulation ) Act ( ID&amp;R Act ) <p> The objective of the ID&amp;R Act is to provide for the development and regulation of certain industries specified in the schedule to the Act . Under the provisions of the ID&amp;R Act , the central government is empowered to take over the management and control of industrial undertakings .

Under the Act , a Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction ( BIFR ) has been constituted to look into the issues affecting such sick companies and to sanction appropriate schemes for their revival . A domestic bank or financial institution having some interest in such a sick company usually prepares such schemes .

Various benefits such as an exemption from tax on capital gains , and allowances of carryforward benefits of unabsorbed expenses and losses are possible only if the merger satisfies the conditions of being an amalgamation under the Income Tax Act 1961 ( the Income Tax Act does not use the term merger but uses the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions have to be satisfied ) . One of the reasons for companies to choose a merger " rather than an asset or business acquisition " is to reduce the incidence of stamp duties on the transfer of immovable assets ; such duties usually range between 4% and 12% in the states where the property is situated . However , some of the states in India have made changes to the applicable stamp duty laws that provide for the stamping of an order of the court in mergers as a conveyance . In such cases , there will be an additional stamp duty impact , based on the value of shares issued/assets acquired in a merger . <p> Acquisitions <p> Tax considerations are relatively less in the case of acquisitions , since the major tax impact would be in the nature of share transfer taxes at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration . From the point of view of the sellers of shares , any capital gains on the sale of such shares will be subject to tax at a concessive rate ( where the shares are held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal rates in other cases . In the case of foreign investors , the actual incidence and rates of duty will depend on the provisions of the applicable double taxation avoidance agreement . In cases of transfer in excess of 49% of the shareholding in certain companies ( like clodely held private companies ) , the Company will forego the benefits of carrying forward and setting off any unabsorbed losses incurred by that company in the previous years . <p> Legal and regulatory approvals <p> The legal and regulatory approvals required for effecting a M&amp;A transaction are different . A complete and clear understanding of the applicable legal and regulatory framework must be made before a final decision is taken . In some cases , these considerations determine whether one should go for a merger or an acquisition . For example , direct cross-border mergers are not feasible in India , and the hostile acquisition of an Indian company by a foreign one is also practically impossible . <p> Time considerations <p> Mergers <p> Mergers can be effected only with the sanction of the court . It takes not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court until the final order of sanction is received from the court . Further , courts have wide powers to effect changes in the scheme of merger . There are further uncertainties " for example , any interested party such as employees and the government may raise objections to the scheme , resulting in further delays in implementing the scheme . <p> Acquisitions <p> In cases of acquisitions , though the timeline specified under the Takeover Regulations will have to be complied with , completion is after acquisition of the initial 15% of shares by the acquirer . Further , since the Takeover Regulations permit conditional offers , uncertainty as to whether the acquirer may not be able to acquire the minimum number of shares can be overcome . <p> Relevant issues in relation to mergers and acquisitions <p> Whose interests are paramount ? <p> Although it is said in corporate democracy that the will of the majority shall prevail , there have always been questions about the role played by management , since families traditionally control many Indian companies . Further , the interests of other minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of M&amp;A . It was recently reported ( The Economist Newspaper Group Limited , May 10 2001 ) that a Paris court blocked Schneider Electric 's proposal for taking over Legrand , a rival company , for a deal worth $7 billion on the grounds that the proposed deal discriminated against the preference shares held by minority shareholders of Legrand . Similar issues relating to the valuation of shares and the scheme of merger have been raised in India in the past . There is a need to strike a balance between the absolute rule of corporate democracy and the interests of all stakeholders . <p> The role of the board becomes crucial in such major decisions . With the exception of the Takeover Regulations that provide for the general obligations of the board of directors of the target company , there are no specific guidelines as to the conduct of the board in relation to M&amp;A transactions . In the emerging era of corporate governance , it would be appropriate if issues relating to disclosure and transparency could be strengthened . <p> Hostile takeovers <p> Since the Takeover Regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of completed takeovers , of which a mere eight have been hostile . In many publicly held Indian companies , the shareholding of financial institutions is substantial . Generally , the financial institutions have exhibited a tendency not to disturb the existing management even if the existing management has not really performed . The role of financial institutions in the recent attempt to take over Bombay Dyeing " one of the country 's largest textile manufacturers " is a case on point . It is high time that the financial institutions had clear policies to make the conduct of such matters transparent , since financial institutions are supposed to be the custodians of public money . <p> Mergers and monopolies <p> After the amendment to the MRTP Act in 1991 , there are no provisions under which mergers that give rise to a monopolistic situation are considered and cleared by any authority . This is in sharp contrast with the situation prevailing in many developed countries . For instance , while the UK has its own restrictions on the formation of monopolies due to M&amp;A activities , the EU also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-border transactions do not result in such a situation in the EU as a whole . In India however , to a limited extent , this situation is addressed by the provisions of the Companies Act that require prior permission from the central government in relation to certain transactions regarding the transfer of shares . However , there are no such provisions in relation to a merger transaction . The time is ripe to introduce changes in the legislation to address the issues relating to the formation of monopolies arising out of M&amp;A activities by way of suitable competition laws . <p> The role of regulatory and other agencies <p> There is growing uncertainty about the role played by the CLB and SEBI in relation to certain matters involving M&amp;A activities , due to the fact that their powers seem to overlap in some cases . In one recent case of an attempted hostile takeover , CLB favoured the idea of freezing the voting rights of the hostile bidder while SEBI seemed to favour a hands-off approach . In the future , such friction is expected to increase . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality one can effectively perform the required tasks .

@@8538106 @1738106/ <h> Employment:The termination of the individual employment contract <h> Author : Published : 5 Jul 2000 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> THE LEGISLATION ON THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT <p> The contractual relationship between employer and employee is essentially governed by the Swiss Code of Obligations ( CO ) . The CO is part of the Swiss Civil Code , the most important private law statute . The legislation on the Individual employment contract therefore does not apply to persons employed by organizations such as the state or other public bodies , unless otherwise provided for by public law . <p> Among the different contracts governed by the CO , the Individual employment contract is of the type whose content is extensively regulated . The provisions are either mandatory or optional . No deviation can be made from a variety of mandatory provisions to the detriment of either the employer or the employee -- or to the detriment of the employee only -- by agreement or by collective employment contract . Optional provisions apply if the parties to the employment contract do not deviate by mutual consent . Notwithstanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal compared to the legislation of other European countries . <p> CONCLUSION AND TERM OF THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT <p> The Individual employment contract is deemed to have been entered into as soon as the employer accepts work in his service for a given time , the performance of which , under the circumstances , is only to be expected against wages . The contract is not required to be in a particular form ( Article 320 CO ) . Individual employment contracts are concluded either for a fixed period of time or without a definite period of time . <p> The employment contract for a fixed period of time <p> The term of an employment contract is determined by fixing a time limit , by the purpose of the work or by other circumstances . The end of the specific term agreed upon must be foreseeable for both parties . The employment relationship is automatically terminated at the end of that term . It may not be terminated before the end of that specific term by either party by giving notice . After a maximum term of 10 years each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six months ( Article 334 CO ) . An employment contract for a fixed period of time that is tacitly continued after the expiration of the term becomes an employment contract for an indefinite period of time . <p> The parties to an employment contract may agree upon a ( maximum ) term of the contract combined with the possibility of giving notice before the end of that term . They also may agree upon a minimum term . <p> The employment contract without definite period of time <p> If the term of the contract is not clearly defined or foreseeable for both parties , the employment contract is deemed to be concluded for an indefinite period of time . Such employment relationship can be terminated by either party by giving notice . <p> As set forth below , various detailed provisions in the CO regulate the notice of termination . However either party to the employment contract is in principle free to give notice at any time -- irrespective of the employee 's age -- observing contractual or legal notice periods ( freedom of giving notice ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination <p> In practice the ( ordinary ) termination by giving notice is by far the most frequent way of terminating employment relationships . Any Individual employment contract concluded for an indefinite period of time is subject to ordinary termination by either party . <p> Notice periods <p> Unless otherwise stipulated in the contract by written agreement , the notice periods are of one month during the first year of service , of two months in the second and up to and including the ninth year of service and of three months thereafter . The termination date is at the end of a month ( optional provisions ) . A minimum notice period of one month may only be reduced by collective employment contract and only for the first year of service . As a principle the notice periods do not differ for the employer and the employee ( mandatory provisions ) . <p> Individual and collective employment contracts often alter the term of notice periods whereas an alteration of the termination date other than the end of a month is unusual . An extension of the legal term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . The term of notice periods then is of six months or an even longer period . <p> Restrictions to the freedom of giving notice <p> Notice of termination at an improper time <p> The employee is protected from dismissal during a certain period -- the forbidden period . The employer must not give notice during forbidden periods such as <p> the employee 's pregnancy and the 16 weeks following confinement ; <p> a period of 30 days in the first year of service , of 90 days in the second year until and including the fifth year of service and of 180 days as of the sixth year of service , if the employee is fully or partially prevented from working due to illness or accident ; <p> the employee 's performance of compulsory military or civil defence service , provided such service lasts more than 12 days , as well as four weeks prior to and four weeks following such service . <p> The notice given by the employer during a forbidden period is null and void . It has to be given again once such period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious illness may continue , but once the forbidden period has expired ( maximum term of 180 days ) , the employer may validly give notice . However , each single situation gives rise to a separate forbidden period . Thus , the employee who has an accident just after recovering from an illness is protected by a new forbidden period whereas if he falls i 'll under the same illness he is not protected . <p> If notice is given prior to the beginning of a forbidden period and if the notice period has not yet expired , the expiration of the notice period is suspended and continues only after the termination of the forbidden period . The suspension of a notice period due to an illness might be a few days . Since in the majority of employment relationships , the termination date is at the end of a month , a brief suspension of a few days can cause an extension of the term of contract by one month . <p> Abusive notice of termination <p> A notice of termination given for certain reasons specified by the CO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given : <p> because of a quality inherent in the personality of the other party such as age , race , sex , origin or others ; <p> because the other party exercises a constitutional right such as political activity or religious liberty ; <p> to prevent the arising of claims based on the employment contract ; <p> because the other party asserts in good faith claims based on the employment contract ( notice of termination as an act of revenge ) ; <p> because the other party performs compulsory military or civil defence service ; <p> because of the employee 's membership or non-membership to/of an employee 's association or because the employee lawfully exercises a union activity ; <p> during the period , the employee is elected employee representative unless the employer can prove a justified motive for the notice ; or <p> in connection with a mass dismissal , if the employer violates the consultation procedure . <p> Unlike the notice given by the employer during a forbidden period , the abusive notice of termination is valid . The term of the employment relationship is not influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party which abusively gives notice of termination must pay an indemnity to the other party . The indemnity is determined by the judge and can not exceed the employee 's wages for six months ( two months in case of abusive notice of termination in connection with a mass dismissal ) . <p> Swiss Federal Act on the Equal Treatment of Women and Men ( ETA ) <p> The ETA , which entered into force July 1 1996 , aims at furthering the equal treatment of women and men . Employees must not be discriminated against on the basis of their sex . The prohibition against discrimination includes employment , job assignment , remuneration and dismissal . A discrimination may also be caused by sexual harassment . Employees affected by such discrimination may invoke a conciliation authority or bring an action before a court . <p> A notice of termination by the employer may be challenged if it is given following a complaint of discrimination to a superior or following a proceeding initiated by the employee before a conciliation authority or a court , unless the employer can prove justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination is granted during the proceedings and for the six months thereafter . By challenging a notice of termination the employees may request a judgment against the employer ordering the provisional reinstatement of the employees for the duration of the proceedings . Instead of a provisional reinstatement , they may claim an indemnity according to the provisions relating to the abusive notice of termination . Contrary to expectations of trade unions and employee associations , there have been very few actions based on the ETA so far . <p> Termination without notice <p> For valid reasons , both the employee and the employer may at any time terminate the employment relationship without notice . An employment contract without a definite period of time may be terminated with immediate effect as may an employment contract for a fixed period of time . The employment contract may also be terminated with immediate effect after notice of termination has already been given . <p> Any circumstance under which , if existing , the terminating party can not in good faith be expected to continue the employment relationship is considered to be a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion on the existence of such circumstances . The CO does not specify further , what behaviour of the party breaching the employment contract justifies a termination with immediate effect . According to text book writers and case law only a serious fault which destroys the mutual trust may give the other party the right to terminate the contract with immediate effect . The termination without notice is the last resort . <p> If the employer terminates the employment contract with immediate effect without valid reason ( unjustified dismissal ) , the employees will have a claim for compensation equivalent to what they would have earned if the employment relationship had been terminated by observing the notice period or until the expiration of the specified term . Furthermore the judge may oblige the employer to pay an indemnity to the employee . As a rule courts adjudicate such indemnities as a penalty . The indemnity may not exceed the employee 's wage for six months . <p> If the employee terminates the employment contract with immediate effect without a valid reason , the employer has a claim for compensation equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for additional damages being reserved . <p> Termination by agreement <p> An employment contract may at any time be terminated by mutual agreement between the employee and the employer irrespectful of whether the employment contract is concluded with or without definite period of time . In practice termination by agreement is frequently used as an alternative to a termination by giving notice . A termination agreement can also be concluded after notice of termination has already been given by either party . <p> Termination at the end of the specific term agreed upon <p> The employment contract concluded for a fixed period of time is automatically terminated at the end of that specified term agreed upon . The employment relationship then ends irrespective of an actual " forbidden period " , that would render a notice of termination given by the employer null and void . <p> Termination on death of the employee or the employer <p> The employment relationship terminates with the death of the employee . In case of the employer 's death the employment relationship , in principle , is transferred to the employer 's heirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal consideration for the employer . <p> AUTHORS <p> Alfred Blesi <p> Alfred Blesi is an associate of Lenz &amp; Staehelin , Zurich .

What are the applicable rules under Japanese law ? <p> As is the case with other jurisdictions , there are many detailed , complicated regulations under Japanese law that are relevant when inviting Japanese investors to participate in a foreign partnership fund . Various regulations under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ) are relevant to foreign limited partnerships wishing to raise funds in Japan . <p> Here , we discuss those foreign funds ( LPs ) : ( i ) that are formed as limited partnerships ; ( ii ) that are established and managed outside of Japan ; ( iii ) whose general partner ( GP ) is established outside of Japan ; and ( iv ) that invest only in securities , as defined under the FIEA ( as opposed to , for example , commodities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundraising activity in Japan will be conducted through the addition of new limited partners to the foreign LP fund by way of private placement that targets only Japanese institutional investors and not retail investors . <h> Characterisation of fund interest under Japanese law <p> The manner in which foreign LP funds are regulated in Japan is determined by how the interests in the LP fund are characterised under Japanese law . Foreign LP interests are typically categorised as " foreign collective investment scheme interests " , as set forth in Article 2 , Paragraph 2 , Item 6 of the FIEA . This category generally refers to interests in schemes formed under non-Japanese law that involve ( i ) the collection of money from investors ; ( ii ) using such collected money to conduct business ; and ( iii ) the distribution of profits arising out of such business . There are certain specific carve-outs from this category including funds that do not distribute profits to their investors in amounts exceeding those amounts invested . Here , it is assumed that the foreign LP interests will be characterised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Private placement rules <p> Where an offering of foreign LP interest is made in Japan , unless such offering qualifies as a private placement under the FIEA it will be classified as a public offering , which , in principle , will trigger burdensome public disclosure obligations , such as the filing of a securities registration statement . Under the FIEA , foreign collective investment scheme interests such as the foreign LP interests are classified as Type II securities , while the more conventional types of securities , such as stocks , bonds and warrants , are classified as Type I securities . The private placement rules applicable to Type II securities are generally less stringent than the private placement rules applicable to Type I securities . <p> In order for a foreign LP interest offering to qualify as a private placement , the number of investors in Japan that actually acquire the foreign LP interests must be fewer than 500 . There is no restriction with respect to the number of Japanese investors that may be solicited for investment in the foreign LP fund . For the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose restrictions on the transfer or sale of foreign LP interests - the type of investors to whom the foreign LP interests will be offered , whether or not the investors are institutional , sophisticated or professional investors , is irrelevant . <p> If the offering qualifies as a private placement , the offered investors must be advised at the time of the solicitation that the offering qualifies as a private placement and , therefore , will not be registered under the FIEA , and that the foreign LP interests are categorised as foreign collective investment scheme interests as set forth in Article 2 , Paragraph 2 , Item 6 of the FIEA . A document setting forth this information must be submitted to the investors concurrently with or before their acquisition of the interests . <p> If the total number of investors in Japan holding foreign LP interests is 500 or more as at the end of the business year of the GP , the GP will , in principle , become subject to disclosure obligations as set forth in the FIEA , including being required to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously monitor the total number of investors in Japan that hold foreign LP interests to ensure that such number remains fewer than 500 at all times . <h> Investment management business regulations <p> If an investor in Japan acquires a foreign LP interest and enters into a limited partnership agreement with the GP , the GP will ( subject to certain exemptions ) be engaging in an investment management business and become subject to the regulations under the FIEA . The GP will be subject to the investment management business regulations under the FIEA even if it delegates the investment management of the assets of the foreign LP fund to an investment manager outside Japan . This is because , under the FIEA , the GP will be considered ultimately responsible for managing the assets of the foreign LP fund on behalf of the investors in Japan . Even if all of the investment management activities of the foreign LP fund are conducted outside of Japan , the GP will nevertheless be subject to these FIEA regulations because the GP will be the direct contracting party with the investors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management to an investment manager outside Japan , the delegated investment manager will not be subject to the investment management business regulations under the FIEA , because the investment manager 's direct contracting party is the GP , and not the investor in Japan . <p> If the GP engages in an investment management business , it must , in principle , register as an investment manager in accordance with the provisions of the FIEA . The registration requirements and other obligations imposed on a registered investment manager under the FIEA are not insignificant . For example , in order for the GP to register as an investment manager the GP must satisfy certain criteria , including that the GP 's stated capital is equivalent to at least 50 million ( $648,600 ) and the corporate form of the GP is equivalent to that of a Japanese joint-stock company ( kabushiki kaisha ) with a board of directors . Once registered , the GP must comply with various professional code of conduct rules , and its business activities will be restricted to those specifically enumerated under the FIEA . Determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GP is , therefore , one of the key issues when inviting investors in Japan into a foreign LP fund . <p> An amendment to the FIEA , scheduled to take effect on April 1 2012 , will introduce a new investment management business category of an investment management business for qualified investors . This category will be subject to reduced registration requirements to encourage new entrants to the market . <p> The new regulations provide that in order to qualify as an investment management business for qualified investors , the total amount of the GP 's assets under management , including not only the assets of the foreign LP fund but also all other assets under the management of the GP , must not exceed 20 billion . Additionally , all of the clients/investors , as defined by law , with respect to the assets under GP management must be qualified investors . <p> The concept of qualified investors is a new development to the FIEA that will be introduced by the amendment , which includes within its scope qualified institutional investors ( QII ) and certain other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investment management business for qualified investors , it will be able to take advantage of reduced registration requirements . For example , the minimum stated capital requirement of the GP will be lowered to 10 million and it will not be necessary for the GP to have a board of directors , provided it has a corporate auditor , or an equivalent thereto . The GP will nevertheless be required to register under the FIEA and comply with the same regulations as a standard registered investment manager , including the various professional code of conduct rules and scope of business restrictions . <p> The FIEA provides an exemption from the investment management business registration requirement where : ( i ) all of the foreign LP fund investors in Japan are QIIs , or , in certain cases , fund managers operating under the special exempted QII business rules as described below ; ( ii ) the total number of foreign LP fund investors in Japan , which , in certain prescribed cases , will include indirect investors , is less than 10 ; and ( iii ) the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total amount of contributions in the foreign LP fund . <p> If the foreign LP fund satisfies these three criteria , the GP will not be subject to any registration or notification requirements under the FIEA as an operator of an investment management business . It is important to note , however , that in order to remain exempt from the FIEA investment management business regulations , the GP must ensure that the foreign LP fund continues to meet the criteria . This exemption may be an option if the foreign LP fund is an existing fund wishing to raise only limited funds from a limited number of institutional investors in Japan . <h> Securities business regulations <p> Where an offering of foreign LP interest is made in Japan , the entity that conducts the solicitation process in Japan will generally be regarded as being engaged in a securities business , as regulated under the FIEA . If the GP solicits investors in Japan to invest in the foreign LP fund , the GP will generally be regarded as being engaged in a securities business . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party then it will be that third party , and not the GP , that will generally be regarded as being engaged in a securities business . <p> As foreign LP interests are classified as Type II securities , the party conducting the solicitation process must be registered as a Type II financial instruments business operator under the FIEA . The registration requirements for a Type II financial instruments business operator are less stringent than the investment management business registration requirements . For example , an applicant seeking registration as a Type II financial instruments business operator must have a stated capital equivalent to at least 10 million , but there is no restriction as to corporate form . Even if registered as a Type II financial instruments business operator , the registered entity will be able to engage in other businesses . The registered entity will , however , be required to comply with various professional code of conduct rules and be subject to the supervision and inspection authorities of the Financial Services Agency of Japan ( JFST ) . As discussed above , the GP will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it delegates all solicitation activities to a third party . <h> Special exempted QII business <p> The FIEA provides a special exemption from the investment management business and Type II financial instruments business registration requirements , which is available for the GP . This exemption is only available for the GP , and is not available to a third party , if any , to which the solicitation of the foreign LP interests is delegated . In order for the GP to qualify for this exemption , the foreign LP fund must meet a number of criteria ( see box ) . <p> The FIEA defines QIIs to include , among others , banks , insurance companies , securities firms and investment management companies licensed in Japan , as well as those Japanese pension funds and Japanese corporations that hold assets exceeding a prescribed value threshold and have submitted notification to the JFST with respect to same .

This notification , which may be prepared in English , must include certain information concerning the GP , such as its name , amount of stated capital , names of officers and certain key employees and the location of its principal office . This notification must be updated without delay if there is any change to the information contained in the notification . <p> An additional amendment , which is scheduled to take effect on April 1 2012 , will expand the information that the GP must provide to the KLFB in the notification . Pursuant to the amendment , the notification will also need to include the name of the foreign LP interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP fund that is a QII . A registration certificate of the GP will also need to be attached to the notification . There is no specific requirement as to which QII must be named in the notification . Although the notification , in principle , will not be publicly disclosed on the JFST or KLFB website , the GP will need to consider which QII to disclose in the notification , including ensuring that the QII authorises the disclosure of its name in the notification . Further , as the GP is required to update such notification whenever a change occurs , if the named QII ceases to hold the foreign LP interest the GP will need to submit an amended notification that discloses the name of another QII . <p> Under such exemption , the professional code of conduct rules applicable to FIEA-registered entities will generally not be applicable to the GP , except for certain limited rules such as the prohibition against providing false information to customers and the prohibition against improper compensation of investment loss . As a notifying entity , however , the GP will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Tailor-made approach <p> The manner in which a foreign LP fund will be treated under Japanese securities regulations will be determined based upon various factors , such as the fund structure , fund size , number and type of Japanese investors and size of fundraising in Japan .

For example , the Financial Instruments Sales Act , which sets forth certain risk explanation requirements , and the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds , which sets forth certain customer identification obligations , will also be relevant to a foreign LP fund seeking to raise funds in Japan . <p> Where a foreign LP fund wishes to raise funds in Japan it will be necessary to conduct a careful legal analysis to determine the most efficient way to achieve its goals while complying with the various Japanese legislative requirements . <p> Criteria for qualification for special exemption under the FIEA <p> At least one of the investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QII ; <p> The number of non-QII investors in Japan is 49 or less ; <p> In the case of certain fund-of-funds , subject to certain exemptions ( such as where a sub-fund is a limited partnership and the total number of non-QII investors in Japan in the foreign LP fund and the sub-fund is 49 or less ) , no non-QII investor is an investor in the sub-funds of the foreign LP fund ; <p> A six-month look-back rule will apply when calculating the number of non-QII investors in ( ii ) and ( iii ) above if the subject foreign LP interests were previously issued in Japan ; <p> The offering of the foreign LP interest qualifies as a private placement ( the number of investors in Japan who acquire the offered interests is fewer than 500 ) ; and <p> The limited partnership agreement with respect to the foreign LP fund provides that if an investor is a QII , it may not transfer the interest to a non-QII , and if an investor is a non-QII , it may not transfer the interest to any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lot . <p> Note : Criteria ( iv ) - ( vi ) only apply if the GP is seeking to be exempt from the Type II financial instruments business registration requirements . <p> Kensuke Suzuki <p> Kensuke Suzuki is a partner of Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu .

Foreign investment contracts are governed by Chilean law , are subject to the jurisdiction of Chilean courts and may not be unilaterally modified by the Republic of Chile . <p> Furthermore , Decree Law 600 grants foreign investors additional protection against discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis domestic investors by stating that foreign investors and local companies receiving foreign investments are subject to the general provisions of law applicable to domestic investors and that no discrimination , direct or indirect , may be made against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be enacted to limit foreign investor access to local financing .

Thus , any single shareholder limited liability company , irrespective of the jurisdiction where it is incorporated , may not become the sole shareholder of a limited liability company organised under Czech law . On the contrary , if a Czech single shareholder limited liability company becomes the sole shareholder of a limited liability company incorporated outside the territory of the Czech Republic , the prohibition resulting from the Czech Commercial Code will not apply , and the legal feasibility of the structure will be considered exclusively pursuant to the laws of the place of incorporation of the foreign subsidiary . <p> A breach of the prohibition on chains of single shareholder companies has fundamental legal consequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition is deemed invalid . As a result of such invalidity , the subsidiary will not be eligible for registration with the Commercial Register , and therefore its sole shareholder or any person acting on behalf of the invalid subsidiary will be directly liable for the acts effected by the invalid subsidiary . If the breach of the prohibition is discovered after the registration of the subsidiary in the Commercial Register , the courts are obligated to declare the subsidiary invalid and order its liquidation . <p> To prevent a breach of the prohibition , notaries and registration courts require evidence of the fact that the foreign founder of a Czech limited liability company or the foreign purchaser of 100% of its shares is not a single shareholder limited liability company . Typically , this may be evidenced by registry extracts or articles . As already noted , the prohibition does not apply to joint-stock companies . Czech registration courts have the competence to decide whether the legal form of a foreign sole shareholder corresponds to the legal form of a limited liability company pursuant to Czech law . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company types listed in the Twelfth Directive as limited liability companies will be considered to be subject to the prohibition . The form of companies organised under the laws of other jurisdictions is assessed on a case-by-case basis . <p> The exterritorial effect of the Czech prohibition of a chain of single shareholder companies may be easily overcome by establishing a Czech subsidiary in the form of a joint-stock company instead of a limited liability company . However , the corporate administration of a joint stock company is more complicated than that of a limited liability company . Another solution is to install more than one shareholder at the Czech subsidiary . Again , this increases the cost of administration of the participation because the decision-making of two or more shareholders , though they are affiliated , is more complex in terms of documentation requirements than the decision-making of a single shareholder . 
@@8538118 @1738118/ <h> Brexit 's implications for merger control <h> Author : Published : 26 Sep 2016 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The EU 's one-stop shop principle for concentrations faces an uncertain future following for the UK 's Brexit decision . Several scenarios could play out <p> Ever since the UK 's vote to leave the European Union in the referendum of June 23 2016 , newspapers and bulletins in the UK and internationally have been filled with articles analysing the potential impact of Brexit . <p> Among the myriad of questions that arise as a result of the outcome of the UK referendum is what the implications will be for merger control . In particular , what will the impact be for : <p> the one-stop-shop principle that lies at the heart of EU merger control ? <p> the test that will be used to assess transactions going forward - in particular , will post-Brexit UK seek to apply a stronger industrial policy-based approach to mergers and acquisitions than is currently the case ? and <p> the institutions that will be called upon to review mergers that fall within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the core principles of the EU Merger Regulation ( EUMR ) is that the European Commission is exclusively competent to investigate concentrations ( i.e. mergers , acquisitions and certain types of joint ventures ) that exceed either of the two turnover thresholds set out in articles 1(2) and 1(3) EUMR and therefore have a " Community dimension " . This " one-stop-shop " principle is highly valued by the business community as it reduces the regulatory burden . This has become all the more important given the proliferation of national merger control regimes over the last decade . The question therefore arises whether transactions involving both the UK and the EU would , post-Brexit , lose this significant benefit . <p> The answer to this question , as with most Brexit-related questions , depends on what form the post-Brexit UK/EU relationship will take . The various possible options and permutations that have been mooted broadly fall in one of the following three categories : <p> The UK leaves the EU but adopts a Norwegian style solution by becoming member of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The UK and the EU adopt a solution which allows the UK some , but not full , access to the single market ( this could entail the adoption of a Swiss type arrangement , or a UK specific deal ) . <p> The UK withdraws from the single market and falls back on World Trade Organization principles . <h> " If the UK were not to become a member of the EEA , the one-stop-principle would likely cease to apply , irrespective of whether the UK were to seek a degree of access to the single market , or withdrew fully from it " <p> If the UK becomes an EEA member , the changes to merger control as a result of Brexit would be relatively limited . In accordance with article 57(2) of the EEA Treaty , the Commission has exclusive competence to assess , in certain circumstances in cooperation with the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) Surveillance Authority , the impact within the EEA of a transaction that meets the EUMR thresholds and therefore has a Community dimension . However , UK turnover would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thresholds set out in EUMR are met . The following scenarios can therefore be distinguished . First , the turnover generated by the relevant parties worldwide and in the remaining 27 EU member states is sufficient to meet the EUMR thresholds . In such a situation , the current regime where the Commission has exclusive competence to investigate the deal would continue to apply and the Commission 's investigation would cover the effects of the proposed transaction in the EEA , including the UK . Secondly , where the proposed transaction does not meet the EU thresholds , it would fall within the jurisdiction of the UK 's Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) if the jurisdictional criteria of UK merger control are met , unless the transaction has an EFTA ( but not EU ) dimension as defined in article 57 and annex XIV to the EEA Treaty . In that case , the EFTA Surveillance Authority would be competent to review the transaction . To date , there have been no transactions with an EFTA ( but not EU ) dimension , but accession of the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the chances of this happening . <p> If the UK were not to become a member of the EEA , the one-stop-principle would most likely cease to apply . This is irrespective of whether the UK were to seek a degree of ( but not full ) access to the single market , or withdrew fully from it . In this scenario , a significant number of transactions would likely fall within the jurisdiction of an additional competition authority , the CMA . However , not all transactions falling within the scope of UK merger control rules would lead to an extra investigation ; given that the UK regime is voluntary parties would be able to opt not to notify their transaction , although the CMA has the power to open an ex officio investigation . If the parties would decide to notify , a fee would be payable . This is in contrast with the EU system where no filing fee applies . <p> Where a transaction would be reviewed simultaneously by the CMA and the Commission , the two authorities would almost certainly cooperate closely to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedies , as the Commission currently does with a number of other authorities across the globe such as the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission , Brazil 's Administrative Council for Economic Defence ( known as CADE ) , and others . However , while such cooperation would certainly be both helpful and desirable , it would not replace the advantages of the current one-stop-shop regime . <h> Towards a greater industrial policy ? <p> In accordance with article 2 of the EUMR , the substantive investigation of a proposed transaction focusses on whether or not it would result in a " significant impediment of effective competition " ( commonly referred to as the SIEC test ) . The test is therefore narrow in scope and does not include wider policy considerations , such as , for example , employment , environment or privacy protection . Article 21(4) EUMR allows member states to adopt measures that are required to safeguard national security , media plurality or prudential rules . However , the application of article 21(4) is strict and the Commission has in the past taken action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , when the Portuguese government sought to prevent Secil and Holderbank from acquiring the Portuguese cement company Cimpor on the grounds that it would be against Portuguese economic policy , the Commission required the Portuguese government to withdraw its objection as none of the three grounds identified in article 21(4) EUMR applied . <p> The Commission has also consistently made it clear in statements and speeches that it intends to remain vigilant to ensure that the mechanism of article 21(4) EUMR is not used as a pretext to impose national protectionist measures . <h> " The UK has been a strong advocate of an effects based M&amp;A assessment while certain other continental EU jurisdictions have tended to be more structuralist in their approach " <p> In her speech of July 11 2016 , when it was confirmed she had won the conservative party leadership race and would therefore replace David Cameron as UK prime minister , Theresa May stated that : " Because as we saw when Cadbury 's " that great Birmingham company " was bought by Kraft , or when AstraZeneca was almost sold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's money " are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close . Workers have a stake , local communities have a stake , and often the whole country has a stake . It is hard to think of an industry of greater strategic importance to Britain than its pharmaceutical industry , and AstraZeneca is one of the jewels in its crown . Yet two years ago the Government almost allowed AstraZeneca to be sold to Pfizer , the US company with a track record of asset stripping and whose self-confessed attraction to the deal was to avoid tax . A proper industrial strategy would n't automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones , but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain . " <p> Can it therefore be expected that post Brexit , the UK will adopt a more industrial policy focussed approach to possible transactions ? A number of politicians have certainly called for this in the past . Cadbury 's takeover by Kraft prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call for the re-introduction of a wider public interest test . In 2014 , in his then role as business secretary , Cable was reported in the press as seeking to strengthen the takeover rules which he had concluded were inadequate in the light of Pfizer 's bid for Astra Zeneca . Chucka Umunna , then Labour shadow business secretary agreed and offered cross-party support for an initiative to change the law . <p> The scope for a more industrial policy based approach will depend on the form the UK-EU arrangement takes post-Brexit . If the UK becomes an EEA member , the EUMR rules will continue to apply to most transactions that currently fall within its scope and any possible change in policy would apply only to transactions that are caught by UK merger control rules . There would be greater scope for a wider public interest based approach to mergers and acquisitions if the UK and EU come to a looser Brexit arrangement . <p> However , even if that were the case , and the UK were to allow for increased public interest based intervention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited . Indeed , it is noteworthy in this context that the UK Enterprise Act replaced the public interest test that was provided for in the Fair Trading Act with a more narrowly focussed substantial lessening of competition test . Intervention on public interest grounds is possible , but only where concerns arise relating to national security , plurality of the media or stability of the UK financial system . The UK therefore independently adopted a position that is very similar to that of the EUMR . Moreover , on July 18 2016 , the Japanese company Softbank acquired the Cambridge-based technology company ARM without any concerns being raised by the UK government . On the contrary , the transaction was hailed as being " in the national interest " . While Softbank 's chairman and CEO was reported as having made a phone call to the UK 's new prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer , offering a series of legally binding assurances to maintain ARM 's headquarters , double its UK-based staff over the next five years and increase its overseas headcount , the enforceability in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen how aggressive the UK will actually be in pursuing a " proper industrial strategy " . <h> Institutional impact of Brexit <p> Absent membership of the EEA , Brexit is likely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of cases reviewed by the CMA . However , concerns have been raised as to whether the CMA would be able to cope with such an increase of cases as it merger team is currently already fairly stretched . A considerable increase in the volume of cases may even eventually lead to a revision of the UK 's jurisdictional criteria as a way to limit the number of transactions capable of review . <p> But the CMA is not the only institution potentially impacted by Brexit . If the UK were to become an EEA member , given the size of the UK market , there may in the future be a number of cases that have an EFTA ( but not EU ) dimension . As the EFTA Surveillance Authority is competent to review such transactions , an expansion of their merger team may be required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an effects based assessment of mergers and acquisitions , while certain other continental European jurisdictions have tended to be more structuralist in their approach . There is therefore at least a potential risk that post-Brexit the Commission 's assessment may over time shift towards such a more formal approach . <p> As is clear from the issues discussed above , while it is easy to raise the question as to what the impact of Brexit on merger control is likely to be , it is very difficult to predict with any degree of certainty what the likely outcome will be . At one end of the spectrum , the impact on merger control may be limited if the UK opts to become a member of the EEA . However , if no such solution is adopted , the impact will be more pronounced . The degree to which merger control will change in practice will , however , only become clearer when the likely contours of the post Brexit UK/EU framework become more defined .

In particular , there has been considerable pressure on Canadian resource companies to achieve the critical mass necessary to compete globally . <p> Many foreign companies with minority-held public Canadian subsidiaries have been pursuing various types of going private transactions to eliminate minority Canadian shareholdings . This is being driven in part by Nafta , which has provided opportunities for businesses to reallocate production within the continent more efficiently but has also increased the potential for conflicts of interest between a parent and a minority-held subsidiary . Minority shareholders have typically obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intermediate international mining companies formed over the past several years are based in Canada and listed on the Toronto , Vancouver or Alberta stock exchanges . Most of these companies are exploring in Latin America , Africa , Asia and the CIS countries , but have chosen to locate in Canada to access the large available pools of mining expertise and speculative mining capital . Increasingly , large international mining firms appear to be relying on the smaller exploration companies to discover new mineral deposits , and focusing on applying their large capital resources and development expertise to bring such deposits into production . This had led to a number of acquisitions and other transactions involving successful junior and intermediate mining companies . <h> Acquisition and merger structures <p> An acquisition or merger involving a Canadian public company is generally accomplished by way of a formal public takeover bid , private share acquisitions , or an agreed amalgamation or court-approved arrangement transaction . <p> Formal takeover bid . Where a bidder offers to acquire voting or equity securities of a Canadian public company and the number of shares sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exceeds 20% of the outstanding shares of the target ( 10% in the case of federally-incorporated companies ) , the Canadian takeover bid rules apply . These rules are designed to ensure that all shareholders are treated equally and receive adequate disclosure on a timely basis . <p> Unless the takeover bid is exempt ( see below ) , the bidder must make an identical offer to all shareholders . In particular , all shareholders must receive the same price . Side deals designed to enhance the consideration paid to certain vendors are not permitted , although securities regulators will permit collateral agreements that have a legitimate business purpose ( for example employment contracts with senior officers of a target who are also shareholders ) . <p> A bid must be open for acceptance for at least 21 calendar days . Some consideration is being given by the regulatory authorities to extending this period . Deposited shares may be withdrawn before the expiry of the 21st day and after 45 days from the date of the bid . Partial bids are permitted , provided shares are taken up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conditions , except as to financing . <p> A bidder must send an offer document to the target 's shareholders containing the terms of the bid and , if the bidder is offering its own securities as consideration , prospectus-level disclosure concerning its business and capital . The Canada-US multi-jurisdictional disclosure system ( MJDS ) permits a bid for a US company with Canadian shareholders holding less than 40% of its shares to be made in accordance with US takeover bid rules . <p> Private acquisitions and other exempt bids . Canadian securities laws exempt from the takeover bid rules ( including the requirement to make an offer to all shareholders ) private purchases from not more than five persons where the value of the consideration paid for the shares does not exceed 115% of their market price ( as defined ) . A further exemption is available where a bid is made in compliance with the laws of an approved foreign jurisdiction and the number of Canadian shareholders and the size of their holdings are relatively small . <p> Amalgamations . Canadian corporate legislation permits an amalgamation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the shares of each of the amalgamating companies are exchanged for new shares in the merged entity based on agreed exchange ratios . An amalgamation can be used to effect a range of transactions including a merger of equals , an agreed acquisition of control or a squeeze out of minority shareholders ( see below ) . An amalgamation requires the approval of shareholders of each amalgamating company holding 66.66% of the shares voted at a special meeting called to consider the transaction . <p> If any of the amalgamating companies is publicly-held , a proxy circular must be sent to its shareholders containing prospectus-level disclosure concerning the parties to the merger and the financial and other terms of the amalgamation . The board of directors will typically obtain an opinion from an investment dealer that the amalgamation , including the proposed share exchange ratio , is fair to shareholders from a financial point of view . <p> Arrangements . Where a corporate combination , divestiture , restructuring or similar transaction can not be accomplished under a conventional structure because it requires a series of complicated interdependent steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arrangements are used routinely in connection with cross-border mergers and other corporate restructurings . The procedure is also a useful way of implementing multi-step transactions where the parties do not wish to complete any step unless completion of the entire transaction is assured . <p> A court will generally require that each group of affected security holders approve an arrangement prior to the court granting its final approval . Once shareholder approval has been obtained , and provided the transaction is being implemented for valid business reasons , final approval is usually granted . <p> Lock-up agreements . Bidders will often want to lock-up significant shareholders of a target before making a formal bid . Lock-up agreements oblige a shareholder to tender his or her shares to a general offer made by the bidder to all shareholders . A lock-up agreement should not confer any benefit on the shareholder that will not be made available equally to all shareholders of the target . Locked-up shares can not subsequently be voted in connection with the approval of a second-stage going private amalgamation squeeze out ( see below ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe-hold in the target before launching a formal bid . There are a number of important considerations when acquiring shares in this way . <p> A person that acquires ownership or control of 10% or more of the voting or equity securities of a Canadian public company must comply with early warning rules . Under these rules , once the 10% level is reached , it is necessary to file a press release and statutory report disclosing the purchaser 's intention to make further acquisitions . Similar procedures apply each time a further 2% is purchased , until the 20% level is reached ( at which point the takeover bid rules apply ) . After each filing , a one day cooling-off period applies when further share acquisitions are prohibited . <p> A person making a formal bid to all shareholders must offer to pay a price that is at least as high as the highest price paid in any private acquisitions made by him during the previous 90-day period . <p> Shares held by a bidder before making a formal bid can not be voted in connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see below ) . <p> Takeover bid defence tactics . Canadian securities regulators have made it clear that the takeover bid rules are intended to encourage unrestricted auctions for a target 's shares . There is no fixed code of conduct applicable to a target 's directors ( other than compliance with their general fiduciary obligations ) , but securities regulators will intervene to correct behaviour that is abusive to shareholders ' interests or is likely to deny or severely limit the ability of shareholders to respond to a takeover bid . <p> Poison pills . Many widely-held Canadian companies have adopted shareholder rights plans or ' poison pills ' . These plans , which result in massive dilution for a bidder that fails strictly to comply with their provisions , are designed to enable the directors of a target company to control the bidding process and explore options for maximizing shareholder value . <p> Most poison pills allow a bidder to make a permitted bid that complies with various criteria without triggering the pill . Often , a permitted bid must be <p> an all shares offer to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding less than 5% of the target 's shares ; and <p> open for a period that exceeds the 21-day statutory minimum ( anywhere from 40 to 120 days ) . <p> It is essential that a prospective bidder take legal advice before it acquires a significant stake in a company that has adopted a poison pill . <p> Many Canadian poison pills do not allow a bidder to make a permitted bid if it holds more than a certain amount of the company 's shares ( often 5% ) . <p> Canadian securities regulators will strike down a poison pill that has served its purpose of encouraging an auction to develop ( generally , after a bid has been open for about two months ) , particularly if the bid is supported by the target 's institutional shareholders . <p> Elimination of minority shareholders . A bidder who acquires 90% of the shares of a target under a formal offer made to all shareholders can use a statutory compulsory acquisition procedure to eliminate the remaining shareholders . <p> Where the 90% level is not achieved , or a prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority shareholders are available including an amalgamation squeeze-out procedure . Such transactions are subject to rules designed to ensure procedural and substantive fairness , including majority of minority approval by the shareholders being eliminated . <h> Foreign investment laws <p> Canada 's foreign investment review procedures require notifications and often extensive filings with the federal authorities , but do not normally prevent the acquisition by foreign entities of Canadian businesses , except those operating in cultural and certain other sensitive industries .

Outsourcing offers a cost-efficient business by preventing time loss . The Banking Law and the related legislation recently enacted comprise provisions with respect to outsourcing in light of global trends . The Banking Law provides the definition of outsourcing companies ( supporting service providers ) in Article 3 ; however it leaves the details of application to the secondary legislation . The rules regarding the procurement of outsourcing services by banks and authorisation of the service providers " the Outsourcing Regulation , enacted on November 1 2006 " regulates outsourcing companies and the specifications of outsourced services . <p> In the Banking Law and the Outsourcing Regulation , outsourcing companies provide any services supplementary to or complementing the activities of the banks . But companies providing clearing , custody and central registration services are excluded from the scope of the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services that may be outsourced upon authorisation of the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency ( the BRSA ) as explained below ; but it does list the services that may not be outsourced . Services other than the following may be outsourced to different companies : <p> clearing , custody and central registration services ; <p> services mostly procured from external providers such as consultancy , marketing , security , catering , transportation , promotion of banking services , maintenance and repair of any hardware including automated teller machines ( ATMs ) and point of sale ( POS ) devices , scanning and transfer of banking and credit card application documents to electronic form , delivery of abstracts by hand , and cleaning , not supplementary to or complementary of the activities of the banks ; <p> activities to be executed exclusively by the board of directors or the internal system units . <p> According to a recent amendment made to the Outsourcing Regulation and published in the Official Gazette dated July 24 2007 , the Outsourcing Regulation provides a non-restrictive list of services such as call centres , maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POS device operations , imprinting of banking and credit cards , delivery of abstracts in electronic form , archiving and security services including counting , distribution , delivery , protection of cash , negotiable instruments and precious metals which can be defined as outsourcing services ; however , the providers of such services are not obliged to be authorised by the BRSA . On the whole , the Outsourcing Regulation does not apply to such services ; their providers are only subject to limited supervision of the BRSA , are bound by professional secrecy , and must purchase professional liability insurance to indemnify any losses arising from their activities . <p> Outsourcing in the banking sector is a highly regulated field . Banks wishing to procure such services are obliged to develop a risk management programme defining the services they require , expected benefits , allocation of audit , evaluation , reporting and security duties regarding such services , and a contingency plan in the event that such a service is interrupted . Before the execution of any agreement with outsourcing companies , banks must conduct an evaluation study within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , financial structure , expertise , know-how and personnel for provision of the service . The technical adequacy report to be drawn from the evaluation study is submitted to the audit committee and to the board . When the board assesses the report and the audit committee gives its opinion , the board resolves to execute an agreement with the outsourcing company that it deems adequate . <p> Article 6 of the Outsourcing Regulation sets forth the required conditions for outsourcing companies , for example , a transparent corporate structure , enough technical expertise and hardware , permits and authorisations necessary for business and professional liability insurance . The Article also states that the shareholders , members of the board , auditors and managers must fulfil the requirements sought for the founding shareholders of the banks under Article 8 of the Banking Law . <p> Companies willing to outsource activities to banks must obtain permission from the BRSA . In an application to be filed with the BRSA , banks submit ( i ) the risk management programme ; ( ii ) technical adequacy report ; ( iii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the outsourcing companies , corporate structure and backgrounds of board members , shareholders , auditors and managers ; and ( v ) a notarised copy of the agreement executed with the outsourcing company ( a draft agreement may be submitted if the agreement has not yet been executed ) . In any case , a notarised copy of the executed agreement is to be submitted immediately after execution . The Outsourcing Regulation sets out , in detail , the mandatory content of the agreements to be executed . <p> The authorisation to be granted upon the BRSA 's evaluation of the submitted information and documentation is only valid for the applicant bank . The agreement enters into force upon the delivery of the BRSA 's decision to the relevant parties . <p> The BRSA assumes an active role in every phase of the process . If the parties amend the agreement , except for the mandatory content enumerated under the Outsourcing Regulation , they must inform the BRSA of the relevant amendments within seven days . The BRSA itself is entitled to request any amendments if the provisions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRSA detects any activities of the authorised company that are not in compliance with the Banking Law or the Outsourcing Regulation , or if it does not fulfil the necessary conditions enumerated under the Outsourcing Regulation , or if the company fails to purchase professional liability insurance , the BRSA is entitled to request termination of the agreements . Following such a request , cancellation of the authorisation granted ensues . <p> Regulation of the information systems audit to be carried out by independent audit firms within banks " the Information Systems Audit Regulation " enacted on May 16 2006 and amended by a regulation published in the Official Gazette dated August 17 2006 , governs the audit of the banks ' information systems and financial data production . In the Information Systems Audit Regulation , the information system audit is conducted under three categories : <p> Audit of application controls ( every year ) ; <p> Audit of general control areas ( every two years ) ; <p> A big audit of the above-mentioned areas . <p> The audit of the information systems of a bank is conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BRSA to conduct the audit of the information systems ( the Authorised Company ) . The BRSA is also entitled to cancel the authorisation , on a permanent or temporary basis , if the Authorised Company fails to comply with the provisions of the Information Systems Audit Regulation . <p> The Authorised Company also audits the outsourced services of banks , taking into account the effect of such services on the information systems and financial data production process . The Authorised Company is entitled to review and evaluate the information systems audit report drawn with respect to the outsourcing company . Where the relevant bank has outsourced some of its services , the Authorised Company provides that the agreement executed with the bank comprises provisions ensuring meetings with the outsourcing companies regarding audit issues . <p> Despite the fact that the Outsourcing Regulation includes detailed provisions with respect to the outsourcing , the practice remains ambiguous , as the BRSA has not clarified its approach on the scope of outsourcing . We will soon see how the BRSA distinguishes between the core services of banks and those that are complementary and supplementary to such core services .

This year countries in the EU will implement the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive ( BRRD ) ahead of the January 1 2016 deadline , while other countries in Europe may follow with similar mechanisms . And the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) is expected to release its conclusions to its consultation on total loss-absorbing capacity ( TLAC ) later this year . <p> So far bank resolution has had a significant impact on bank ratings . For example BRRD and other bank resolution regimes have changed base cases regarding likelihood of government support , and how much support an institution might receive . Moody 's , for one , has published a new bank rating methodology that takes into account these changes , as well as to better assess losses expected from creditors throughout a bank 's capital structure . <p> Here , IFLR spoke with Carola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , the Middle East and Africa about the new methodology as well as the global regulatory environment . <h> What are the reforms to the global banking system that may affect Moody 's ratings most at this point , and what are the impacts on banks globally from the multitude of reforms ? <p> There are two reforms that are partly still evolving . One is enhancing financial stability through more and higher quality of capital and other loss-absorbing instruments , and the other is the initiative for bank resolution regimes . <h> " Creditors must make conscious decisions about where they are exposed in the capital structure of banking institutions " <p> These are clearly a consequence of lessons learned during the global financial crisis , and are key to regulatory and legal initiatives impacting banks globally . They do n't only apply to banking systems where resolution regimes are about to be implemented or have been implemented , but given the efforts to enhance financial stability globally , these initiatives do also directly and indirectly affect other banking systems . <p> From the bank perspective , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , and increase the cost of capital generally . They also have broader implications on possible business or organisational realignment that may be necessary in the future . For instance largely diversified banking institutions will see continued pressure on a cost basis . They may also see increasing capital requirements across a variety of countries in which they are doing business , as well as taking into account different resolution regimes . <p> Large active institutions based in the US , EU and other parts of the world will have to adapt and reorganise themselves to respond to resolution requirements in the key markets that they 're operating in . It has cost implications and will challenge how banks set up their businesses globally , and how they operate within particular banking systems as well as across those systems . So far we 've seen announcements by large globally-active institutions that they 're going to revisit their business setup , close down operations in countries , scale back certain business lines as well as other measures . Changes to resolution regimes or coming from resolution elements , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within banking groups have significant implications for the way global banking institutions operate . <p> At the same time that may offer opportunities for more locally focused institutions to grab market share and expand their businesses locally , provided they have the capital to do so . We may see redistribution of market share and leadership positions in certain markets . <p> And from a creditor perspective , previously creditors had the option of either being exposed to insolvency or a bail-out . That was a relatively binary situation , but the bail-out was the option most often applied over the past few years . <p> With the introduction of resolution regimes in many countries and key banking systems , creditors must make conscious decisions about where they are exposed in the capital structure of banking institutions . They must understand what resolution regimes mean for their particular investments in a given country and in various entities of globally active banking groups , and they can no longer rely on a bail-out perspective . Instead they 'll have to bake in potential losses into their investment decision . The risk-return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted " when creditors make new investments . <h> How is Moody 's considering the FSB consultation on TLAC ? What are some of the aspects of the consultation that could affect Moody 's bank rating methodology ? <p> The consultation period ended in February , so we may see some changes in the TLAC rules once the proposals are finalised later this year . Those changes may include more clarity on the required levels necessary for establishing the final TLAC rules , as well as a quantitative impact study and a market survey . <p> We also released a new bank rating methodology . Previously our methodology had two key components : the assessment of the fundamental credit strength of an institution , as well as a joint default analysis , which captured our expectation for systemic support made available for banking institutions . The combination of both led to the final ratings outcome . <h> " In a nutshell , the new methodology is TLAC-ready " <p> The new methodology preserves those components and adds one more . As with the previous methodology , we will start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of failure of the institution . But then we 'll add a second layer " the loss-given failure analysis . That involves an analysis of the entire waterfall of the capital structure , thereby assessing the expected losses of creditors as and when the institution is failing . <p> It clearly captures all the elements that are relevant under the new resolution frameworks . Creditors can now determine the expected losses they may incur depending on whether their securities lie in the capital structure " whether those are very low and are close to equity , or very high and close to secured obligations . <p> There is the third part of a joint default analysis which we preserved . In jurisdictions where resolution frameworks have been implemented , it now takes into account that the likelihood of government support being forthcoming has materially declined . <p> Our new methodology is very flexible to the extent that each security or debt class " and the losses related to those debt classes " can now be assessed on their own merit . So whatever the final TLAC rules may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework . It is independent on what new capital rules or other capital rules may bring . Our new methodology is flexible and can adapt to TLAC or new concepts that have n't yet been put forward because we undergo an entire analysis of the waterfall of claims . <p> In a nutshell , the new methodology is TLAC-ready and ratings will respond to capital structures as banks adopt and respond to regulations . <h> In another reform , has the implementation of the BRRD changed Moody 's views on European banks ? What lessons have been learned from the jurisdictions that have already implemented BRRD ? <p> The implementation of BRRD has changed our view on European banks . Last year when the Directive was approved , we placed a negative outlook on ratings of EU banks that had some degree of government support baked into the ratings . Since then we have engaged in a very intense dialogue with all stakeholders in Europe , including those who crafted BRRD as well as banks and investors affected by BRRD . <p> We have now communicated that we have lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has affected banks in the EU but also those in Switzerland , Norway and Liechtenstein , which are n't EU countries but have adopted or are likely to adopt similar frameworks . <p> Discussions with the regulators have indicated widespread commitment underpinning BRRD . Creditors , including senior unsecured creditors and junior depositors , will in most cases be expected to bear the full cost of recapitalising these banks . <p> Because of our discussions with the official sector as well as the market , we believe that there will likely be less government support " even for the most systemically-important banks " than what we initially expected . <h> What are some of the risks remaining in the global banking system ? <p> Principally we expect greater stability of banks ' fundamental credit strength in 2015 , which is primarily a reflection of significant progress in repairing balance sheets and systems across the globe , which came with a much-enhanced level and loss-absorbing capacity in banks globally . <p> However the macroeconomic outlook is still an area of concern . The economic recovery is still fragile in many countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine banks ' improved credit fundamentals . Areas of concern are slow and uneven economic growth , as well as the potential for interest rate setbacks in different regions . <p> Regional divergence and growth paths could also exacerbate challenges in some systems , particularly with the prospect of rising US policy rates in 2015 . That always has the impact of influencing capital flows and interest rates globally , especially in emerging markets that have generally seen good bank performance over the past year but the impact of rising US interest rates could pressure debt service capacity of borrowers and also slow capital inflows . All those effects could weigh on banks ' asset quality and earnings . <p> And clearly the regulatory landscape continues to evolve . There have been many steps taken to require higher capital and loss-absorbing capacity . TLAC may not be the last ; the Basel Committee has started consulting on the standards for assessing risk-weighted assets under the standard approach versus an internal rating-based approach .

The Ordinance is a response by the French legislator in particular to the issues encountered by debtor companies facing difficulties over the last three years since the introduction of the safeguard proceedings . <p> The Ordinance is principally aimed at making the safeguard proceedings , which came into effect on January 1 2006 , more accessible to companies in difficulty , to clarify the rules governing the composition and operation of creditors ' committees and bondholders , and generally to give flexibility in the mandatairead hoc and conciliation procedures . The Ordinance also clarifies the liabilities and responsibilities of creditors and directors in relation to restructuring and insolvency proceedings . <p> The principal restructuring and insolvency regimes available for a company in France are as follows : special mediation ( mandat ad hoc ) , conciliation proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , rehabilitation proceedings ( redressement judiciaire ) and compulsory liquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) . <h> Insolvency test <p> Whether or not a restructuring procedure is available to a French company in difficulty will very much depend on whether the company is solvent or insolvent . A French company is insolvent ( en Ttat de cessation de paiements ) if it is not able to meet its payment obligations as they fall due for payment with its available assets . This is essentially a cash-flow test . The Ordinance provides that a company will not be insolvent if it can demonstrate that its available credit reserves or any moratoria granted to it by its creditors are such that it can in fact meet its payment obligations that are then due for payment . <h> Special mediation ( mandat ad hoc ) <p> The special mediation procedure was formally introduced into the restructuring and insolvency legislation in July 2005 but has existed in practice for many years . It is a pre-insolvency procedure , which is a confidential and not a public procedure . <p> The legal representative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court to appoint a special mediator ( mandataire ad hoc ) provided that the company is solvent ( not in cessation de paiements , as above ) . The Ordinance provides that the company may choose the mandataire ad hoc that it wishes to appoint when applying to the court . The period for which the special mediator can be appointed is not limited by law but will usually be for three months and may be extended for further periods . <p> The special mediator will report to the president of the court on the economic and financial situation of the company in difficulty and assist the company in seeking an agreement with its creditors . Management of the company remains in the hands of the chairman/board . The special mediation procedure is not coercive and the opening of special mediation proceedings does not give rise to any suspension of creditors ' rights or remedies . In practice , however , the special mediator will ask creditors to standstill to ensure the solvency of the company during the mediation period . <p> If the special mediator 's mission fails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect of the company . Where the special mediator 's mission succeeds , and an agreement is reached between the interested parties , this may be formally endorsed by the court ( homologation ) in conciliation proceedings . <h> Conciliation proceedings ( conciliation ) <p> Conciliation proceedings were introduced by the safeguard legislation of July 2005 . The purpose of conciliation proceedings is essentially to enable the company and its main creditors ( principaux crTanciers ) to come to a restructuring agreement . Conciliation proceedings are available to any company that : <p> encounters legal , economic or financial difficulties , actual or anticipated ; or <p> has not been insolvent ( see paragraph 2 above ) for more than 45 days . <p> The company will be required to provide details of its financial , economic and social situation , including its financing requirements . The conciliator is a facilitator and may be assisted by experts when reporting on the company 's economic and financial situation . The conciliation procedure is limited to four months and may be extended by the court by one month . The Ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the restructuring agreement endorsed ( homologuT ) by the court before the expiry of the conciliation period , this period will be extended until the date on which the court makes its decision formally to endorse the agreement . <p> Management of the company retains control of the debtor during conciliation proceedings . There is no suspension of judicial or legal proceedings during the conciliation period . The French social , tax and public administrations may grant write-offs of their debts as well as payment grace periods ( Articles L 611-7 and L 626-6 of the French Commercial Code ) . <p> The Ordinance provides that where a creditor makes a formal demand ( mise en demeure ) for its debt during the conciliation proceedings , the debtor may make application to the court under Article 1244 and following the French civil code , with a view to obtaining payment grace periods if it wishes . <p> Where a restructuring agreement is reached between the parties to the conciliation proceedings , this may be endorsed at the request of the debtor by the court provided that : <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the restructuring agreement terminates such situation ; <p> the terms and conditions of the restructuring agreement are such as to ensure the continuation of the debtor 's business ; and <p> the restructuring agreement does not prejudice the interests of creditors that are not parties to it . <p> Where the restructuring agreement is endorsed by a court judgment , this is filed with the court as a measure of publicity . The court endorsement of the restructuring agreement reached during the conciliation proceedings will provide protection to creditors in respect of certain lender liability issues . Absent fraud , the date on which a company can be deemed by the court to have been unable to pay its debts as they fell due can not be a date before the date of the court judgment approving the restructuring agreement reached during the conciliation proceedings . <p> New money providers who make credit available within the terms of the court-endorsed restructuring agreement for the purposes of ensuring the continuation of the company 's business during the conciliation period will have priority to claims of creditors ( other than super-priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the date of the opening of the conciliation proceedings if the company is subsequently placed into rehabilitation proceedings , safeguard proceedings or judicial liquidation . Similar provisions also apply to suppliers of new services or assets for such purposes . These provisions do not apply to shareholders making contributions in respect of share capital increases . <p> The Ordinance also extends the benefit of certain provisions that were previously only applicable to the court-endorsed restructuring agreement and that now extend also to the restructuring agreement itself . For example , neither creditors party to the restructuring agreement nor the court-endorsed restructuring agreement can take legal action against the debtor in order to obtain the payment of their debt , and this extends the categories of the guarantors of the debtor that may rely on the restructuring agreement itself . Where the restructuring agreement or the court-endorsed restructuring agreement is subsequently terminated by the court , as a result of non-performance of the restructuring agreement , the court may , but is not obliged to , declare the payments automatically due and payable . <h> Safeguard proceedings ( procTdure de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of survival of a company facing difficulties by anticipating the situation at an early stage and seeking to negotiate a safeguard plan with its creditors to ensure the continuation of the company 's business , to maintain employment and to restructure the company 's indebtedness . Safeguard proceedings have been used successfully in a number of high-profile matters in France , including Eurotunnel . <p> Safeguard proceedings can only be initiated by a debtor company if it is solvent and demonstrates that it is encountering difficulties that it is not able to overcome . The Ordinance has relaxed the conditions for the opening of safeguard proceedings firstly as regards the solvency test and secondly because there is no longer any need for the company to demonstrate that the difficulties that it is facing would lead to it becoming insolvent , as there was previously . This was often difficult to demonstrate where safeguard proceedings were sought at an early stage by the debtor company . From our initial discussions with French judges and practitioners , it seems that the notion of " difficulties " encountered by the debtor company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Where safeguard proceedings are opened , the procedure becomes public knowledge , as it does for rehabilitation proceedings ( redressement judiciaire ) . The court order opening Safeguard Proceedings will result in a freeze on debt payment , acceleration and enforcement of security , as it does for rehabilitation proceedings . The court order will also lead to the appointment of a safeguard administrator whose role it will be to assist the company , but he will not take over the management of the company . <p> A number of measures have been introduced by the Ordinance with a view to making the safeguard proceedings more attractive and more accessible to the debtor company and to seek to clarify the role of the debtor and the safeguard administrator . These include the ability for the debtor to propose a specific safeguard administrator when making an application to the court for the opening of safeguard proceedings and for the debtor to make application to the court to dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business during the safeguard observation period or to seek to substitute security or sell part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard observation period . <p> Further measures , with a view to improving the attractiveness of the safeguard proceedings to French companies in difficulty have also been introduced by the Ordinance . For example , claims that have not been regularly declared by creditors in the safeguard proceedings are inopposable to the debtor company and to certain third-party guarantors and security providers during the execution of the safeguard plan . <p> Where a company has granted fiduciary security ( fiducie svretTs ) over its assets or rights and where the debtor has the right to use those assets or rights pursuant to a use agreement ( convention de mise a disposition ) , the fiduciary security can not be enforced solely as a result of the commencement of safeguard proceedings , the non-payment of debts incurred by the opening of the safeguard proceedings or the adoption by the court of a safeguard plan . Creditors ' that have the benefit of a right of retention ( droit de retention ) pursuant to Article 2286 of the French civil code in respect of certain security are restricted from enforcing their retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the retention right is included in a sale of part of the business . This restriction does not apply to retention rights created as a result of specific legislation . <p> The Ordinance introduces greater flexibility with regard to the payment of debts that were incurred before the opening of the safeguard proceedings ? for example , payments may now be made to exercise a purchase option in a finance lease agreement if it can be demonstrated that exercise of the purchase option is needed for the continuation of the company 's business and is an amount which is less than the market value of the assets subject to the purchase option . <p> Subject to certain thresholds as to a company 's turnover and number of employees , the safeguard legislation provides for two creditors ' committees to be established , a financial institutions creditors ' committee and a trade creditors ' committee . The Ordinance has made significant changes to the composition and rules relating to the committees . The composition of the committees is determined on the basis of the debts incurred before the judgement opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard administrator . <p> The Ordinance provides that a financial institutions creditors ' committee will now be composed of financial institutions ( Ttablissements de credit ) and also creditors that are assimilated to credit financial institution ( to be determined by decree ) . Special rules apply to creditors that hold security by way of a fiducie as regards their inclusion ( or not ) on this committee . <p> Holders of debt transferred to them by financial institutions or assimilated institutions will now automatically be members of the financial institutions ' credit committee . The Ordinance provides that the obligation or , as applicable , the right to be a member of a committee constitutes an accessory to the debt incurred before the opening of the safeguard proceedings and is automatically transferred to each successive holder of the debt , notwithstanding any clause to the contrary . However , the transferee will only be informed of the debtor 's proposals and will only be entitled to vote on these as from the date on which the safeguard administrator has knowledge of the transfer ( the precise method is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the debtor , assisted by the safeguard administrator , which presents proposals to the creditors ' committees . The Ordinance further provides that any creditor that is a committee member may also submit proposals to the debtor and the safeguard administrator . The draft plan proposed to the committees is not subject to certain provisions that apply to creditors that are consulted individually and not consulted in committee . <p> The draft safeguard plan that is put to the committees may include payment grace periods , debt write-offs and , where the debtor company is a company limited by shares and the shareholders support losses in the amount of capital contribution , conversion of debt or bond claims into securities giving access to share capital of the company directly or indirectly . However , the agreement of the shareholders to any such capital conversion will still be necessary . The draft safeguard plan may establish a different treatment between creditors if the situation of the debtor justifies this . In general terms , the plan needs to be made available and be voted on by the creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Creditors ' committees must generally vote on a plan within a period of 20 to 30 days following its receipt . This time period may be increased or reduced ( but not below a minimum 15-day period ) . The decision of each committee to approve the draft plan is taken by a two-thirds ' majority of debt claims of members of that committee that have voted on the debtor 's plan . The Ordinance removes the former requirement of 51% in number of creditors . <p> The threshold for membership of the trade creditors ' committee has been reduced from more than 5% to more than 3% of the aggregate of trade creditors ' claims . <p> Bondholders are not members of the financial institutions creditors ' committee . The Ordinance provides that bondholders are to be consulted in one general meeting of all bondholders in relation to all bonds whether issued in France or abroad . Bondholders vote in a general meeting on the plan that has been adopted by both the creditors ' committees . Bondholders decision is taken by a two-thirds ' majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted at the bondholders ' general meeting on the proposal , notwithstanding any clause to the contrary and independent from any law governing the bond issue . <p> Where the safeguard plan has been adopted by each of the creditors ' committees and , where applicable , by the general meeting of bondholders ( and by shareholders ' meeting in relation to any debt equity conversion ) , the court will ensure that the interests of all of the creditors are sufficiently protected . In this case , the court will approve the safeguard plan , which will become binding on all members of the committees . <p> Creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders will be consulted individually by the mandataire judiciaire in respect of the debtors ' requests for payment delay and/or debt forgiveness . In this case , the safeguard plan can not impose debt forgiveness upon them and the duration of the safeguard plan can not exceed 10 years . The court must impose uniform payment terms subject to the payment of any term debt where longer grace periods were stipulated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can exceed the duration of the plan . The safeguard plan must also provide for an annual payment of no less than 5% of the accepted debt claims to be paid from year three to these creditors . Individual creditors that do not reply to the proposals made by the mandataire judiciaire within 30 days of receipt of its letter are deemed to have accepted these proposals . <p> The French public authorities may grant debt forgiveness ( but not for indirect taxes other than penalties and late interest ) . There are other advantages to safeguard proceedings ? for example , there are no hardening periods , and transactions entered into during the proceedings can not subsequently be challenged . <p> The Ordinance provides that the debtor may apply to convert a safeguard proceedings into administration ( redressement judiciaire ) if the adoption of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the ending of the safeguard proceedings , in a certain manner and within a short period of time , will lead to the company 's insolvency . The Ordinance also provides that where the debtor 's insolvency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , the court , after hearing the public minister , may open administration proceedings or , if the rehabilitation of the company is manifestly impossible , the court may open judicial liquidation proceedings . <h> Rehabilitation proceedings ( redressement judiciaire ) <p> Rehabilitation proceedings are court-based , collective insolvency proceedings that were introduced by Law 85-88 of January 25 1985 ( the 1985 Law ) relating to the judicial rehabilitation and compulsory liquidation of businesses and were completed by Decree 85-1389 of December 27 1985 . The provisions of the 1985 Law were amended in 1994 and 1999 and codified under Book VI and Article L 620-1 to L 628-3 of the French Code of Commerce . The previous legislation was recently modified by Law 2005-845 , dated July 26 2005 , and the enabling Decree 2005-1677 dated December 28 2005 . Rehabilitation proceedings are submitted to the same legal regime as safeguard proceedings unless otherwise specified . <p> Rehabilitation proceedings aim at allowing the survival of a company , the preservation of its activities and employment , and the discharge of its liabilities . The court will order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the debtor is in a state of cessation of payments ( cessation des paiements ) ( as described in paragraph 2 above ) and has not ceased its activities , or if the company is capable of being rehabilitated . Any debtor in a state of cessation of payments will have 45 days to apply to the court to start rehabilitation proceedings or to open conciliation proceedings . If the debtor has ceased its activities or is incapable of being rehabilitated , the court will order the opening of compulsory liquidation proceedings with no period of observation . <p> Unlike safeguard proceedings , a creditor , the public prosecutor or the court are also able to request the opening of rehabilitation proceedings . When opening a rehabilitation procedure , the court will open an observation period for the purpose of assessing the company and either : ( i ) forming a plan for the reconstruction of the company ( plan de redressement ) , which may take the form of a continuation plan or a transfer plan ; or ( ii ) liquidating it under the compulsory liquidation procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the court will appoint three persons with different duties : an administrator ( administrateur judiciaire ) , a representative of the creditors ( reprTsentant des crTanciers ) and a bankruptcy judge ( juge commissaire ) to preside over the administration . The court will also invite the employees to appoint a representative ( reprTsentant des salariTs ) . The court can also appoint one to five controllers ( contr(leurs) among the creditors , who ask to be appointed as such . The controllers are entitled to be informed of the procedure and will be asked to give their opinion before any important decision is taken and also have the power to take certain actions . <p> During the observation period , the debtor usually remains in possession and retains title to its property . The debtor remains in charge of the management of its business in respect of the part that has not been transferred to the administrator in accordance with the court decision . <p> Creditors are barred from taking any legal action against the company to obtain payment for claims that arose before the court order initiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation period , the court will be able to order the transfer of part of the debtor 's business or the start of liquidation proceedings . <h> Compulsory liquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) <p> Compulsory liquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) is one of the two dissolution procedures for companies under French law . It only applies to private entities that have ceased their activities , or that are incapable of being rehabilitated . The court can order the opening of immediate compulsory liquidation proceedings without opening rehabilitation proceedings ( as described above ) , or the company can go into compulsory liquidation following the opening of rehabilitation proceedings . Compulsory liquidation involves the appointment of a liquidator to take control of the company , represent the creditors , and to collect , realise and distribute the company 's assets or the proceeds of its assets . The court decision ordering compulsory liquidation also leads to the immediate dissolution of the company . <h> Sanctions <p> The safeguard legislation of 2005 significantly reduced the grounds upon which creditors ' and directors ' liability could be incurred . The Ordinance provides further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creditors ' liability . For example , the Ordinance provides that , where safeguard , rehabilitation or judicial liquidation proceedings have been opened , creditors may only be liable for fraud , consistent intervention in the management of the debtor , or where the guarantees and security taken are disproportionate to the credit facilities . The previous legislation provided for the disproportionate guarantees or security to be automatically null and void . The Ordinance relaxes this rule and provides that in such case the guarantees and security may be cancelled or reduced by the court , but are not automatically null and void . <p> The Ordinance also clarifies the maximum liability of directors for mismanagement ( faute de gestion ) by limiting the maximum liability to the amount of any insufficiency of assets . The Ordinance also abolishes liability of directors for corporate debts ( dettes sociales ) . <p> Author biography <h> Rod Cork <h> Allen &amp; Overy LLP <p> Rod Cork is a banking partner at Allen &amp; Overy LLP based in the Paris office . <p> Rod has advised commercial lenders , banks , CLOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently been involved in many major French restructurings , refinancings and numerous cross-border restructurings .

The parent company of the SPV would issue a guarantee for the instrument and would make payments to the SPV in consideration for the funds derived from issuing the instrument . In other words , the SPV lends the money to its parent company in exchange for the guarantee and repayments from the parent , which will ultimately be used to pay principal and interest/coupon to the holders .

This is why on July 7 2005 the Indonesian directorate general of taxation issued a circular letter SE-04/PJ.34/2005 that reiterated that payments made to an SPV in the form of interests , dividends and or royalties are subject to the common withholding rate of 20% . SPVs are not beneficial owners and so are not entitled to the benefit of a reduced tax rate under tax treaties to which Indonesia is a party . This policy would increase the cost of borrowing of Indonesian corporations and make issuance of debt instruments more difficult than it already has been . Although this policy does not affect the validity of the transaction , a new structure needs to be established to address this issue .

They were issued only with a fiscal agent and without a commissioned company for bondholders performing a role similar to a bond trustee . <p> Table 1 <p> 1st series bonds 2010 <p> 2nd series bonds 2011 <p> Issue date <p> June 16 2010 <p> July 28 2011 <p> Aggregate principal amount <p> 30 billion <p> 30 billion <p> Issue price <p> 100% <p> 100% <p> Interest rate <p> 0.89% per annum <p> 0.72% per annum <p> Maturity date <p> June 16 2015 <p> July 28 2016 <p> Among the events of default set out in both series were the two events relating to a winding up or dissolution , and a cessation of business . These were : <p> ' an order of a competent court is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding-up or dissolution of the issuer or any similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <p> ' the issuer shall cease or threaten to cease to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business ' . <p> These two default events were the same as those used in euro medium-term note ( EMTN ) bonds issued by Eksportfinans . But while its EMTN programme included a trustee regime , its samurai bonds were issued without a trustee and therefore allowed any bondholder to declare an event of default with respect to its bonds by giving notice to the issuer at the head office of the fiscal agent . <p> Following the announcements in November 2011 by the Norwegian government , Eksportfinans and its largest shareholders concerning the future plans for Eksportfinans , Silver Point declared a default on the samurai bonds by sending a letter to Eksportfinans on December 4 2011 . This claimed that default events had occurred both with respect to a winding up or dissolution , and a cessation of business , as described above . Silver Point demanded immediate repayment with respect to the 2.6 billion of samurai bonds it then held . Thereafter , Silver Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2013 declaring events of default " first with respect to the 8.6 billion of samurai bonds it then held , including the above-mentioned 2.6 billion of bonds , and then with respect to an additional 1 billion of samurai bonds that it subsequently acquired . <p> On November 16 2012 , Silver Point brought an action against Eksportfinans in the Tokyo District Court , demanding repayment of the principal amount of the bonds , which eventually was 9.6 billion , as well as default interest from the day following the respective default declaration dates . On March 28 2014 , the Tokyo District Court issued its ruling , interpreting the language of the two relevant default clauses and finding that neither default event had occurred . <h> The court 's ruling <p> No winding up or dissolution <p> The court first addressed whether the winding up or dissolution default event had occurred as a result of the press release issued by Eksportfinans ' four largest shareholders . Silver Point alleged that this press release made by shareholders holding more than two-thirds of Eksportfinans ' capital amounted to ' similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court held that because the language of the default event clause included references to ' an order of a competent court ' and ' an effective resolution ' , it was appropriate to interpret the phrase ' any similar proceedings ' to mean other legal proceedings for a winding up or dissolution . As a result , the court found that the shareholder press release was merely an expression of opinion and should not be considered to be the equivalent of legal proceedings taken for a winding up or dissolution of Eksportfinans . <p> ' Business ' and ' substantially the whole ' <p> The other issue considered by the court was whether Eksportfinans had ' ceased or threatened to cease to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business ' . The first aspect of this issue centred on the interpretation of ' the whole or substantially the whole of its business ' . This was because Eksportfinans stopped provision of new export lending . The second aspect was the construction of the words ' threaten to cease ' . <p> The court first found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all parties should be governed by and construed in accordance with Japanese law under the provisions of the conditions of the bonds . The court then noted that , in Japan , the term ' business ' generally means ' economic activities conducted on the basis of certain purposes and plans ' . The court also pointed out the interpretation of a ' transfer of business ' under article 467(1) of the Japanese Companies Act . This has been interpreted to mean a transfer of all or a material part of assets organised for a certain business purpose and functioning as an organic unit ( including factual matters that have economic value such as relations with customers ) , which ought to necessitate the duty of non-competition under law ( see judgment of September 22 1965 of the Supreme Court , Grand Bench ; Minshu volume 19 , number 6 , page 1600 ) . <p> Therefore , the court held that it was reasonable to interpret the term ' business ' , as used in the relevant default clause , to mean external economic activities for gaining revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such activities . It also found it reasonable to interpret the meaning of a ' cessation to carry on substantially the whole of its business ' as the occurrence of a situation that may be deemed equivalent to a ' cessation to carry on the whole of its business ' . <p> With regard to Eksportfinans ' export lending , municipal lending and securities activities , although it had ceased new export lending and had come to conduct only management and collection of existing loans in the export lending business , these three activities had characteristics of economic activity for gaining revenue . The court also noted that Eksportfinans had the physical facilities and human resources necessary to perform each of these activities . The court accordingly held that each of these activities could be said to be a ' business ' and that Eksportfinans could not be considered to have ' ceased to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business ' . <p> No ' threat ' to cease business <p> The court then considered whether there was any ' threat ' of Eksportfinans ceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its business . It noted that the relevant default event was one of many default events provided under the same conditions of the samurai bonds . In this regard , the court noted that all of the default events listed were objective events that clearly signalled a deterioration of Eksportfinans ' credit , such as : a failure to pay interest on the samurai bonds ; enforcement of security ; acceleration of due date or a failure in the performance of borrowed money ; continuation of a seizure or the like on a substantial part of assets ; stoppage of payment ; and a petition for bankruptcy , winding up or similar proceedings . The court found that there was no reason to interpret only the event concerning a threat of cessation of business as not requiring any objectivity , and that it should rather be construed as requiring an objective event similar to those described above . Therefore , the court concluded that for it to hold that such a ' threat ' exists , it would need to find that there is an objective event which signals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' business . <h> " The decision of the Tokyo District Court in this case was measured , reasonable and persuasive " <p> The court found that Eksportfinans was conducting management and collection activities with regard to its existing loans , which would continue until 2029 for export lending and until 2033 for municipal lending . It also found that it was actually expected to generate revenues in the future , and that it had newly-acquired loans from a shareholder bank . The court further found that , in relation to its securities business , Eksportfinans had entered into a portfolio hedge agreement with a major shareholder which would terminate in the event of , among other things , the expiry of the covered bonds , expected to occur on December 31 2023 . Considering all the evidence , the court did not find any facts that would indicate that Eksportfinans had any plan to cease its securities business . The court noted a written statement submitted by Eksportfinans ' CEO , which stated that there was a possibility that the company would conduct new business in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Eksportfinans planned to continue its businesses and there was nothing to indicate the actual likelihood that Eksportfinans would cease to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business . <h> Ramifications <p> If a judgment had been made against Eksportfinans , it could have resulted in a cascade of default and cross-default claims against Eksportfinans by the EMTN trustee or multiple creditors . The risk arose from a default claim by essentially a single investor in Eksportfinans ' samurai bonds , even though none of the other samurai bondholders or the trustee of the EMTN programme had declared a default . The existence of a trustee for the EMTN bonds was clearly useful in dealing with an individual bondholder capable of creating a potentially cataclysmic credit event . It will also be useful to require in conditions of bonds a threshold of bond holding who may declare a default . <p> Even though the default provisions at issue in this case were typical of provisions used in bonds issued in European and other international markets , there were surprisingly few interpretive precedents from courts in major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo District Court in this case was measured , reasonable and persuasive should make it a useful precedent for the interpretation of similar default provisions that are used not only in Japan but internationally . <p> Satoshi Nakamura is a partner at Mori Hamada &amp; Matsumoto .

Cognizant of this need , the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has initiated efforts towards promoting good corporate governance . These efforts culminated in the SEC issuing on April 5 2002 the Code of Corporate Governance through SEC Memorandum Circular No 2 , Series of 2002 . <p> Code of Corporate Governance <p> The Code declares its support for the state 's policy of actively promoting corporate governance reforms intended to raise investor confidence and develop capital markets . Entities covered by the Code are corporations whose securities are registered or listed , corporations that are grantees of permits or licences and secondary franchise from the SEC ( such as investment houses and stock brokerage firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiaries of foreign corporations operating in the Philippines whose securities are registered or listed . <p> The Code complements many of the provisions of the Corporation Code of the Philippines and this article focuses on these enhancements . <p> Definition of corporate governance <p> The Code defines corporate governance as a system whereby shareholders , creditors and other stakeholders of a corporation ensure that management enhances the value of the corporation as it competes in an increasingly global marketplace . For this purpose , companies are enjoined to adopt a framework whereby the board of directors , the management and other personnel share responsibility for creating and maintaining an effective and efficient internal control environment . <p> Corporate governance framework <p> Under the Code , a corporation 's internal control environment may be illustrated as shown in Figure 1 . <p> Figure 1 : Internal control environment <p> Board of directors <p> Being primarily responsible for the governance of the corporation , the board of directors must provide an independent check on management . Therefore , the Code requires that two members of a corporation 's board or 20% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be independent directors . An independent director is one who must be independent of management ( ie he is not an officer or employee of the corporation , its parent or subsidiaries ) and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment . <p> An independent director should always be in attendance at board meetings . His attendance is required to constitute a quorum for a board meeting unless he is duly notified of the meeting but deliberately and without justifiable cause fails to attend the meeting . Justifiable causes may only include grave illness or death of immediately family and serious accidents . <p> Absence or non-participation by any director for whatever reason for more than 50% of all board meetings during his incumbency or any 12-month period during his incumbency is a ground for his disqualification at the succeeding election . <p> Board committees <p> To aid in complying with the principles of good corporate governance , the Code directs the board to create an audit committee chaired by an independent director . The committee monitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control system . <p> The board may also constitute a nomination committee to evaluate the qualifications of persons nominated to the board and to other positions requiring appointment by the board and a compensation or remuneration committee to fix the remuneration packages of corporate officers and directors . Both committees must have an independent director as member . <p> Corporate secretary <p> The Code imposes special qualifications on the corporate secretary . He should have the administrative skills of the chief administrative officer , the interpersonal skills of the chief human resources officer , the legal skills of a chief legal officer , the financial and accounting skills of a chief financial officer and the vision and decisiveness of the chief executive officer of the corporation . <p> Compliance officer <p> The Code mandates the chairman of the board to designate a compliance officer , with the rank of vice president or its equivalent , whose main task is to ensure adherence by the corporation to corporate principles and best practices . <p> Information systems <p> The Code obliges management to supply the board , in a timely manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , budgets , forecasts and monthly internal financial statements . The board may have separate and independent access to senior management and the corporate secretary . If necessary in the furtherance of their duties , the board may take independent professional advice at the corporation 's expense . <p> Accountability and audit <p> The Code provides that management is primarily accountable to the board and the board is primarily accountable to the stockholders . While the management of the day-to-day affairs of the corporation is the responsibility of management , the board is , however , responsible for monitoring and overseeing management action . <p> The Code requires the board , through the audit committee , to recommend to the stockholders a duly accredited external auditor to undertake an independent audit and provide an objective assurance on the preparation and presentation of financial statements . The external auditor is prohibited from rendering internal audit services to the same client . The external auditor or the handling partner is required to be rotated or changed every five years or earlier . <p> Disclosure and transparency <p> A dominant theme in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure .

@@8538148 @1738148/ <p> On July 1 2012 , the Act on Special Measures Concerning Procurement of Renewable Electric Energy by Operators of Electric Utilities ( Act on Special Measures ) , which establishes Japan 's feed-in tariff ( FIT ) regime for the promotion of renewable energy , became effective . This new law made an immediate and substantial impact on the renewable energy sector in Japan . According to government reports , by the end of November 2012 more than 187,000 renewable energy generation facilities ( mostly solar photovoltaic facilities ) were certified by the Minister of Economy , Trade and Industry pursuant to the Act ( certified facilities ) , and the aggregated amount of renewable energy produced ( on an output basis ) grew to more than 3,648,000 kW . <p> The FIT regime is not the first regime established in Japan to promote renewable energy and strengthen the country 's energy independence . The Renewable Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) regime was introduced in 2003 by the Act on Special Measures Concerning New Energy Use by Operators of Electric Utilities ( RPS Act ) . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of electricity generated from renewable energy generation facilities . The RPS Act was repealed on July 1 2012 by the implementation of the Act on Special Measures . In addition , a feed-in tariff regime for surplus electricity generated by solar PVs installed on residences was introduced in 2009 under the Act on Sophistication of Energy Supply Structure . The Act on Special Measures was enacted to further promote new investments in renewable energy projects and renewable energy . <h> Framework of the FIT regime <p> Under the FIT regime , utilities are required to purchase electricity generated by certified facilities at certain pre-determined fixed prices for certain fixed periods of time , and to allow certified facilities access to their grid connections , although the Act on Special Measures does allow for certain exceptions . The FIT regime contemplates that the excess cost incurred by utilities under this new arrangement will be recovered through surcharges assessed to consumers of electricity . The Act on Special Measures applies to solar , wind , hydro , geothermal and biomass generated electricity ( renewable electricity ) . <h> Facility certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the FIT regime , its renewable energy generation facility must be certified by the Minister . A facility which has received such certification is defined under the Act on Special Measures as a certified facility and a renewable energy supplier which intends to supply the renewable electricity using a certified facility is defined as a specified supplier . Special purpose vehicles ( SPVs ) are eligible to become specified suppliers . While the specific criteria covering each type of renewable energy source are set out in ministerial ordinances , the following are key criteria applicable to all types of renewable energy sources : <p> The facility must have an appropriate system in place in Japan that enables facility inspections and maintenance for the duration of the purchase period , and facility repairs within three months of the event necessitating such repairs ; <p> The facility must allow for measurements to be taken of the amounts of renewable electricity supplied to utilities ; and <p> The installation and operational costs of the facility must be recorded . <p> If any of the aforesaid criteria fails to remain fulfilled , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price and period <p> In general , initial investments in renewable energy projects are costly and investors must wait a substantial amount of time to recoup their investments through profits generated from such projects . Thus , without assurances regarding the level of achievable profits , investments in renewable energy projects would not likely increase . In this respect , in setting the purchase price , the Minister , who determines the purchase price and period in consultation with ministers of other governmental agencies and the Purchase Price Calculation Committee , an independent committee established by the Diet , must take into account , among other things , the appropriate level of profit for renewable energy suppliers . It should be noted that within the first three years of the enforcement of the Act on Special Measures , the Minister is required to give special consideration to the level of profit for specified suppliers in determining the purchase price in order to intensively promote the use of renewable electricity . For example , the purchase price for electricity generated from solar PV of 10kW or more for the 2012 fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the purchase period was set at 20 years . <p> The Act provides that Minister is to determine the purchase price and period before the start of each fiscal year ( April 1 of each year ) . Thus , it is important for investors to understand which purchase price ( either the purchase price established for that particular fiscal year or to the year thereafter ) is to apply to their projects in order to correctly anticipate the expected cash flow from such projects . The purchase price applicable to a particular project will be determined by the date the renewable energy generation facility is certified by the Minister , or the date of a utility 's receipt of an offer from the renewable energy supplier to enter into a grid connection agreement ( GCA ) , whichever is later . <p> Once the purchase price applicable to the specific project has been determined , it applies continuously throughout the purchase period even if the purchase price is subsequently changed by the Minister as a result of the annual re-evaluation . In exceptional cases , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpired purchase period if " significant changes in economic conditions " have occurred or are likely to occur . According to the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ( METI ) , however , this only applies in extremely exceptional cases such as when there is sharp inflation or deflation . It should be further noted that the purchase price continues to apply even if the initial power purchase agreement ( PPA ) has been terminated and the specified supplier enters into another PPA with a different utility , or ownership of the certified facility is transferred to a third party which then becomes the new specified supplier . <p> According to a public notice issued by the Minister , a purchase period commences on the date when electricity generated from the renewable energy facility is first supplied to the utility pursuant to the applicable PPA . <h> Foreign investment <p> Except for the general requirements under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act , there are no legal restrictions on foreign investments in relation to renewable energy projects in Japan . <h> Implementation of a renewable energy project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIT regime include , among others : ( i ) planning ( for example , determining the specifications of the facility , determining the investment structure , selecting a project site , and conducting preliminary consultations in regards to the grid connection ) ; ( ii ) obtaining necessary approvals ; ( iii ) negotiating and executing project-related agreements ; ( iv ) fundraising ; ( v ) constructing the facility ; and ( vi ) commencing operations of the certified facility . <p> A SPV can serve as a specified supplier that owns and operates a certified facility . One of the most commonly used investment structures in Japan is referred to as the GK-TK structure . Under this structure , a Japanese limited liability company ( godo kaisha ) is first established to serve as the TK operator ( eigyosha ) under a tokumei kumiai agreement ( TK Agreement ) and the owner of the certified facility . Tokumei kumiai investments are then made with the GK as the TK operator , with respect to the TK operator 's business pursuant to the TK Agreement , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If an equity investment was instead to be made by way of a subscription of common shares in a Japanese stock company ( kabushiki kaisha ) which owned the certified facility , the investor would be subject to double taxation ( both at the corporate level and investor/shareholder level ) . Under the GK-TK structure , however , taxable amounts at the corporate level are reduced , and profits gained and losses incurred by the GK as the TK operator are distributed to the tokumei kumiai investors . <p> Under legislation that created a special tax treatment intended to promote investments in environmental related fields in Japan , certain solar PV and wind-power generation facilities which qualify as certified facilities are eligible for immediate depreciation of the entire acquisition price of such facilities subject to certain restrictions prescribed under the applicable tax law . ( The applicable facilities must be acquired between May 29 2012 and March 31 2013 and must be in operation within one year of their respective acquisition date . According to an outline of the proposed tax system revisions for the 2013 fiscal year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two additional years . ) Although detailed tax structuring is indispensable and any tax treatment would also be subject to fulfillment of certain other requirements , it became possible for a tokumei kumiai investor to take advantage of this immediate depreciation benefit at the investor level taxation , through the use of the GK-TK structure . <p> There are three options available under Japanese law to secure a site for a project : ( i ) acquiring ownership of the site , ( ii ) acquiring surface rights to the site ( chijo-ken ) , and ( iii ) acquiring a leasehold right to use the site ( chinshaku-ken ) . <p> Although acquisition of a site is the most assured legal means to secure a site , doing so will increase the initial investment cost . In addition , if the investment is made through a GK-TK structure , a certain regulatory issue in respect of the Real Estate Specified Joint Enterprise Act may arise when disposing of the project site and distributing the profits therefrom to the tokumei kumiai investors at the exit phase . Thus , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land use right ( a surface right or land leasehold right ) for their project . In Japan , land owners are often reluctant to create surface rights over their properties and thus this option may not be possible . Also , a leasehold right may not be suitable since the duration of any such leasehold right may not legally be allowed to exceed 20 years , and the duration of a renewable energy project such as solar PV will likely exceed 20 years taking into account the time required to construct the certified facility . Although the possibility exists that it may be viewed as an improper circumvention of the regulation limiting lease terms to 20 years , one possible idea to address this issue would be to enter into two separate land lease agreements : a short-term land lease agreement for the duration of the construction period , and a long-term land lease agreement for the duration of operation of the project ( in the case of a solar PV , 20 years ) . <p> Further , if the owner of a project site transfers its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leasehold right held by the specified supplier may not be asserted against this third party unless such specified supplier 's leasehold right has been perfected . In order to perfect a leasehold right , registration thereof must be completed . Therefore , when negotiating the terms and conditions of a land lease agreement with the owner of the site , the land owner 's consent to the registration of the SPV 's leasehold right should be required as a covenant to such agreement . <p> In order to benefit from the FIT regime , the renewable energy facility must be certified by the Minister . The certification can be obtained before commencement of the construction of the certified facility . The processing of applying for certification will likely take approximately one month to complete with the exception of biomass facilities which will likely take about two months to complete . <p> Although the applicable regulations and permits may differ depending on the location of the project site or the size of the facility , other laws that may apply to the project include the Electricity Business Act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to conducting a legal due diligence to identify the applicable approvals/permits related to the project , it is advisable that a preliminary consultation with the applicable local government agency be conducted at the planning stage . <p> In the case of a renewable energy generation facility with a certain output capacity , a utility will typically need to conduct a technical analysis regarding the grid connection . In such cases , a preliminary consultation with the utility to address the grid connection is necessary . It normally takes about three months to complete this process . In order to make an offer to enter into the PPA and GCA , this process must be completed . It should be noted , however , that completion of this process is not a prerequisite for a Certification . <p> With regard to negotiation and execution of certain project-related agreements , the following points which pertain to the application of the Act on Special Measures should be considered when preparing project-related agreements . <p> Under the Act on Special Measures , utilities are obliged to enter into PPAs with specified suppliers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the duration of the applicable purchase period , unless certain justifiable exceptions which are specifically provided under the ministerial ordinance , apply . These exceptions include , without limitation , cases where ( a ) entering into the PPA is likely to unreasonably impair the interest of the utilities , ( b ) the specified supplier rejects certain proposed provisions in the PPA , and ( c ) the specified supplier enters into a GCA with a utility that is different from the one with whom the specified supplier entered into the PPA , and ( i ) it is geographically impossible for the utility to access the electricity to be supplied by the specified supplier 's facility , or ( ii ) the contents of the PPA conflict with the terms and conditions of the wheeling service provisions of the utility with whom the specified supplier entered into the GCA . <p> The specified supplier may wish to set out in the PPA that even if " significant changes in economic conditions " occur and the purchase price is amended by the Minister , the purchase price under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doing so would further stabilise the cash flow from the project . Inclusion of such provision in the PPA would , however , likely constitute legitimate grounds for a utility to reject a request to enter into such PPA . <p> Under the FIT regime , the PPA must confer exclusive jurisdiction over the disputes arising therefrom to the courts of Japan , the governing law of the PPA must be the law of Japan , and the PPA must be written in the Japanese language . <p> In an effort to address the possibility that utilities may insist on the use of their standard form PPAs which contain certain provisions that appear to conflict the spirit of the Act , METI published a model power purchase and grid connection agreement ( Model Agreement ) . The Model Agreement was initially designed to be used when the following conditions are met : ( i ) the same utility enters into the PPA and the GCA ; ( ii ) the type of certified facility is either a solar PV or a wind power facility generating 500 kW or more ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before commencing construction of the certified facility ; and ( iv ) acquisition and operational financing is to be acquired from a financial institution . <p> As METI pointed out , the Model Agreement is designed to be used not only when the specified supplier is a SPV but also when such specified supplier is an ordinary Japanese company . Thus , in raising funds by way of project financing using SPVs , the Model Agreement should be supplemented to include both non-petition and limited recourse clauses . <p> Specified suppliers are not obliged to use utilities ' standard form PPAs , and instead , may ask the utility to enter into the Model Agreement . <p> As contemplated by the Model Agreement which contains provisions regarding access to a grid connection , a utility typically owns the grid connection through which it can access the renewable electricity . Thus , the PPA will normally contain provisions regarding the grid connection . Under the Act on Special Measures , a utility must grant the specified supplier access to its grid connection if so requested , unless certain justifiable exceptions apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specified supplier will not bear certain costs necessary for establishing and maintaining the grid connection , the GCA contains false or illegal terms or conditions or the GCA obliges the utility to pay for damages incurred by the specified supplier even when such damages can not be attributed to the utility , and the specified supplier does not agree to curtail its supply of electricity without compensation from the utility upon the occurrence of certain conditions such as when the supply of electricity from the utility to the public is likely to exceed demand despite implementation of certain countermeasures by such utility ( provided that such curtailment without compensation must not exceed 30 days per year ) . <p> In the event the operator under an operation and maintenance ( O&amp;M ) agreement becomes unable to provide operation and maintenance work for the specified supplier in relation to a certified facility due to bankruptcy or otherwise , and there is no other operator which can take over the former operator 's obligations thereunder , there would arise a risk that the certification may be revoked by the Minister on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified supplier to monitor and maintain the certified facility would no longer exist . Thus , in the event the project sponsor will not be the operator under the O&amp;M agreement , the financial status and creditworthiness of candidates to serve as the operator must be carefully evaluated before entering into the O&amp;M agreement . Further , a back-up operator should be retained in preparation for the situation where appointed operator is no longer able to fulfill its obligations under the O&amp;M agreement . <p> Junichi Ikeda is a partner at Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu .

@@8538150 @1738150/ <p> The discovery and commercial exploitation of shale gas reserves in the US has been a revolution which admirers from around the world have been eager to pursue . One country on the brink of this revolution is Indonesia , whose geology draws tantalising parallels with the most productive shale basins in the US . The Indonesian prospects are all the more interesting when you consider that today 's gas prices in Indonesia and Southeast Asia are four times the price in the US . Add to this mixture a sustained and diversified demand for energy regionally , which should avoid a repeat collapse in gas prices , and the prospects for shale gas seem assured . In early 2012 Indonesia adopted a regulatory framework for shale gas exploitation . However , progress has been painfully slow since then " evolutionary rather than revolutionary . <h> The US experience <p> Shale gas has significantly boosted the US 's gas production , projecting it to be a net exporter of hydrocarbons by 2016 . So successful has the American experience been that local gas prices have been driven down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . This was captured in the words of President Obama in his 2012 State of the Union address : " We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years , and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy " . With existing US reserves standing at 1000 trillion cubic feet ( TCF ) and counting , President Obama has every right to be optimistic . <h> " The shale gas revolution in Indonesia has failed to live up to its initial promise " <p> Energy self-sufficiency is a political dream for many countries , including Indonesia , which is still smarting from its ejection from OPEC Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries when it became a net importer in 2008 . With an estimated 547 TCF of recoverable shale gas resources " largely located onshore throughout the archipelago 's major islands being Sumatra , Borneo and Papua " many thought that the US success story could be reproduced in Indonesia with relative ease . With energy production threatening to be a major bottleneck slowing Indonesia 's economic growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this wave of optimism , in January 2012 Indonesia 's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation Number 5 of 2012 on Procedures and Steps for Offering Non-Conventional Working Areas ( Regulation ) with the goal of kick-starting a mini revolution based on the American model . A year later , the first shale gas Production Sharing Contract ( PSC ) was entered into with Pertamina , covering the Sumbagut shale gas block in Sumatra . At that time , Pertamina undertook to invest $7.8 billion over 30 years in shale development . Two further shale gas blocks were offered to bidders at the same time . <p> Yet the momentum now appears to have stalled , with Indonesia facing uncertainty over the future of shale gas as it struggles to attract sufficient investment . <h> The Regulation <p> The Regulation is a brave first attempt to lay down the rules regulating shale acreage in Indonesia . In 10 brief chapters it deals with the determination of shale areas , the auction and direct offer processes for their acquisition , and the criteria for successful acquisition . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Regulation usefully defines its scope as covering unconventional oil and gas , namely , hydrocarbons extracted from low permeability reservoirs , including shale oil , shale gas , tight gas sands , coal bed methane and methane-hydrate , using technology such as fracturing . This provides a framework which should be robust to changes and new trends in unconventional technology . <p> The Regulation also sets out the preferential rights given to conventional and coal bed methane ( CBM ) PSC holders within an area being offered for a shale PSC . It does this via a system that in theory provides a balance between the rights of existing PSC holders and those wishing to acquire unconventional acreage . <p> Other aspects of the oil and gas regime , including ringfencing of fields and extensive controls for upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMIGAS , are untouched by the Regulation . <h> Why the Regulation may not be enough <p> While this light touch approach is useful in bringing about fast-moving regulatory change , it has limitations . The oil and gas regime in Indonesia is more generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been developed over generations of PSCs , with measures which have adjusted to the mounting sophistication of conventional oil and gas players in Indonesia . In contrast , the unconventional industry is much less developed and at this stage unsuited to the established broader regime . <h> " The Regulation is a brave first attempt to lay down the rules regulating shale acreage in Indonesia " <p> By way of example , issues that will ultimately become key factors in determining economic viability of a project have surprisingly been left unattended . The Regulation is silent on issues such as incentives , tax breaks , a domestic marketing obligation ( DMO ) holiday and other non-conventional economic provisions . So there is no guidance on the profit split that potential shale gas contractors can expect . Although the government may prefer not to limit its options , the absence of a simple benchmark for splitting fixed profits has hampered this fledgling industry 's ability to attract investors . Considering also that the estimated cost of drilling a shale gas well in Indonesia is twice that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Regulation is also silent on the sharing of infrastructure ( such as gas pipelines ) with existing conventional/CBM contractors . Since many unconventional resources are found alongside existing conventional resources and infrastructure , the sharing of existing infrastructure is a major economic driver in making development viable . By omitting to guarantee a mechanism for such sharing , a further degree of uncertainty is introduced . While such sharing should arguably be a private undertaking between contractors , some incentives for the joint utilisation of infrastructure ( which is often state-owned as it comes from cost-recovery ) would have been welcome . The construction of new infrastructure " requiring manoeuvring through a maze of land , forestry and local regulations " is never easy in Indonesia , and this difficulty is heightened in this fledgling unconventional industry . <p> The Regulation also seems not to acknowledge the technology-heavy extraction method used in unconventional oil and gas . Such technology involves not only additional costs but also the need for skilled expertise from overseas . Frustratingly for unconventional players , the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting the employment of expatriates in the oil and gas industry generally . While such tightening of provisions may target the established , conventional sector , the inadvertent effect on unconventional players looking to enter the market is palpable . <h> Competing rights <p> Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the Regulation has not been successful in addressing one of the most important aspects of developing the unconventional industry " the issuing of new PSCs . Shale resources are commonly found within areas covered by existing conventional PSCs , but such Contracts do not grant rights over unconventional resources . Accordingly , companies seeking to acquire rights to unconventional resources must either wait for public auction processes or " more commonly " approach the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources with a proposal for a so-called joint study whereby the unconventional potential in a given area will be explored , with a view to issuing a new unconventional PSC . The Regulation provides for a period of six months during which the conventional PSC holder may elect to conduct the joint study itself . In practice , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holders of conventional PSCs therefore face the dilemma of whether to take up the unconventional rights ( which are often outside of their own business plans ) or give them up to a potential competitor This has led to stalemate , with no party ( the government included ) being willing to make a decisive move . <h> Revolution : cancelled or postponed ? <p> Like so many revolutions , the shale gas revolution in Indonesia has failed to live up to its initial promise . And yet , not all is lost . The Indonesian experience in the development of regulation must be seen from a longer-term perspective . One advantage of the piecemeal development of Indonesian regulations is that this allows for readjustment . Where experience shows that change is necessary , then sooner or later such change will be delivered . <h> " There is no guidance on the profit split that potential shale gas contractors can expect " <p> For shale , the drivers for getting the balance right are all in place : national pride wounded by OPEC expulsion ; the need for energy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the geological conditions ; dwindling conventional resources ; and the symbolic importance of cheap fuel to the Indonesian economy ( currently comprising 20% of the national budget ) . Seen in that light , the practical and legal hurdles are far from insurmountable and the ultimate outcome " geology and technology permitting " is inevitable . Presidential elections in Indonesia in 2014 may mean that there will be no significant developments until later that year . But the first mover advantage is still there for the taking by those who understand not only the nature of unconventional oil and gas , but also the unconventional nature of change in Indonesia ; namely erratic , sometimes frustrating , but ultimately progressive .

Presently , Angola vies with Nigeria as Sub-Saharan Africa 's biggest oil producer . In addition to the exploration of its vast oil reserves , the country has also turned its attention to exploiting its natural gas reserves and has attracted the attention of international oil and gas companies . The following is a brief overview of recent activity in the oil and gas sectors and changes that have been made to the foreign exchange regime . <h> 2013 round bid for pre-salt blocks <p> Angola 's Ministry of Petroleum has recently announced a bid round for exploration of onshore pre-salt blocks , to take place this year . The last Angolan pre-salt round took place in 2011 and included 11 offshore blocks disputed by numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Combustfvel de Angola , Empresa Pblica , Sonangol , EP ( ' National Concessionaire ' or ' Sonangol ' ) and BP , Total , Eni and Statoil along with Cobalt Energy International ( a Houston-based company ) that were the winners in the limited pre-salt licensing round presaging further deep-water exploration initiatives in offshore Angola . <h> Angola 's regime for awarding blocks <p> Under the Constitution of Angola , the State is the owner of all national resources within the Angolan jurisdiction . Consequently all oil fields and gas in the onshore and offshore areas of Angolan territory , in internal waters , in territorial sea , in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf belong to the public domain of the Angolan State and exclusive mining rights are assigned to the National Concessionaire . <p> According to the Angolan Petroleum Act ( Act 10/04 , of November 12 ) and the Angolan Petroleum Operations Regulation ( Decree 1/09 , of January 27 ) oil operations ( i.e. , prospecting , exploration , appraisal , development and production of crude oil and natural gas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Petroleum , or pursuant to an oil concession , awarded by the Government . <p> As to the prospecting license , any upstanding domestic or foreign company having the necessary technical and financial capacity may apply to the Ministry of Petroleum for the issue of a three-year prospecting license ( exceptionally extendable at the request of the licensee ) to determine the petroleum potential of a given area . The prospecting license includes geological , geochemical and geophysical research , and the processing , analysis and interpretation of the acquired data , as well as regional studies and mapping , for the purpose of locating oil and natural gas fields . These prospecting rights are not exclusive to the licensee , nor is the licensee granted any right of first refusal with respect to oil production in the area to which the license relates . The data derived under the license is considered State property and may be used by the licensee and the National Concessionaire . The Ministry of Petroleum may authorise the sale of the data by the licensee , the proceeds of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In relation to oil concessions , petroleum operations outside the scope of a prospecting license may only be performed by the interested companies if they join up with the National Concessionaire . The joint exercise of these activities between national or foreign companies of proven competence and technical and financial capacity and the National Concessionaire is subject to prior approval of the Government and may lead to : ( i ) the incorporation of a company ; ( ii ) the entering into of a consortium agreement ; or ( iii ) the entering into of a production sharing agreement . The National Concessionaire may also carry out petroleum operations through risk service contracts . <p> The concession covers : ( i ) an exploration period comprising prospecting , drilling , well-test activities and evaluation ; and ( ii ) a period for development and production . However , the concession may cover just the development and production period and the Government may assign a concession directly to the National Concessionaire , should it wish to carry out petroleum operations in a particular area without having to associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to associate with other companies , it shall request the Ministry of Petroleum to issue a public call for tenders for the selection of the companies that will become associates for oil exploration and production in a given area . Direct negotiation may only occur when , after a public call for tenders , there was a lack of tenders or the tenders were not satisfactory . Upon extinguishment of the concession , operation assets and technical and economic data obtained shall revert to the National Concessionaire . <p> The point of transfer of ownership of the oil produced lies beyond the mouth of the well , and the associates of the National Concessionaire may freely dispose of their share of the oil produced , except in cases of need for domestic consumption and of national emergency requisition . The specific terms of the concessions and their different periods and phases are laid down in the relevant concession decree . <p> Regarding local content , prospecting licensees , companies that are granted oil concessions in association with the National Concessionaire and the National Concessionaire , shall acquire Angolan materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are identical to those available in the international market for delivery in good time and to the extent that their prices are no more than 10% higher than the cost of imported items or services , including customs , tax and shipping and insurance costs . Consultation of Angolan companies under the same conditions as the consultation of foreign companies is mandatory . Companies that perform oil operations in Angola shall employ Angolan citizens in every category and function , unless the domestic market lacks skilled and experienced Angolan citizens . <p> Bank guarantee ensuring fulfillment of the work obligations assumed in prospecting licenses and oil concessions is required . In the case of a prospecting license , the amount of the guarantee shall be 50% of the value of the estimated work . As for the associates of the National Concessionaire , the guarantee shall correspond to the value attributed to the mandatory work schedule of the oil concession .

Disputes between the Ministry of Petroleum and the licensees or between the National Concessionaire and its associates concerning contractual matters , which can not be resolved by agreement , shall be resolved by arbitration . The arbitral tribunal shall sit in Angola under Angolan law and the arbitration shall be conducted in Portuguese . <p> It is within this legal background and after a successful bidding process for offshore pre-salt blocks in 2011 , that Angola is planning a second bid for pre-salt to take place this year , this time for onshore blocks . 10 blocks are expected to be auctioned in the Soyo Basin and another five in the Kwanza Basin with the focus to attract small and medium companies . Further details concerning the 2013 bid are still to come . <h> Angola LNG Project <p> Alongside the announcement of the 2013 onshore pre-salt bid , it was confirmed that there would be a delay , due to technical problems , on the commencement of production of the Angola LNG ( liquefied natural gas ) Project , previously forecasted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project will start exporting LNG in the second quarter of 2013 . <p> While Angola has extensive natural gas resources ( according to data available in 2011 the proved reserves were in the amount of 10.95 trillion cubic feet ) historically , the vast majority of this natural gas was re-injected into oil fields to help recovery or simply flared off as a by-product of oil operations and even as recently as 2011 , re-injection and flaring still accounted for 91% of all the natural gas produced in the country . <p> Since 1997 the government has shown interest in enhancing Angola 's ability to produce and market its natural gas reserves and in 2001 activities involving reception and processing of gas , production of LNG and its commercialisation were declared to be public interest ( Resolution 17/01 , of October 12 ) and ultimately resulted in the ' Angola LNG Project ' . <p> The Angola LNG Project legal framework was enacted in 2007 ( Decree-Law 10/07 , of October 3 ) and to date , those regulations specific to the natural gas sector have focused on the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Angola LNG Project is being executed by Sonangol , Chevron , Total , BP and ENI groups ( ' Promoter Companies ' ) through their investment in Angola LNG Limited ( Angola LNG ) " the holder of the corresponding rights in the project and the entity that will receive the revenue generated by the sale of LNG . The project also involves an operator for the onshore and offshore facilities and another for the gas pipelines network , both having entered into operation agreements with Angola LNG and also being held by the Promoter Companies . <p> The Angola LNG Project was initially designed as an integrated value chain along which LNG would be transported from the liquefaction plant in Soyo , Angola , to the regasification facilities in Pascagoula , United States of America and after undergoing regasification , the gas would be sold to an affiliate of the Promoter Companies . <p> However , recent developments in the world markets have made LNG sales profitable in markets other than those for which the project was designed .

This redirection may open the possibility for Angola LNG to : ( i ) process the domestic share of gas Sonangol is entitled to ( and which is not used for internal consumption ) ; as well as ( ii ) acquire additional domestic gas and LNG for internal use in Angola . <h> Special Foreign Exchange Regime <p> Until 2012 companies operating in the oil and gas sector were subject to the foreign exchange rules set out in their respective concession agreements , however , with the enactment of the Angolan Oil and Gas Foreign Exchange Act ( Act 2/2012 , of January 13 ) the Government decided to change this situation and establish a general foreign-exchange regime applicable to oil and gas activities pursued under the Angolan Petroleum Act . <p> The new regime is intended to strengthen the country 's banking sector and requires that Sonangol and its Associates ( domestic or foreign corporate persons associated with the National Concessionaire through a commercial company , a consortium agreement or a production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations , as well as payments for goods and services provided by residents and non-residents , through bank accounts domiciled in Angola .

@@8538158 @1738158/ <h> Aina Blankson LP <h> Address <h> Telephone <h> Fax <p> In December 2013 , the Central Bank of Nigeria released the guidelines on the implementation of Basel II/III recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which implementation took effect from January 2014 . While the timeframe for implementation of the minimum capital adequacy computation under Basel II rules will commence in June 2014 , the banks have already begun a parallel run of the Basel II capital adequacy computation along with existing Basel I requirements . In specifying the approaches for quantifying the risk-weighted assets for the purpose of determining regulatory capital , the banks are required to adopt the standardised approach in relation to market and credit risks , with the basic indicator approach adopted for operational risk . <p> Rather than adopt a sweeping endorsement of the Basel II/III accords however , the Central Bank ( CBN ) has modified the guidelines , taking into consideration the present realities of the Nigerian banking system . Credit risk modifications abound in the risk weight assigned to inter-bank transactions and exposures guaranteed by the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FGN or CBN transactions denominated in naira and funded in that currency , amongst others , which carry risk weight of 0% . Other modifications include exposures secured by residential mortgage loans , which carry a risk weight of 100% , compared to the recommended 35% in the Basel II accord . Unrated on-balance sheet securitisation carries a risk weight of 1250% , whereas the Basel II accord provides no risk weight for such transaction . <p> With respect to compliance , the biggest challenge for the banks " and to an extent the CBN " is in terms of cost : improving human capacity and information technology . The vast amounts of data that will be required and processed for risk measurement , management , compliance and reporting means banks must invest extensively in their IT solutions ; not only that , but ensure that deployed IT solutions are capable of handling the massive amounts of requests of the institutions .

The adoption of the proposals could make it even harder for banks to participate in project financings without ECA or guarantee cover . <p> Most banks now calculate credit exposure based on an Internal Ratings-Based ( IRB ) approach . The BCBS hopes to change that " particularly the reliance on external credit ratings agencies " by requiring banks to hold more capital against riskier loans . <p> Project finance is classified as a specialised lending category " an area that exhibits higher losses and risks , according to BCBS .

The Basel Committee believes that low leverage and high revenue is a more accurate indicator of credit worthiness than external ratings . <p> He added : " This is quite a significant change for banks that rely on the standardised approach , and would impact banks relying on internal models inasmuch as the standardised approach provides a floor for IRB banks . " <p> For project finance exposure , BCBS proposed to apply either the counterparty risk rate determined by its revenue and leverage , or 120% - whichever is higher . <p> Guarantee necessity <p> There is no such thing as a zero percent risk weighting in the new regulations .

Such separate laws were , however , consolidated into the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act ( DRBA ) , which went into effect on April 1 2006 . The DRBA consists of chapters on General Provisions ( Chapter 1 ) , Rehabilitation Proceedings ( Chapter 2 ) , Bankruptcy Proceedings ( Chapter 3 ) , Individual Rehabilitation Proceedings ( Chapter 4 ) and Cross-border Insolvency ( Chapter 5 ) . The bankruptcy and insolvency statutes existing before the enactment of the DRBA basically adopted the principle of territoriality and therefore did not contain any provisions on cross-border insolvency . However , following the recent trends in international insolvency law , provisions for cross-border insolvency were newly introduced into the DRBA by reference to the Uncitral Model Law on Cross-border Insolvency ( Model Law ) . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example , the territoriality principle and the status of foreigners ) were amended . <h> Abolition of the territoriality principle <p> Under the former Corporate Reorganisation Act , corporate reorganisation proceedings commenced in Korea were effective as to the assets of companies located within Korea only , and corporate reorganisation proceedings commenced abroad had no effect on assets located within Korea ( Article 4 ) . Under the former Bankruptcy Act , bankruptcies declared in Korea were effective only as to the assets of the bankrupt that were located within Korea , and bankruptcies declared abroad had no effect on assets located within Korea ( Article 3 ) . As such , the above laws adopted an extreme territoriality principle whereby the effects of domestic bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside of Korea , and the effects of foreign bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in Korea , were denied . However , since it was not rational to adhere to such extreme territoriality principle given the objectives of the system of bankruptcy and insolvency , the doctrines , practices and case precedents in Korea reflected efforts to mitigate the territoriality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the above provisions containing the territoriality principle were removed and , under the assumption that the effects of domestic bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings outside of Korea , and the effects of foreign bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in Korea , would be recognised , a new chapter on cross-border insolvency was established . <h> Equal treatment of Korean and non-Korean residents <p> Under the DRBA , all rehabilitation and bankruptcy proceedings became subject to the principle of equality among Korean and non-Korean residents , by providing that : " in the application of the DRBA , foreigners and foreign corporations shall have the same status as that of Korean nationals or Korean corporations " ( Article 2 of the DRBA ) . <h> Scope of application of cross-border provisions <p> The cross-border insolvency provisions under the DRBA apply in the following cases : ( i ) where the representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding seeks recognition or support for such insolvency proceeding from a Korean court ; ( ii ) where the representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding applies for the commencement of a domestic insolvency proceeding in Korea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending in Korea ; ( iii ) where , in relation to a domestic insolvency proceeding , the administrator , trustee in bankruptcy , debtor or any other person who has obtained permission from the court , carries out activities abroad , such as participating in a proceeding before a foreign court , or seeking recognition or support from a foreign court ; and ( iv ) where insolvency proceedings involving the same debtor are pending simultaneously before a Korean court and a foreign court , and coordination between the two proceedings is therefore necessary ( Article 629(1) ( i ) to ( iv ) of the DRBA ) . <p> In the paragraph above , ( i ) the term foreign insolvency proceeding means rehabilitation proceedings , bankruptcy proceedings , individual rehabilitation proceedings and other similar proceedings , including provisional proceedings , which have been applied for with a foreign court ( Article 628(i) of the DRBA ) ; ( ii ) domestic insolvency proceeding means rehabilitation proceedings , bankruptcy proceedings or individual rehabilitation proceedings , which have been applied for with a Korean court ( Article 628(ii) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign insolvency proceeding means a person recognised by a foreign court as the administrator or representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding ( Article 628(v) of the DRBA ) ; ( iv ) recognition means recognition for a foreign insolvency proceeding as the ground on which an order for support could be rendered pursuant to the cross-border insolvency provisions ( Article 628(iii) of the DRBA ) ; and ( v ) order for support means a disposition rendered for the support of the relevant foreign insolvency proceedings in regard to the debtor 's affairs and assets in Korea , as stipulated in the provisions on cross-border insolvency ( Article 628(iv) of the DRBA ) . <h> Specific features of the provisions under the DRBA <p> While the cross-border insolvency provisions under the DRBA basically adopt the approach taken by the Model Law , there are differences in the details . Two significant differences are as follows . First , under the Model Law , the prohibition on the exercise of rights regarding the debtor 's assets or repayment by the debtor becomes effective automatically upon recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the DRBA a separate decision ( disposition for support ) , such as an order for suspension or prohibition , apart from such recognition , is necessary ( Articles 635 and 636 of the DRBA ) . Second , under the Model Law , foreign insolvency proceedings are categorised into principal proceedings and ancillary proceedings , and the effects thereof vary accordingly , whereas under the DRBA foreign insolvency proceedings in principle are not separately categorised into principal proceedings and ancillary proceedings , and only in cases where an application has been made for the recognition of multiple foreign insolvency proceedings involving the same debtor , the court may determine which is the principal insolvency proceeding ( Article 639 of the DRBA ) . <h> Direct and indirect jurisdiction <p> Jurisdiction over cross-border insolvency cases can be categorised into : ( i ) direct jurisdiction , which refers to the authority of a court to hear an insolvency proceeding against a foreign person or entity commenced and carried out before it ; and ( ii ) indirect jurisdiction , which refers to the authority of a court to recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect jurisdiction in Article 630 , which is discussed below . Direct jurisdiction is provided for in Article 3 of the DRBA and under general legal principles regarding international jurisdiction . <h> Direct jurisdiction of Korean courts <p> First , a Korean court is deemed to have jurisdiction if the debtor has an office or a place of business in Korea ( Article 3(1) of the DRBA ) . In such cases , the office or place of business need not be the principal office or place of business of the debtor , and the Korean court is deemed to have jurisdiction even if the principal office or place of business is located outside of Korea , as long as the debtor has an ancillary office or place of business in Korea . <p> Second , in cases where the debtor is an individual or does not have an office or place of business in Korea , direct jurisdiction over cross-border insolvency cases can be recognised if a Korean court has jurisdiction over such debtor under the Korean Civil Procedure Act and general legal principles of international jurisdiction ( Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a Korean court does not have direct jurisdiction by way of the above , direct jurisdiction is possible if the debtor has assets in Korea ( Article 3(3) of the DRBA ) . <h> Outbound effects of domestic insolvency proceedings <h> Meaning of outbound effects <p> Under the DRBA , the authority of the administrator ( in a rehabilitation proceeding ) and the trustee ( in a bankruptcy proceeding ) to manage and dispose of estate assets and the principle prohibiting individual executions also apply to the debtor 's assets located outside of Korea . <h> Authority of administrator/trustee in Korea to act outside of Korea <p> The DRBA , under the assumption that the authority of the administrator or the trustee to manage and dispose of assets has an effect on assets located abroad , prescribes that the administrator , trustee and other persons authorised by a court in a Korean insolvency proceeding has the authority to act abroad for and in connection with such Korean insolvency proceeding , as permitted by the applicable foreign laws ( Article 640 of the DRBA ) . <h> Inbound effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition <p> With respect to inbound effects of foreign insolvency proceedings , the DRBA adopts a dual system , which consists of the recognition procedure and the order for support to be rendered based thereon . The procedure for recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding is not a procedure whereby the effects of the insolvency proceeding commenced under the laws of the foreign country are recognised as-is in Korea , but a hearing to determine whether or not the proceeding deserves the rendering of a disposition for support under Korean laws with respect to the debtor 's affairs or assets in Korea . As a result , a decision for the recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding does not have any immediate legal effect in Korea but only serves as the basis for the rendering of a separate order for support . Therefore , it would be reasonable to interpret that a decision for recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding is in the nature of a comprehensive permission for international judicial cooperation . <p> Jurisdiction for recognition ( indirect jurisdiction ) <p> In principle , cases concerning the recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Seoul Central District Court ( Article 630 of the DRBA ) . <h> Application for recognition <p> The representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding may file an application for recognition of such foreign insolvency proceeding with the Korean court ( Article 631 ( 1 ) of the DRBA ) . In such cases , it does not matter whether the foreign insolvency proceeding is a principal or ancillary one . However , in cases where the foreign court has jurisdiction over the foreign insolvency proceeding solely on the ground that the debtor 's assets are located in the foreign country , such foreign insolvency proceeding is not eligible for recognition under the DRBA . The right to apply for recognition is granted only to the representative of a foreign insolvency proceeding , and debtors and creditors are not eligible . <p> The application for recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding must be accompanied by the following documents : ( i ) a statement on the legal grounds for and a general summary of the foreign insolvency proceeding ; ( ii ) documentation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentation of the qualification and authority of the representative of the foreign insolvency proceeding ; ( iv ) a statement on the key contents of the foreign insolvency proceeding ( including description of the creditors , debtor and interested parties ) ; and ( v ) a statement identifying all other foreign insolvency proceedings against the debtor that are known to the representative of the foreign insolvency proceeding ( Article 631(1) of the DRBA ) . <h> Decision for recognition of proceeding <p> The court is required to render a decision as to whether or not recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding is to be granted , within one month from the date on which the application for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding is filed ( Article 632 ( 1 ) of the DRBA ) . The court is required to dismiss the application if : ( i ) the costs determined by the court have not been prepaid ; ( ii ) any of the documents specified in Article 631(1) have not been submitted or are not adequate so as to be recognised as valid or genuine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contrary to the public policy of Korea ( Article 632(2) of the DRBA ) . <p> The decision for recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding does not affect the commencement or the process of a proceeding under the DRBA ( Article 633 of the DRBA ) . Therefore , a domestic insolvency proceeding may be commenced even after the recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding . <h> Support for proceeding <p> Concurrently with or after the rendering of a decision for the recognition of a foreign proceeding , the court may render any of the following orders at the request of the interested parties ( including the representative of the foreign insolvency proceeding ) or by its own authority : ( i ) suspension of litigation proceedings against the affairs or assets of the debtor or proceedings pending before administrative agencies ; ( ii ) prohibition on or suspension of compulsory execution against the affairs or assets of the debtor , auctions for the realisation of security rights , and preservative measures such as provisional attachment or disposition ; ( iii ) prohibition on repayment by the debtor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of an international administrator in insolvency ; and ( v ) other orders necessary to preserve the affairs or assets of the debtor or to protect the interests of creditors ( Article 636(1) of the DRBA ) . <p> In rendering a decision pursuant to Article 636(1) of the DRBA , the court is required to take into consideration the interests of creditors , the debtor and other interested parties ( Article 636(2) of the DRBA ) , and in cases where the request for support pursuant to Article 636(1) of the DRBA is contrary to the public policy of Korea , the court is required to dismiss such request ( Article 636 ( 3 ) of the DRBA ) . Also , when deemed necessary , the court may modify or revoke the order rendered pursuant to Article 636(1) of the DRBA at the request of the interested parties or by its own authority ( Article 636 ( 6 ) of the DRBA ) . <h> International administrator in insolvency <p> In cases where an international insolvency administrator has been appointed by a Korean court , the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage and dispose of the assets of the debtor located in Korea is vested exclusively in such international insolvency administrator ( Article 637(1) of the DRBA ) .

Unlike the DRBA , the Model Law ( Article 11 of the Model Law ) allows the representative of the foreign insolvency proceeding to apply for commencement of a domestic insolvency proceeding immediately without applying for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding . <p> Also , in cases where a domestic insolvency proceeding against the debtor is already in progress , the representative of the foreign insolvency proceeding may participate in such domestic insolvency proceeding after obtaining a decision for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding ( Article 634 of the DRBA ) . <h> Provisions for concurrent insolvency proceedings <h> Coordination between domestic and foreign proceedings <p> In cases where a foreign insolvency proceeding and a domestic insolvency proceeding involving the same debtor are taking place concurrently , the court may render , modify or revoke an order for support under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 636 ( post-recognition support ) of the DRBA , taking into consideration the domestic insolvency proceeding as a matter of priority ( Article 638 of the DRBA ) .

And , unlike nearly every jurisdiction globally , regulators are supporting their growth . So far it appears that they are succeeding . <p> According to a report released by the Financial Supervisory Service ( FSS ) in December 2014 , hedge funds in Korea received KRW 2.7 trillion ( $2.5 billion ) in investment in the last three years " a 12.5% increase over KRW 200 billion in 2011 . The number of hedge funds in the country has nearly tripled , from only 12 in 2011 to 32 in 2014 . <p> But more could still be done to boost domestic hedge funds , such as allowing managers to invest in their own funds . On the market side , existing hedge funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IFLR speaks with Kyle Shin , CEO of Korean hedge fund Gen2 Partners , about the local regulatory environment and what he expects next from the industry . <h> How has Korea 's hedge fund industry developed in the last five years ? What are the regulatory changes that spurred that development ? <p> The Korean government announced that it would develop the Korean hedge fund industry back between 2006 and 2008 . That was why I left Kingdom Capital , a global New York-based hedge fund . <p> Following the Lehman crisis , the government plan was put on hold . But we have seen growth since then : Korean onshore hedge funds ' assets under management ( AUM ) was near zero a few years ago , and has now grown to $2.5 billion . But compared to the Korean gross domestic product of $1.1 trillion , onshore hedge funds remain very small . This is just the beginning . <h> " If hedge funds are going to continue to grow , they must expand their mandates from Korea to across Asia " <p> Korea is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow the domestic hedge fund business . Everywhere else , regulators are trying to regulate and control hedge funds , but Korea is moving in the opposite direction . That is probably because Korea 's government wants to help build its broker businesses ; a few years ago , it permitted them to begin raising equity by rights offerings . <p> As a result the top Korean brokers raised billions of dollars to seed Korean hedge funds . Before that , there were very few industry experts onshore in Korea , and a few years ago only a few investors who were able to invest in Korean hedge funds . Brokers raised billions of dollars and seeded some to hedge funds , which is how Korean hedge funds began . <p> Regulators , particularly the FSS and the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) , are working with Korean hedge funds . But at the same time , they are controlling for the risks of hedge funds " although they allow leverage of up to four times , compared to almost none for public funds . While they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime brokers " especially since that market has been protected from global players . <h> Who are typically the investors into Korean hedge funds ? Are you seeing more interest from foreign investors ? <p> Foreign investors can invest in hedge funds , but that may require a 22% corporate tax rate . Offshore it is tax free . At the moment it is primarily the Korean brokers and high net worth individuals that invest through the private banking channel . <p> The industry is still waiting for more aggressive institutional investors . For example , National Pension Service ( NPS ) has $450 billion AUM in Korea . That is expected to grow to $770 billion by 2020 and to $2.3 trillion by 2043 , but it is not yet allowed to invest in Korean hedge funds . Although it is encouraged by the government ; it has been blocked by its investment committee . <p> Most Korean hedge funds have an equity long-short strategy that is Korea-specific . The borrowing costs in Korea are usually 2.5% or above , and the leverage cost is also 2.5% or above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decent returns . Plus , the Korea market is not that deep in terms of borrowing " and it is difficult to get the borrow these days at reasonable terms " so if hedge funds are going to continue to grow , they must expand their strategy by expanding their mandates from Korea to across the Asia Pacific . Otherwise they are going to be very confined . <h> What are some of the regulatory concerns that the FSC or FSS could address to further encourage hedge fund growth ? <p> What is interesting about Korea is that in other jurisdictions " including Hong Kong " regulators would encourage fund managers to invest their own capital into funds to ensure that they are especially careful about making investment decisions . <h> " Foreign funds coming onshore in Korea would be a very important boost for the Korean hedge fund industry " <p> The FSS did not allow fund managers to invest their own capital in the funds that they manage until recently . The law now has been changed to allow hedge fund managers to invest in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign exchange ( FX ) and PE permanent establishment tax issues ; those have been blocking some growth of the Korean hedge fund industry as well . <h> What would be the biggest market-driven change that would spur growth for Korean hedge funds ? <p> Foreign funds coming onshore in Korea would be a very important boost for the Korean hedge fund industry . When Korea first opened its hedge funds , it tried to invite global hedge funds to open funds onshore , but none decided to open . Their presence in the domestic market would be very helpful . <p> We also hope that the government can convince NPS to invest and allocate their billions into Korean hedge funds . That would be a stable source of funding for domestic funds . <p> Diversifying hedge fund strategies is also an area that could be improved , as I mentioned before . They are now too focused on Korea-specific long-short strategies . <p> Kyle Shin is an expert in the Korean and Asian markets with over 16 years of experience in the industry .

The Act 's basic premise is that no person is allowed , among others , to buy or borrow foreign currency from , or sell or lend foreign currency to , any person ; to make any payment in Malaysian ringgit to a non-resident in and outside Malaysia ; or to deal in ringgit assets in Malaysia ; save with the prior permission of the Controller . <p> The Controller then publishes Exchange Control Notices of Malaysia ( ECMs ) from time to time pursuant to which permissions ( general and specific ) , and the rules and parameters under which they apply , are prescribed . <p> A resident is defined as ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with permanent resident status and ordinarily residing in Malaysia ; ( iii ) a Malaysian-incorporated body corporate ; ( iv ) a Malaysian-registered unincorporated body ; and ( v ) the Malaysian government ( federal and state ) . A " non-resident " is anyone who is not a resident , and includes ( i ) overseas branches or representative offices of resident companies ; ( ii ) embassies , consulates , high commissions , and international organisations ; and ( iii ) Malaysians who are permanent residents of another country and reside outside Malaysia . <p> Presently , residents without domestic ringgit borrowings are free to invest any amount outside Malaysia . Resident companies with domestic ringgit borrowings are also not subject to any investment limit , if the investment abroad is funded from its own foreign currency funds , or proceeds from an initial public offering . <p> But if it is funded through a conversion of ringgit , the Controller 's permission is required if the investment exceeds RM50 million ( $16.3 million ) in aggregate on a corporate group basis per calendar year . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident companies may invest abroad up to the full amount of their foreign currency borrowings . <p> There is no restriction for non-residents to invest in Malaysia to purchase ringgit assets , such as landed property and securities . There is also no restriction for non-residents to transfer abroad , in foreign currency , all profits , returns and divestment proceeds from their investments in Malaysia . <p> Settlement for investments in ringgit assets by non-residents can , among others , be sourced from their own ringgit funds held in Malaysia ; sale of foreign currency with licensed onshore banks or their appointed overseas branches ; or borrowings obtained from licensed onshore banks to finance real sector activities in Malaysia . These activities include agriculture , mining , manufacturing , construction , and wholesale and retail trade . <p> Resident companies are free to borrow any amount in foreign currency from licensed onshore banks , other resident related companies , and their non-resident non-bank related companies . If resident companies borrow from other non-residents , or through the issuance of foreign currency bonds , the permitted limit is RM100 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the Controller 's prior permission . <p> Resident companies are free to issue ordinary shares , irredeemable preference shares , and private debt securities to non-residents . The Controller 's prior permission is required for issuances of other forms of securities to non-residents . <p> Also , residents are allowed to make payments to , and receive payments from , non-residents in ringgit as settlement for goods or services . Residents are also allowed to invoice in ringgit for their exports , or accept invoices in ringgit for their imports , of goods or services with non-residents . Additionally , non-residents are allowed to receive or make payments in ringgit using their ringgit held in Malaysia as settlement for goods or services with residents , if certain prescribed conditions are met . <p> The rules applicable to Labuan companies incorporated under the Labuan Companies Act , 1990 , have also become more liberal .

@@8538168 @1738168/ <h> Section 1 : REGULATORY FRAMEWORK <p> The Code of Commerce is the main regulation for Honduran corporate and commercial law . It contains the main principles and regulations regarding corporations and companies as well as commercial contracts and agreements . As for the regulatory bodies , the primary regulator for M&amp;A activity in Honduras is the Competition Agency ( Comision para la Defensa y Promocion de la Competencia , CDPC ) . The Competition Agency is responsible for granting authorisation for mergers to take place . Without its permission , M&amp;A can not be carried out . For specific sectors , other regulators may be relevant , such as : the National Banking and Insurance Commission ( Comision Nacional de Bancos y Seguros , CNBS ) , and the National Telecommunications Commission ( Comision Nacional de Telecomunicaciones , Conatel ) . <h> 1.2 How and by what measures , are takeovers regulations ( or equivalent ) enforced ? <p> For takeovers , regulations grant the Competition Agency sufficient powers so as to simply authorise them , grant authorisation under certain conditions or deny the takeover or order divestment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the basic structures for friendly and hostile acquisitions ? <p> There are three principal ways to acquire a business in Honduras : shareholding , management control , and merger and acquisition of any rights on shares . <h> 2.2 What determines the choice of structure , including in the case of a cross-border deal ? <p> Choosing which structure to use involves many factors . Buyers and sellers often have competing interests . Before choosing a structure , it is essential to understand each factor and impact on the parties . <p> These factors include : transaction-related issues ( dealing with few or large number of shareholders or directly with directors ) ; liability issues ( all the target 's business liability or specific assets ) ; labour matters ; commercial issues ; governmental approvals or consents ; and tax-related aspects . <h> 2.3 How quickly can a bidder complete an acquisition ? How long is the deal open to competing bids ? <p> It may depend on the circumstances and the complexity of the transaction and if it falls within regulated sectors or not . But it ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . <h> 2.4 Are there restrictions on the price offered or its form ( cash or shares ) ? <p> There are no restrictions in Honduras regarding the price offered or its form . <h> 2.5 What ownership and other conditions determine whether the bidder makes the acquisition and can satisfactorily squeeze out or otherwise eliminate minority shareholders ? <p> There are no effective mechanisms in Honduras that allow the squeeze-out of the shareholders or eliminate minority shareholders . <p> A peculiarity of the Honduran legal system that deserves to be mentioned is that , in the case of acquisitions or takeover involving stocks of a Honduran entity , it is not possible for a single legal or natural person to acquire 100% of the shares of the target company , as legislation stipulates that any company must have at least two shareholders . However , it is allowed to purchase 100% of equity in the acquisition of assets . <p> Under Honduran Corporate Law , shareholders that represent 25% of the share capital are defined as minorities . They have the rights that the Commercial Law grants : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to request the meeting of the general stockholders ' assembly , and in the event that the corporation has more than three observers ( corporate officials who keep check on management in the interest of all stockholders ) , minorities may appoint one of them . The stockholders of the merging companies who become stockholders of the new incorporated corporation will receive stock or partner interests in the amount agreed upon in the merging resolution ; at that time , minorities may shift or may be squeezed out in the new corporation composition , if their interest drops below the 25% threshold . <h> 2.6 Do minority shareholders enjoy protections against the payment of control premiums , other preferential pricing for select shareholders , and partial acquisitions , such as mandatory offer requirements , ownership disclosure obligations and a best price/all holders rule ? <p> Honduran Corporate Law does not provide for specific protection to minority shareholders against the payment of control premiums , preferential pricing for select shareholders , or partial acquisitions . <h> 2.7 . To what extent can buyers make conditional offers , for example subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representations ? Are bank guarantees or certain funding of the purchase price required ? <p> For listed companies , offers can not be subject to the condition of the buyer obtaining financing . <p> For privately held companies , no legal provisions prohibit an offer from being conditional on the buyer obtaining financing , or the absence of material adverse changes or truth of representations . <h> 2.8 How do buyers and sellers seek to maximise value through their price and other strategies ? <p> We have seen vendors conducting due diligence processes before going into the market in order to be aware of any contingency that might affect price , in order to remedy it . <p> Buyers , on the other hand , usually take advantage of lack of information or of internal disarray to reduce the price as much as possible . <h> Section 3 : TAX CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What are the basic tax considerations and tradeoffs ? <p> In a share sale , capital gains tax is payable at the rate of 10% .

No transfer taxes are payable on the transfer of other assets , or the transfer of shares . <h> 3.2 Are there special considerations in cross-border deals ? <p> On cross-border deals where the seller is a non-resident entity , the buyer must withhold four percent of the purchase price on capital gains tax . <h> Section 4 : ANTI-TAKEOVER DEFENCES <h> ? 4.1 What are the most important forms of antitakeover defences , including antitrust , national security or protected industry review , foreign ownership restrictions , employment regulation and other governmental regulation ? <p> According to the Honduran Constitution and the Competition Law , monopolies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antitrust regulations are found in the Competition Law ( decree 357-2005 ) and its by-law ( accord 1-2007 ) . <p> As for foreign ownership restrictions , except for the aviation and transport sector , there are no restrictions on foreign investments in Honduras . The Law for Promotion and Protection of Investments ( decree 51-2011 " Ley para la Promocion y Proteccion de Inversiones ) provides that no limitations should apply to access markets for individuals or corporations who establish their investments in Honduras . <p> As for labour matters , the transfer of ownership of a company can not affect existing employment agreements . The old employer will be held jointly liable in relation to any obligations arising from agreements made before the date of transfer , for a term of up to six months after the transfer , after which the new employer will assume full responsibility under the agreements . <h> 4.2 How do targets use anti-takeover defences ? <p> Honduran Law does not allow for directors to use defensive measures . <p> However , typical anti-takeover defence mechanisms are so-called golden parachutes : high compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defences ? <p> When overcome , particularly in golden parachute provisions , this may be normally handled through negotiation strategies to lessen or distribute the impact on compensation . <h> 4.4 Are there many examples of successful hostile acquisitions ? <p> Hostile acquisitions are not common in Honduras . <h> Section 5 : DEAL PROTECTIONS <h> 5.1 What are the main ways for a friendly bidder and target to protect a friendly deal from a hostile interloper ? <p> As mentioned ( 4.4 ) , hostile takeovers are not common in our jurisdiction . <h> 5.2 To what extent are deal protections limited , for example by restrictions on impediments to bidding competition , break fees or lock-up agreements ? <p> To protect a potential acquisition , the buyer may seek non-solicitation provisions and force-the-vote provisions , as deal security measures . <h> Section 6 : ANTITRUST REVIEW <h> 6.1 What are the notification thresholds in your jurisdiction ? <p> According to the resolution 013-CDPC-2012-ANO-VII issued by the Competition Agency , the economic concentrations that are included in one of the following scenarios must be notified to the Competition Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economic agents directly involved in the operation of economic concentration exceeds the equivalent of 10,000 minimum wages ; <p> when the sum of the sales volume of the economic agents directly involved in the operation of economic concentration in the country exceeds 15,000 minimum wages ; or <p> when the economic agents directly involved in the merger exceed a participation of 50% of the relevant market . <h> 6.2 When will transactions falling below those thresholds be investigated ? <p> Honduran Competition Law states that any M&amp;A transaction that falls into the thresholds established by the Competition Agency , must be notified for its clearance and approval before entering into effect . <h> 6.3 Is a notification filing mandatory or voluntary ? <p> Notification before the Competition Agency for any M&amp;A between Honduran entities that may fall below the thresholds listed above is mandatory . <h> 6.4 What are the deadlines for filing , and what are the penalties for not filing ? <p> Under article 14 of the Competition By-law , before entering into effect , parties must file for clearance before the Agency .

Often the approach to side letters has been casual and parties have not checked , first , that the fund 's documentation accommodates the creation of side-letter arrangements and , secondly , that the preparation and approval of the side letter is consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render the side letter unenforceable and expose the fund to complaints and legal proceedings by other investors , on the basis that the side-letter investor was given unfair and improper preference that was not disclosed adequately in the offering memorandum . <p> In practice , side letters range from simple side letters between the investors and the investment manager that provide for arrangements completely outside the fund structure ( for example , a rebate of management fees to a shareholder ) to complex arrangements with seed investors that amend the fund 's principal documentation , thus becoming integral to the fund 's structure . The most common type of side letter is an agreement between the fund , the investment manager and the investor on more favourable terms than those in the offering memorandum . In this briefing , we assume the fund is a standalone Cayman exempted company . The following matters should be considered when preparing a side letter of this kind : <p> What is required in order to give the side letter binding contractual effect ? <p> Are there provisions in the fund 's documentation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side letter whose purpose is to vary rights attached to shares , or the commercial and economic terms of the particular investment ? <p> Have the required actions been taken to approve and implement the terms of the side letter ? <p> As with any contract , to be enforceable , a side letter arrangement must either be supported by consideration or be made by deed . Any side letter arrangement entered into after the investor 's entry into the initial principal contractual documentation will generally require consideration other than the initial investment or the entry into the principal documentation , as such consideration will be past . The arrangement must also comply with other essential requirements ( such as certainty of terms ) for contractual effect . <p> The offering memorandum , the subscription agreement , and the memorandum and articles of association govern the relationship between the investor and the fund . A side-letter investor is seeking to subscribe for shares on the terms of the offering memorandum and subscription agreement , as modified by the side letter . A side letter should not modify the provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor once the shares are registered in the fund 's register of members . <p> To accommodate the creation of side letters , the fund must include provisions in its offering memorandum that disclose the possibility of side letters , alerting investors that others could be given preferential offering terms . The disclosure should clearly distinguish between two issues : modification of class rights and variation of offering terms . This distinction lies at the core of proper side-letter implementation . <h> Modification of class rights <p> Rights carried by shares prima facie rank pari passu , that is , shareholders benefit from membership equally . It is only when a company divides its share capital into different classes with different rights that share equality is displaced . A separate class of shares is constituted when the rights carried by those shares differ from those attached to other shares , even if there is no express wording to that effect . The principal rights that a share may carry are : <p> the right to dividends ; <p> the right to vote at meetings of members ; and <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the payment of the debts , to receive a proportionate part of the capital or otherwise to participate in the distribution of the company 's assets . <p> When defining share rights , the capital clause in the memorandum of association us usually kept simple , and the rights of the different classes are defined in the articles . <p> However , differentiation between rights could itself create a different class of shares . If the articles give specific rights to certain members only , these members become a class of members and their shares constitute a class of shares , even though the shares qua shares enjoy no special rights . But there is no class right if the shares are the same and the rights of the shareholders qua shareholders are the same . <p> It is important that a side letter 's terms do not give rights to the side-letter investor that inadvertently create a separate class of shares , requiring the existing shareholders ' approval for such modification . Without such consent , the issue of shares to the side-letter investor might be invalid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the terms of the commercial and economic contract between the fund and the investor . These terms include the fund 's investment objective and strategies , the identity of the investment manager , the fees charged by service providers and other material economic and commercial terms . <p> This distinction between share rights and offering terms is really a distinction between two separate contracts " the contract represented by the articles of association , and the economic contract represented by the offering memorandum and the subscription agreement . A side letter should only purport to vary the economic contract , never the provisions of the memorandum or articles of association . To accommodate side-letter arrangements , the articles of association should make clear that such arrangements will only affect the former . <p> Modification of class rights provisions should also state that any such variation does not constitute a modification of share rights . And if any term of the side letter relates to a provision in the articles ( for example , a lock-up period ) , the provision should be one the application or exercise of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the articles , to be exercised solely and absolutely , either generally or in any particular case . <p> A good rule of thumb for directors when considering whether the provisions of a side letter will affect the economic contract of existing shareholders , is to ask whether existing shareholders would be affected if the side-letter investor invested or did not invest . If the position of existing investors would remain neutral regardless , then the answer is generally that its economic contract will not be affected . If it will , then the directors should only approve the side letter if the extent to which the existing investors are affected falls within the disclosure in the offering memorandum at the time they invested . <p> A side letter should always be reviewed by the fund 's legal counsel and approved by a directors ' resolution . Its scope must fall within the side-letter disclosure provisions of the offering memorandum and it must not modify existing share rights . The directors ' resolution should recite in full the provisions in the offering memorandum and the articles that permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side letter 's terms is in the fund 's best interests . <p> Side letters can be a useful tool in the hedge fund world . But appropriate structuring steps and legal advice must be taken so that the negotiated terms are implemented without unintended adverse consequences for the fund or any of its existing shareholders , and so that each party has all the benefit of the negotiated terms with no unforeseen adverse consequences to either .

The Cayman Islands exempted companies , acting as holding companies in these transactions , set the preference shares they issue ( the preference shares ) at the level of the capital requirement of the relevant GK because the preference shares are issued to enable the Cayman Islands exempted company to finance the purchase of the shares in the GK . <h> Board of directors versus operator <p> Unlike the YK , the GK does not have a director or board of directors .

The absence of a board of directors at the GK level has raised questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a structured finance transaction . Taking a conservative view of the operator 's powers , the approval of the contracts entered into by the GK will need to be in the form of a resolution of the sole member of the GK , that is , the Cayman Islands exempted company . The wider view of the operator 's powers is that it is given full authority pursuant to the constituent documents of the GK to approve and execute contracts on behalf of the GK . <p> To date most transactions involving GKs have adopted the conservative view and structured the Cayman Islands exempted company with a Japanese individual acting as a sole director of the Cayman Islands company . This means that if contracts in the Japanese language entered into by the GK need to be approved by a resolution of the sole member of the GK , the Japanese individual in their capacity as the sole director can approve the contracts and agree to the Cayman Islands exempted company in its capacity as sole member of the GK approving the contracts for the GK . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands entity most commonly used in the Japanese structured finance market is the exempted company .

There are no withholding taxes imposed on any of its cash flows and it is able to obtain an undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that it will remain tax-free for 20 years ( which can be extended to 30 years ) . <h> Incorporating a Cayman Islands exempted company <p> One of the main advantages of a Cayman Islands exempted company over other entities , including the chukan hojin , is the speed with which it can be incorporated .

This shareholding gives the Cayman Islands exempted company an orphan status , which is critical to ensuring that the Cayman Islands exempted company is bankruptcy remote and off balance sheet to the originator and other parties to the transaction . <p> Bankruptcy remoteness and off-balance-sheet status mean that in the event of an insolvency of the originator or another party to the transaction , the assets of the Cayman Islands exempted company will not form part of the assets of the insolvent entity because the Cayman Islands exempted company is not owned or controlled by the insolvent entity . <p> The Cayman Islands exempted company is a cost-effective form of holding company and its position in this type of structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When selecting an entity for this holding company role it is important that the entity is legally tested and secure in the role and the parties to the transaction should look at its cost over the life of the transaction . <h> The Cayman Islands legal environment <p> The Cayman Islands have a user friendly and flexible legal system .

Article 725 para 1 of the Swiss Code of Obligations ( the Code ) provides that , if the last annual balance sheet shows that half of the share capital and the legal reserves are no longer covered by net assets , the board of directors must without delay call a general meeting of shareholders and propose adequate remedies . As a starting point , historic book values for real estate and participations may be restated to their real value to diminish capital loss . <p> A quintessential stage is reached once the corporate debtor is actually threatened with overindebtedness . Pursuant to Article 725 para 2 of the Code , in case of substantiated concern of overindebtedness , an interim balance sheet must be prepared and submitted to the auditors for examination . If the interim balance sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the assets are appraised at going concern values , nor at liquidation values , nor that debts can be subordinated to technically overcome the deficiency , then the board of directors shall notify the judge . Unless debtor protection is applied for in court ( see below ) , the bankruptcy court will order the opening of the bankruptcy proceeding . <p> Often credit facility agreements impose strict and specific financial covenants . They result in an early warning and influence the restructuring process . Experience shows that , in practice , creditors tend to agree on reasonable restructuring proposals and support the debtor to avoid formal proceedings in which the court will be involved and where the creditors are less influential . <p> Usually a debtor seeks to conclude a private agreement with its main creditors for a standstill on the repayment of the debt and/or interest for a certain period of time . For complex financial structures , standstill agreements are vital . <p> To be successful , a rescue plan will have to reflect persuasive operational , financial and organizational remedies that are likely to safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific remedies need to be analyzed and implemented according to the needs of the individual case . The following are the most frequently used ( but not exclusive ) means of capital restructuring in Switzerland . <p> Subordination of debts <p> Existing debts are converted into subordinated debts . In the case of bankruptcy or liquidation of the company , the subordinated creditors undertake not to claim the repayment of the subordinated part before all unsubordinated claims are satisfied . In consideration of this undertaking , financial creditors sometimes will receive a so-called equity kicker , often in the form of conversion rights ( Wandelrechte ) or warrants . The subordination of debt is expressly foreseen in Article 725 of the Code as a technical device to avoid notification of the judge , but does not improve the balance sheet structure . A subordination for such purpose must meet specific criteria . In view of the required postponement of the maturity date linked to a subordination , a subordinated debt is in general not due and , consequently , some argue that a subordinated debt can not be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shareholder loan indeed qualifies as a loan , especially in instances of capital deficiency or overindebtedness . In the case of bankruptcy , such a loan could eventually be re-qualified as equity ( capital contribution ) or as a subordinated loan . <p> Change of capital <p> For a financially stressed corporation , changes of the capital structure may become imperative , with the consequence that existing shareholdings will be fully or partially diluted . By way of a declarative capital decrease a capital deficiency , which is caused by losses ( called Unterbilanz , that is , when the assets of a company still cover the liabilities , but no longer the liabilities and the nominal share capital ) can be eliminated , provided the decrease is not greater than the Unterbilanz and a minimal nominal capital of SFr100,000 is preserved . The company does not have to notify its creditors , or pay or guarantee the claims ( but remains subject to a specific auditors report ) , as would be required in an ordinary capital decrease . <p> By way of a capital decrease with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital decrease , no link to an Unterbilanz is required and no special auditors ' report is needed . The nominal amount of the existing share capital can be , in theory , reduced to zero . If the old shareholders do not participate in the subscription of the new share capital , their holdings will be diluted but their shareholder status can not be entirely extinguished . <p> A subscriber to new shares may contribute the subscription amount by setting off a claim it has against the company . Just as in an ordinary capital increase with a capital decrease followed by an immediate capital increase , the creditors become shareholders of the company by off-setting their claims against a contribution in equity whereby common stock , preferred shares ( Vorzugsaktien ) or participation certificates ( Partizipationsscheine ) are issued . <p> It is hotly debated whether , in a stressed situation , debt can be exchanged for equity at a one-to-one ratio . It is argued that a claim does not have a real value when the company is unable to pay back the respective claim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective subscription contribution ( that is , payment for the shares ) is not considered paid . In practice this risk of double contribution is addressed by expert opinions confirming that the relevant debts have a real value and that such real value corresponds to the amount that is subscribed to . <p> If , in case of a listed company , a financial restructuring brings the new shareholders above the threshold of 33.3% of the voting rights of the debtor company , the new shareholders must make a mandatory public tender offer . It is important to note that the parties participating in a financial restructuring are likely to be regarded as persons acting in concert . The Swiss Stock Exchange Act ( SESTA ) leaves some room for manoeuvre in respect of the obligation to make an offer , in particular , if the securities have been acquired for reorganization purposes . Also listing requirements have to be observed . <p> Financial assistance <p> Issues arise from the legal assumption that each legal entity works and acts on its own . The law , therefore , puts each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests independently from interests of related companies . Intercompany transactions can only be entered into if they are within the company 's purpose and interest , otherwise they will be void . To reduce the risk of dealing outside the company purpose , the statutory purpose should include group support and transactions should be dealt with at a third-party level . Especially for intercompany transactions , several legal restrictions have to be observed . <p> Profits may only be paid out of the profit reflected in the ( audited ) financial statement or out of reserves created for this purpose ( Article 675 para 2 of the Code ) . As long as the legal reserves do not exceed 50% of the share capital , they can be used for financial reorganization purposes only . <p> Article 678 of the Code further requires shareholders , members of the board of directors and persons associated with them to repay distributions of profits or interim interest that they caused to be paid to themselves without justification and in bad faith . They also must repay other payments that they have received to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Article 680 para 2 of the Code , outside a formal share capital decrease or liquidation a corporation is prohibited from returning to the shareholders their contributions to the share capital . Protected are the nominal value of shares , participation certificates and certain reserves , including ( according to a considerable part of legal literature ) the paid-in surplus ( agio ) . <p> According to court practice , the prohibition to return capital contributions does also apply to transactions with third parties that economically result in a repayment of capital . Granting a loan to a related company or a security to secure the debt of a related company ( up- or cross-stream ) is likely to result in a prohibited repayment of capital , if the amounts involved exceed the free reserves of the corporation . Certain authors take a strict view on this , whereas others believe such transactions are valid as long as there is no risk of insolvency of the related company . <p> Directors ' liability <p> Directors and officers of a corporation have a duty to manage the corporation with due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular the period when first signs of overindebtedness have to be recognized puts the management and especially the board of directors in focus , as personal liability may be created for damages caused by delaying a restructuring or the confrontation with the court . They become personally liable for damages caused to the corporation , its creditors and shareholders by wilful or negligent breach of their duties of due care . This responsibility also applies to what are called factual corporate bodies or de-facto board members , that is , to everyone making decisions within the competence of appointed corporate bodies or managing the corporation and so influencing the corporate decision-making process in a material way . Lenders may , therefore , become liable if they participate in the management of the company , have a representative on the board of directors or otherwise substantially influence the decisions of management , especially if their influence is merely driven to protect their own interests . <p> New Merger Law <p> On July 1 2004 the Swiss Merger Law Act is expected to become effective , addressing mergers , demergers , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transfers of assets and liabilities . With some exemptions , the new Merger Law concentrates on restructurings of financially sound legal entities . A merger of overindebted companies will not be feasible but a merger of a financially stressed company with a financially sound company will be permitted , if the merger compensates the capital loss of one company with free equity of the other . In a demerger the divesting company can divide all of its assets and the related liabilities and transfer them to two or more acquiring companies , provided the divestments in the aggregate show a net asset value . A spin-off of bad business parts only will not be accepted . To change the legal form of an entity the applicable minimal capital requirements must be met , what excludes a change of legal form in the case of a subsisting negative net equity . Likewise alternative procedures of regulated restructurings will require a transaction based on a positive net asset value . <p> Tax implications <p> In conjunction with the new Merger Law , modifications of the tax law will be implemented so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Careful analysis of possible tax implications of a restructuring plan for financially stressed companies , in particular Swiss thin-capitalization rules and stamp duty , is called for .

In this seven-month period , visitor arrivals in Macau were , mostly , from mainland China ( over 12 million people ) , Hong Kong ( 3.7 million ) and Taiwan ( over half a million ) . <p> With this growing number of people , goods and business flowing to and from Macau , this SAR has had to step up its game in terms of judiciary cooperation . In particular , it needs to be able to work efficiently with the Hong Kong SAR ( HKSAR ) and with the Peoples ' Republic of China ( PRC ) , in order to cope with the challenges it faces by virtue of the frequent and inevitable private law relations ( and potential litigation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potential transnational litigation , and as a result of increasing globalisation of trade and business , which leads to constant changes in the economy , there are consequences in terms of the criminal practices a state must now deal with . All these reasons demand that national states establish a new set of specific rules and procedures that allow and expedite access to justice beyond its borders , underpinned by judicial cooperation between the states . <p> An example of the importance of judicial cooperation , with particular relevance to Macau as an gaming hub , can be found in the FATF Recommendations ( International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation ) , in particular Recommendations 30 to 40 , that deal with the role of judicial cooperation in the fight against money laundering . <p> In fact , with about seven times the revenue of Las Vegas ( 360.75 billion Patacas , approximately $45.2 billion during 2013 ) , the casino industry is the driving force behind Macau 's economy . This overwhelming growth has attracted a great deal of attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the gaming industry . Several renowned publications have focused on the fact that Macau gaming revenues rely heavily on the so-called VIP market , controlled by gaming promoters , which operation and activity is helping Chinese wealth , whether or not originating from illegal practices , to reach Macau and circumvent strict PRC limits for carrying cash abroad . <p> According to PwC 's 2014 Global Economic Crime Survey issued on the March 5 2014 , the proportion of respondents who reported suffering money laundering was three times higher than regional and global averages . <p> The US Government Congressional-Executive Commission on China 2013 Annual Report dedicates some attention to the role the Macau gaming industry plays in the ' laundering of large amounts of money out of the mainland China ' . <p> Macau 's legislator has focused on the enactment of a broader judicial cooperation with its neighbours , in particular with the HKSAR and the PRC . This may be a very important step in the fight against money laundering practices that have been usually been associated with the MSAR . <h> MSAR legal framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Macau , in accordance with the Basic Law , exercises a high degree of autonomy and enjoys executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication . This means that the PRC , Macau and the HKSAR are territories with their own juridical systems , necessarily implying that a special effort in creating fruitful judicial cooperation between all should be put in place . A different approach would certainly be detrimental to the interests of each of the three systems . <h> " Under the principle of one country , two systems , Macau exercises a high degree of autonomy " <p> The effort in pursuing judicial cooperation between the three systems is enshrined in Macau Basic Law , under section 93 , which states ' The Macau Special Administrative Region may , through consultations and in accordance with the law , maintain judicial relations with the judicial organs of other parts of the country , and they may render assistance to each other ' . Section 93 therefore sets out the general ideas and principles which should guide the judicial cooperation between these parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : ( i ) service of court documents ; ( ii ) gathering of evidence ; ( iii ) enforcement of judgments ; ( iv ) enforcement of arbitral awards ; and , ( v ) granting of interim relief . <p> The general regime in matters of enforcement of foreign judgments is defined under section 1199 , and the sections immediately following , of the Civil Procedure Code . Without prejudice to international conventions applicable to Macau and to bilateral agreements on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments , the Civil Procedure Code generally provides for expedited proceedings in the enforcement of foreign judgments . <p> Normally , a foreign court decision will be recognised and enforced in Macau , provided it qualifies as a final decision ( res iudicata ) supported by authentic documentation . To be enforceable , the foreign judgment must also be issued by a court of proper jurisdiction , not affected by any lis pendens and it must be clear that its enforcement will not breach any fundamental procedural and substantive public policy principles of Macau law . <p> The Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and it is possible to appeal against its decisions in the Court of Last Appeal ( Tribunal de +ltima InstGncia ) . <p> This is the general rule applicable to all foreign judgments where no international conventions or bilateral agreements on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments applicable to Macau can be put in place . However , the development of judicial cooperation between Macau and its closest neighbours , within its space of almost full autonomy in judicial matters , has been at its most fruitful over recent years . <h> Cooperation with PRC <p> Not forgetting the fact that Macau is party to some international conventions regarding the enforcement of judicial and arbitral decisions ( including the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards , although with the same limitations applicable to PRC " Chief Executive Notice Aviso do Chefe do Executivo 3/2007 ) , there are two agreements regarding the enforcement of foreign decisions , and another one regarding the Service of Court Documents between Macau and the PRC . <p> Both agreements regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to civil and commercial matters ( even though the Agreement regarding the Mutual Confirmation and Enforcement of Judicial Decisions is also applicable to labour matters and to compensation arising from criminal proceedings ) ; ( ii ) set the rules and procedures necessary for the confirmation and enforcement of the judgments there included ; ( iii ) do not work automatically neither ex officio " it is always dependent on the request of the interested party ; ( iv ) do not lead to a revision of the substance of the foreign decision , that is , both jurisdictions can not refuse enforcement simply because the decision violates their own substantial law ; ( v ) from the Macau side , it attributes competence for the Court of Appeal for the admission of the request for confirmation of foreign awards , and to the Judicial Base Court ( Tribunal Judicial de Base ) for its enforcement . <p> However , if the decision to be enforced in the PRC is against the fundamental principles of law or the public interest of society ( or , in case of Macau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ) the request is not allowed . <p> The idea of not enforcing a decision against the public order or the general principles of law is globally accepted . However , certain countries may have particular specificities which may represent obstacles to judicial cooperation . In particular , we are referring to the fact that mainland Chinese courts do not recognise or enforce payments on casino debts , as gambling is illegal in the PRC . This means that , on the one side , any gaming debt incurred in Macau by a Chinese national can not be enforced in the PRC , irrespective of whether it has the means to proceed with payment , and , on the other side , alternative methods for the collection of such debt ought to be found by the casino concessionaires ( please note that gaming accounts for circa 50% of MSAR GDP and 84% of fiscal revenues ) . This limitation also means that casino operators are extremely reluctant to directly lend money to mainland gamblers . One solution is for gaming promoters to assume the collection ( or procure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is important not to forget the following : Macau is no different to any other jurisdiction where gambling is allowed . Here , gaming in a casino is also said to be used as a way to clean money from an illicit origin , creating the appearance that it has been obtained by lawful means . <p> The particularity of Macau resides in the importance given to the activity of so-called junket operators ( or gaming promoters as they are referred in the gaming law ) and the risks such activity purportedly entails . Due to strict PRC limits for carrying cash abroad , gaming promoters help mainland gamblers bypass this restriction by collecting the money in the PRC and granting credit in Macau . <p> Gaming promoters therefore contribute to the high levels of capital into Macau , mainly from the PRC , which invites worldwide concern as to the origin of the capital and identity of its owner . According to the FATF/OECD report , <p> ' a vulnerability of junket programs is that they involve the movement of large amounts of money across borders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on the junket operators to move their funds to and from the casino . This creates layers of obscurity around the source and ownership of the money and the identities of the players . ' <h> " The casino industry is the driving force behind Macau 's economy " <p> Their role is all the more significant given that PRC courts do not recognise or enforce payments on casino debts , letting the gaming promoters assume the role of collecting ( or procuring the collection ) gaming debts . <p> Judicial cooperation is indispensible in the combat against money laundering : both jurisdictions could further deepen their cooperation in order to find a solution for the enforcement of Macau-enforceable judgments regarding the payment of gaming related debts . This would undoubtedly be a step forward in Macau 's fight against money laundering , as it would limit the activity of junket operators which , rightly or wrongly , are often linked to the practice of money laundering activities . One can not suggest a definite solution to this matter , mainly because this will be solely a PRC decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . <h> Cooperation with the HKSAR <p> Despite the proximity ( not only geographical ) between the two SARs , only recently was the first cooperation agreement executed regarding the enforcement of arbitral awards between Macau and the HKSAR ( an agreement for the transfer of criminal convicts in jail is also in force , as per Chief Executive Notice 13/2005 ) . <p> This was the Agreement regarding the Mutual Confirmation and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards ( Acordo sobre a Confirmatpo e Executpo Recfprocas de Decis ) es Arbitrais entre a Regipo Administrativa Especial de Macau e a Regipo Administrativa Especial de Hong Kong ) , published under Chief Executive Notice 2/2013 , and in force , according to Chief Executive Notice 41/2013 , since December 16 2013 . <p> This Agreement : ( i ) applies to all arbitration awards ( its application is not limited to civil and commercial matters as with the agreement executed between Macau and the PRC ) ; ( ii ) sets out the rules and procedures necessary for the confirmation and enforcement of arbitral awards ; ( iii ) does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the request of the interested party ; ( iv ) do not lead to a revision of the substance of the arbitral award , that is , both jurisdictions can not refuse enforcement simply because the decision violates their own substantial law ; ( v ) from the Macau side , it attributes competence to the Court of Appeal for the admission of the request for confirmation of foreign awards , and to the Judicial Base Court for its enforcement . <p> This agreement also states that the arbitral award can not be either confirmed or executed when the competent court recognises the object of the dispute is not subject to arbitration according to the law of the place where the confirmation and execution should take place ( the same provision is in force regarding the agreements between the PRC and Macau ) . <p> At present , no further cooperation agreements are in place between Macau and the HKSAR , namely on important matters like the service of court documents , the gathering of evidence and enforcement of judicial decisions judgments ( which means that the general regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procedure Code is applicable ) . <p> However , according to the latest news conveyed by Macau and HKSAR media , a judicial cooperation agreement on criminal matters ( and , in particular , a bilateral extradition agreement ) is under discussion and preparation by the Department of Justice of both SARs . This development follows the sentencing to jail , in Macau , of two Hong Kong business tycoons , who will not be imprisoned unless they enter Macau , as there is no extradition agreement in place between the SARs . <p> If this particular case has brought attention to the necessity of a broader discussion on judicial cooperation agreements on criminal matters between both SARs , more ponderous reasons were already being considered by both Departments of Justice to justify such discussion . In fact , the increase of cross-border crime , especially white-collar crime , the increasing volume of people crossing between both SARs on a daily basis ( which will continue to increase as soon as the new bridge linking this territories opens ) , and the overall proximity between the two territories ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on criminal matters should be put in place . <p> It is hoped that the agreement will not be limited to a mere bilateral extradition agreement , but that it will also bring new solutions to cope , for instance , with the longstanding issue of money laundering in Macau . <h> Final suggestions <p> The necessity of judicial cooperation , in particular between both SARs and the PRC , is a matter that has been widely discussed since the handover of these territories . Despite not being a new subject , it does not mean that progress should not be sought in order to create , improve and mature new or the existing formal agreements . <p> Huge progress has been made in this area in recent years , first between Macau and the PRC and more recently between Macau and HKSAR . However , there are still many loopholes to be considered . Here , we briefly offer some suggestions for the relevant authorities . <p> The enactment of a broader judicial cooperation with its neighbours , in particular with the HKSAR and the PRC , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices . In particular , Macau and the PRC could further enhance their cooperation in order find a solution for the enforcement of Macau-enforceable judgments regarding the payment of gaming related debts . Second , Macau and HKSAR should prioritise the fight against money laundering as one of the grounds underlying the ongoing discussions on a formal agreement for judicial cooperation on criminal matters . <p> Regarding judicial decisions , a mechanism similar to the one used in the 1968 Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters , which sets out that a judgment given in any contracting state should be recognised in another contracting state , without any special procedure being required ( automatically ) , should be sought . <p> The increased development of the economic integration between the SARs and the PRC , along with the high degree of autonomy Macau enjoys , will undoubtedly pave the way to full judicial cooperation . This in turn will assist Macau in the fight against some of its problems , including the fight against money laundering practices as usually associated with a gaming hub .

It held that such award of interest was impossible unless stipulated under the agreement of parties , supported by mercantile custom , statute or claimed under a principle of equity such as breach of fiduciary relationship . By this decision , the Supreme Court reiterated Nigeria 's adherence to the common law principle enunciated in the London Chatham &amp; Dover Railway case . <p> Instructive in this regard , however , is the fact that courts in other jurisdictions are moving away from application of the common law principle in London Chatham &amp; Dover Railway which prohibits award of interest on debts in the absence of agreement .

Until then , parties would more appropriately avoid the effect of the Supreme Court decision in that case by specifically making provisions for payment of interest in their contractual agreements .

Law 11 of 1967 on Mining and its implementing regulations adopt this fundamental principle . Control has been interpreted as being equivalent to ownership . Therefore , there is no title to particular mineral deposits granted by the state to private companies or individuals . Instead , the state only grants rights to exploit and sell the mineral deposits . <p> Domestic investment in mining is further governed by Government Regulation 32 of 1969 on the Implementation of Law 11 of 1967 , as further consecutively amended by Government Regulation 79 of 1992 and Government Regulation 75 of 2001 ( GR 75/01 ) . Domestic investment in the mining industry is conducted through a Kuasa Pertambangan ( KP ) . Essentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regency , the Governor and the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources , depending on where the mining area lies . If the mining area delineated by the KP is located within one Regency , the KP will be issued by the Bupati or Head of the Regency . On the other hand , if the mining area crosses the boundary between two Regencies , the KP is issued by the Governor ( head of the province ) . If the mining area crosses the boundary between two provinces , the authority to issue the KP lies with the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources . <p> Although the Mining Law considers that a KP applicant should have a demonstrable capacity to exploit minerals in its KP area , this is often not the case . As a result , KP holders on occasion enter into agreements with foreign mining companies to conduct mining activities on their behalf . <p> A KP grants exclusive mining rights within the delineated mining area to its holder for specified minerals or metals and a defined stage of mining activities . There are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mining area itself , as follows . <h> General Survey KP <p> A General Survey KP serves as a licence for preliminary surveys within a mining area . It is valid for a limited term of one year , which can only be extended for one additional year . The maximum area coverage of a General Survey KP is 5,000 hectares . <h> Exploration KP <p> An Exploration KP is a type of mining licence for exploration activities in a mining area . It is valid for a limited term of three years and can be extended twice , each time for a one-year period . The maximum area covered by an Exploration KP is 2,000 hectares . <h> Exploitation KP <p> An Exploitation KP is a type of mining licence for exploitation activities in a mining area . It is valid for a limited period of up to 30 years and can be extended twice , each time for a 10-year period . The maximum area coverage for an Exploitation KP is 1,000 hectares . <p> An Exploitation KP may include KPs for processing and refining , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not include the necessary KPs for those activities , the holder will be required to apply for the other types of KPs . <h> Processing and Refinery KP <p> A Processing and Refinery KP is a type of mining licence for processing and refining activities . It may be granted for a period of up to 30 years and is extendable for additional periods of 10 years at a time . <h> Transportation and Marketing KP <p> A Transportation and Marketing KP is a type of mining licence for transportation and marketing activities . It is valid for a period of up to 10 years and is extendable for additional periods of five years at a time . <p> Under Article 15.4 of the Mining Law and Article 23 of GR 75/01 , a KP is transferrable . The provisions state that a KP is transferrable to any other entity/individual under certain circumstances before approval from the competent officials . The KP can be transferred if the requirements are met : for instance , if the KP holder is not able to continue operating its business because of lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , the receiver must prove that he/she/the entity is capable of running the mining business ( for example , the individual or the entity is in a good financial position and is experienced in mining ) . If the receiver is a company , it should be a wholly Indonesian-owned company . If it is a foreign investment company ( Perusahaan Penanaman Modal Asing ? PMA ) , the KP must be converted into a Contract of Work ( CoW ) because a PMA company can only hold either a CoW or Coal Contract of Work ( CCoW ) . <h> Contract of Work ( CoW ) <p> A sole foreign investor or a joint venture between foreign investors and Indonesian investors may carry out mining activities through a CoW granted to an Indonesian foreign investment company ( Perusahaan Penanaman Modal Asing ? PMA ) . A CoW is signed between the PMA company established by the foreign investors ( and , if applicable , their Indonesian partners ) and the Government of Indonesia . <p> The CoW sets out in detail the rights and obligations of the mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining project . From the initial CoWs signed in the sixties to the last of those signed in the late nineties , there have been a number of revisions to the CoW terms . Each revision is referred to as a generation of CoW . There have been a total of seven different generations of CoWs signed . <p> The regulation of the rights and obligations of a mining company engaged under a CoW principally constitutes the CoW itself . The CoW covers all stages of the mine development . <p> Under Indonesian law , the CoW has the status of special law , meaning that it overrides the Indonesian laws of general application ( for instance , general tax law ) where the relevant subject matter is specifically dealt with in the terms of the CoW itself . This treatment is of utmost importance in relation to the taxation provisions of the CoW , which set out the detailed tax regime applicable to the relevant mining company throughout the life of the CoW , regardless of occasional changes to Indonesia 's tax regulations . <p> Principally , a CoW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indonesian incorporated company . Under a CoW , a PMA company acts as a contractor to the government for the exploration and exploitation of certain minerals in the specified CoW area . A CoW is valid for a period of 30 years as of the commencement of commercial production and its term is extendable . <p> CoWs are theoretically negotiable , but they have in practice followed a series of evolving standard agreements ( from the first to the eighth generation ) , all of which have been approved by parliament and the president . <p> A PMA company planning to engage in a mining business must first obtain a CoW . Because of its difference to a KP , the PMA company only needs a single CoW for all of the mining activities . A PMA company is permitted to subcontract such phases of its operations as it deems appropriate . <p> Foreign business entities may establish a PMA company to engage in a mining business with a maximum 95% of total share ownership . A PMA company as a CoW contractor does not automatically acquire any interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is granted for a maximum mining area of 250,000 hectares . <h> Coal Contract of Work ( CCoW ) <p> The legal framework for coal mining is the same as for general mining . Coal mining activities also require KPs , and a contract of work . The differences lie , among others , in the contract 's name , the mining area , the amount of royalty to be paid to the government and the specific line of business . <p> A contract of work for coal mining is a Coal Contract of Work ( CCoW ) , also recognised as PKP2B in its Indonesian abbreviation . The CCoW is a contract between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and an Indonesian incorporated company . As with the CoW , the CCoW has been developed over generations : for the time being , the " three plus " generations of CCoW are being used . All PMA companies in the same generation have the same terms and conditions in their CCoW . <p> The mining area of a CCoW contractor is 100,000 hectares and the amount of royalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal production . The royalty is to be delivered to the government in cash at the free on board ( FOB ) or point of sale price . Also , a CCoW company is not allowed to engage in any other business other than coal mining . In other words , the PMA company should be a special purpose company engaged in coal mining . It must be able to demonstrate its technical and financial capacity when applying to the government as a contractor . <h> Duties , royalties and taxes <p> A holder of mining rights is required to pay deadrent and royalties as provided under Government Regulation 45/2003 , which specifies the deadrent and royalty obligations of KP holders . Circular Letter of the Director General of Geology and Mineral Resources ( DGMR ) 008 . E/84/DJG/2004 provides instructions for calculating payments of deadrent and royalties .

For KPs , deadrent charges begin at Rp500 ( $0.05 ) per hectare per year during the General Survey KP and increase to as much as Rp25,000 per hectare per year during the Exploitation KP . <p> Royalties for KP holders are defined as percentages of FOB sales prices for minerals exported . The current defined rates for coal distinguish between open-cut and underground mining . For open-cut mining , the royalties start at 3% per tonne for 5,100 kcal/kg airdried basis and below and rise to 7% per tonne for coal with a quality above 6,100 kcal/kg airdried basis . For underground mining the royalties start at 2% per tonne for 5,100 kcal/kg airdried basis and below and rise to 6% per tonne for coal with a quality above 6,100 kcal/kg airdried basis . <p> Companies holding KPs are also subject to income tax at generally applicable rates ( 30% at present ) and are subject to the generally applicable tax laws governed by Law 7 of 1983 as amended by Law 7 of 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recently , as amended by Law 17 of 2000 on Income Tax . <p> For the surface area within the mining site used for offices , housing and other buildings and facilities and that have land title , they will be subject to land and building tax . Land and building tax is governed by Law 12 of 1985 as amended by Law 12 of 1994 on Land and Building Tax . <h> Forestry issues <p> Based on Article 38.4 of Law 41 of 1999 on Forestry ( Forestry Law ) , open-cut mining in a conservation forest is prohibited . General exploration activities , including drilling , in conservation forest areas may also be affected , as discussed below . <p> When the Forestry Law was firstly introduced , it created a great deal of uncertainty as to whether mining companies with mining concessions which pre-dated the Forestry Law were entitled , in accordance with the terms of their CoWs and mining regulations , to carry out open-cut mining in conservation forests . <p> Through emergency Government Regulation ( PERPU ) 1 of 2004 , the government stipulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been granted before the Forestry Law would remain valid until their expiry date . Subsequent to the PERPU , through Presidential Decree 41 of 2004 ( PD 41/2004 ) , the government authorised 13 mining companies to continue operations ( including open-cut mining ) in their CoW area despite the provisions of the apparently inconsistent Forestry Law . The PERPU was later ratified by parliament and accordingly has the legal effect of amending Article 38.4 of the Forestry Law . <p> Following PD 41/2004 , the Minister of Forestry issued the Regulation of the Minister of Forestry P.12/Menhut-II/2004 on the Use of Conservation Forest Areas for Mining Activities ( Reg P-12 ) in September 2004 , which essentially stated that the licences to carry out mining activities in conservation forests ( for both the exploration and exploitation stages ) will only be valid for the mining companies included in the list of 13 authorised by PD 41/2004 to conduct mining activities . <p> For all other mining companies , Ministry of Forestry Regulation P.43/MENHUT-II/2008 ( Reg 43/2008 ) imposes similar requirements but requires a replacement non-forest area of 200% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has less than 30% forest area . Reg 43/2008 also provides a softer approach to the obligation to obtain , borrow and use a licence . That is , a mining company must pay the Non-Tax State Revenue for the non-forestry use of production and conservation forests and re-direct its payment from the Ministry of Forestry to the Ministry of Finance . The regulation covers a range of non-forestry activities , including mining , oil and gas , geothermal , power , telecoms and toll road projects carried out within a forest area . <p> The amount of revenue to be paid by the mining company each year depends on non-forest activity being carried out in the forest area and , within that activity , the specific use to which the forest area is being put , as evidenced from the formula for the calculation of the annual payment , as follows . <p> PNBP = ( L1 + tariff ) + ( L2 + 4 + tariff ) + ( L3 + 2 + tariff ) Rp/year <p> Where : <p> L1 is the area affected by permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area affected in a temporary manner and that can be reclaimed ; and <p> L3 is the affected area that is used for a permanent purpose and can not be reclaimed . <p> The tariff also varies depending on whether the activity is being carried out in conservation forests or production forests . The applicable tariffs are as below . <p> Table <p> Activity <p> Rp/annum for Production forests <p> Rp/annum for Conservation forests <p> Open-cut mining ( horizontal ) <p> Rp2.4 million <p> Rp3 million <p> Open-cut mining ( vertical ) <p> Rp1.8 million <p> Rp2.25 million <p> Underground mining <p> Rp1.8 million <p> Rp2.25 million <p> Oil and gas , geothermal , telecoms , power and radio station towers , among others <p> Rp1.2 million <p> Rp1.5 million <h> Land remediation <p> With respect to remediation of the mining area after completion of mining activities under the KP , based on Decree of the Director General of General Mining 336 . K/271/DDJP/1996 on Reclamation Bonds ( Decree on Reclamation Bonds ) , the KP holder is required to provide remediation security ( in the form of deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government banking or other security institutions owned by the government ) before the commencement of operations . <p> The amount of the remediation security will be determined based on the estimated remediation cost stated in the Annual Environmental Management Plan prepared by the holder of the KP for a period of five years . The remediation costs will consist of : ( i ) direct costs ( for instance , the cost of removing mine facilities and re-plantation costs ) ; and ( ii ) indirect costs , including heavy equipment mobilisation and demobilisation costs , remediation planning costs , administration costs and remediation contractors ' profits . <p> To the extent that security has been provided , release of remediation security will be made in stages , in accordance with the completion of the remediation work . Any interest accruing in respect of remediation cash security posted will also be released to the mining company . <h> Export of mining material <p> A KP holder is entitled to export the exploited minerals ( apart from tin ) without obtaining a specific exportation permit . <p> In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement is that they have : ( i ) in the case of domestically-owned companies , a Trade Business Licence ( SIUP ) issued by the Minister of Trade ; ( ii ) in the case of a foreign-owned company , an investment licence from the BKPM or other relevant business licences from the technical government institutions ; and ( iii ) for all companies , a Company Registry Certificate ( TDP ) issued by the Minister of Trade . <p> All exports must be notified by submitting an Export Declaration ( PEB ) and supporting documents . The PEB should be sent to the customs official either by written or electronic notification . In general circumstances , there is no export tax or duty applied for any exported goods . However , Law 17 of 2006 regarding Customs ( Customs Law ) provides that the government may impose export duty for certain exported goods with the following considerations : <p> to secure domestic consumption ; <p> to preserve natural resources ; <p> to anticipate the price rise of certain commodities ; and <p> to stabilise the price of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time impose export duty for certain exported goods , including mining materials ( for instance , coal , iron ore and nickel ore ) . <h> Draft mining law <p> The Indonesian Parliament is now discussing the Bill of the New Mining Law .

The KP will be replaced by the Mining Business Licence ( Izin Usaha Pertambangan ? IUP ) . The IUP can be obtained by both foreign and domestic investors . Unlike the five types of KPs , there will only be two types of IUP : the Exploration IUP and the Operational and Production IUP . The Exploration IUP will be valid for a maximum period of eight years . This period includes general survey , exploration and feasibility study activities .

Although a common prediction is that they will help clear private equity ? s exit gridlock , more development is needed before they ? re an option . <p> China ? s equities markets have become increasingly difficult to access . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IPO ) approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) as of 31 January of this year . But approvals have been frozen , and it ? s unclear when they will reopen . <p> Instead regulators are promoting the national and regional OTC markets as alternative means for financing for small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) , especially those in the high-tech sector . <p> Although the OTC equity markets may eventually give private equity funds a new way to exit China investments , lawyers agree that their novelty and structuring issues means that they aren ? t yet considered . <p> However the OTC designation is somewhat misleading . The national market , named the National Equities Exchange and Quotations Co ( NEEQC ) , is a ? third board , ? and is an alternative to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange ( SZSE ) and Shanghai Stock Exchange ( SHSE ) primarily for unlisted technology companies . <p> Paul Hastings ? Sean Tai explained in a written response that the OTC market provides more financing opportunities for small companies because the threshold for listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added that it remains to be seen how the pilot programmes roll out in practice and how China ? s securities regulator will fine-tune the system to better suit these financing needs . <p> On January 16 the CSRC launched the National Transfer System for the Shares of Small and Medium Enterprises ( NTSSSME ) , which is a national trading venue that will provide supervision and services for the NEEQC . <p> Although the national OTC market is expected to have significant impact on the overall Chinese securities market , there are only four pilot industrial parks in which companies are able to quote their shares on the NTSSSME . They are located in Shanghai , Wuhan , Beijing and Tianjin . <p> But the pilot park scheme may soon expand to 88 state-level science and technology parks , all of which may be listed in on the national OTC market . <p> There are 256 companies on China ? s OTC market : 56 are trading on the NTSSSME ? s predecessor ? an exchange for delisted companies ? and 200 are technology-focused companies trading on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology-focused companies to receive financial backing , the process for their trading on the boards is called quoting instead of listing . <p> Instead of filing a prospectus , companies must find dealers who are willing to sponsor a quotation on the OTC market . Once the company signs that sponsorship agreement , the shares of the company will be quoted . <p> Regulators are quickly opening the OTC market . On February 18 , China ? s National Equities Exchange and Quotations Co published new rules allowing individual investors with over two years of investment experience and CNY 3 million worth of securities assets as well as certain institutional investors can invest . <p> However the national OTC market is not yet open to international investors participating in the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor ( QFII ) scheme . <p> But the lawyer warned that for the national OTC market , the fundraising function isn ? t as developed as that of the stock exchanges , but it is useful for the transfer of shares . <p> Tai said that althoughdetails regarding specific trading regulations are yet to be issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer of listed equities can use mechanisms including market making , mutual agreement , price bidding or other mechanisms approved by CSRC . <p> But these mechanisms are different from the automated computer systems that SZSE and SHSE now use to match the high volume of trading orders . <p> Regional OTC boards <p> Aside from the national board , Chinese provinces and cities have their own OTC boards . <p> The first pilot OTC board was begun for companies in Beijing ? s Zhongguancun area for technology companies : according toXinhua , nearly CNY600 million in transactions were recorded on the board last year . <p> It ? s important to note that the quotation rules may differ slightly across OTC boards . <p> The Shanghai-based lawyer said that SHSE and SZSE have their own listing rules , and there are some differences between the two . The OTC boards have their own rules for quotation , and he expected that there are some small differences between rules . <p> For example , Tai explained that individual investors in the Shanghai OTC market must have at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RMB 1 million invested in financial assets . <p> Exit option for private equity ? <p> Counsel observed that international private equity funds are not yet interested in the technology companies quoted on the OTC markets . <p> Instead , the Shanghai-based lawyer said that only institutional investors that can prove a certain net worth are able to invest in the national OTC markets . However in the local markets rules are much less clear . <p> Regardless liquidity may be an issue on the national OTC market , especially without analysts covering the companies and without underwriters . <p> Although companies can quote shares , it ? s unclear if there is a secondary market : there are no analysts covering the OTC market nor are underwriters involved in quotations . But the opening of the OTC market to institutional investors may help create a more liquid aftermarket . <p> A private equity lawyer said that a more difficult issue is that there are so many regulatory hurdles to getting an exit in China on any of these boards that it ? s difficult to plan ahead . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for onshore listing , it ? s essentially ruled out of offshore listing . It ? s important to place your bets fairly early in the investment process , he said . <p> But there is room for growth , especially because of the delays for companies looking to an SZSE or SHSE listing . The OTC markets may be an alternative for some of the smaller companies looking to list . <p> ? I think the securities industry is very excited about the prospect of the national OTC market , ? the Shanghai lawyer said . ? Some people even predict that over the next ten years , the OTC market will have a larger market capitalisation than SHSE and SZSE . We expect to see a huge number of applicants in the pipeline. ? 
@@8538187 @1738187/ <h> Market Introduction : Schemes of arrangement <h> Author : Published : 29 Mar 2001 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The last few years in Hong Kong have seen a noticeable increase in the number of takeovers of companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange . A number of these have been effective " back door " listings enabling the offeror to inject new assets into , and at the same time acquire control of , existing listed companies . Others have involved the privatization and delisting of the listed company by its controlling shareholder , where , for instance , the company is perceived to be undervalued by the market , as well as more strategic acquisitions by a third party acquiror . While many of these takeovers are conducted by way of a recommended general offer , a scheme of arrangement offers an alternative route which may provide particular advantages where the offeror seeks both to acquire 100% of the target company and to delist the company from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange . <p> This article briefly sets out the principal advantages and disadvantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be considered by a potential offeror seeking to acquire a Hong Kong incorporated company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange . Similar considerations will apply to Bermuda and Cayman Islands incorporated companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange although the Court procedures are slightly different . In each case , the offer will be governed by the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers . <h> What is a scheme of arrangement ? <p> A scheme of arrangement ( " Scheme " ) is a procedure under section 166 of the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong whereby a company may make a compromise or arrangement with its members or a class of its members or with its creditors or a class of its creditors . The scope and circumstances for using a Scheme is wide . For example , a Scheme can be used to merge one company with another under a new holding company , to reorganize the capital structure of a company , to redomicile a company to a different jurisdiction or to effect a management buyout . In facilitating the takeover of a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancellation of the shares held by the existing shareholders of the target company and the issue by the target company of new shares to the offeror in return for the consideration payable by the offeror to the shareholders of the target company . This is commonly in the form of cash and/or shares of the offeror . <p> Essentially , a Scheme is a proposal put forward by the board of directors of the target company to its shareholders and must be approved by the Court . Examples of where a Scheme has been used in Hong Kong include the recent privatizations , in each case by their respective controlling shareholders , of Jardine International Motors Holdings Limited ( a Bermuda incorporated company ) and of Sime Darby Hong Kong Limited ( a Hong Kong incorporated company ) which is currently in progress . <p> One of the most significant recent examples of the use of a Scheme in Hong Kong is the merger between Pacific Century CyberWorks Limited ( PCCW ) and Cable &amp; Wireless HKT Limited ( HKT ) . This merger , Asia 's largest ever outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was initially launched by PCCW as a general offer upon securing the support of Cable and Wireless plc , which then held 54% of HKT . The offer was subsequently converted into a Scheme with the support of the board of directors of HKT . While the takeover was launched as a general offer at the time because of a possible competing bid from SingTel , its subsequent conversion to a Scheme allowed PCCW to take advantage of the certainty of the results of a Scheme as it wished to acquire 100% of HKT as well as extend its offer to the shareholders of HKT in the United States . At the time it was uncertain whether PCCW would receive acceptances for 90% in value of the shares for which the general offer was made and thereby be able to compulsorily acquire the remainder of the shares . This was particularly the case as the general offer could not comply with certain exceptions to the tender offer rules of the US and therefore could not be made direct to the shareholders of HKT in that country . This uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compulsorily acquire any minority interests in HKT if in fact 90% acceptances were received , made the general offer route undesirable and PCCW , with the agreement of the board of directors of HKT , proceeded with the offer by way of a Scheme . <p> By its nature , a Scheme requires agreement between the boards of directors of the target company and the offeror and can not be used in a hostile takeover . Where , however , the offer is recommended - and there is the specific purpose of cancelling the target company 's listed status - a Scheme offers a viable alternative to making a general offer . <h> Advantages <p> The principal advantages of a Scheme are as follows : <p> Guaranteed acquisition of 100% of the target . Once the Court has sanctioned a Scheme all the shareholders or class of shareholders concerned are bound whether or not they have voted in favour of the Scheme . <p> Approval of the Scheme requires a lower level of support . To complete the acquisition of 100% of the target company , less support is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general offer ( see below ) . <p> The period for acquiring 100% control can be shorter for a Scheme than under a general offer because of the time limits imposed under the compulsory acquisition procedures set out in the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong . <p> A Scheme does not require strict adherence to the time limits imposed by the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers . As a Court sanctioned process , the timing of a Scheme will be governed by the Court 's timetable . <p> It can cater for difficulties associated with untraceable shareholders and US shareholders more effectively than a general offer . It is possible to establish a trust for untraceable shareholders . US securities laws contain an exception which would apply to a Scheme which will normally enable the US shareholders of the target company to receive shares in the offeror without the usual difficulties associated with filings in the US . <p> Stamp duty can be saved on the acquisition . Hong Kong stamp duty is payable on the transfer of shares . Since a Scheme usually entails a cancellation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A Scheme must be approved by a majority in number of the target company 's shareholders at a special general meeting convened by the Court representing 75% in value of the target shares voting at the meeting . Once approved , a Scheme must be sanctioned by the Court in order to be effective . Shareholder apathy can work in favour of an offeror under a Scheme since only those shareholders who vote at the special general meeting are taken into account . Conversely , if there is a minority opposed to the Scheme they need less support to prevent the Scheme than that under a general offer . <p> Where 100% control is required , this can only be achieved in a general offer when 90% in value of the shares for which the general offer is made are acquired and the offeror is able to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares . In contrast , a Scheme by its very nature achieves 100% control of the target company . <p> TABLE ONE : COMPARATIVE TIMETABLE <p> General offer <p> Scheme ( subject to the Court 's timetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a securities exchange offer ) <p> P-21 ( 35 ) <p> Announcement <p> Announcement <p> P-10 <p> Issue of originating summons for Scheme <p> P <p> Post offer document to shareholders of target company <p> P <p> Post Scheme document to share holders of target company ( note ) <p> P+14 <p> Post offeree 's document ( if not combined with offer document ) <p> P+21 <p> First closing date ( minimum period for offer to remain open ) <p> P+35 <p> Earliest possible closing date if offer unconditional on P+21 ( offer must remain open for a minimum period of 14 days ) <p> P+35 <p> Court meeting and extraordinary general meeting of target company <p> P+39 <p> Target company should not announce results and certain other information after this date <p> If the offeror then wishes to avail itself of the compulsory acquisition procedures to secure 100% control this may take an additional two months . <p> Note : As the Scheme document will need to be reviewed and approved by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement before the Scheme document can be despatched . <h> Comparative timetable <p> A summary of the principal events and timeline ( as prescribed by the Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Merger ) for a general offer and a Scheme is set out in table one . <p> The timing of a Scheme and the documentation involved differ from a general offer , and depending on the circumstances , a Scheme can prove much more effective than a general offer in acquiring 100% control of the target company . Where , however , an offeror is prepared to accept minority interests , or a risk of minority interests , remaining in the target company a general offer is the quickest means of achieving 50% voting control . <h> Disadvantages <p> These include the following : <p> The target company and its directors control the timing and implementation of the Scheme . The target company 's directors may withdraw support at any time up to the sanctioning of the Scheme by the Court , particularly if a third party makes a higher bid . <p> The Scheme 's potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competing higher offer . <p> It is difficult for the bidder to compete on equal terms with a competing bidder as it is more cumbersome to alter the terms of the Scheme than a general offer . Changes to the terms of the Scheme may require the Court 's approval . <p> A lower level of support is required for the Scheme to be vetoed . A minority needs only 25% in value of the shares subject to the Scheme to prevent the Scheme becoming effective . <p> The time frame is determined by the Court . <p> The Court procedure may provide an additional forum for dissenting shareholders to voice objections . <p> The costs of the Scheme may be greater in view of the Court procedures and resources required . However , this is likely to be balanced by the expense saved on stamp duty . <h> When is a scheme of arrangement suitable ? <p> A Scheme is a suitable alternative to a general offer where : <p> there is agreement between the boards of directors of the offeror and target companies ; <p> the shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to be a competing offer made by another bidder ; <p> an independent financial adviser , which will be appointed to advise the independent directors of the target company , is likely to determine that the terms of the Scheme are fair and reasonable ; <p> the Scheme is likely to obtain Court approval ; and <p> the financial benefits of using the Scheme adequately balance the costs involved . <p> In the right circumstances , a Scheme can be an efficient and organized method of acquisition . The success of the PCCW 's landmark takeover of HKT reflects the importance of a Scheme and indicates the potential for the use of Schemes in recommended acquisitions .

@@8538192 @1738192/ <h> Wolf Theiss ( Bulgaria ) <h> Address <h> Telephone <h> Fax <p> In times of economic crisis , many companies undertake restructuring while others seek alternative sources of financing to improve cashflow . While the company is attempting to improve its financial position , its shareholders might be experiencing their own cashflow problems and could be interested in extracting resources from the company . This leads to a conflict between the shareholders ' interests and the management 's duties to secure the company 's solvency and creditors ' interests . <p> Bulgarian legislation gives priority to creditors ' interests and protects them consistently through a system of measures known as the capital maintenance regime . The regime imposes special restrictions on operations between a joint-stock company and its shareholders in order to protect the company 's capital . <h> Dividend distribution <p> Dividend distributions in a Bulgarian joint-stock company should comply with the following requirements : <p> Subject to dividend distribution is the profit for the respective year , as shown in the audited and approved annual financial statements , reduced by ( i ) any losses transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reserves in accordance with the law or Articles of Association , and increased by ( i ) any undistributed profits transferred from previous years and ( ii ) any sums placed to reserves which are exceeding the legally-required minimum amount of the reserves ; and <p> Following the payment of dividends , the net assets of the company ( the difference between the value of the assets and the liabilities as per the balance sheet ) , as set out in the company 's audited and approved annual financial statements for the respective year , should not be lower than the amount of the company 's registered capital plus any sums placed to reserves . <p> It is important that some specific features of applicable accounting standards , on the basis of which the company 's annual financial statements are prepared , may influence the amount of the distributable profit . Thus , under the International Accounting Standards , some categories of assets , for example investment properties or some types of financial assets , can be accounted for at their fair value , where every subsequent change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss or a profit in the company 's income statement without any disposal of the asset . As a result , the distributable profit of the company may be increased with unrealised profits from subsequent revaluations . <p> Special attention must be paid to the issue of financial assistance . Under Bulgarian law , a joint-stock company is prohibited from extending loans or providing collaterals for the acquisition of its own shares by third persons . A violation of this prohibition would trigger invalidity of the loan agreement or the collateral agreement . <p> Decrease of the registered capital in a joint-stock company should also account for the rights of the company 's creditors . In case of violation of the requirements for notifying and satisfying creditors , the members of the company 's managing body can be held jointly and severally liable by the creditors for any damages incurred . <p> The capital maintenance regime also includes restrictions on the acquisitions by the company of its own shares ( such as buy-back of shares , preferred shares with privilege for buy-back , decrease of capital by cancellation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may acquire its own shares only with amounts eligible for distribution ( amounts distributable as dividends , for example ) . The company may not hold its own shares with a total nominal value exceeding 10% of its registered capital . If this rule is violated , the company has to transfer excessive shares within a specified period , otherwise such shares should be cancelled and the registered capital of the company should be reduced . The company 's managing body must disclose in the annual activity reports what own shares the company holds . <p> Some restructuring alternatives could lead to an outcome similar to that of an acquisition of own shares " for example , if shares in a company which is a shareholder in a joint-stock company are contributed to the same joint-stock company ; then the contributed shares would be considered own shares of joint-stock company , with all restrictions applicable to it . <p> Acquisition of own shares , however , should be carefully considered from an accounting and tax point of view . Depending on the particular circumstances , it can be treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred shares with buy-back privilege can be treated by the applicable accounting standards not as equity instruments , but as financial liabilities of the company , with all the consequent complications arising from that fact . <p> If , despite the capital maintenance restrictions , the net assets of the company fall below the figure of its registered capital and the shareholders do not take a decision to decrease the registered capital , restructure or liquidate voluntarily the company within a period of a year , the company could be compulsorily liquidated upon request of a prosecutor . <p> There are several legal ways to avoid the negative consequences of capital erosion . One of them is to carry out a simultaneous capital decrease and increase : the company 's capital is decreased in order to cover losses and to reach the level of the net assets of the company , but then is increased back to the same level or higher , often through an equity injection by a new investor . Restructuring ( such as merger or spin off ) also creates opportunities to optimise capital structure .

This approach , which regulates RRNs in the same manner as other UII , was under criticism because in practice it was easy to obtain a data subject 's consent and as a result many data subjects were exposed to large scale data breaches such as the credit card information leak in 2014 . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIPA : ( i ) the processing of RRNs is prohibited regardless of the data subject 's consent ; and , ( ii ) the data processor must , within two years of the date of implementation of the 2014 amendment to the PIPA ( by August 6 2016 ) , destroy all RRNs collected before August 7 2014 , unless certain exceptions apply . <p> Exceptions include where the processing of RRNs : ( i ) is required or permitted by any law or regulation other than the PIPA ( for example for the purpose of sharing personal credit information it is permitted by the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act ) ; ( ii ) is necessary to protect the interest of a data subject or a third party concerning their life , physical safety or property ( for example in case of emergency patients or criminal victims ) ; or , ( iii ) is required or permitted by the enforcement regulation promulgated by the Ministry of Security and Public Administration of Korea ( the Mospa ) in November 2014 . The Mospa 's enforcement regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential decrees of various relevant laws governing public services ) permits the processing of RRNs where such processing is necessary to facilitate the key administrative services conducted by public authorities and lists other circumstances where the processing of RRNs is permitted . <p> The above changes apply to all corporations and institutions ( both domestic and foreign ) in both public and private sectors . The most significant change to the PIPA is that the processing of RRNs is now prohibited regardless of the data subject 's consent " a change which is expected to prevent data leakage and misuse of personal information , especially by private-sector data processors . <p> In fact , it has long been criticised that in Korea individual customers are often required by service providers ( such as financial companies ) to give consent for the service provider to access all the customer 's personal identification information ; the customer can not only select certain information that they are comfortable sharing , and this is a typical requirement of most companies in Korea . <p> The PIPA only provides a basic framework for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the guidelines of the competent authorities , including the Mospa ( which is in charge of supervising the enforcement of the PIPA ) and the Financial Services Commission of Korea ( FSC " which regulates data protection policies with respect to credit or financial information and financial companies ) . <p> The Mospa and the FSC provide a three-step approach as follows : <p> Mospa 's guideline <p> FSC 's guideline <p> Step 1 <p> General prohibition : The processing of RRNs is in principle prohibited . <p> Sort-out : The processing of RRNs is allowed in some laws and regulations ( such as the Real Name Financial Transactions and Confidentiality Act ) . <p> Step 2 <p> Amend/enact : An amendment or enactment of relevant laws and regulations is necessary to allow the processing of RRNs only to the minimum extent necessary . <p> Amend/enact : The FSC must amend the relevant laws and regulations ( such as the Banking Act , the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act ) to allow the processing of RRNs for certain financial businesses ( for whom the processing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the long term : An alternative personal identification ( such as i-pin or My-Pin ) system must be established . <p> In the long term : The FSC must encourage financial companies to develop , establish or use alternative personal identification systems . <p> With regard to step 2 , the FSC 's position is that under the Use and Protection of Credit Information Act ( Credit Information Act ) , the collection of RRNs for the purpose of identifying the data subject with certain credit information ( as defined in the Credit Information Act ) is allowed , despite the changes adopted in the 2014 amendment to the PIPA . <p> An information processor in violation of the regulations on RRNs is subject to an administrative fine of up to W30 million ( $27,000 ) . However , the Mospa granted a compliance period ( until February 6 2015 ) during which no punitive measures will be taken against minor violations . <h> Outsourcing of data processing <p> Before the FHCA amendment <p> The FHCA , before its amendment in 2014 , did not impose heavy regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data management by financial companies . While the PIPA , the Credit Information Act and the Real Name Financial Transactions and Confidentiality Act ( Real Name Act ) usually require the data subject 's consent for data transfer ( either within or outside the holding group ) , the FHCA alleviates such burden by providing an exception to the consent requirement . Under the FHCA , a financial company , without obtaining the consent of the relevant data subject , is allowed to share the data subject 's financial transaction information ( as defined in the Real Name Act ) and personal credit information ( as defined in the Credit Information Act ) within its financial holding group for any business purposes ( including sales , distribution , and marketing purposes ) . Other than the purpose test ( the requirement for business purposes ) , there is no other way to effectively restrict or regulate data transfer within a financial holding group . <p> The above exception , which in practice allowed data sharing among affiliates within each financial holding group , was pointed out as being one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach cases such as the data leak of credit card firms in 2014 . <p> An interim measure <h> " These recent changes in the country 's data protection regulations are viewed by some as overreaching and highly burdensome " <p> To prevent mass data leaks , the Korean government drastically changed its position with respect to group-wide data transfers by proposing an amendment to the FHCA on May 28 2014 , which became effective on November 29 2014 . In addition , the Financial Supervisory Service of Korea ( FSS ) issued a Model Business Guideline on May 1 2014 , which provided for more stringent regulations on intra-group data transfers , to be effective during the interim period until the implementation date of the 2014 amendment to the FHCA . Under the FSS 's supervision , the Model Business Guideline was adopted by most financial holding groups in Korea . <p> The Model Business Guideline is similar to the 2014 amendment to the FHCA in that it allowed group-wide data transfers without the consent of data subject only for ' internal business management ' of the financial holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual notification of data transfers to relevant customers at least once a year , and prohibited the use of such transferred data for more than one month unless otherwise approved by the chief information officer ( RR ) . <p> However , like the FHCA , the Model Business Guideline provided certain exceptions under which group-wide data transfers for business purposes ( such as sales or marketing purposes ) are allowed . These exceptions are : ( i ) if the interest or consent of the relevant customer is clearly expected ; or , ( ii ) if the chief information officer ( CIO ) and the board of directors of the company approve such transfer . This was the most significant difference from the 2014 amendment to the FHCA . <p> Post-amendment FHCA <p> The FHCA before its amendment in 2014 allowed intra-group data transfers for any business purposes , while the Model Business Guideline allowed such data transfers only for internal business management purposes subject to certain exceptions . <p> The 2014 amendment to the FHCA further reduced the scope of permissible data transfers by limiting them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data shared within a financial holding group for business purposes ( other than for internal business management purposes ) be destroyed by February 28 2015 . <p> Under the amendment to the FHCA , a financial company is allowed to transfer financial transaction information and personal credit information without obtaining the consent of the relevant data subject . However , this is only if such data transfer is necessary for certain internal business management purposes as provided in the amendment , and as set out in the enforcement decree of the FHCA and the FSC 's Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Company for the following purposes : ( i ) risk management , internal control or inspection of subsidiaries for the purposes of improving corporate integrity ; ( ii ) product or service development , customer analysis or business delegation for the purposes of creating a group-wide synergy effect ; or ( iii ) distribution of performance or costs between subsidiaries for the purposes of performance management . <h> " To prevent mass data leaks , the Korean government drastically changed its position with respect to group-wide data transfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of permissible purposes of data sharing the introduction or solicitation of sale of products or services to customers . The above list is more restrictive than the Model Business Guideline , and is expected to restrict financial holding groups ' ability to share customer-related data within the group . <p> In addition , the 2014 amendment to the FHCA requires financial holding groups to comply with the following procedures to share data within the group : <p> a notice of data transfer ( specifying the transferor , transferee , and the purpose and items of transfer ) must be sent to the relevant customer at least once a year ; <p> the transferred data may be used ( processed ) for a maximum of one month , unless otherwise approved by the CIO ; <p> the provision of the original documents is prohibited ( only copies of such original documents can be shared within the financial holding group ) ; <p> the CIO must review the purpose and period of use , scope of the shared data and authorised persons to use such data ; <p> the data shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transferee 's own customer data ; <p> the shared customer data must be codified ; <p> the shared data must be destroyed immediately after such data becomes no longer necessary ; and <p> the CIO of the financial holding company must comprehensively inspect the data transfer within the group at least once a year , and report the outcome of the inspection to the FSS . <p> A notable difference from the FHCA before its 2014 amendment is that the 2014 amendment : ( a ) requires the transferor to notify the relevant customers of the data sharing that took place at least once a year ; and ( b ) limits the period of use of the shared data to a maximum of one month ( unless otherwise approved by the CIO ) . <p> Sky Yang has been in the financial regulatory practice for over 20 years , advising various financial companies in Korea .

" I think the NCWOL is the most difficult concept of all , " said Mark Hyde , partner at Clifford Chance who worked with the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association in its response to the HKMA 's first round consultation . <p> It 's laudable as a starting point , and is clearly intended to establish a benchmark , he added . <p> " As we said when we commented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is incredibly difficult for someone to make a judgement to , if they were appointed liquidator , what they would realise for the assets , " he commented . " I do n't doubt that if you asked two separate people " both eminently qualified " they would come up with different answers . " <p> Another question is how the regulator will work through these issues in time to complete legislative reforms by the FSB 's year-end deadline . <p> KEY TAKEAWAYS <p> The HKMA has proposed a mechanism to confirm that no creditor is worse off in resolution than in liquidation ; <p> It follows the FSB 's Key Attributes provision of no creditor being worse off than in liquidation ( NCWOL ) point , but goes further by suggesting the appointment of a valuer and a tribunal to ensure that creditors do benefit from the resolution of a financial institution ; <p> But resolution can take years before it does prove to be profitable to creditors , and the valuation process is subjective ; <p> The consultation also proposes the creation of a Resolution Compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NCWOL valuation ; <p> More details around the Resolution Compensation Tribunal are expected in the third round of consultation , which will hopefully be released at the end of this year . <p> The proposalThe Key Attributes say that creditors should have the right to compensation where they do n't receive , at a minimum , what they would have received in a liquidation of the firm under the applicable insolvency regime . <p> CP2 provides details of that mechanism , which will apply to shareholders as well as bondholders , although shareholders should not expect to receive much " if anything " in a resolution or liquidation . <h> " I think the NCWOL is the most difficult concept of all " <p> Choosing a valuerThe valuer will have a role similar to the liquidator in Hong Kong liquidations , although it 's unclear whether he will be appointed by the resolution authority or another body . <p> According to CP2 this valuer must be independent and not conflicted in any way that may affect their neutrality , as well as have the professional skills and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial institutions . <p> Valuers obviously can not be appointed until resolution proceedings have formally commenced , although they are likely to be appointed very soon after " and in advance where possible . <p> The role of the valuer seems analogous to the role of the provisional liquidator in Hong Kong bankruptcies . It seems unique to the Hong Kong regime , and may exist because the city-state has no experience with any restructuring regime outside liquidation . Lawyers have lobbied for a new restructuring law to allow workouts for years , but that has not materialised . <p> Hyde presumed that the only people really capable of taking on the valuer role are those who have performed the role of provision liquidator and in sizeable insolvency situations . He added : " I ca n't think of anyone else who would be prepared to put their hands up and do this . " <p> What will be most important " and what does n't seem to be addressed in the consultation " is the issue of legal protection for valuers . <p> Whether they are prepared in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're able to get , said Hyde . <p> " I think immunity is the right word because I do n't think they 'll get indemnities , " he added . " Indemnities would presumably have to be funded by the public purse . " <p> It 's unclear how valuers will be compensated . CP2 proposes that , following Bank of England 's approach , NCWOL compensation will be funded by the wider financial services industry . <p> Predicting the futureBut the NCWOL principle is especially challenging to implement and prove ; as Hyde mentioned previously , the process is subjective , and may differ from valuer to valuer . And it 's difficult to predict the future . <p> For example , creditors of Lehman Brothers 's US brokerage and Lehman Brothers International Europe ( LBIE ) received 100% of their claims seven years after the bank 's failure . Creditors of LBIE received more than 100 cents on the dollar because of interest . That 's not an outcome that would have seemed likely in September 2008 . <p> And surprisingly good outcomes could become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know resolution outcomes . <p> " They wo n't have the benefit of hindsight when they have to make this judgement , " said Hyde . " If the resolution is done and someone ends up worse off years later , presumably the test ca n't involve how things unfolded " because it 's proved to be worse off " but whether the judgement at the time was correct . " <p> To assist the valuer , CP2 sets out three guidelines for the NCWOL valuation : a valuation reference date based on the earliest point that the financial institution would have otherwise entered a liquidation ; the creditor hierarchy ; and disregarding any actual or potential government financial assistance to the financial institution outside the course of business as usual . <p> Bail-inThe creditor hierarchy aspect may be challenging , especially following the introduction of Basel III-compliant bonds that must be fully written down before senior debt is affected . And because investors are warned of the risks involved with buying these bonds , it 's unclear whether they will be able to receive any recourse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their full effect at the time they buy them , " said Hyde . <p> When an institution fails and the instrument becomes worthless , he added , litigation may ensue . " It 'll be a slight sideshow but is , in one sense , a NCWOL point , " he commented . <p> A new tribunalCP2 envisions a Resolution Compensation Tribunal ( RCT ) specifically to hear appeals of creditors and shareholders against a NCWOL valuation , as well as the resolution authority against a NCWOL valuation . The relief available will be limited to compensation between the difference of the valuer and tribunal 's assessments of the compensation payable . <p> It suggests that the RCT be established as a standing body with a chair and two members . The chair and a longlist of members will be appointed for a five-year term by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong , following the examples of the Banking Review Tribunal and the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal . <p> To determine the powers of the new tribunal , the regulator will also look to the powers of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dissatisfied with the outcome , it will also be able to take the RCT 's decisions to the Court of Appeal . <p> What 's nextIn CP2 , the HKMA anticipates the need for a third round consultation ( CP3 ) to clarify the powers of the resolution authority , as well as the RCT . <p> The regulator has proposed that the resolution authority have the powers to direct a financial institution to make changes to its business practices , structure and operations to improve resolvability . It 's unclear whether this will also come under the jurisdiction of the RCT , and the HKMA has said it will provide proposals for a suitable mechanism in CP3 . <p> More broadly , the NCWOL scheme could apply to the resolution of financial institutions outside licensed banks . CP2 proposed expanding the scope of the resolution regime to financial market infrastructure , such as clearinghouses and exchanges ; insurance companies ; and non-bank non-insurer financial institutions such as asset managers depending on an Financial Stability Board/International Organization of Securities Commissions consultation . <p> The scope of the resolution regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be further clarified in the next consultation .

Therefore , following the global financial crisis , bank resolution regimes were amended to allow regulators to stay the termination of contracts . However , the reach of domestic insolvency law is limited : ' banks live globally , but die locally ' , as Mervyn King once said . This aphorism was repeated as regulators realised the limited reach of domestic insolvency laws . The solution to this problem , which was offered first by the industry and then mandated by regulations , was to provide in contracts for a stay of termination rights mirroring the statutory one . <p> Since January 1 2016 , Switzerland has also followed this approach to ensure the effectiveness of the 48-hours stay of termination rights in connection with the commencement of restructuring proceedings provided for by article 30a of the Banking Act .

One shortcoming of the reporting requirement , however , is that there is no requirement for the risk management system put in place by the fund managers . While Rule 249(d) ( 4 ) imposes a restriction on the percentage of assets that a fund can invest in a single investment " a maximum limit of 30% " there is no disclosure requirement on fund managers in instances where the proportion of voting rights in a non-listed company held by one of its funds exceeds , reaches or falls below the threshold . <p> While the introduction of these rules is commendable , a few key considerations will be had to certain scenarios not contemplated by the rules . There are few , if any , continuing compliance requirements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that has been posited is that the existing SEC compliance guidelines will serve to fill this gap . It may be pertinent to borrow a leaf from the AIFM Directive , which requires fund managers to ensure the appointment of a single depositary for each fund under management ( article 21(1) ) , and equally procure the independent valuation of all funds at least once a year ( article 19 ) . These requirements , however , have the attendant effect of increasing investment cost . <p> Another likely oversight on the part of the regulator is in relation to asset stripping " a grave possibility in an investment environment such as Nigeria " of the investee companies through buyouts that may form part of a short term investment strategy of PE investors . Although investors are free to exit their investments , it would seem that the nature of PE investments require a great deal of regulatory supervision in view of the enormity of the investments . In comparison , the AIFM Directive includes a provision that prohibits a fund or the fund manager from facilitating , supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquisition of its shares by the investee company until a period of 24 months following its investment in the investee company ( article 30 ) . <p> According to the Securities and Exchange Commission , the two goals of the amended rules are to provide a framework for the operation of PE Funds and pre-empt their illegal operations as the market develops . These rules are a step in the right direction in anticipating the future developments of PE investments . In the long run they will be a benefit both to investors and the entire PE chain .

International trade participants are of the view that such domestic recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments provides oil in the wheels of trade . Recognition is a precondition for enforcement of foreign judgments with the criteria for such recognition stipulated in domestic legislation . <p> In Nigeria , the requirement for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is contained in the Foreign Judgments ( Reciprocal Enforcement ) Act , Cap 152 , Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990 . Parties wishing to enforce foreign judgments in Nigeria must , as a first step , apply to have the judgment registered in the appropriate court . The time limit for such registration recently came up for resolution before the Nigerian Supreme Court in VAB Petroleum Inc v Mr. Mike Momah ( 2013 ) LPELR-SC. 99/2004 . <p> VAB Petroleum had sought to register a United Kingdom default judgment shortly after a successful appeal against its enforcement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court found that VAB Petroleum had failed to make the application within the time stipulated by the Act .

Section 4 permits creditors who obtained judgment from such foreign countries where the Minister 's orders extend to apply to register the judgment within six years from the date of judgment . Where the judgment has been subject of an appeal , section 4 permits the judgment creditors to make the application within six years from the conclusion of appeals . <p> Both sections ( 3 and 4 ) are , however , made subject to section 10 , which stipulates that foreign judgment given before the commencement of the order of the Minister may be registered within 12 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer period as may be allowed by a superior court in Nigeria . <p> The Supreme Court opined in the case under review that unless the Minister 's orders exists , which is permissible only where he is assured of reciprocity , a party does not have the luxury of waiting six years after the date of judgment or after exhausting all appeals before applying to register the judgment . Relying on its earlier decision in Macaulay v R.Z.B. Austria ( 2003 ) 18 NWLR ( Pt. 852 ) 282 at pp. 298H " 299 A-B , the Supreme Court held that the draftsman in section 10 of the Foreign Judgments ( Reciprocal Enforcement ) Act made clear and strict provisions . Foreign judgments made outside of the Minister 's orders are only registrable within 12 months except where an extension has been granted by the court registering the judgment for enforcement . <p> Thus , the Supreme Court found that VAB Petroleum had exceeded the time limited stipulated under section 10 of the Act and would not be permitted to register the foreign judgment . The court arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of several appeals and VAB Petroleum had only sought to register after all appeals had been exhausted . <p> It is clear that the Supreme Court arrived at that decision because nothing in section 10 of the Act supports suspension of registration pending appeal where the Minister has not made the order stipulated in section 3 . As absurd as that may sound , it is the law in Nigeria . Parties would do well to act within time in such cases to avoid being caught by the statute .

Changes in leadership and economic policies through the years , unfortunately , resulted in slower economic growth . In recent years , however , investor confidence in the Philippines has been renewed , with the Philippines being given labels such as " break-out nation " , one of " the NEXT-11 " and " the largest economy in South East Asia by 2050 " . <p> In the first quarter of 2012 , the Philippines ' $225 billion economy expanded by 6.4% , the fastest since 2010 .

Last year alone , approximately $6 billion-worth of investments were pledged and other foreign companies are set to come to the Philippines to explore possible opportunities in the country . In fact , in the fast-growing business process outsourcing sector , the Philippines is now considered the world leader . <p> As with investing in any country , the first question that a foreign investor asks is : What areas of economic activities are open to foreign ownership ? This question can easily be answered by mentioning the percentage of ownership allowed to foreign investors . The more critical issue , however , is how the nationality of a corporation is determined under Philippine law for purposes of investment . <h> Nationality restrictions on areas of investment <p> Article XII , Section 10 of the Philippine Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planning agency , when the national interest dictates , reserve to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at least 60% of whose capital is owned by such citizens , or such higher percentage as Congress may prescribe , certain areas of investments .

These areas are referred to as fully nationalised ( where no foreign ownership is permitted ) or partly-nationalised ( where foreign ownership is subject to a cap ) activities . <p> Under the FIA , foreign investors may own up to 100% of domestic market enterprises unless foreign ownership is prohibited or limited by the Constitution and existing law or the Foreign Investment Negative List ( Negative List ) referred to under Section 8 of the FIA . Section 8 states that the Negative List must have two components : List A and List B.

Nonetheless , where a corporation and its non-Filipino stockholders own stocks in a Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) -registered enterprise , at least 60% of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote of each of both corporations must be owned and held by citizens of the Philippines , in order for the corporation to be considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered when the stockholders are individuals . The rule is not as straightforward where the investee corporation has corporate stockholders , however . <p> In the recent case of Gamboa v Teves ( G.R. 176579 , June 28 2011 , 652 SCRA 690 ) , the Supreme Court took the opportunity to define the term " capital " in Article XII , Section 11 of the Constitution in relation to determining the nationality of a corporation engaged in the operation of a public utility . The issue was mainly whether all of a corporation 's outstanding capital stock should be considered in determining the corporation 's nationality for purposes of participating in fully nationalised or partly nationalised activities . The petitioner in that case argued that only those shares that entitle the shareholder to vote for members of the company 's board of directors were relevant for determining nationality . In its decision dated June 29 2011 , the Supreme Court agreed and ruled that , in light of the intention behind the Constitution 's granting effective control of enterprises in fully or partly nationalised activities to Filipinos , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution refers only to shares of stock that entitle their stockholders to vote in the election of directors , and not to the total outstanding capital stock comprising both common and non-voting preferred shares . This ruling would have validated the current practice of structuring foreign investments in nationalised activities in the Philippines through the issuance of non-voting preferred shares . <p> In its resolution ( G.R. No. 176579 , October 9 2011 ) of the motion for reconsideration filed by the respondents in Teves , however , the Supreme Court " while denying such motion " appeared to have modified its earlier decision . It held that the 60-40 ownership requirement in favour of Filipino citizens must apply separately to each class of shares , whether common , preferred non-voting , preferred voting or any other class of shares . The highest court reasoned that since the constitutional requirement of at least 60% Filipino ownership applies not only to voting control of the corporation but also to the beneficial ownership of the corporation , it is therefore imperative that such requirement apply uniformly and across the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category , comprising the capital of a corporation . According to the court , this is because , under the Corporation Code , capital stock consists of all classes of shares issued to stockholders " that is , common shares as well as preferred shares , which may have different rights , privileges or restrictions as stated in the articles of incorporation . The court noted that preferred shares , even if denied the right to vote in the election of directors , are in fact entitled to vote on the certain corporate matters . Accordingly , the court held that " since a specific class of shares may have rights and privileges or restrictions different from the rest of the shares in a corporation , the 60-40 ownership requirement in favour of Filipino citizens in Section 11 , Article XII of the Constitution must apply not only to shares with voting rights but also to shares without voting rights . " <h> Methods of determining nationality <p> In determining the nationality of a corporation , three methods have been recognised in the Philippine legal system : the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule ( SEC-Office of the General Counsel ( OGC ) Opinion No. 02-12 , February 2 2012 ) . <p> Based on the Corporation Code of the Philippines , the principal test in determining the nationality of a corporation is the Place of Incorporation Test . Simply put , Section 123 of the Code states that a corporation will be deemed a foreign corporation if it was " formed , organised or existing under any laws other than those of the Philippines . " For the purpose of determining compliance with nationality restrictions on fully or partly nationalised activities , however , the place of incorporation test is not the only test applicable . For such purpose , the control test has also been adopted by the SEC ( SEC Opinion dated November 23 1993 ) . <p> Under the control test , the nationality of a corporation is determined by the nationality of its stockholders ( see SEC Opinion No. 04-40 dated August 10 2004 , where the SEC stated that in applying the control test , all of the corporation 's capital stock must be considered ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . To determine the nationality of a corporation under the control test , the formula is quite simple : a corporation is automatically considered a Filipino national if at least 60% of its capital is owned by Filipino citizens . <p> In addition to the above tests , a third test has been applied by the SEC in determining the nationality of a corporation for purposes of meeting the nationality requirements in certain activities . Known as the grandfather rule , this method applies when a corporation is owned by another corporation with foreign stockholdings ( SEC Opinion No. 31-10 dated December 9 2010 ; see also SEC-OGC Opinion No. 19-07 dated November 28 2007 ) . Under this rule , nationality is determined by breaking down the equity structure of the component corporation(s) . If the percentage of Filipino ownership in the corporation is less than 60% , only the number of shares corresponding to such percentage will be counted as of Philippine nationality . This is done by multiplying the number of shares in the corporate shareholder owned by Filipinos by the number of shares of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers of shares owned by Filipinos in the investee company . One must not stop until the citizenships of the individual or natural stockholders of layer after layer of investing corporations have been established , the very essence of the grandfather rule ( see SEC En Banc Case No. 09-09-177 dated March 25 2010 ; some commentators have also stated , relying on the early case of Palting v San Jose Petroleum ( 18 SCRA 924 ( 1966 ) ) , that the application of the grandfather rule can not go beyond what is reasonable " for instance , the SEC has suggested in the past that the grandfather rule be applied up to three levels in relation to shares not traded in the stock exchange ( Cesar Villanueva , Philippine Corporate Law 66 ( 2010 ) ) ) . <p> Take for example Corporation Y , whose voting stock is owned 60% by Corporation Z , with the remaining 40% in Corporation Y being owned by foreigners . Corporation Z , in turn , is 60% owned by Filipino individuals and 40% owned by foreign individuals . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Filipino national because Corporation Z 's investment of 60% will have to be broken down to determine the respective actual , indirect interests in Corporation Y of Corporation Z 's Filipino and foreign shareholders .

To illustrate , Corporation Z 's shareholding in Corporation Y ( 60% ) multiplied by Corporation Z 's shares of stock actually owned by Filipinos ( 60% ) results in 36% Filipino ownership . This means that , under the grandfather rule , Corporation Y is not a Filipino national because the percentage of shareholding actually held by Filipino citizens is less 60% . <p> Nevertheless , in both the control test and the grandfather rule , Section 3 ( a ) of the FIA requires a second element : where a corporation and its non-Filipino stockholders own stocks in an SEC-registered enterprise , at least 60% of the capital stocks outstanding and entitled to vote of both corporations must be owned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the board of directors of both corporations must be citizens of the Philippines , in order for the corporations to be considered a Philippine national . <h> Control test v grandfather rule <p> As both tests have been applied in determining the nationality of a corporation for purposes of investment , the question of which of these two tests should be applied is a recurrent issue . It would be well to note that the control test and the grandfather rule are in fact two parts of one rule ( DOJ Opinion No. 20 dated May 5 2005 ) . In the 1967 SEC Rules implementing the requirements of the Constitution and other laws imposing nationality restrictions for the exploitation of natural resources , the nationality of a corporation with foreign equity was to be determined as follows : " shares belonging to corporations or partnerships at least 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens will be considered as of Philippine Nationality , but if the percentage of Filipino ownership in the corporation or partnership is less than 60% , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of Philippine nationality . " The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has explained that the first part of the rule is what is now essentially known as the control test . It is the more liberal rule because there will be no need to look into the equity or ownership of an investing corporation as long as at least 60% of the investee-company is Filipino-owned . Meanwhile , the second part of the rule corresponds to what is now termed as the grandfather rule . In contrast , it is the more stringent of the two rules , since the equity or ownership of both the investing and investee-company must be broken down and ownership traced and thereafter combined ( grandfathered , in other words ) in order to determine the actual percentage of Filipino ownership . <h> But when should each test apply ? <p> Both these tests appear to be relevant when fully or partly nationalised activities are involved . According to the DOJ and the SEC , however , the grandfather rule should be applied when the shareholders of a corporation are also corporations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 60% of the voting stock or the 60-40 Filipino-foreign equity ownership is in doubt : in cases where a joint venture corporation with less than 60% Filipino stockholdings invests in another joint venture corporation which is either 60% or less than 60% Filipino ( SEC-OGC Opinion No. 26-11 dated April 19 2011 ) . Otherwise , where 60% Filipino ownership is well established , the grandfather rule will not apply and the control test will be applicable ( DOJ Opinion No. 20 dated May 5 2005 ) . Thus , if say only 50% of the capital stock or capital of the corporation or partnership belongs to Filipino citizens , the grandfather rule will apply ( SEC Opinion dated November 23 1993 , citing DOJ Opinion dated January 19 1989 ) . <h> Structuring investments <p> Without labouring the point , the rules on determining nationality must be taken seriously as any violation of nationality restrictions will not only result in the imposition of heavy fines but may , depending on the circumstances , trigger penal liability ( under the Anti-dummy Law , for example ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution must be taken by foreign investors in setting up wholly or majority foreign-owned vehicles that will , in turn , own companies in the Philippines that will engage in partly-nationalised activities . Previously , foreign investors have resorted to the issuance of non-voting preferred shares to avoid breaching nationality restrictions .

The exception to the waiver is often noted in the litany of risk factors in the bond prospectus , warning investors that they may not have available to them claims against the sovereign issuer based on the anti-fraud or other protections of US securities laws .

" The secondary market issue is creating much more heartache than any of the origination pieces , " said one European bank counsel . <p> They are buoyed by the market-wide solution spearheaded by Bloomberg : a label similar to an ISIN or CUSIP that attaches to securities traded on the popular trading terminal will indicate what is and is n't a covered bond . <p> KEY TAKEAWAYS <p> Bloomberg has developed a tag identifier that could offer a solution to secondary trading market issues presented by the incoming Volcker Rule ; <p> The tag , which the issuer will be responsible for , will attach to instruments that are classified as covered funds under the incoming rule ; <p> The data licence product provides data feeds for clients to feed into their databases ; <p> Market participants hope the tag will be live by June 1 , ahead of the July 21 implementation date for Volcker 's covered fund provisions . <p> While banks can monitor and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party funds is more difficult . They must determine whether something is or is n't prohibited based on third party attestations and documentation drafted before the vague ' covered fund ' criteria was devised . <p> The tag will indicate that the security has been reviewed against the covered fund definition and , based on that analysis , either is or is n't treated as a covered fund . So before executing a trade , the bank can confirm that it will not fall foul of the rules . <p> Vigano said the data licence product provides data feeds for clients to feed into their databases . " The data will also appear on a Bloomberg Professional service screen that will be permissioned to clients that subscribe to the premium service , " she added . <p> The product will require banks selling securities via the terminal to inform Bloomberg whether it is a covered fund . Bloomberg must also determine whether the legacy instruments being traded today are or are n't covered funds ; IFLR understands some US banks and law firms have helped devise criteria on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been discussed since late last year , but it started to gain momentum in February when the Federal Reserve failed to grant the industrywide relief sought by Sifma Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association on the issue . <p> There will be a " not insignificant subscription fee " " according to one bank counsel , who added that Bloomberg is guarding the data very closely . <p> Many banks are still deciding whether to sign up to it . <p> Challenges <p> Bloomberg 's Vigano confirmed that the issuer will be responsible for the tag . Issues around liability , and who would be responsible if something went wrong , had been raised by counsel as a potential challenge faced by any tag . <p> Another potential challenge raised by counsel was timing . Some say that Bloomberg , the consultancy firm " believed to be KPMG " and banks devising the tags had hoped it would launch mid-May . When that time passed , some were concerned that it would not be online by July 21 , when the Volcker conformance period ends . <p> " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them could be .

A covered fund includes , inter alia , funds that rely on sections 3(c) ( 1 ) or 3(c) ( 7 ) as exemptions from the Investment Company Act . <p> " The documents for a lot of the older deals do n't get into different types of Volcker exceptions or 3(c) ( 1 ) or 3(c) ( 7 ) ; it just was n't on anyone 's radar so no one felt the need to define those aspects , " said one bank counsel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rely on something other than 3(c) ( 1 ) or 3(c) ( 7 ) ' , the answer could very well be ' maybe ' , " they added .

" By custom the disclosure will just say that a security is exempt under the 40 Act ; there was no need to say which exemption that was , " she said . <p> A bank investor needs to be certain which 40 Act exemption the security can rely on . " Right now there 's a lot of bilateral discussions between issuers and underwriters on that exact point , " Maxwell said .

@@8538222 @1738222/ <h> Cayman Islands <h> Author : Published : 1 Oct 2005 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> There have been a number of reported decisions in the Cayman Islands that underscore the basic principle that a director must act in good faith and in the interests of the company on whose board they serve . The courts of the Cayman Islands will regard appropriate English court decisions as highly persuasive and will take into account Commonwealth court decisions where general principles of company law are involved , unless there are specific statutory differences . The Cayman Islands cases referred to below are specifically identified and all other cases are of the English courts . <h> Common law duties <p> It has long been established in common law that a director owes two types of duty to the company , a fiduciary duty and a duty of skill and care . <p> In essence , this means that directors , operating and making decisions as a board , are required to : <p> act in good faith in the best interests of the company ; <p> use powers conferred on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they possess and reasonable care when acting in the company 's interests . <p> Furthermore , an individual director should not allow their personal interests to conflict with those of the company nor derive any personal profit from their position beyond what the company pays them . <p> If a director breaches any of their common law duties , the company can take action to recover its property or to obtain payment of damages from the director as compensation for any loss incurred . The company is also entitled to recover any personal profit a director may have made by exploiting their position . <p> To whom duty is owed <p> Generally directors ' duties are owed to the company as a whole and not to individual members . However , directors must be aware that in certain circumstances their duties are owed to a wider audience , including , for example , the interests of the company 's creditors . <p> In that regard , it was held in the Cayman Islands case of Prospect Properties v McNeill , 1990-91 CILR 177 at p 201 , that the directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company in failing to consider the interests of creditors . <p> There is no particular guidance under Cayman Islands law on how to determine the best interests of the company . However , where there are different groups of shareholders with different interests , the Cayman Islands Courts are likely to follow the established English approach that directors must act fairly between these different groups . <p> Although the directors duties are owed to the company ( as confirmed by the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal in Schultz v Reynolds and Newport Limited , 1992-93 CILR 59 ) a minority shareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the company if , for instance , the directors have used their controlling powers , either fraudulently or negligently , with the intention of benefiting themselves at the expense of the company . <h> Fiduciary duty <p> As confirmed in Prospect Properties v McNeill , an individual director must act in good faith in their dealings with or on behalf of the company and exercise the powers conferred on them and fulfil the duties of their office honestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a board have a duty to act in good faith in what they consider to be the best interests of the company ( Re Smith and Fawcett Ltd 1942 Ch 304 , at 306 , CA ) . They must not use their powers for the benefit of third parties or themselves . It is likely that , provided the director 's motives were honest and they genuinely believed the action taken was in the best interests of the company , the director would not normally be subject to claims that they should have acted differently . <p> The English Court of Appeal in Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd 1942 1 All ER 542 , held that " directors must exercise their discretion bona fide in what they consider - not what a court may consider - is in the interest of the company , and not for any collateral purposes " . Accordingly , the Cayman Islands Court is likely to interfere only where it believes no reasonable director would consider the action taken to be in the best interests of the company . <p> If a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best interests of the company , they are in breach of duty . <p> Duty to exercise powers for a proper purpose <p> A company 's memorandum and articles of association , relevant shareholders ' resolutions and board minutes will determine the powers conferred upon directors and the context in which they can be reasonably exercised . Any director who exercises these powers over the company 's assets other than for the purposes intended or for the benefit of the company as a whole will be liable for a breach of duty . <p> In certain circumstances where there is no question of insolvency of the company , these breaches of duty can be ratified after the event by the members in general meeting . This was permitted in Bamford v Bamford 1970 Ch 212 , where the English Court of Appeal held that the improper issue of 500,000 shares by the directors to defend a takeover bid could be ratified by the shareholders and therefore no challenge could be made to the directors ' actions . Shareholders can not ratify a breach of duty by the directors if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director must not put themselves in a position where there is an actual or potential conflict between their personal interest and their duty to the company . This is illustrated in the Cayman Islands decision in Phyllison Ltd v G H Ltd , 1992-93 CILR 160 . Further a conflict of interest will arise if the director seeks to exploit the assets or opportunities of the company for their own benefit . The effect of this at common law is that a director may not enter into a valid contract ( other than a service contract ) with the company , directly or indirectly , unless the company gives its approval in general meeting , or the articles permit such a transaction . <p> Strict application of this principle in all circumstances would often work to the detriment of companies and it is established that disclosure by the director of their interest may validate the contract . In practice , in most companies , provisions in the articles render contracts in which a director is interested enforceable subject to disclosure by the director of their interest to the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can carry on a competing business or serve on the boards of competing companies is unclear . There is old case law that provides that it is not a breach of duty for a director to serve on the boards of competing companies ( London and Mashonaland Exploration Co v New Mashonaland Exploration Co 1891 WN 165 ) . However , the fiduciary duties that bind all directors might in certain circumstances make such an appointment almost untenable in practice . <p> In certain circumstances a contract that is voidable by reason of a director 's interest can be ratified by the company in general meeting ( North-West Transportation Co Ltd v Beatty ( 1887 ) 12 App Cas 589 ) . <p> Duty not to fetter their own discretion <p> A director must not fetter their discretion to act in the best interests of the company by , for example , a contract with an outsider . Therefore , under Cayman Islands law , a director who is appointed by a shareholder can not agree with that shareholder , for example , to vote at board meetings in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not otherwise be a breach of their duties to the company ) . This situation is distinguishable from one in which the directors enter into an agreement on behalf of the company under which they bind themselves to vote in such a way as to ensure that the company performs its obligations under that agreement ( Fulham Football Club Limited and Others v Cabra Estates plc 1994 1 BCLC 363 ) . <p> Secret profits <p> A director 's fiduciary position precludes them from taking a personal profit from any opportunities that result from their position as a director even if they are acting honestly and for the good of the company . Any profit arising in such circumstances must be repaid to the company unless it has been previously disclosed and authorized . This applies whether the profit arises from a contract with the company or a third party . <p> Even if the director 's profit would not have accrued to the company , they must still account for it if the opportunity to make it arose through their directorship . This derives from the rule in equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit is liable to account for that profit ( Cayman Islands News Bureau Limited v Cohen and Cohen Associates Limited 1988-89 CILR 195 at p 208 , applying the House of Lords decision in Regal ( Hastings ) Ltd v Gulliver 1967 2 AC 134 ) . <p> Equally , it was confirmed in the Cayman Islands News Bureau decision that if a fiduciary duty is established , the question of accountability does not depend on whether the company ) would have obtained the benefit . A director can not escape their duty to account for a personal profit by resigning before they take it . <h> Common law duty of skill and care <p> The directors ' fiduciary duties impose on them a largely negative obligation to do nothing that conflicts with the company 's interests . At the same time , when they are acting in the company 's interests they are expected to exercise whatever skill they possess , and reasonable care . <p> Case law has long established that a director must attend diligently to the affairs of the company and that , in performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... an ordinary man might be expected to take in the same circumstances on his own behalf " ( Re Brazilian Rubber Plantations and Estates Ltd 1911 1 Ch 425 ) . <p> The starting point in determining the nature and extent of the duty of skill and care remains the English Court of Appeal decision in Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd 1925 Ch 407 . That case established three well-known principles as follows : <p> A director is not an expert , and need only display skills they actually possess . They are not expected to exercise a level of skill they do not have . <p> A director need not devote their continuous attention to the business . <p> A director is entitled , in the absence of suspicious circumstances , to rely on the experience and expertise of their co-directors and other officers of the company . <p> Degree of skill <p> The level of skill required by a director based on the City Equitable case is subjective and implies that they would not be expected , merely by virtue of their office , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they apply any skills they actually have . <p> Attention to the business <p> It was held in City Equitable that " a director is not bound to give continuous attention to the affairs of the company . His duties are of an intermittent nature " . This dictum is clearly more appropriate to a director who does not have a service contract with the company . A director 's service contract may specify the specific duties of the director and often requires that they devote their full attention to the business of the company and so would override the above principle . Equally , the size and nature of a company 's operations will be relevant to determining the matters that are attended to by the director personally , as again will the overall factual matrix . <p> More recent helpful guidance as to what in practice is expected of a director is found in the English decision of Re : Barings Plc ( No 5 ) 2003 1 BCLC 523 , where it was held that directors should : ( 1 ) " acquire and maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable them to properly discharge their duties as directors ; " ( 2 ) that they were under a " duty to supervise the discharge of the delegated functions ; " and ( 3 ) that " the extent of the duty ... depends on the facts of each particular case " . <p> Reliance on others <p> Generally , a director is entitled to rely on their fellow directors and officers of the company . Thus in Dovey v Cory 1901 AC 477 HL , it was held that a director was entitled to rely on a subordinate " put in a position of trust for the express purpose of attending to the detail of management " and was not liable for any loss resulting from wrongful acts committed by that person . <p> Similarly , in City Equitable it was held that " in respect of duties ... that may properly be left to some other official , a director is , in the absence of grounds for suspicion , justified in trusting that official to perform such duties honestly " . <p> Directors can not absolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , in Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock 1967 2 All ER 1255 the directors were held liable where they should have been aware of a wrong even though they were in fact ignorant of it . So ignorance is not necessarily a defence , and directors are expected to exercise their judgment and to delegate and supervise activities in such a manner as to uncover any unauthorized or unapproved actions . Furthermore , in Re Barings plc ; Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Baker ( 1998 ) BCC 583 at 586 , when making a disqualification order , the Judge held that , while directors are entitled to delegate functions , the high level of responsibility associated with their office requires them to supervise the delegated functions , even if they trust the competence and integrity of those below them . This approach is broadly consistent with the supervisory obligations explained in Re : Barings Plc ( No. 5 ) 2003 1 BCLC 523 . As a matter of practice , the delegation of authority should itself be periodically reviewed by the board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts are becoming increasingly vigilant in prosecuting and disqualifying directors for failing to fulfil their fiduciary duties , it is important that information on what is expected of directors is easily accessible for , and widely known by , directors . At present , requirements of directors in terms of their duties and the standard of skill and care expected are embodied in common law and the vast number of cases , coupled with a lack of legal expertise , means this information is not easily found and interpreted by directors . Notwithstanding that , it is clear that both English and Commonwealth authority have gradually adopted an objective test resulting in a more stringent approach to the degree of skill expected of a director and it would appear likely that the Cayman Islands Court will generally adopt that stricter approach , now that 80 years has passed since the City Equitable decision . The level of skill required is likely to be effected , in each individual case , by the overall factual matrix . <h> Statutory duties <p> The statutory duties imposed on the director of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law ( 2004 Revision ) . The Companies Law imposes a number of obligations upon a director , failure to comply with which can also result in penalties being imposed on the company . The main statutory obligations are : <p> to ensure that the company keeps books of account as prescribed by Section 59 of the Companies Law ; <p> to ensure that filings , such as the annual return , copies of any special resolutions and any change in the registered office or of the directors , are made to the Registrar of Companies ; <p> to ensure that the Register of Directors and Officers , Register of Members and Register of Mortgages and Charges are properly kept up to date and at the appropriate location for the company in issue ; and <p> to properly maintain a registered office in the Cayman Islands . <p> In addition to the above , directors of exempted segregated portfolio companies who enter into a contract or other agreement that is binding on a segregated portfolio must ensure the contract is executed by or on behalf of that segregated portfolio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially incur liability under other statutes , such as the Securities and Investment Business Law ( 2004 Revision ) . Further , banks , trust companies , insurance companies , mutual funds and certain other regulated entities in the Cayman Islands could incur liability to the Cayman Island Monetary Authority . <h> Breach of duty by directors <p> Under Cayman Islands law , a director who fails in their duties to the company could have unlimited liability for any loss suffered by the company , even if they themselves have not made any personal gain . Similarly , directors can be liable for actions outside their authority ( that are not ratified by the company ) and can be directly accountable to third parties for any loss or damage suffered by them , for instance , if found liable for any misrepresentations . <p> Breach of common law and fiduciary duties <p> In addition to potentially being dismissed as a director , if a director breaches their fiduciary duty or their duty of skill and care to the company , they will be liable to civil action instigated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is owed for any loss suffered or undisclosed profit made or advantage taken . The company may obtain : <p> an injunction to restrain the director and prevent them from carrying out or continuing with the action constituting the breach of duty ; <p> damages by way of compensation ; <p> restoration of the company 's property , provided it does not prejudice an innocent third party ; <p> an account of profits ; or <p> rescission of a contract in which the director has an undisclosed interest . <p> A director who has misapplied a company 's funds and is in breach of their fiduciary duties to the company will be liable to replace the funds , together with interest ( normally on a compounded basis ) ( Cayman Islands Grand Court , Pedro Devs Ltd v Zuiderent and Spotts Dev Ltd , 1990-91 CILR N-7 ) . <p> Liquidator 's powers <p> In practice , the question of whether directors have acted in accordance with their duties is one of the matters a liquidator appointed over a company will consider and they may , in appropriate circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although the specific statutory duties of a director of a Cayman Islands unregulated company may appear limited , the thrust of both English and Commonwealth decisions has for some time been to impose greater obligations upon directors .

@@8538223 @1738223/ <h> Foreign investors eye Finnish real estate <h> Author : Published : 1 Feb 2006 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The Finnish real estate market , generally characterized as a low liquidity market , has changed considerably in the 21st century . The volume of transactions has grown in recent years , due to an increase in foreign investment , vigorous restructuring of the portfolios of traditionally dominant players in the Finnish market ( that is , pension insurance companies , pension funds and life insurance companies ) and corporations ' considerable property outsourcing . Pension and life funds are now increasingly exploring international investment prospects , and investments made by various foreign investors in the Finnish real estate market have grown since 2001 . <p> According to market studies by The Finnish Institute for Real Estate Economics , the property transactions volume for 2004 totalled ? 3.2 billion and , by the end of September , the transactions volume for 2005 amounted to ? 2.1 billion . Up to 40% of transactions made in 2005 were made by foreign investors . <p> Corresponding development can be expected within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finland through Finnish banks . Yet recently Finnish property financing institutions have been challenged by international banks that specialize in global property financing . This entry by new players into the market has resulted in a welcome change to property financing and an increasing number of options are now available for investors . <h> Investment vehicles <p> Property investors often acquire properties in Finland through a mutual real estate company ( MREC ) or through a non-mutual real estate company ( REC ) . Both are limited liability companies , with somewhat similar administrative procedures . They are the legal owners of the underlying property , and owning the property is their sole purpose . The difference between an MREC and an REC is that an MREC 's shareholders , in that capacity , are entitled to possess certain premises in the real estate on the basis of their shareholdings . The premises possessed with certain shares are defined in the MREC 's articles of association . When the premises of an MREC are leased , the lease agreement is entered into between the lessee and the shareholder that owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made directly to the shareholder and not to the MREC . In an REC , the lease agreement is entered into by the REC and the lessee pays the rents to the REC . An REC can distribute profits to its shareholders through dividend distributions . <p> The MREC/REC is responsible for covering the property costs , that is , costs payable by the owner according to the lease agreement . With an REC , the property costs are covered with the REC 's rental income . In the case of an MREC , the costs are covered with maintenance fees paid by the shareholders ? these fees are typically matched with property costs , aiming to produce a zero net result for the MREC . <p> Real estate investors often use a separate Finnish special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) to acquire the shares in an REC/MREC and to administrate the Finnish activities and the acquisition . These SPVs are standard Finnish limited liability companies , capitalized by equity and loans . In the case of an MREC , an SPV receives lease incomes and pays interests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of an REC , the lease income needs to be distributed to the SPV in the form of dividend payments to enable it to amortize the acquisition loans . Group contributions can not be used because MRECs and RECs , as holding companies , are not taxed on the basis of the Finnish Business Income Tax Act . <p> By using an MREC structure , the acquisition loans and rental income are placed in the same entity because the SPV receives the lease income directly from the premises in the real estate that the MREC owns . The maintenance fees invoiced by an MREC and the interest payable on the loans are deductible in the taxation of an SPV . The targeted situation for an MREC is that the property-related costs are matched with the maintenance fees so that the MREC does not incur taxable profits . With an REC , where the company receives the lease income , the most efficient structure can be achieved by placing part of the financing in the REC . As tax treaties generally allow Finland to widely levy tax on income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnish RECs and MRECs , an SPV model is often necessary to create an efficient tax structure for exit situations . However , tax treatment varies depending on the tax treaty in question , and an efficient exit structure should be examined on a case-by-case basis . <p> An alternative to organizing the real estate ownership through a limited liability company is the basic form of direct property ownership , including ownership of land and the buildings on it . However , in a transfer of shares in a limited liability company ( such as an MREC or an REC ) , the applicable transfer tax rate in Finland is 1.6% , whereas the applicable transfer tax rate for property disposals is 4.0% . An efficient ownership structure from a tax perspective can also be obtained if an investor or a holding company purchases the underlying real estate directly instead of acquiring the shares in an REC or an MREC . This enables the purchaser to receive a step-up in the value of the real estate instead of maintaining the historical bookkeeping value , which would be the case if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the acquisition value of shares acquired in an MREC or a REC is not deductible during the period of ownership , which is the case with direct ownership of a real estate . <h> Restrictions on financial structuring <p> According to the Finnish Companies Act , a Finnish limited liability company may not grant security of any kind ( including guarantees , pledges , charges ) , or a monetary loan or other assets of the company , to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the company or in a company belonging to the same group . This financial assistance prohibition applies whether the funds are to be used for this purpose before or after an acquisition closes . So the decisive factor under scrutiny is the actual use of the funds . Deviation from this prohibition is not possible even if the board of directors or all shareholders of the company make a unanimous decision to do so , or if all creditors approve a deviation . So neither the target company nor a subsidiary within the target group may grant security to secure the repayment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target company . Based upon the opinion of certain scholars , it would , however , be possible to interpret the current company legislation in such a way that a Finnish limited company would be able to grant a loan or a security in connection with the acquisition of shares in a foreign sister company ( that is , associated or affiliated companies ) . There are no legal precedents on this issue , so this interpretation is somewhat uncertain . The Finnish Companies Act is subject to revision and will be replaced by new legislation in September 2006 . Changes regarding the rules on financial assistance are not expected to come into force , but a minor amendment in respect of intra-group acquisitions is expected . <p> Violating the provision on financial assistance will lead to an obligation to repay the loan or return the collateral without delay . The arrangement could also constitute a criminal act under the Finnish Companies Act . <p> Another legislative limitation that it is vital to acknowledge when carrying out real estate transactions in the Finnish market relates to implementation of sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circumstances ? sale and lease-back transactions implemented by selling a property together with its buildings are , under Finnish law , considered assignments by way of security , not mere transfers of title . As such , they are encompassed by a specific provision of the Finnish Code of Real Estate , according to which a clause stating the seller has the right to redeem the real estate at will , or that the seller has the right of first refusal before the real estate is conveyed to a new titleholder , will not be binding in a sale of real estate . Equally , any separate option right agreement could be regarded as non-binding when executed in connection with a sale and purchase of real estate . Moreover , the use of a clause under which the seller has the right to rescind the sale contract might be declared non-binding if regarded as a bare attempt to evade the law . <p> If a sale and lease-back arrangement is , subject to all-inclusive evaluation , considered void , by law it would be void not only between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as creditors . If the seller later becomes bankrupt , the sale and leaseback arrangement with the financing provider would not be binding in relation to the seller 's other creditors . <p> At the same time , a sale and leaseback arrangement implemented by simply selling the buildings and leasing the related property to the financier is permitted under the Finnish Code of Real Estate . Accordingly , sale and leaseback transactions are , as such , valid between the contractual parties . However , unless the lease right and the sale and purchase of the buildings are registered with the Finnish Land Register pursuant to the Finnish Code of Real Estate , the corresponding invalidity remains in relation to third parties . If execution proceedings of the seller begin , the arrangement with the financer would not be valid towards the seller 's other creditors , and in particular , towards the seller 's mortgagees . This lack of efficiency relates to the fact that the buildings and any equipment attached or appurtenant to it and located on the real estate are considered to be a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of the mortgage unless otherwise agreed by the other creditors , which is also a prerequisite for the above registrations . <h> Security arrangements <p> The security position of a debt-financing provider depends on how the acquisition is structured . Due to the financial assistance restrictions of the Finnish Companies Act , as discussed above , only a pledge over the shares of an MREC/REC , as well as a pledge over the shares in an SPV , are available when acquiring shares in an MREC or an REC . However , in the case of purchasing an MREC , where the lease agreements are entered into between an SPV and respective lessees , the rental payments and other rights relating to the lease agreements can also be validly pledged by the SPV . Furthermore , a business mortgage ( that is , a floating charge ) governed by the Finnish Enterprise Mortgage Act consisting of business assets of an SPV can be created . <p> The funds of an MREC/REC ( such as rents ) may not be transferred to an SPV to repay the acquisition loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , assuming also that group contributions are not available because of the tax status of the MREC/REC . <p> Regardless of the above , the assets and cashflow of the target company may , through a post-transaction merger of an MREC/REC into an SPV , be put into a position where they can be used as security for acquisition financing . This can be arranged by using business mortgages consisting of business assets of an SPV pledged to acquisition lenders . By merging an MREC/REC into an SPV , business mortgages extend to cover the assets of the MREC/REC as well . Simultaneously with the merger , the pledges of an MREC's/REC 's shares will expire . This view , although debated in legal literature , is based on the fact that the position of creditors and ( other ) shareholders of a merging company is not deteriorated without them having a possibility to oppose the merger ( as stipulated under the Finnish Companies Act ) and , therefore , having a possibility to require their claims to be satisfied before the execution of the merger . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SPV , no assets of , or cashflow generated by , an MREC/REC may be pledged to directly or indirectly secure a third-party loan taken for financing the acquisition or to satisfy any undefined future undertaking , commitment or liability of an SPV . <p> A Finnish limited liability company , generally speaking , may grant a loan or provide collateral to secure the repayment of a loan on behalf of a company belonging to the same group if the purpose is other than to assist the borrower in funding the acquisition of shares in the company or in another group company . Therefore , the prohibition on financial assistance does not apply to financing used for other purposes . It does not apply , for instance , for a working capital facility or for refinancing of existing debt within the group . In such cases , the assets of an MREC/REC and its possible subsidiaries and associated companies can also be validly pledged . <p> Because a transaction that includes prohibited financial assistance could have serious repercussions for shareholders and directors and because a Finnish company may grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the same group in certain refinancing cases ( as referred to above ) , the obligations of the pledgors under finance and security documents must be limited accordingly . So it is customary in Finland ( as in other jurisdictions ) to include limitation language in the security documents and loan agreement regardless of whether or not the relevant loan agreement is governed by the laws of Finland . <p> Subject to the restrictions set out above , it is also possible to create a charge over the proceeds arising from the leased premises to secure repayment of the liabilities of an MREC/REC . To be effective , the pledge of lease payments in relation to third parties requires a notice of pledge to be delivered to the lessees . Yet , based on the prevailing legal praxis and legal literature , advance notice of transfer would not be deemed enough in relation to third parties if it refers to any receivable that does not exist on the date of the notice ( the so-called earnings principle ) . <p> Naturally , with a direct purchase of underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investor or a holding company , the prohibition on financial assistance will not apply and the real estate and all profits it generates can , without restrictions , be pledged as a security for the acquisition financing . <p> Author biographies <h> Samuli Palin <h> CastrTn &amp; Snellman Attorneys Ltd <p> Samuli Palin has many years of experience in banking and finance , capital markets , and mergers and acquisitions .

The no-hostile-takeover social norm in Japan has denigrated such takeovers as unethical , and therefore operating as low-cost substitutes for an extensive system of legal rules for such activity . <p> Procedural safeguards in tender offers as well as securities anti-fraud rules remained underdeveloped through the 1980s . For instance , until 1990 , there were no disclosure requirements under the securities laws . This made it possible for a corporate raider to secretly amass shares of a public company and thrust itself upon unsuspecting management . <p> As well as cultural beliefs and the lack of adequate legal frameworks still making hostile takeover bids less likely , there are various business and structural impediments . One of the most effective is the established practice of stable cross-shareholding among Japanese banks and corporations . In assessing how to answer to a tender offer , the strategic shareholders would generally consider not only the attractiveness of the share premium offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitability of existing business relations with the target and the likelihood that the takeover will succeed . <p> However , the past few years have witnessed unprecedented - at least by Japanese standards - hostile M&amp;A activities . The emergence of a stronger corporate control market in which firms with poor financial performance can not maintain their cross-shareholdings is becoming a reality . When considering recent deals as Cable &amp; Wireless 's acquisition of IDC and Boehringer Ingelheim 's acquisition of a blocking stake in SS Pharmaceuticals , Japanese management no longer seems immune from hostile acquisitions or other unwelcome shareholder advances . And investment banks are no longer discouraging foreign clients from hostile bids . <p> Tender offers and stock accumulation <p> In 1991 , Japan instituted a mandatory bid rule requiring that any offer to buy more than 33.3% of a target 's shares should be made through a tender offer to all shareholders . In principle , tender offer rules apply whenever shares are acquired outside of the securities markets , with a few exceptions . This broad rule is designed to protect minority shareholders by ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by ensuring disclosure of even a private purchase where a majority shareholder would emerge . <p> It should be noted that , because of strong requests by industry sectors , the Financial Services Agency ( FST ) is now discussing to amend the one-third share capital Takeover Bid ( TOB ) requirement . In November 2003 , the Financial System Counsel ( Kinyu-shingi-kai ) began a study into this and while nothing has been determined by press time , discussions have proposed the requirement be changed to a half . The FST expects to submit its bill on this to the Ordinary Diet Session of 2004 with the legislation effective by the end of 2004 . <p> The Securities and Exchange Law ( SEL ) states that when a person buys stock in a registered company either outside the securities market or over-the-counter , the person shall make a tender offer ( kokai kaitsuke ) to the general public by using the TOB system , except when : <p> the total amount of stock bought by a buyer and its affiliated persons is less than 5% ; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-third of share capital , provided that stocks are bought from 10 or less persons and/or less than within a 60-day period ; and <p> Takeover Bid proceduresFirstly , a brokerage house or financial institution must be selected as the agent to file paperwork and ensure payments of fees . <p> Secondly , a TOB acquirer must submit a public notice of the offer in at least two daily newspapers to announce the purpose of the buyout , the price , the number of stocks it plans to buy , duration and tender offer terms and conditions , and contracts to be disclosed regarding shares , voting rights agreements , or collateral agreements . The acquirer must also submit the tender offer registration statement or TOB application ( statement and basic financial information about the acquiring company ) to the relevant local finance bureau on the same day . The acquirer must also send a copy of the application to the target company , stock exchange authorities and the Japan Securities Dealers Association . <p> Thirdly , the duration of the offer must be between 20 and 60 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the offer period can be extended . <p> Fourthly , detailed terms of the offer must be sent to all shareholders of the target company who expressed an interest in selling their shares to the bidder . Purchase price and other conditions for the TOB shall be made equally to all shareholders . <p> Fifthly , the TOB conditions may be changed during the tender offer period , except in relation to : reducing the purchase price ; decreasing the number of stocks to be acquired ; and changing the buyout terms . Withdrawal of a TOB , however , is not permitted unless a material event , such as bankruptcy , occurs . <p> Finally , there are no fair price rules , but if a tender offer is required , the price must be no less than the highest price paid outside the market in the last 60 days . <p> A tender offer under Japanese law does not necessarily achieve full control . There are no so-called squeeze-out provisions , which would force minority shareholders to sell their shares to a successful TOB acquirer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No mandatory offerThere is no statutory requirement for mandatory offers , nor any level at which a mandatory general offer on all the shares of a company is required . However , if a buyer wants to acquire at one time a holding from a specified group of sellers , and this triggers a tender offer requirement , then it may be necessary to acquire the whole company because the accepting shareholders would be entitled to participate in the offer on a pro rata basis . <p> In practice , however , techniques are used to avoid a tender offer for all outstanding shares . The bidder would launch a tender offer specifying a minimum number of shares it wants to buy ( but no maximum ) . This amount generally corresponds with one that is pre-negotiated with one or several core shareholders of the target , resulting in the bidder accepting the tender of all shares by the core shareholders during the tender offer period . Further , the bidder and core shareholders seeking liquidity ( cashing out large blocks of shares ) would often agree on pre-arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders have no incentive to tender their shares . About half of all tender offers in Japan are transacted on offer price below the market price . <p> Duties of directors taking defensive measures <p> Directors ' duties during contests for corporate control remain unclear and untested in Japan . Few statutory laws and little case law relate to directors ' duties and the responsibilities of Japanese companies in the context of contested or competitive bids . The question of the adequacy of the measures and actions taken by the corporate management would likely be determined by the Japanese courts by applying the traditional rules under the Commercial Code , in particular , the duty of care and the duty of loyalty . <p> The duty of care and the duty of loyaltyUnder Japanese law , the directors owe duty of care ( Article 254 of the Commercial Code , Article 644 of the Civil Code ) . The director 's duty of loyalty ( Article 254-3 of the Commercial Code ) was added to the Commercial Code in 1950 as a direct import from the US . Article 254-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company the duty to perform their functions faithfully , in compliance with the laws , the company 's charter provisions , and resolutions of shareholders meetings . " It should be noted that the Japanese courts usually do not separately apply the duty of loyalty and the duty of care . <p> A Supreme Court decision of June 24 1970 adopted the view that Article 254-3 clarifies and restates the duty of care ( similar to a duty of diligence of a good manager ) but does not constitute a separate or higher duty for corporate directors . The development of the defence mechanisms and strategies will make the Japanese courts face more opportunities to give meaning to those abstract standards in the context of hostile takeovers . <p> Business judgment ruleIn the US , the business judgment rule plays an important role in giving management certain autonomy . The rule provides that directors are not liable for judgments in which they did not have any personal interest , and which were made with knowledge that they reasonably believed to be sufficient in the circumstances and in the rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company . <p> The doctrine of the business judgment rule is yet to be firmly established in Japan , although some lower court judgments have referred to it . The Tokyo District Court judgment of September 16 1993 applied a Japanese version of the business judgment rule to a case where the directors of Nomura Securities Co , Ltd were sued for paying illegal compensation to preferred customers . The Tokyo District Court found the directors not liable under the business judgment rule . It is still uncertain how the duty of care/loyalty and the business judgment rule would be applied to the management actions against hostile takeover . <p> Possible defensive mechanisms <p> In the event of an unsolicited , hostile takeover bid for the publicly listed shares of a Japanese company , the management can consider various defences in response . Although none would be certain to succeed , depending on circumstances the bidder might be deterred from continuing to pursue the offer . <p> Reactive versus preventive measuresIf no reactive measures are in place , the timing required to carry out such measures against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general assembly to be held during the offer period , could make reactive measures of little use . It can leave the target company vulnerable and unable to effectively respond to an unsolicited bid . <p> Issuing new shares to a friendly unaffiliated third party ( white knight ) or an existing shareholder after a takeover has started may be considered illegal under the primary purpose doctrine described below . By contrast , preventive anti-takeover measures could be carried out before a potential threat and appear more effective to deter a business or financial raider . <p> Risks of issuing new sharesThere are a few cases concerning the use of issuing shares to white knights as a defensive measure once a takeover has started . In a case decided by the Tokyo District Court in 1989 , the court decided to void the target management 's white knight stock placement as unfair where the primary purpose of the issuance was to dilute the holdings of the bidder and to maintain control over the company . The court confirmed that the issue price in question was determined without regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , as defined in Article 280-2(2) of the Commercial Code . The court 's opinion was : that the primary purpose of the target company 's issuance of new shares in question was to reduce the competitor 's shareholding ratio and to maintain the existing directors ' control over the company ; that the issue of new shares was undertaken , at a minimum , with the knowledge that it would result in a marked drop in the competitor 's shareholding ratio ; and that the issuance of new shares of such a large amount was not justified , and , therefore , was grossly unfair . <p> The so-called primary purpose rule was also adopted in Takahashi Sangyo v Miyairi Valve ( Tokyo District Court , September 5 1989 ) . In that case , the court did not enjoin the issuance of the shares . The court held that the primary purpose was for external financing and that it could not conclude with the evidence that the primary purpose was for entrenching a competitor or the bidder . The courts ' application of the primary purpose rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against hostile takeover bids rather than reactive measures . <p> Preventive measuresA basic defensive measure would be for the company to agree in advance with one or more of its core shareholders to repurchase its ( or their ) shares in the company in the event of a threat of a hostile takeover bid . Before the 2001 Amendment to the Commercial Code , repurchasing treasury stocks was generally prohibited . However , after the amendment a company can repurchase its own shares as treasury stock . <p> To do this , a company would have to satisfy two requirements . Firstly , the shareholders must authorize the buy-back and certain basic terms and conditions , such as amount and price , at the annual general meeting ( AGM ) , which is held in June for most Japanese companies . Secondly , the aggregate price the company would be allowed to pay for the buy-back must be limited to the surplus , that is , tier-two capital ( shihon junbikin ) . <p> If approved by shareholders , and up to the maximum amount allowed given the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discretion and flexibility in carrying out the repurchase programme in terms of number of shares , timing and price . Advantages of this defence are that once authorized by shareholders , it can be implemented quickly , eliminating the need to identify a white knight and provide certain deterrents for a potential bidder . A disadvantage is that even with a large amount of surplus and cash reserves , such a large buy-back of shares could have a rather negative impact on the company 's financial condition . Another problem appears to be that if the company acquires shares constituting more than one-third of its share capital , it would generally trigger tender offer requirements under the SEL ( for its own shares ) . <p> Considerations for a pre-emptive white knight strategyThe most obvious defensive reaction against a hostile bid for the company would be to agree in advance with a white knight to launch a counter bid or other transaction on the company 's shares . This would enable the company 's management , under the protection of the white knight , to maintain effective control on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks associated with indirectly acquiring only a minority shareholding in the company . <p> This strategy and the selection of a white knight must be considered carefully because it often results in an unwanted change in control rather than in achieving successful independence of the target . In practice , the white knight strategy often requires a group of unaffiliated white knights to circumvent the restrictions on the choice of white knight and to limit the risks of betrayal by diversifying the risks among several white knights . Although typically a white knight defence is used as a reactive measure rather than pre-arranged as a preventive measure , a company can explore with financial institutions and other strategic , non-competitive parties structuring a defence in advance . The risk is , of course , that the strategy becomes known in the market and the company 's vulnerability is highlighted . A hostile bid may be the unwelcome result . <p> Restrictions on choice of white knightUnder Japanese law , there are certain limits to having a single white knight as a bank or an insurance company , although certain structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Japanese Banking Law provides that certain financial institutions ( domestic and foreign banks ) are prohibited from holding more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a Japanese company . Bank holding companies are not directly subject to this restriction because they are not banks as such . The Banking Law prohibits a bank holding company from holding ( together with its subsidiaries ) more than 15% of the voting stock of any Japanese company . The universe of entities that could act as a white knight to hold a certain portion of the shares in the target company is therefore limited . It might be possible to structure the white knight defence so that a group ( at least two ) of financial institutions acting as white knights is used , where , for example , two friendly bank holdings acquire 15% each of a core shareholder 's shareholding in the target company . The above restrictions do not to apply to bank subsidiaries ( to the extent such subsidiaries are not mere special purpose entities or conduits ) , securities companies , private equity funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions not covered under the Banking Law . <p> Transfer of core shareholdings to white knight(s)The transfer or sale of a core shareholder 's holding in the company to a white knight , or a group of white knights ( whether or not an existing shareholder of the company ) , would generally trigger the requirement to launch a tender offer to all shareholders of the company if the white knight crosses the one-third threshold . One strategy could be for a core shareholder or a group of core shareholders of the target company to transfer its ( or their ) shares to a white knight or a group of white knights in an amount constituting less than one-third of the total outstanding . However , the tender offer rules may apply if a voting rights pooling arrangement is entered into between the new shareholders acting as white knights and/or with certain existing core shareholders according to the SEL 's special relationship rules . These would result in all voting rights of the parties being in a special relationship under the voting agreement and therefore aggregated and exceeding the one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , more commonly known as poison pills , have been an effective deterrent to hostile takeover bids in the US for nearly 20 years . The legality of poison pills has been upheld and the structures have evolved and become an accepted part of the preventive defensive strategy of many large publicly listed companies . <p> No major Japanese company seems to have adopted a poison pill and no Japanese court has ruled on its legality . From a legal perspective , one of the biggest problems in designing a poison pill within the Commercial Code relates to the unequal treatment of all shareholders . Under Japanese commercial law , it has been established that shareholders should be treated equally . As a board member of a Japanese company , a director should exercise reasonable care in reviewing any poison pill proposal before a hostile bid because once a bid is made , a director would be scrutinized as to whether he adhered to his fiduciary duties . Certain motives for creating a poison pill include : self-interest of management ; negotiation tactics ( management wants to use defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better offer ) ; and timing considerations ( management believes that selling the company is not in the shareholders ' interests ) . <p> For many years , the Commercial Code has not provided managers with the flexibility to craft US defensive mechanisms such as the poison pill . As noted below , however , with the example of share acquisition rights ( SARs ; shinkabu-yoyakuken ) , several amendments to the Commercial Code over the past 10 years can be viewed as increasing the flexibility of managerial discretion and enhancing corporate defence measures , despite the amendments not being intended as such . Japanese companies are now considering using those new tools as shark-repellent mechanisms , for instance the more flexible issuance of non-voting shares , restricted voting rights attached to any class of shares and special class of shares with certain veto powers . <p> Share acquisition rights as poison pillsIntroduced on April 1 2002 , SARs were first used by WalMart in its phased acquisition of Japanese retail chain Seiyu . The rights are similar to stock options that can be used as an acquisition tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used as poison pills by issuing them to a favourable business partner or existing shareholders . <p> SARs and common stock are different securities . The SAR-holder becomes a shareholder of the company on payment of the exercise price to the company . Therefore , until the option-holder pays the exercise price , it has no shareholder rights with respect to the shares to be issued or delivered . One limitation is that the value of the SARs must be limited to the amount of authorized capital ( four times the amount of the paid-in capital ) . <p> The main merits of SARs are five-fold : ( i ) they generally require only a board of directors decision ; ( ii ) they would not trigger a TOB requirement for the SAR-holder even if , on conversion , its shareholding in the issuing company exceeds the TOB thresholds ; ( iii ) there is certain flexibility for the board of directors to structure the terms and conditions of exercise ( for example , a hostile TOB on the company or on a company group 's strategic partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iv ) there is no statutory limit in time to exercise the SAR ; and ( v ) the exercise of the SARs by a white knight would have the effect of diluting all other existing shareholders , including certain core shareholders ' shareholdings in the company , providing an effective deterrent to a potential raider . <p> SARs may technically operate as poison pills , as in Europe and the US . Yet it is unclear whether Japanese courts would consider this issuance illegal or inappropriate under the Commercial Code , particularly in the case where the SARs are issued to one friendly business partner or white knight . <p> The use of SARs as poison pills has never been tested in court and it is not believed that any implementation in practice of SARs schemes as poison pills has occurred yet in Japan , although several Japanese companies are studying the feasibility .

There is no protection under the Commercial Code for shareholders such as standstill that would guarantee them to maintain their initial shareholding percentages in the company .

While project bonds have grown , they are not yet as common a product as many had hoped and the pool of potential investors remains limited . Meanwhile , banks continue to offer longer tenors - a trend spurred by the flow of capital from Japanese banks . While investors view this as a positive sign for securing financing , Citibank 's Nasser Malik , managing director and head of global structured debt at Citi , worries it is stunting the development of new debt products that would be a more stable foundation for the project finance market . <h> What is the biggest trend affecting project finance right now ? <p> Globally , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back the clock , going into the European sovereign debt crisis there was a great deal of speculation on how banks would deal with project finance because of both Basel III and dollar liquidity challenges . Three years later , banks seem to be less focused on Basel III , despite the need for European banks to continue deleveraging . At the same time , liquidity pressures seem to have dissipated . <h> " Japanese banks are being increasingly aggressive in the way they put money into the system " <p> There is more capital available to deploy than two or three years ago . Project sponsors are looking for funding from both banks and the bond market . There is more disciplined behaviour in both the US and European bank markets , but the foundation for bank markets in general may become a little weaker going forward . We will need to see a stronger foundation for debt capital built up over the next five to 10 years . <p> The number of bank players in project financing has decreased relative to pre-crisis numbers , though there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend stems from the increased participation of Japanese banks , though one has to question how sustainable their quantum of lending is . <h> What effect have the long tenors Japanese banks offer had on the global project finance market ? <p> Sponsors that want to harness Japanese lending are seeking to incorporate as many Japanese touch points as possible in a deal . They will have Japanese shareholders and capital goods providers , and then bring in Japanese banks and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation ( JBIC ) . Because of this , they are able to obtain very long tenors without having to go to the bond market . Competition engendered among Japanese lending institutions is also resulting in tighter spreads that US and European banks are now forced to chase . <p> Japanese banks are being increasingly aggressive in the way they put money into the system . I do n't know if it is sustainable . For now , that aggression is delaying further development of an institutional investor market for project finance , which may be an issue if Japanese banks suddenly pull back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Japanese banks five years from now . If we do , it will leave us in a healthier place by fostering the further development of debt capital market solutions , which will be able to address lender needs while also handling the construction risk of which many investors today are still wary . <h> Following the financial crisis , there was a lot of talk about the need for project bonds to be more actively used . Where do we stand now on their use and should we expect them to become more common ? <p> We have seen a nice if not important increase in project bond activity and volume , though it 's hard to get a full sense of this as some has been fully supported by government guarantees , lowering the risk . Even so , the growth in project bond activity has been a significant milestone in validating the importance of project bonds to the project finance market . That said , there are still a relatively small number of investors driving these transactions . More work needs to be done to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieving the sustainability of this market with the emergence of new dedicated third-party money managers that invest in infrastructure debt . This has mostly occurred in Europe and the UK , and it 's a very healthy development . When money is raised for this purpose , it comes with specialised skills and knowledge of the infrastructure sector and how a transaction should be structured . The growth has raised some concern that there is not sufficient deal volume in the pipeline to deploy these funds , but this is due more to a lag effect from the euro crisis . <p> There has been a lot of conjecture about how capital markets and investors will be a rising force in the infrastructure realm . This is plausible ( indeed desirable ) , but at the moment work still needs to be done around how government concessions are awarded , in tandem with engendering a process that incorporates the unique nuances of infrastructure financings . There is still a long way to go to getting the kind of certainty of execution that equity investor will need . <h> Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks who have since taken on the role of financing the greenfield stages of projects and allowing more typical long term investors such as pension funds to fund the brownfield stages . Is this the new norm and does it pose any problems ? <p> This is the model some people have hoped for because investors very often do n't want construction risk , but this is n't easy to solve . What if there is a long construction period ? What if yields in the bond market have significantly risen at the point of refinancing ? It can be hard to refinance the debt if that is the case . <p> What equity investors are saying is that they often need to know that they have financing for life to proceed with a project , and this approach ca n't guarantee that . While some projects can withstand this re-financing risk , for others , particularly infrastructure projects , the risk can be too much stress on the equity ( and , thereby , the lenders as well ) . There are a lot of ideas out there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them comprehensively solves the issue globally . <h> How would you classify the state of financing in developing countries where project financing is arguably most needed ? And how important is securing local financing in those markets ? <p> Some countries are getting what they need " Peru , Mexico and much of Asia , for example . The problem is how you define developing . There are regions where banks are lending and where capital markets are lending . In some lesser developed countries , there is not as much activity . <h> " I question whether we will see a market led by Japanese banks five years from now " <p> In some lesser developed regions , the multilaterals want to help , but may not necessarily have the best tools for the market . The foundation on which the multilaterals were created has changed . Some investors today want to be paid for sovereign risks , rather than be protected from them " but these same investors are not likely to want construction risk . The BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , China and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to build a foundation based on the world of today . <p> Additionally , in many emerging markets , local currency markets are needed to create longer-term sources of infrastructure funding , but that requires broader macro-economic and structural reform . Chile is a really great example of this . There are other examples of governments that want to foster greater capital formation for infrastructure finance , but which place constraints that will ultimately frustrate the development of a sustainable and healthy market . <h> Should banks be pushing for more social conciseness in project finance ( such as green bonds , native rights , sustainability ) ? Or is this beyond the role of banks ? <p> Ultimately , banks have been the leaders of the equator standards . More recently , there has also been a paradigm shift in the notion of green investing , to an investor base that is increasingly green-conscious .

@@8538227 @1738227/ <h> Cayman Islands : Partnership rules <h> Author : Published : 23 Apr 2008 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The last five to 10 years have witnessed the globalisation of the private equity market . In particular US LBO private equity houses have spread their network to Europe , Asia and the emerging markets in pursuit of value driven deals . As a result of this globalisation , the Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership has become increasingly popular as the vehicle of choice for co-investment funds , parallel funds and alternative investment vehicles ( AIVs ) . Indeed , it is also growing in popularity as a vehicle for main funds , when managers and tax advisers have determined that real estate deals , which would otherwise give rise to Foreign Investment Real Property Tax Act ( FIRPTA ) issues , are unlikely to occur . <p> When a US Fund forms either an AIV or a Co-investment Fund for certain tax-exempt or foreign investors , the US and Cayman Islands counsel are eager to ensure that the partnership agreement for the Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership mirrors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onshore fund vehicle as far as is possible . Not only must the commercial terms be replicated in the Cayman Islands law governed partnership agreement ; the legal protection offered to limited partners , general partner and persons sitting on the Advisory Board , must be consistent with the Delaware limited partnership . <p> The Cayman Islands laws applicable to exempted limited partnerships comprise the Exempted Limited Partnership Law ( 2007 Revision ) ( ' the Law ' ) and the rules of equity and of common law applicable to partnerships as modified by the Partnership Law ( 2002 Revision ) , except when they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the Law . This regime provides a flexible framework for drafting partnership agreements . Partners may agree by contract how to conduct the partnership subject to certain statutory limitations and common law principles applicable to contractual relations generally and partnerships in particular . Consequently , it is relatively straightforward to adapt the Delaware or any other onshore partnership agreement and to produce a Cayman Islands partnership agreement consistent in all material terms . <h> Third party beneficiary rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should note that no third party beneficiary rights extend to persons who are not parties to a partnership agreement governed by Cayman Islands law . This may affect the business deal unless it is covered contractually by other means . Areas to consider will include the claw-back provisions and the requirement to bind principals of the Cayman Islands general partner entity that would otherwise have no obligation to contribute capital if the general partner entity were insolvent . This can be cured separately by contract or claw-back guarantee granted by the principals . <p> Indemnity provisions are another area to consider . Individuals not party to the partnership agreement may not have a directly enforceable right of indemnity . This is often considered by general partners and members of the Advisory Board and can be managed by separate contracts for each individual concerned or by an indemnity agreement governed by US law , which respects the rights of third party beneficiaries . Additional language in the partnership agreement should also be considered to expressly allow the general partner to enter into these types of arrangements with third parties . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership interests can not be assigned without the general partner 's prior written consent . In practice , the terms of the Delaware partnership agreement often set out certain types of transfers that can be made without the consent of the general partner but with all other transfers requiring the consent of the general partner . Under section 7(7) of the Law , the general partner 's prior written consent is required for a transfer of a partnership interest . The general partner may withhold consent , regardless of contrary statements in the partnership agreement . Accordingly , language with respect to certain transfers not requiring the consent of the general partner would be unenforceable and should be amended to ensure compliance with the Law . The general partner may deal with this issue by issuing a comfort letter giving consent to certain types of future transfers . The wording of such letters always requires careful consideration . The parties must ensure that the grant of the comfort letter constitutes a proper exercise of the general partner 's powers . <h> Powers of attorney <p> Powers of attorney are commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the Powers of Attorney Law ( 1996 Revision ) of the Cayman Islands , a document creating a power of attorney must be executed as a deed ( and witnessed , in the case of individuals ) or as an instrument under seal by the donor of the power . Section 4 of the Powers of Attorney Law provides that when a power of attorney is irrevocable and secures a proprietary interest of the donee of the power , or secures the performance of an obligation owed to the donee , then the power shall not be revoked by the donor without the donee 's consent , as long as the donee has that interest or the obligation remains undischarged . Nor will the power be revoked by donor 's death , incapacity or bankruptcy , or ( if the donor is a corporate ) by its winding-up or dissolution . <p> To fall within these provisions the powers of attorney must be carefully drafted in the partnership agreement . Sometimes the power of attorney is replicated in the subscription agreement or a side letter , which is governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no requirement for the donee of the power of attorney to have a proprietary interest for that power of attorney to be irrevocable . <h> Rights of withdrawal <p> In certain circumstances , limited partners have a limited right to withdraw partially or completely from a Delaware limited partnership , if ERISA , anti-trust or other onshore regulations apply , limiting the percentage of ownership a limited partner may hold in certain portfolio acquisitions made by the limited partnership . Typically , these are drafted to allow the limited partner the right to request withdrawal , subject to the general partner 's satisfaction of certain conditions , although in some circumstances the limited partner may have a right of withdrawal . Usually the existence of conditions to the right to withdraw will mean the partnership will fall outside the definition of a mutual fund under the Mutual Funds Law ( 2007 Revision ) of the Cayman Islands and will not give rise to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority as a mutual fund . However , the partnership agreement must be carefully drafted to ensure the partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This issue can be avoided by ensuring that the general partner retains ultimate control over the withdrawal of the limited partner . <p> This is part one of a series of articles intended to highlight , in brief detail , the principal points to focus on when drafting the Cayman Islands law-governed partnership agreement in terms that replicate an existing Delaware limited partnership <p> To download a full copy of IFLR 's Private equity and venture capital review , please click here

@@8538235 @1738235/ <h> Ireland : Negotiating derivatives documentation <h> Author : Published : 20 Jul 2010 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> Derivatives are widely used in Ireland by many types of legal entities , including credit institutions , insurance companies , building societies , professional associations , trusts , individuals , corporate entities and governmental agencies such as the National Treasury Management Agency . In addition , Ireland is a leading jurisdiction for the establishment of investment funds . Specific regulations issued by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority ( the financial regulator ) govern the use of derivatives by investment funds established in Ireland . <p> Generally speaking , Ireland is considered a relatively friendly jurisdiction from the perspective of post-insolvency close-out netting by reliance on legislation implementing the EU Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive , the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 , as amended , and relevant Irish common law and insolvency rules . <h> Use of derivatives <p> When first introduced , undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( Ucits ) were only permitted to use derivatives ( referred to in the Irish Regulations as financial derivative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , with the introduction of Ucits III , which was implemented in Ireland by the European Communities ( Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ) Regulations , 2003 ( as amended ) , the use of derivatives was extended to permit their use for investment purposes . The financial regulator also regulates non-retail investment funds established in Ireland , such as Qualifying Investor Funds ( QIF ) and Professional Investor Funds ( PIF ) . <p> When negotiating derivatives documentation involving a Ucits , a QIF or a PIF , parties need to consider the Ucits notices or non-Ucits notices , as the case may be , and the related guidance notes issued by the financial regulator which set out certain conditions with which such funds must comply . In addition to compliance with regulatory requirements , there are other important technical and commercial considerations that should be reflected in the Isda Schedule and Isda credit support documents to ensure legal enforceability and the proper protection of commercial interests . <h> Proper identification of parties <p> The Isda master agreement will often be entered into by an umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although contained in a single document , by contractual agreement separate Isda master agreements are deemed to be formed between the relevant counterparty and the umbrella fund acting severally in respect of each of the sub-funds . A careful description of the parties is required . <p> Irish law requires that the description of the umbrella fund , on its letterhead and in any legal agreement , should include the words " an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds " . Also , the definition of affiliates should be amended to avoid unintended inter-connectedness between sub-funds . <h> Limited recourse provisions <p> Where an Irish fund is established as an umbrella fund with one or more sub-funds , part XIII of the Companies Act 1990 provides for segregated liability between such sub-funds . Nevertheless , it is best practice to include contractual limited recourse provisions in the Isda Schedule to reduce the risk of cross-liability between sub-funds . <p> Each of the events of default and termination events hard-wired into the Isda master agreement should be reconsidered in the context of a regulated fund . For instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is appropriate , when applied to a fund . There is an argument that this termination event should not be applied in respect of any fund where it is not possible to monitor changes of control of the fund . <p> The parties should include appropriate language to ensure that the occurrence of an event of default or termination event in respect of a single sub-fund would not constitute an event of default or termination event with respect to the Isda master agreement , deemed to have been entered into according to the same physical document , in respect of any other sub-fund . <h> Additional termination events <p> When negotiating an Isda Master Agreement with an investment fund , often the additional termination events are heavily negotiated . There are a number of additional termination events which are particularly relevant in a fund context . <p> Additional termination events relating to the decline of the net asset value ( NAV ) of the fund are common , on the basis that it is necessary to protect against increased NAV volatility and a significant decline in NAV . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to NAV volatility , reference should be made to ' NAV per share ' as opposed to unmodified NAV . Concerns relating to a minimum NAV can be addressed by a separate additional termination event . <p> Also the fund may propose language to provide that the counterparty would lose the right to terminate if it failed to use this right within a defined timeframe after receipt of a NAV report evidencing a relevant decline in the fund 's NAV ( a so-called ' use it or lose it ' proviso ) . <p> Change of investment manager <p> If the investment adviser ceases to be an investment adviser to the fund , goes bankrupt or merges or consolidates with another entity , the counterparty will usually demand the right to terminate the Isda master agreement . Similar safeguards may be requested in connection with certain named key individuals should their association with the fund be terminated or cease for any reason or should they be charged with a criminal office . <p> In the context of a PIF or QIF , the dealer would usually request the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fund were altered in a material way . <p> In addition , the dealer would usually request the right to terminate if it became impossible or impracticable for the fund to deliver its NAV reports when due . Similarly , the dealer may have agreed a certain level of transparency through to the fund 's underlying investments and any failure to provide such information would usually give the dealer the right to terminate , subject to certain conditions . <p> Finally , the dealer would usually request the right to terminate if the fund breached specified investment guidelines agreed with the fund in relation to strategy , leverage and diversification . <p> Regulatory action <p> The dealer would usually request the right to terminate if any regulatory approval or licence was withdrawn in respect of the fund or its investment manager or any investigation relating to alleged misconduct was initiated and not dismissed within a specified period . <h> Financial regulator requirements <p> The Ucits notices , the non-Ucits notices and the related guidance notes issued by the financial regulator set out certain requirements that affect the negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements include the following : <p> Counterparty eligibility <p> A counterparty to a Ucits must be either : ( a ) a credit institution authorised ( i ) in the EEA ; ( ii ) within a signatory state ( other than an EEA Member State ) to the Basle Capital Convergence Agreement of July 1998 ; or ( iii ) in Jersey , Guernsey , the Isle of Man , Australia or New Zealand or ( b ) an authorised investment firm , authorised in accordance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in an EEA Member State , or an entity subject to regulation as a Consolidated Supervised Entity by the US Securities and Exchange Commission . If the counterparty is not a credit institution it must have a short term S&amp;P rating of at least A2 or be guaranteed by an entity with at least that rating . <p> The counterparty to a QIF or a PIF must have a short term S&amp;P rating of at least A2 or a short term Moody 's rating of at least P2 or be guaranteed by an entity with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isda Schedule a representation from the fund 's counterparty that it meets the applicable criteria . <p> Right to terminate <p> Ucits and PIFs must have the ability to close out transactions at any time at fair value , described as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable , willing parties in an arm 's length transaction . Accordingly , all transactions between the parties should be subject to an appropriately drafted optional termination provision . <p> Mark-to-market valuation of transactions <p> Ucits and PIFs must obtain agreement from their respective counterparties to provide mark-to-market valuations of transactions on request . <h> Dealing with hedged share classes <p> In the financial regulator 's Policy Update 1/2010 of February 2010 entitled Multiple share classes within a single collective investment scheme , it was confirmed that Irish funds may establish separate share classes . Although a fund would consist of a common pool of assets , the participation of each share class in that pool of assets would vary depending on the performance of the share class . Funds establish distinctive share classes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies , or to allow for interest rate or currency hedging in respect of certain share classes only . For hedged share classes , the costs or the benefits of hedging must be allocated respectively to the specific share classes only , not to the fund 's pool of assets . <p> Naturally , it would be necessary for a fund 's constitutional documents to make specific provision for the creation of separate share classes . The constitutional documents should also allow for the use of derivatives and should include clear provisions allocating the benefits or costs of hedging to each relevant share class . <p> Further to the general principle that a fund is not allowed to subordinate the rights of certain unit holders to those of other unit holders , the creation of share classes within a single fund is subject to the conditions that the use of derivatives at share class level : <p> ( a ) creates positive benefits for investors ; and <p> ( b ) does not prejudice the interests of holders in other share classes . <p> The creation of separate share classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with a dealer in respect of the fund 's common pool of assets for its general investment purposes ( the General Isda ) , as well as separate Isda master agreements in respect of each hedged share class ( a Share Class Isda ) . A General Isda and any number of Share Class Isdas are often recorded in a single document , which by contractual agreement are deemed to form separate agreements in respect of the General Isda and each Share Class Isda , respectively . <p> In an umbrella fund structure , the General Isda should form limited recourse obligations for each of its sub-funds , and if the umbrella fund is established as a company in Ireland , it will benefit from statutory protection for such limited recourse provisions pursuant to Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990 , as amended by the Investment Funds , Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 . <p> To limit the effect of any derivative transactions to a single share class , it is necessary to include carefully considered limited recourse provisions between the General Isda and each Share Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the separate agreements for each share class and the General Isda , and the respective Share Class Isdas between themselves . The financial regulator requires a legal opinion in respect of the efficacy of the limited recourse provisions in respect of separate share classes . <p> It should also be noted in the context of a Share Class Isda , that it would not be permitted to provide collateral under an Isda Credit Support Annex or similar agreement . If collateral were provided in respect of a Share Class Isda , the other share classes would be at risk in the event of counterparty default . Should the hedge counterparty default , or should the derivatives transactions experience severe negative volatility , the participation of a hedged share class of a fund may be reduced to a level below that of the amount of collateral provided by the common pool on its behalf . This would have the unintended and prohibited consequence that the affected share class would in effect have borrowed from the other share classes without being able to repay its debts and would have prejudiced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling counterparty risk would be to permit frequent re-setting of out-the-money derivatives trades from the perspective of the share class , with mark-to-market payments to the relevant dealer . This would be an imperfect solution but would mitigate an otherwise uncollateralised position . <h> New custody arrangements <p> Further to any netting and set-off rights that parties may have , the key method of mitigating counterparty credit risk in the derivative markets is collateralisation of trades . For cleared trades , **25;322;TOOLONG and OTC trades , parties may be required to provide an upfront initial margin to a clearing house , clearing member , exchange or its OTC counterparty , followed by variation margin on an ongoing basis , the latter reflecting the aggregate mark-to-market value of the trades between the parties . For the purposes of the Isda credit support documentation , initial margin is referred to as ' Independent Amounts ' . Initial margin acts as an additional buffer for parties to address expected volatility in market prices , and when considered together with variation margin , means that a fund may be providing collateral in excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in time . <p> It follows that such excess collateral leaves the fund at risk of a dealer default , as was the case for many funds when Lehman Brothers collapsed . Excess collateral , like any deposit , will typically form part of a bankrupt 's estate and funds may be in the position of a general creditor when seeking the return of initial margin . In other words , excess collateral re-introduces counterparty credit risk between the parties . It has also been argued that Independent Amounts create systemic risk as funds and other clients of a bank , fearing a dealer default , may take pre-emptive action to recover Independent Amounts posted to a dealer , possibly resulting in a ' run on the bank ' . <p> To avoid the risks of over-collateralisation , and to save on unnecessary use of counterparty credit limits ( applicable to Ucits ) , a fund may require that the Independent Amounts it posts be held by an independent third party , with security interests created in favour of the dealer . Through such an arrangement , collateral is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer default , the collateral is returned to the fund . <p> The practice has developed where the fund creates a segregated account ( the IA Account ) with its custodian . It then posts Independent Amounts to this account and creates security interests over the IA Account in favour of the dealer . For the security interest to rank as a fixed charge , the dealer needs to establish control over the IA Account , typically through a separate agreement entered into between the parties . The documentation structure typically consists of : <p> For Isda Master Agreements governed by English law , a bespoke Credit Support Deed ( an English Law CSD ) for Independent Amounts , a bespoke Credit Support Annex ( an English Law CSA ) for mark-to-market collateral , a Control Agreement , and the custody agreement between the fund and its custodian ( the Custody Agreement ) . <p> For Isda Master Agreements governed by New York law , a Credit Support Annex ( a New York Law CSA ) that provides for Independent Amounts to be provided by the fund to its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided to the dealer 's custodian on the other hand , a Control Agreement , and the Custody Agreement . <p> Alternatively , parties can agree to exclude Independent Amounts from the Isda credit support documentation that they enter into , and enter into a separate agreement ( the Charged Agreement ) , typically in the local law of the fund and its custodian , that provides for the establishment of the IA Account , the posting of Independent Amounts and the control aspects in favour of the dealer required for the perfection of the dealer 's security interests in the IA Account . A Charged Agreement approach is typically accompanied by either a New York Law CSA or an English Law CSA to address mark-to-market collateral . <p> In each case , the fund receives mark-to-market collateral from the dealer in the usual manner , but provides two types of collateral to the dealer , being Independent Amounts and mark-to-market collateral separately . <p> Where an English Law CSD and an English Law CSA are entered into , the two types of collateral are easily dealt with in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English Law CSD as zero and excluding Independent Amounts from the calculation of " Credit Support Amount " . This dual CSA/CSD approach raises some questions regarding the applicability of the European Communities ( Financial Collateral Arrangements ) Regulations 2004 , which provides protection to the validity of financial collateral arrangements , but in a carefully structured transaction this approach should not weaken the robustness of the collateral arrangement from an Irish law perspective . <p> The New York Law CSA requires substantial redrafting to make provision for the calculation and posting of the two types of collateral , and the distinctive manner in which each is posted . <p> Where a Charged Agreement is contemplated , amendments to the Isda credit support documentation that the parties enter into , in addition to the Charged Agreement , would similarly be required . <p> It is important to consider all relevant jurisdictions in order to confirm the enforceability of the relevant security interests . From an Irish law perspective , it is important to confirm that all applicable steps to perfect the security interest have been identified and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IA Account is sufficient to support the classification of the security interest as a first fixed charge . A similar exercise should be conducted in respect of all relevant jurisdictions . <h> Ongoing commitment <p> The financial regulator 's ongoing commitment to the prudent regulation of the use of derivatives by investment funds and its willingness to address industry concerns in a constructive manner , suggest that Ireland is likely to remain at the forefront of the regulated funds industry . <p> The regulations applicable to Irish funds as well as the use of sub-funds and hedged share classes , mean that particular attention should be paid to the negotiation of Isda Schedules and Isda credit support documentation when one of the parties is an Irish fund . <p> Finally , as the market continues to evolve following the events of the past few years the importance of reducing counterparty credit risk in derivative trading , including risks associated with providing initial margin as considered above , will remain a key concern for market participants . <p> Author biography <p> Christian Donagh Matheson Ormsby Prentice <p> Christian Donagh is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and head of the firm ? s derivatives practice .

@@8538241 @1738241/ <h> Switzerland 's attractive structures <h> Author : Published : 15 Jul 2015 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> Luc Defferrard and David Hadad of Walder Wyss look at a pragmatic new framework for the distribution of funds , which opens up the market to foreign fund providers <p> Switzerland 's revised law on the distribution of funds has now become a well-known and documented matter . The new framework leaves the Swiss qualified investors ' market accessible to all types of alternative investment funds and is therefore a natural fit for private equity funds . <p> As these rules are relatively new and have been enacted with guidance on only specific topics from the Swiss regulator , Finma , important questions regarding the new fund distribution rules remain among Swiss representatives of private equity funds , foreign fund providers and their legal counsels . The principal issues relate to the timing and duration of appointments of Swiss representatives and paying agents , appropriate supervision requirements of foreign placement agents and fund document requirements . <h> New fund distribution rules <p> Most private equity fund managers are well aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified investors . Since March 1 2015 , the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes ( Cisa ) requires alternative investment funds that are distributed to Swiss qualified investors to appoint a Swiss representative and a Swiss paying agent . In addition , any placement agent of a private equity fund active in Switzerland ( or the fund manager itself should no third party placement agent be appointed ) must be subject to appropriate supervision in its country of domicile and should enter into a distribution agreement with the Swiss representative . <p> Private equity funds and their managers are only exempt from having to comply with these new regulatory requirements in two situations . First , if they solely market funds ' units to certain exempt qualified investors in Switzerland ( regulated financial intermediaries such as banks , broker dealers , fund managers and asset managers of investment funds , or regulated insurance companies ) ; second , if they sell their funds ' units to investors that have approached the fund on their own initiative without prior solicitation of the fund manager ( reverse solicitation ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , prior to marketing a private equity foreign fund in Switzerland , the fund manager must appoint a Swiss representative and a Swiss paying agent . In practice , it is difficult to determine whether marketing activities prior to the finalisation of the fund structure are already deemed to be distribution of a fund , as the fund is not yet established . This leads to a conundrum for private equity funds , which are often marketed prior to launching the fund , on the basis of teaser documents and generally before the PPM ( private placement memorandum ) is finalised . <p> The Swiss Funds &amp; Asset Management Association ( SFAMA ) is of the view that once the investment policy , the fee structure and the fund manager have been determined , the tipping point will already have passed . According to this interpretation , the sending of teaser documents or pathfinder PPMs could already constitute fund distribution and would trigger the requirement to appoint a Swiss representative and a Swiss paying agent . On the other hand , abstract discussions with potential future investors not related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trigger this requirement and in this sense , market testing appears to be possible without having to make any appointment . <p> The process for appointing a Swiss representative and paying agent starts with choosing the private equity fund 's Swiss representative . The Swiss representative of foreign funds should be an entity licensed by Finma to exercise such activities . There are a handful of providers that offer the Swiss representative services , with prices usually ranging between SFr10,000 ( $10,600 ) to SFr15,900 per fund per year . The fund manager will then start on-boarding procedures with the Swiss representative chosen and complete an on-boarding questionnaire . Once the on-boarding process has been completed , the private equity fund and the Swiss representative will negotiate the representation agreement under which the Swiss representative is appointed . In addition , the private equity fund , the placement agent of the fund and the Swiss representative will negotiate the distribution agreement . <p> The appointment of the Swiss paying agent usually comes next . The private equity fund manager may choose between one of several banks which usually already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fees of the Swiss paying agents range between SFr1,060 to SFr5,300 per fund per year . For the Swiss paying agent , a short on-boarding process must be completed , followed by negotiations on the paying agency agreement . <p> The process for appointment of both the Swiss representative and the Swiss paying agent usually takes around three weeks depending on the representative chosen and the fund manager 's appetite to negotiate the agreements . If time is of the essence , it is possible to complete the appointments in a shorter period . <p> Under the law , if applied literally , the Swiss representative and the Swiss paying agent must remain appointed for the whole marketing period . Once this period is over and any distribution activities in relation to the private equity fund in Switzerland have definitely been stopped , the mandates of the Swiss representative and paying agent will , despite the text of the law , remain in force and may be terminated , for private equity funds ( as a rule , closed-end funds ) only in the following cases . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity fund has been made by a qualified investor domiciled in Switzerland ; or , second , where early redemption is not possible ( which is normally the case for private equity funds ) or only with a special fee or penalty applying , once the last qualified investor domiciled in Switzerland has transferred its interests or the private equity fund is liquidated . <p> The revised Cisa and its new marketing rules came into effect on March 1 2013 , but provided for a transitional period of two years until February 29 2015 for the appointment of a Swiss representative and Swiss paying agent . As a result , private equity funds that were marketed in Switzerland to qualified investors during this transitional period were exempt from having to appoint a Swiss representative and a Swiss paying agent . <p> On March 1 2015 , this transitional period lapsed and all private equity funds must now fully comply with the new law . This means that private equity funds that have been marketed in Switzerland under these transitional arrangements ( but have been closed before March 1 2015 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified investors domiciled in Switzerland have subscribed units or interests in the private equity fund . If no subscription of units or interests in the private equity fund has been made by a qualified investor domiciled in Switzerland , no appointment has to be made . Likewise , any private equity fund that has been closed prior to the revised Cisa coming into effect on March 1 2013 , is exempt from compliance with the new law . <h> Requirements on fund documents <p> Once the appointment of a Swiss representative and paying agent has been made , the name and address of the Swiss representative and the Swiss paying agent , the fund 's country of domicile and the applicable jurisdiction between the private equity fund and its investors has to be included in all relevant fund documents , based on Swiss mandatory wording . For alternative investment funds , such as private equity funds , this term is generally understood to include the PPM , the subscription agreement and the financial statements . <p> Many Swiss representatives still insist that the Swiss mandatory wording also mentions a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swiss representative and so creates a forum for Swiss investors in Switzerland . However , Cisa does not require the place of jurisdiction to be in Switzerland and the fund manager is free to agree with Swiss investors on any other place of jurisdiction . <p> Swiss representatives are also of the opinion that foreign fund managers need to comply with the Guidelines on Duties Regarding the Charging and Use of Fees and Costs ( Transparency Guidelines ) issued by SFAMA . The Transparency Guidelines have been recognised by Finma as a minimum standard . The Transparency Guidelines require funds to disclose all charges and fees incurred directly or indirectly by the investors and their appropriation in the PPM in general or as part of the Swiss mandatory wording . In addition , SFAMA has in its Transparency Guidelines extended the applicability of these guidelines to foreign placement agents and foreign fund managers . In our view , the Transparency Guidelines are more extensive than what is required by the law and as such , should not be viewed as mandatory by foreign placement agents and foreign fund managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking in the distribution agreement . In general , it is of course advisable to specify all applicable charges and fees in one single document ( the PPM ) in order to avoid contradictions and different interpretations based on different governing laws . <h> Requirements on foreign placement agents <p> A foreign placement agent may only place foreign private equity funds to qualified investors in Switzerland if it is subject to appropriate supervision and admitted for fund distribution in its country of domicile . In addition , the foreign placement agent must enter into a written distribution agreement with the Swiss representative of the fund manager . However , the requirements on appropriate supervision or admission for fund distribution are not specified in detail . Any fund manager subject to the AIFMD ( Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive ) would meet the requirements . We are also of the view that any SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) registered investment adviser is deemed to be appropriately supervised , as the Cisa does not request an explicit authorisation to distribute funds from the foreign placement agent 's home regulator ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Finma . <p> The distributor must enter into a distribution agreement with the Swiss representative . The distribution agreement is usually a tripartite agreement between the private equity fund manager , the placement agent ( distributor ) and the Swiss representative . The fund manager acts as principal of the distributor and the distributor is approved by the Swiss representative for purposes of distribution in Switzerland . We recommend that the Swiss distribution agreement is aligned with the global distribution agreement in place between the fund manager and the placement agent or any other distributor . In the event the private equity fund manager acts itself as distributor for its own funds , the distribution agreement may be consolidated with the representative agreement to avoid contradicting provisions . The distribution agreement has to be governed by Swiss law . <h> Duties of the Swiss representative <p> The Swiss representative represents the private equity fund with regard to Swiss investors and therefore serves as a point of contact for enquiries and claims by Swiss investors . In this sense , the Swiss representative must ensure that qualified investors may obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are confidential , the Swiss representative should make them available to existing investors only or potential investors approved by the private equity fund manager . <p> Some Swiss representatives also require extensive involvement in fund distribution activity . Swiss law , however , only requests the Swiss representatives to : ( i ) ensure that a written paying agent agreement is entered into ; ( ii ) have any distributor for Switzerland sign a written distribution agreement compliant with the Swiss distribution rules ( including the Provisions for Distributors by SFAMA ) ; ( iii ) ensure that the fund documents contain the Swiss mandatory disclosures ; and ( iv ) make the fund documents available to Swiss investors upon request . Where violations of the law become known to the Swiss representative , it has also to take appropriate measures . In our view , the Swiss representative has no further mandatory duties and in particular , it is not required to attend any investment presentation or be involved in any communication between the private equity fund manager and the Swiss investors . <p> The Cisa requires that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulator Finma and that such power of representation should not be restricted . In our view , despite unrestricted power of representation , the Swiss representative 's contractual obligations demand that it first consults with and obtains instructions from the private equity fund manager before making any legally relevant statements on the private equity fund 's behalf . In addition , the fund must have the unrestricted right to choose to be represented by an independent attorney in any proceedings with Swiss authorities if it feels that its rights and interests can not be sufficiently preserved by the Swiss representative . <h> Duties of the Swiss paying agent <p> Only banks under the Swiss banking act and supervised by the Swiss regulator Finma may act as Swiss paying agent . Swiss investors may request the issuance and redemption of the fund interests at the office of the paying agent . Therefore , the Swiss paying agent would theoretically have to execute all transactions involving Swiss investors . However , for the latter , using the Swiss paying agent is only an additional option , requiring extra transaction fees . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time , processed by the foreign bank or the custodian of the private equity fund manager directly . In practice , Swiss paying agents are only rarely used for investments and disinvestments of private equity funds , since such funds are most of the time closed-end funds and their units can not be redeemed . Most paying agents do not even request that the private equity fund managers open an account with them . <p> One can therefore question the need to name a Swiss paying agent if a foreign fund is only distributed to qualified investors and is a closed-end fund without redemption rights . In our view , the appointment of a Swiss paying agent does not result in a practical protection or easement for Swiss investors . Nevertheless , for the time being , such duty is mentioned in the law and will therefore be respected . <h> Representatives smooth the way <p> The new regulatory framework created by Swiss lawmakers keeps the Swiss qualified investors ' market accessible to private equity funds . This is achieved through the use of a Swiss representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss marketing rules towards foreign fund providers .

However , the provision of funds to private equity , especially from foreign investors , is still quite small , and this has been acknowledged to be due partly to the Japanese tax system 's treatment of foreign investors . <p> In the spring of 2009 , important tax reforms were made in Japan to promote investment from foreign investors through private equity funds . Specific reforms included are the introduction of the permanent establishment exemption and the exception from the 25/5 Rule ( the 25/5 Rule exception ) for certain limited partners ( LPs ) . This article outlines the requirements for such exemption and exception and covers certain issues to be noted when applying the rules . <h> Permanent establishment exemption <p> A foreign investor is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor invests in shares of a Japanese corporation through a partnership whose general partner ( GP ) has an office or other place of business in Japan ( see Exhibit 1 ) . By entering into the partnership agreement , the foreign investor participates in a joint enterprise with other partners and is deemed to have a place of business in Japan even if it is a LP . Once deemed to have a permanent establishment in Japan , such investor will be subject to Japanese income tax on dividends and capital gains from Japanese shares as well as a 20% withholding tax for any partnership distributions . <p> Under the 2009 tax reform , which became effective on April 1 2009 , any investor that is either a foreign legal entity or a non-resident individual is deemed not to have a permanent establishment in Japan if that investor meets all of the following requirements : <p> the investor is a LP of ( a ) a limited partnership ( an investment LPS ) established under the Japanese Limited Partnership Act for Investment ( the Japanese LPS Act ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LPS ( a foreign similar partnership and , together with an investment LPS , an investment partnership ) ; <p> the investor does not engage in any conduct stipulated by a relevant cabinet order as conduct constituting ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership ; <p> the investor 's equity interest in the assets of the investment partnership is less than 25% ; <p> the investor does not have a special relationship with the GP of the investment partnership ; and <p> apart from the business of the investment partnership , the investor does not have a permanent establishment in Japan . <h> The first requirement : LP of investment partnership <p> The law requires that the investor must be an LP of either an investment LPS or a foreign similar partnership . The issue is what constitutes a foreign similar partnership for Japanese tax purposes . Currently , no regulations or administrative guidelines have been provided with regard to this issue . To be considered a foreign similar partnership , it is expected that the entity should be classified as a partnership and not as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability company established under the laws of the State of New York was recognised as a corporation for Japanese tax purposes . On the other hand , a limited partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands has been recognised as a partnership .

The cabinet order lists the following conducts as constituting ' Management of the Business ' of an investment partnership : <p> the management of the business pursuant to the investment partnership agreement ; <p> making decisions regarding the management of the business of the investment partnership ; or <p> approval , consent or any similar conduct as to the management or the decisions of the management of the business of the investment partnership . <p> Under the Japanese LPS Act , a GP shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LPs shall not participate in the management or decision making process of the partnership . However , there are some investment partnership agreements that require the approval or consent of the LPs or advisory committees consisting of principal LPs with regard to certain issues , such as transactions involving a GP 's conflict of interest or the distribution of security assets . Whether or not such conduct by LPs is deemed to constitute ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership is a crucial issue , and the private equity industry has requested guidelines thereon . <h> Meti guidelines <p> In response to these requests , the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ( Meti ) has provided certain guidelines regarding what conduct constitutes the ' Management of the Business ' of an investment partnership . Meti 's guidelines divided LP conduct ( as well as the conduct of any advisory committee made up of LPs ) into the following three categories : <p> 1 . Conduct irrelevant to the management of the business <p> Exercise of the following rights , to which LPs are entitled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership : <p> rights relating to the investment partnership 's fundamentals ( such as rights to change the partnership agreement , rights to dissolve the partnership and rights to elect or remove GPs ) ; <p> rights to inspect the financial statements , state of business and assets of the partnership ; and <p> rights to request the distribution of assets and redemption of equity interests . <p> 2 . Conduct constituting management of the business itself <p> Negotiation with portfolio companies , making decisions regarding which companies the investment partnership should invest in and selecting companies to which the partnership should sell its assets are considered the management of the business itself and thus constitute ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership . <p> 3 . Conduct not of the management of the business itself , but relevant to the management of the business <p> The following conduct is not the management of the business itself but is relevant to such management . Meti has provided guidance for the following LP conducts : <p> a ) LP approvals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GP 's power to manage the business under the partnership agreement ( e.g. LP approval of an investment decision that is within the investment guideline limitations ) <p> Such approvals are considered approvals of the management of the business and thus constitute ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership . <p> b ) LP approvals for investment decisions that are outside the scope of the GP 's power to manage the business under the partnership agreement ( e.g. LP approval of an investment decision that exceeds the investment guideline limitations ) <p> Such approvals are also considered approvals of the management of the business , and thus constitute ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership . <p> c ) LP approvals for transactions that constitute a conflict of interest for the GP <p> According to the guidelines , approvals of transactions that create a conflict of interest for the GP ( GP conflict transactions ) constitute the management of business , provided such transaction was entered into in order to achieve the business purpose of the partnership . If the GP conflict transaction itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval for the GP conflict transaction is considered to be an approval of the management of the business and will therefore also constitute ' Management of the Business ' of the investment partnership . Certain activities related to GP conflict transactions , however , are distinguished in Meti 's guidelines . For instance , the LP 's mere receipt of explanation or report regarding GP conflict transactions , LP 's advice to the GP or LP 's mere objection to a GP conflict transaction ( excluding those objections that , in substance are the same as approvals ) are not considered to be approvals of the management of the business . On the other hand , GP conflict transactions that the GP enters into on its own behalf and not on behalf of the investment partnership , such as the GP accepting a position as GP of another investment partnership , or making a loan to a portfolio company on its own behalf and account , do not constitute the management of business , and LP approvals for such GP conflict transactions are not considered to be approvals of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the scope of GP 's power to manage the business ( e.g. change of limitation of the amount to invest or limitation of types of asset in which to invest ) <p> Such approvals are not considered to be approvals of the management of the business because the subject of such approvals is not the GP 's management of the business itself , but rather the scope of GP 's power to manage the business . However , if such changes are made so frequently that such approvals are , in substance , approvals of the GP 's management of the business , they will be considered approvals of the management of the business . <p> e ) LP investment advice to the GP <p> Such advice is not considered to constitute approval of the management of the business , provided such advice is not binding on the GP . <h> Special rule for multi-tiered funds <p> The cabinet order sets out certain rules that only apply to foreign investors in multi-tiered funds when determining whether such investor engages in ' Management of the Business ' of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an LP of a limited partnership ( the feeder fund ) , and the feeder fund invests directly or indirectly ( i.e. through feeder fund 1 to feeder fund n ( collectively , feeder fund N ) ) into another limited partnership ( master fund ) investing in Japanese shares ( see Exhibit 2 ) . If any partner of either feeder fund or feeder fund N engages in the management of its partnership that constitutes ' Management of the Business ' of the master fund , then Investor A is also deemed to have engaged in ' Management of the Business ' of the master fund . <h> The third requirement : Equity interest proportion should be less than 25% <p> The investor 's proportion of equity interest ( Equity interest proportion ) is determined by using the greater of either ( a ) the proportion of the investor 's equity interest in the partnership 's assets or ( b ) the proportion of the investor 's ownership of the partnership 's profits and losses . <h> Special relationship <p> When calculating an investor 's equity interest proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shares held by any person who has special relationship with that investor are deemed part of the investor 's equity interest proportion .

When multi-tiered funds are structured as outlined in Exhibit 2 , in order to calculate the equity interest proportion of Investor A in the master fund , the equity interest proportion of all the partners ( other than Investor A ) who hold an equity interest in the master fund through the feeder fund or feeder fund N are included .

In the case of multi-tiered funds , as in Exhibit 2 , partnership agreements of all funds involved ( i.e. master fund , feeder fund N ( if any ) , and feeder fund ) must be attached . <p> The law requires that the applicant should report all Japanese source income that would be included in computation of the applicant 's taxable income but for the permanent establishment exemption to the relevant tax authority by March 15 ( for a non-resident individual ) or by the final tax return filing due date ( for a foreign legal entity ) of the year subsequent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital gain realised by a foreign investor without a permanent establishment in Japan from the sale of Japanese shares is not generally subject to income tax , except when the 25/5 Rule applies .

Although some tax treaties exempt capital gains tax even where the 25/5 Rule applies , this issue still applies to investors whose domicile county has not entered into a tax treaty with Japan . <p> Under the 2009 tax reform , an exception was made to 25/5 Rule , stating that , provided certain requirements are satisfied , a foreign investor may ignore the amount of shares owned by other partners for purposes of determining whether the 25% threshold has been met . For example , in the case illustrated by Exhibit 3 , if the LP satisfy the 25/5 Rule exception , then each LP will be deemed to hold 20% ( i.e. not exceed the 25% threshold ) because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify for the 25/5 Rule exception , the sale of Japanese shares must be made by a foreign investor ( i ) who qualifies for the permanent establishment exemption as outlined above or ( ii ) who has been a LP of an investment partnership and ( a ) has not engaged in the ' Management of the Business ' of such partnership during the last three years in which the LP was a partner of the investment partnership before the last day of the fiscal year in which the sale took place and ( b ) whose special related shareholders ( excluding the other partners of the partnership ) have not held 25% or more of the shares of such Japanese corporation during any time within three years before the last day of the fiscal year in which the sale took place . As the rule requires the investor to invest through an investment partnership , the interpretation of a foreign partnership similar to an investment LPS as discussed above with regard to the permanent establishment exemption also applies to the 25/5 Rule exception . <p> The 25/5 Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shares for less than one year before the sale or if shares to be sold are shares of certain distressed financial institutions . The holding period for the shares is determined on a first-in-first-out basis . <p> To qualify for the 25/5 Rule exception , a foreign investor must submit an application form to the relevant tax authority by March 15 ( for a non-resident individual ) or by the final tax return filing deadline ( for a foreign legal entity ) of the year subsequent to the year the sale took place . <h> Outlook <p> Although issues remain , it seems that the recent tax reform has set the framework to encourage foreign funds to invest in Japanese private equity . Hopefully subsequent administrative guidelines or judicial decisions will resolve remaining issues and that will lead to the clear and consistent application of these new rules . I sincerely hope that these reforms will encourage foreign investors to invest in the Japanese private equity market . <p> About the author <p> Sanae Miyamoto is an attorney with Mori Hamada &amp; Matsumoto .

This contains the basic legal rules regulating companies in Indonesia relating to capital and shares , directors and management , meetings and resolutions . The Company Law provides a framework in which various specific rules and regulations and laws in other areas apply to carrying out M&amp;A transactions . <p> Regulation of mergers and acquisitions <p> Government Regulation 27 of 1998 ( GR 27 ) and the Company Law regulate the conduct of mergers ( together with the related but less common concept of consolidation ) and acquisitions . <p> Acquisition is defined in GR 27 as " a legal action taken by a legal entity/individual for the acquisition of part or the whole of the shares which may result in the change of control of the relevant company " . A party conducting a share acquisition governed by GR 27 would be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most acquisitions of shares that are not takeovers of public companies are simply done by arrangement between the contracting parties . GR 27 ( and the Company Law ) permits this as it is not considered to apply to share acquisitions conducted directly between the shareholders without the target company being actively involved . <p> A merger , under the Company Law and GR 27 , is a process by which two companies become one , the assets ( and liabilities ) of the dissolved company being transferred to the surviving company . As GR 27 puts it , merger is a " legal act conducted by one or more companies to merge itself/themselves with another existing company , and further , the absorbed company(ies) is dissolved " . There is also a similar ( if less used ) process called consolidation under the Company Law and GR 27 by which two or more companies come together to create an entirely new company . <p> Mergers are a common way to effect corporate transactions in Indonesia ( they might offer tax advantages but this needs to be considered carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carrying out a merger it is required to take into account the interests of the company , its minority shareholders and employees . Minority shareholders are expressly given the ability to sell their shares to the company at a fair/reasonable price if they do not agree with the merger . The merger must also take account of the interests of creditors . The procedure under GR 27 requires that companies notify their creditors before notices for the shareholder meetings are sent . A creditor can object and a solution must then be found at the general meeting of shareholders held to approve the merger . The merger can not proceed until a solution to the creditor 's objection is found . <p> Foreign ownership rules for private companies <p> Foreign investment is subject to regulation by the Capital Investment Coordinating Board ( the BKPM ) . This applies only to private companies but in such cases can impact on the structure , timing and practicalities of M&amp;A transactions . The acquisition of shares in public companies is overseen by Bapepam ( see below ) and is generally viewed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . <p> Foreign direct shareholdings in unlisted Indonesian companies ( other than financial sector companies ) are only permitted in a special type of Indonesian company , called a penanaman modal asing ( PMA ) company , and must have the BKPM 's approval . In some sectors , a recommendation from the relevant technical department or government agency that oversees that sector might also be required for investment in a PMA company . If a company to be acquired by a foreign investor was not previously a PMA company , it will need to be converted as part of the transaction . <p> Most business sectors in Indonesia are now unrestricted for direct foreign investment . There is , however , a negative list of areas in which foreign shareholdings in unlisted Indonesian companies are closed or the maximum level of foreign ownership restricted . <p> Outside the negative list , although a foreign investor may own 100% of shares of a PMA , there will be a requirement to divest a small percentage of shares ( typically around 5% ) to Indonesian shareholders within 15 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be other more practical reasons for involving an Indonesian partner . <p> Foreign ownership of listed public companies is not restricted in general . Certain specific restrictions do , however , apply under legislation in particular sectors , such as banking and broadcasting . <p> Public companies and tender offers/takeovers <p> In addition to the Company Law , the Capital Markets Supervisory Agency ( Bapepam ) regulates many matters affecting public companies , regardless of whether the shares are listed . As in other jurisdictions , however , the two factors more often than not coincide . The principal law relating to capital markets is Law 8 of 1995 Concerning Capital Markets ( the Capital Markets Law ) . Various regulations and Bapepam rules are in place under the Capital Markets Law . <p> Several Bapepam regulations concern the making of tender offers , that is , general offers to the holders of shares in public companies . These regulations set out the principles to be applied , the procedures to be followed and the timetable . <p> Under Bapepam rules , a party that directly or indirectly acquires more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to make a tender offer for any remaining shares in public hands . <p> The tender offer rules in Indonesia are less stress-tested than , say , the equivalent rules in the UK , as hostile or contested takeovers are uncommon . In most public companies in Indonesia there is a significant controlling stake in the hands of one shareholder or a group of related shareholders . Most public company acquisitions start life as negotiated deals for those controlling stakes . <p> M&amp;A transactions involving public companies as buyer or seller may bring several other Bapepam rules into play . Most commonly , rules on material transactions and conflict of interest transactions might require approval by shareholders or , in the latter case , independent shareholders before they can proceed . <p> Due diligence <p> It is common and advisable in Indonesian M&amp;A transactions for potential purchasers to undertake pre-acquisition due diligence on the Indonesian target company . This is strongly recommended because it is difficult to obtain public information regarding Indonesian companies , particularly private companies . It is not possible to conduct a company search of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Companies is often incomplete . In practice , conducting legal searches of courts , arbitration bodies , manpower dispute committees and land title offices requires the cooperation of the company under review . <p> Management and corporate governance <p> There are three corporate organs in Indonesian companies - the shareholders in general meeting , the board of directors and the board of commissioners . <p> The executive management of the company generally falls to the directors acting in the best interests of the company . All the directors are responsible , but the president director has , as a matter of law , broad executive powers to act for the company subject to the company 's articles of association and the Company Law . <p> The commissioners supervise the directors and , not uncommonly , the articles of association will stipulate certain important matters needing commissioners ' approval ( such as borrowing funds or creating encumbrances over assets ) . <p> The shareholders are the ultimate controlling body in the company and exercise all powers not delegated to the directors or commissioners . <p> Management control after M&amp;A transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association that a particular class of shareholders ( for example , foreign shareholders ) has the right to nominate a majority of the directors ( and/or the commissioners , including specifically the president director and/or the president commissioner ) . This would enable those shareholders to be assured of some indirect control over decisions by the company . Removing this right would involve amendment to the articles of association , which requires approval by holders of two-thirds of the company 's shares . <p> Protection of minority shareholders <p> Mandatory protections <p> The Company Law provides certain protections for minority shareholders . It is not permitted to contract out of these protections . They include : <p> right to bring an action against the company for losses suffered through acts that are inequitable , unreasonable or unfair ; <p> right to request the company to buy back the minority shareholder 's shares at a reasonable price if it disapproves of certain actions of the company that have caused loss to the shareholder or to the company ; <p> minority shareholders controlling no less than 10% of the shares may sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of any misconduct/negligence by the director or commissioner ; <p> shareholder approval of at least three-quarters of the voting shares is needed if the company wishes to transfer or pledge all or a substantial part of the company 's assets ; <p> minority shareholders controlling not less than 10% of the voting shares may submit a petition to the Court to dissolve the company ; and <p> shareholder approval of at least two-thirds of voting shares is needed for amendment of the articles of association . <p> Protection by agreement <p> Other protections for minority shareholders may be agreed between the shareholders and in some cases can be included in the articles of association ( Ministry of Law and Human Rights approval might be needed ) . In other cases , agreed minority protections would be contained in a shareholders agreement . Often a combination of these approaches is adopted . <p> In the usual way , these protections can , for example : <p> set quorum requirements for meetings of shareholders , directors or commissioners requiring the participation of a minority shareholder or its nominee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular shareholder , before the company takes certain actions . <p> General tax issues <p> In general , Indonesian withholding tax is payable on the transfer of shares by a foreign shareholder in an unlisted Indonesian company . The tax works out to be , effectively , 5% of the gross proceeds on the sale . If the purchaser were also a foreign entity , the local company would be obliged to collect the tax before the transfer can be registered . <p> This tax obligation might , in many cases , be rendered inapplicable by a double tax treaty in force between Indonesia and the tax domicile of the selling shareholder . <p> A final transaction tax of 0.01% of sale value is applicable to on-market transfers of listed shares . The rate is higher on the transfer of founder shares . <p> Indonesia does not impose ad valorem stamp duty on transfers of shares . A nominal Rp6,000 ( less than $1 ) stamp duty must , however , be affixed and cancelled by signature on most legal documents . <p> Employee rights on change of ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions relates to the rights of employees . The increased influence of labour unions in this context should be taken into account . <p> Indonesian employment laws regarding termination and severance payments are complex and require careful consideration in the circumstances of each particular transaction . As relevant to share acquisitions , if there is a change of ownership in a company , each employee is entitled to elect whether or not they wish to continue employment with the company under the new owner . If the employee decides not to continue with the employment , the company must provide a severance package in an amount not less than the statutory prescribed package . If the employee decides to stay , then legally they are not entitled to the severance package . <p> Different views are encountered in practice about the scope of application of these provisions . Legislation and attitudes in Indonesia are more pro-employee than might be expected and care needs to be taken if a foreign party is acquiring on Indonesian business . Regardless of the letter of the law , a well-organized or unionized labour force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition that can , on occasion , become problematic if not well managed . <p> If , upon a change of ownership , the employer decides to terminate employees , a larger prescribed severance package is payable . <p> Under the Monopoly Law , a Competition Commission was established to administer and supervise the operation of the Monopoly Law . The Competition Commission may impose a variety of administrative sanctions , including ordering the cancellation of contravening agreements , unwinding transactions , ordering a business to cease its anti-competitive conduct , requiring payment of compensation and/or imposing substantial fines . <p> A business participant may not carry out a merger , consolidation or takeover of companies that might result in monopolistic practices or unfair business competition . <p> A merger , consolidation or takeover of business where the value of assets or sales value would exceed a " certain amount " must be reported to the Competition Commission no later than 30 days after the date of the merger , consolidation or takeover . <p> A business participant may not own a majority of shares in a number of companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in the same relevant market if the ownership causes certain levels of the relevant market share of particular goods or service to be exceeded . <p> Several other provisions under the Monopoly Law might be relevant to an M&amp;A transaction depending on the circumstances . There is little additional guidance in the Anti-Monopoly Law on the main concepts involved . Practices of the Competition Commission will also be relevant to understanding these issues . <p> This is an area that has had limited impact on M&amp;A in Indonesia . The absence of a regulation stipulating the " certain amount " referred to has meant that the notification requirement can not as yet , be followed . There is no procedure , formal or informal , for prior notification or clearance and such a course would not at this stage seem advisable . However , the Competition Commission has seen fit , on occasion over recent years , to take issue with conduct it considered unfair or collusive by international companies , although for the time being not directly related to M&amp;A transactions . Given the need to investigate if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wording of the Monopoly Law , this is perhaps an area to watch , particularly in the case of mergers conducted offshore if both groups have substantial Indonesian business . <h> Author biographies <h> Iril Hiswara <h> Hiswara Bunjamin &amp; Tandjung <p> Iril Hiswara is the managing partner of Hiswara Bunjamin &amp; Tandjung and leads the firm 's merger and acquisitions practice .

Recent high profile project finance transactions include the Myingyan IPP . <p> In general , the Myanmar legal system has a lack of precedents to confirm the legal position . This is particularly true in relation to project financing , and the answers given to these questions must be understood in this context . <h> Section 2 " ECAs and Multilaterals <h> 2.1 What role have export credit agencies , multilateral agencies and international financial institutions played in supporting project finance transactions in your jurisdiction ?

PPPs are negotiated individually and there are no standardised bidding processes or documents , and therefore no standardised approach . Each ministry has its own approach and rules . <p> The Japan International Cooperation Agency ( JICA ) and Myanmar 's Directorate of Investment and Company Administration ( DICA ) have been discussing the standardisation of English language bidding and PPP documents . <h> 3.2 May a concessionaire grant security interest in the project to its lenders and if so is the consent of the government or contracting authority required ? <p> In practice , the Myanmar government sometimes enters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

These large-scale projects include investments that are strategically important , large capital intensive investment projects , investments which have a large potential impact on the natural environment or the local community , investments which use state-owned land and also designated investments . It is likely that many if not all future project financed developments in Myanmar will require MIC approval , and the specific sectors where approval will be required will be published in a notification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 ) . <p> In relation to land , foreign investors face two main restrictions in Myanmar . First , the Transfer of Immovable Property Restriction Act of 1987 prohibits the transfer of immovable property to , and the acquisition of immovable property by , a foreign citizen or a company with foreign shareholding , including creation of and transfer following enforcement of a mortgage ( refer to questions 8.1 and 9.3 in relation to mortgages ) . Note also that Section 228(b) of the draft Myanmar Companies Law , which is expected to come into force by April 2017 , provides that neither the grant of a mortgage or charge or its execution shall be restricted by the Transfer of Immovable Property Restrictions Act or any other law " however this provision has not yet become law and its effect is therefore untested in practice . <p> Second , it also prohibits a foreign person from leasing land for more than one year . <p> However , a foreign investor who obtains a permit or endorsement under the Myanmar Investment Law may obtain a lease over immovable property with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , the Myanmar government has proposed to liberalise the definition of a Myanmar company under the draft Myanmar Companies Law to include a company with up to the prescribed level of foreign shareholding ( expected to be 35% , but this has not been officially confirmed and can only be considered as a possibility at this stage ) . Such a company would not face any restrictions in leasing or owning land . <p> In terms of fees and taxes , stamp duty is payable under the Burma Stamp Act of 1899 on execution of instruments , including lease agreements . As of October 1 2016 , following the amendments to stamp duty under Notification 146/2016 , the stamp duty payable on a share transfer is 0.1% of the value of the shares , a loan agreement is 0.5% of the loan amount , and the stamp duty payable on a lease agreement with a term greater than three years is two per cent of the average annual rent . <h> 4.2 Can a government authority block or unwind a transaction after closing for strategic , national security or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law provides that the Myanmar Government may expropriate investments if : <p> it is necessary for Myanmar and its citizens ; <p> the measures are non-discriminatory ; <p> the measures are in accordance with existing law ; and <p> there is payment of prompt , fair and adequate compensation . <p> However , expropriation without compensation is possible in the case of non-discriminatory measures of general application which governments normally take for the purposes of regulating economic or social activity , as set out in Chapter 21 ( broadly , regulations applicable to the economy as a whole ) and Chapter 22 ( broadly , measures relating to national security ) of the Myanmar Investment Law . <p> However , section 91 of the Myanmar Investment Law provides that Myanmar 's international treaties prevail over that law if they are inconsistent , and some of those treaties give foreign investors additional rights in relation to expropriation . <h> Section 5 " Foreign exchange , remittances and repatriation <h> 5.1 What , if any , are the restrictions , controls , fees or taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parties in other jurisdictions ? <p> Although the right of foreign investors to transfer funds within certain categories is guaranteed under the Myanmar Investment Law , it is generally understood in practice that all remittances of funds from outside Myanmar to inside Myanmar ( and vice versa ) are governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Law of 2012 ( FEML ) and prior approval from the Central Bank of Myanmar ( CBM ) must be obtained if required under the FEML . <p> Under the FEML , fund remittances are classified into ordinary transactions and capital transactions . As a general rule , prior approval must be obtained from the CBM for any capital transaction but approval is not required for an ordinary transaction . However , the definitions of both categories in the FEML are unclear and the practice of the CBM is inconsistent , so in practice it is necessary to confirm with the CBM how to deal with each foreign remittance on a case-by-case basis . <p> With respect to the foreign exchange remittances in connection with a loan from outside Myanmar , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBM 's approval is required prior to the disbursement and , after obtaining such prior approval from the CBM , it is not necessary to obtain the CBM 's approval for each remittance for repayment of principal and interest . Based on the announcement issued by the CBM in July 2016 , it has been understood that , in relation to such approval , the CBM will take into consideration matters relevant to the borrower including the capital amount already brought into Myanmar , the terms of the loan agreement and the debt/equity ratio . <p> Withholding tax will apply for remittances . Subject to the applicability of a double tax treaty , the withholding tax on a non-resident foreigner for interest income is 15% and it is zero per cent for dividend income . <p> Under the FEML and Notification 7/2014 , Myanmar residents ( including Myanmar incorporated companies ) can open offshore foreign currency accounts with the approval of the CBM , provided they file monthly bank statements with the CBM . In practice , we understand the CBM has recently been willing to approve Myanmar companies using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency-denominated loans for project financing . The funds from these loans are then transferred into Myanmar by the Myanmar company itself . <p> Myanmar residents can open onshore foreign currency accounts without permission , and non-residents ( for example foreign corporations ) may open such accounts with the CBM 's permission . <h> Section 6 " Insurance <h> 6.1 Are there any restrictions , controls , fees or taxes on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies ? <p> No foreign insurer has been awarded a licence under the Insurance Business Law of 1996 to undertake an insurance business in Myanmar and may conduct such business through Myanma Insurance , the state-owned insurer . The Special Economic Zones Law of 2014 provides that a foreign insurance business may operate an insurance business within a special economic zone ( SEZ ) with a permit , and a few insurers have received licences to operate an insurance business in the Thilawa SEZ. <h> 6.2 Is reinsurance in the international market commonly seen on project finance transactions in your jurisdiction and are cut-through clauses permitted ? <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is permitted to offer reinsurance within Myanmar under the Myanma Insurance Law of 1993 . According to the Ministry of Finance , Myanma Insurance has taken out reinsurance outside Myanmar with foreign insurers in relation to a number of insurance policies . Cut-through clauses are permitted in Myanmar and we are aware of at least one occasion on which Myanma Insurance has agreed to such a clause in a contract for re-insurance of insurance it provided to a business in Myanmar . <h> Section 7 " Choice of law and jurisdiction <h> 7.1 Is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable ? <p> Under the Code of Civil Procedure , the judgment of a foreign court is binding on parties that submit to its jurisdiction . A waiver of sovereign immunity clause is generally taken by market participants ( including in the context of project finance ) to be effective in Myanmar . <h> 7.2 Is English or New York law recognised as a valid choice of law in your jurisdiction ? <p> By law parties are free in principle to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of any applicable mandatory rules . In practice , state-owned enterprises and Myanmar government agencies will rarely agree to a foreign choice of governing law . <h> 7.3 Would courts recognise a foreign arbitral tribunal award or court judgment ? If so , what are the conditions applicable to such recognition ? <p> Myanmar is a party to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ( New York Convention ) and the Arbitration Law of 2016 provides for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the same manner as court judgments . <p> A party seeking to enforce a foreign arbitral award must present to the court the original or duly authenticated copy of the award and the original or duly certified copy of the agreement for arbitration together with evidence that the award is a foreign arbitral award . <p> An arbitral award may be refused recognition only for certain prescribed procedural flaws ( these grounds for refusal are broadly speaking in line with the UNCITRAL model law ) : <p> a party was under an incapacity ; <p> the arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given ; <p> the arbitral award was ultra vires ; <p> the arbitral tribunal was not properly constituted ; or <p> arbitral award is not final . <p> Enforcement may be refused only if the subject matter was not capable of arbitration under Myanmar law or for public policy reasons . <p> A foreign judgment can be enforced in Myanmar by presenting the pleading set out in the Code of Civil Procedure of 1909 , unless one of the exceptions set out in section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure apply ( these exceptions are similar to those relating to the enforcement of arbitration awards , but also include that the court made an error of international law or refused to recognise Myanmar law when it was applicable , or that the claim was based on a breach of Myanmar law ) . <h> Section 8 " Security <h> 8.1 What types of security are usually seen in project finance transactions in your jurisdiction , and are there any notable exclusions , including assets which can not be secured ? <p> Security can be created through a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pledge can be created over its movable property , including its shares . A sponsor of a project company may grant a security interest over its shares under Myanmar law . If the project company is a company with an MIC permit or endorsement , it must give the MIC notice of a mortgage or a transfer of shares . In addition , equitable mortgages have been created as part of the security package for some loans . <h> 8.2 Would the law of your jurisdiction enforce arrangements whereby debt is subordinated by way of a contractual agreement ( including in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings ) ? <p> Subordination agreements can be made and enforced in Myanmar . In theory , subordination trusts would also be recognised in the context of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings . Note , however , that neither of these conclusions has been confirmed in practice . <h> Section 9 " Perfection , priority and enforcement <h> 9.1 How is a security interest in each type of security perfected and how is its priority established ? <p> For mortgages of immovable property , other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument signed by the mortgagor and attested by at least two witnesses must be executed . For movable property , a pledge requires possession of the property in question by the creditor . <p> Any security instrument must be registered under the Myanmar Companies Act within 21 days with DICA if it relates to a security over company assets or it will not be enforceable if the company becomes insolvent ( the draft Myanmar Companies Law contains similar provisions , and also does in relation to all other provisions of the Myanmar Companies Act discussed in this note ) . Mortgages over immovable property must be registered with the Registration Office under the Registration Act 1909 in order to be enforceable . <p> As noted above , notice must be given to the MIC of mortgages or transfers of shares in a company with an MIC permit or endorsement . <h> 9.2 Are any fees , taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and , if so , are there lawful techniques to minimise or defer them ? <p> Stamp duty must be paid prior to registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is 0.5% of the loan amount . For a pledge , the stamp duty is an amount in Myanmar kyats set out in paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the Burma Stamp Act , and is calculated based on the duration of the loan and its value . <h> 9.3 May a corporate entity , in the capacity of agent or trustee , hold security on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party ? <p> Yes . There are examples of offshore lenders using onshore security agents to hold security on their behalf . This has been used in a few transactions to attempt to circumvent the restriction in the Transfer of Immovable Property Restriction Act on transfer of immovable property , but appears to be untested in practice . <h> Section 10 " Bankruptcy proceedings and enforcement <h> 10.1 How does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral/security ? <p> The effect of the bankruptcy of a project company on the lender 's enforcement of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law principles , we would expect that the powers of any receiver appointed by the lenders would be suspended , but in general the rights of secured creditors to take priority over those of unsecured creditors .

While MNCs will be unaffected , practitioners say that Hong Kong businesses should begin reviewing their practices . <p> The two conduct rules in Part 2 of the Competition Ordinance designate restrictions , and are very broadly drafted . According to John Hickin , a partner at Mayer Brown JSM , this is deliberate because it will give the Commission some latitude in determining what sort of behavior it wants to crack down on . <p> But the general quality of the conduct rules concern businesses . Shirley Yuen , CEO of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce , said , " the Chamber believes that the law still leaves much to be desired in terms of clarity , and although a rough framework has now been put in place , it needs to be shaped to best suit and serve Hong Kong 's needs . " <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distort competition . However the Commission will decide whether the rule will cover vertical arrangements , such as those between entities in a supply chain or distributorship arrangements . <p> Yuen said that it is critical to remove this uncertainty as soon as possible . Currently businesses do not know whether , and to what extent , distribution , franchising , joint purchasing , R&amp;D , commercialisation , resale price maintenance , exclusive dealing and other agreements will be treated under the law . <p> The second conduct rule specifies abuse of market power rather than market dominance . Hickin said that this is because there is a lower threshold for the Tribunal and the Commission to determine if a business has substantial market power . <p> Marc Waha , partner at Norton Rose Hong Kong , said that he has seen concern about the definition of market power . " The government has said it wants to refer a low percentage of market share because it wants to go after supermarkets and retailers , " he said . " Clearly the rest of the business community is uneasy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Hong Kong law goes further than most competition laws . STbastien J. Evrard , an antitrust partner at Jones Day 's Beijing office , said that in other jurisdictions , substantial market power laws generally require at least a 40% market share threshold . <p> But the threshold is lower in Hong Kong . Multinational corporations with market shares between 25 to 40% are not subject to abuse of dominance provisions around the world , but they may be in Hong Kong . However , Evrard clarified that the law does not prohibit having large market shares or a monopoly . Instead , they only become illegal when there is a monopoly that applies unfair prices or bundles products . <p> Noncompliance can incur a penalty of up to 10 percent annual turnover obtained in Hong Kong , based on the gross turnover of the undertakings concerned , for each year of infringement up to a maximum of three years . Individuals can be disqualified for up to five years from acting as a director or being directly or indirectly involved in the management of a company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assets or shares or appointing a third party to take control of property . <p> However Yuen said that the penalty cap to 10 % of Hong Kong turnover does not go far enough to make the law proportionate . Instead , the cap should be on the local turnover in the goods or service concerned . <p> But Waha said that law-abiding corporates , especially listed companies , do not need the prospect of high sanctions to take the Competition Ordinance seriously . " If they are perceived as non-compliant , then they will be sanctioned by shareholders before any competition authority is involved , " he added . <p> Exemptions <p> " As in all jurisdictions that have introduced a competition law ( except for China ) , there will be a rush for exemption applications , " said Waha . <p> The ordinance provides for several exemptions . Practitioners noted that there is effectively an exemption for government entities , which is unusual . <p> Statutory authorities are also exempt , but the government can bring certain statutory authorities back within the scheme of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are public policy reasons . This is often available to entities entrusted with the provision of services of general economic interest , such as utilities . <p> The Competition Ordinance specifies a procedure to apply for block exemptions , which will be determined by the Commission in due course . In other jurisdictions , block exemption orders have been made available to the insurance sector , shipping lines and other businesses where there is justification , said Hickin . <p> Other exemptions are specified in Schedule 1 of the law . Companies are exempt from the first conduct rule if its undertakings in any calendar year do not exceed HK $200 million . They are exempt from the second if its undertakings do not exceed HK $40 million . However , Hickin warned that these exemptions are not absolute . " It does not apply to hardcore cartel activity , " he said . <p> Impact <p> Practitioners agree that the law 's impact on MNCs is limited . MNCs are subject to competition laws around the world , and tend to adopt a consistent policy , Evrard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong companies . Yuen said that the Competition Ordinance will impact the cost of doing business , as companies hire legal and compliance experts to ensure that their contracts and business operations do not breach the law . <p> " Many practices that have been ingrained in how people have done business will no longer be viable , " said Hickin . " By way of example , the competition law will have a real impact on the way businesses make pricing decisions , and even the extent to which they can share information with competitors . " <p> However corporates have time to comply . Waha predicted that it will be six to ten months before appointments to the Commission are made , and does not expect enforcement until 2014 . " It will be maybe five to ten years before we start seeing market changes due to the Competition Ordinance , " he said .

@@8538261 @1738261/ <h> Section 1 : PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES <h> 1.1 What reorganisation and insolvency processes are available for debtors in your jurisdiction ? <p> Luxembourg has two major types of insolvency proceedings : bankruptcy ( faillite ) governed by the Commercial Code ( article 437ff ) and reorganisation proceedings governed by specific legislation . The Insolvency Reform contemplates replacing the prevailing reorganisation proceedings . <p> Most of the insolvency cases opened in Luxembourg are subject to bankruptcy . Bankruptcy aims at repaying creditors through the liquidation of the debtor 's assets . Bankruptcy can be initiated by the debtor , its creditors or the court itself . The court will declare a debtor bankrupt upon the cumulative conditions that the debtor : ( i ) is unable to repay its debts as they fall due ; and , ( ii ) has lost its financial creditworthiness ( bankruptcy conditions ) . As from the opening of the bankruptcy , the existing management is deprived of managing the debtor 's assets . The bankruptcy is managed by a court-appointed receiver ( curateur ) , whose mission is to realise the debtor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank . The receiver acts under the supervision of a supervising judge appointed by the court . <p> Reorganisation proceedings are rarely used in practice and can only be petitioned by the debtor . In the first stage , the court rules on the global merits of the claim . If the court considers there are sufficient grounds for reorganisation proceedings , it will open a preliminary phase and appoint judges and/or experts to investigate and report on the debtor 's state of affairs . After hearing these reports , the court grants or denies the merits of the proceedings . <p> During reorganisation proceedings , the existing management remains but acts under the court 's supervision . Any reorganisation plan requires the creditors ' consent ( at majorities varying depending on the type of reorganisation proceeding the debtor has petitioned for ) . Courts may at any time deny or terminate the proceedings and open a bankruptcy if the bankruptcy conditions are met . <p> Distressed debtors can opt for one of these three types of reorganisation proceedings : <p> Controlled management ( gestion contr(lTe) : aims at effecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , under the supervision of one or several court-appointed commissioners . Controlled management is governed by Grand-Ducal Decree of May 24 1935 and can only be initiated by a debtor acting in good faith , who has lost its financial creditworthiness or faces difficulties in meeting all of its financial commitments . Reorganisation or liquidation plans must be set up by the commissioner , approved by a majority ( in number ) of creditors representing 50% of the debtor 's liabilities , before being ratified by the court and further implemented . <p> Composition with creditors ( concordat prTventif de faillite ) allows a debtor to avoid the filing for bankruptcy by entering into an agreement with creditors on the settlement of their claims . In accordance with the law of April 14 1886 on composition with creditors , these proceedings are subject to approval of a majority of creditors representing 75% of the debtor 's liabilities . If ratified by the court , the agreement must be implemented by the debtor . <p> Reprieve from payments ( sursis de paiement ) allows a debtor who faces temporary liquidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met . The debtor 's temporary financial difficulties must be due to extraordinary and unexpected circumstances and its audited balance sheet must demonstrate an excess of assets over liabilities . During the investigation phase , the court has discretion to grant a temporary stay , either immediately or at a later stage in the procedure . The reprieve from payments requires the consent of a majority of creditors representing 75% of the debtor 's liabilities and the approval of the Luxembourg Superior Court of Justice . <h> 1.2 Is a stay on creditor enforcement action available ? <p> The opening of a bankruptcy automatically and immediately suspends all legal proceedings against the debtor and prevents any creditors ' enforcement actions . <p> The appointment of a judge by the court to investigate the debtor 's state of affairs triggers an automatic stay under the controlled management procedure .

Ranks of claims are established by law and can not be changed by a court or bankruptcy receiver 's decision . <p> If the value of an asset subject to a preferred right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's liability , that value will be paid by preference to the preferred creditor , while the remaining portion of its claim will rank equally with other unsecured creditors . <h> 1.5 Is there a process for facilitating the sale of a distressed debtor 's assets or business ? <p> There is no such process available under Luxembourg law . <h> 1.6 What are the duties of directors of a company in financial difficulty ? <p> As a general principle , directors must always act prudently and diligently . <p> When a company faces financial difficulties , prudent and diligent directors would normally take advice from financiers or lawyers , avoid incurring additional liabilities , or seek arrangements with creditors to delay payments , restructure the indebtedness , or enter into a standstill agreement . <p> Sporadic provisions of the law of August 10 1915 on commercial companies ( Company Law ) or the Commercial Code require directors to take certain actions in certain circumstances . <p> In public companies , directors are required to convene a shareholders ' meeting to resolve on the dissolution of the company when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's share capital . <p> A company having ceased to pay its debts as they fall due must file for bankruptcy within one month . This filing requirement lies ultimately with the directors . <p> In a bankruptcy , directors can be held personally liable when their actions or inaction lead to the bankruptcy or seriously increase the liabilities of a distressed company . <p> During a bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings , directors have the obligation to cooperate with the bankruptcy receiver and the court . <h> 1.7 How can any of a debtor 's transactions be challenged on insolvency ? <p> Transactions can only be clawed back or challenged in a bankruptcy . A claw-back is initiated by the receiver and debated in court . Only specific transactions can be challenged . <p> Transactions entered into during the hardening period ( pTriode suspecte ) " fixed up to six months before the bankruptcy judgment " and up to 10 days before this period may be declared invalid if they constitute the preferential satisfaction of one creditor over another . <p> The court can cancel the following transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments made for debts not yet due ; payments of due debts by means other than cash or bills of exchange ; and , granting of any security for a debt contracted before the hardening period . <p> Any payment for accrued debt or any transactions against money made after a company has ceased its payments and before the bankruptcy judgment may be cancelled by the court if the beneficiary of the payment or the contracting party was aware of the debtor 's cessation of payments . <p> Mortgages granted during the hardening period ( or 10 days before ) may be cancelled if their registration has not been performed within 15 days of the conclusion of the mortgage agreement . <p> Payments made in fraud of creditors ' rights are void irrespective of the day they were made . <h> 1.8 What priority claims are there and is protection available for post-petition credit ? <p> The Luxembourg Civil Code lists the claims benefiting from a general preferred right on a debtor 's movable or immovable assets . These preferred rights supersede any security in rem granted to a creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivables under the Financial Collateral Law remain enforceable despite the opening of a bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings . <p> There is no legal protection available for creditors lending money to a bankrupt company . <h> 1.9 Is there a different regime for credit institutions and investment firms ? <p> Credit institutions and investment firms benefit from different **25;440;TOOLONG regimes . <p> The European Directive 2014/59/EU of May 15 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms was implemented in Luxembourg by a law dated December 18 2015 . The reorganisation procedures for these institutions are as follows : <p> The resolution procedure aims to restructure credit institutions encountering serious financial difficulties to allow the continuity of their core activities and avoid any systemic impact , through : ( i ) a disposal of part or all of their business ; ( ii ) the creation of a bridge bank where all good assets and essential functions are transferred while the bad assets and non-core functions remain with the bad bank for future liquidation ; ( iii ) a segregation of assets ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments may be opened at the request of the CSSF ( Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier ) or the credit institution where : ( i ) it is unable to raise credit or faces temporary liquidity difficulties ( whether or not it has ceased its payments ) ; ( ii ) its ability to meet its commitments is entirely compromised ; or , ( iii ) its authorisation has been withdrawn and the decision has not yet become definitive . The petition for suspension of payment triggers the automatic stay of enforcement actions . The credit institution will be able to operate under the control of court-appointed administrators . <p> The institution can be subject to a judicial liquidation if the suspension of payment fails , if it can no longer meet its commitment or if its authorisation has been definitively withdrawn . In such instances , a liquidator will be appointed by the court to liquidate the assets of the entity and repay the creditors .

It only applies to business-to-business ( B2B ) contracts in an international context . There are three basic rules which , subject to a short list of narrow exceptions , must be followed . First , the court chosen by the parties must hear the case ( article 5 ) . Second , any court not chosen must decline to hear the case ( article 6 ) . Third , any judgment rendered by the chosen court must be recognised and enforced in other contracting states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , the courts are required to respect and give effect to forum selection clauses in B2B contracts . The primary objective is to give legal certainty and predictability to the contacting parties regarding where to litigate a dispute that arises under their contract . It reduces the time and expense that both courts and businesses face when dealing with international jurisdictional issues and the enforcement of foreign rulings . And this , in turn , creates a legal environment that is amenable to international trade and foreign direct investment . <h> When did work on the Convention begin , and what must happen for it to take effect ? <p> Work formally started in April 2002 when the political decision was made to develop a convention in this field . And the actual negotiations lasted until 2005 when the 20th session of the Hague Conference approved the final text of the Convention . But strictly speaking , the negotiations go back further than that . The Convention is actually a spin-off of a broader project " known as the judgments project . This was started in the early 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters . But this massive project proved too ambitious , and the members of the Hague Conference wisely decided to scale down its scope , and do something more manageable and which was more likely to achieve consensus : the Choice of Court Convention . <h> " The Convention creates a clear and predictable regime " <p> Looking ahead , the Convention will enter into force after the deposit of a second instrument of ratification or accession . Today , only Mexico has acceded to the Convention . But on January 30 this year the European Commission issued a proposal for approval of the Convention . That means that after the proposal is approved by the European Parliament and European Council , and the necessary formalities have occurred , there will be a second contracting party ( the EU ) and the Convention will enter into force . It will bind Mexico and 27 of the EU 's 28 member states ( Denmark will not be bound ) . I 'm very hopeful that this will occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels I regulation will enter into force . So the EU authorities are , rather wisely , planning for the two instruments to enter into force on the same day . <h> The Convention is often described as the litigation counterpart to the New York Arbitration Convention . Is this an accurate description ? <p> Absolutely . Commercial arbitration is , of course , widely used . But good commercial arbitration has also become very expensive , and so it is not always an option " in particular for small and mid-sized companies ( SME ) . When these companies consider the court avenue , their first question of course is : which court has jurisdiction to hear the dispute ? If the parties have agreed on the court in their contract , the Convention provides a very clear and predictable answer to this question . So the Convention will ensure that parties can expect what they have bargained for " to have any disputes arising from their contract heard exclusively by the court they have chosen " and have the judgment recognised and enforced elsewhere . <p> That really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote certainty , efficiency and predictability in international dispute settlement . At a comparable level , the New York Convention will continue to be the basic legal instrument for international commercial arbitration , but the choice of court convention will make the litigation path more attractive , in particular for SMEs that can not always afford commercial arbitration . <h> Today , how common are choice of court agreements in contracts to which the Convention would apply , and how readily do courts respect them ? <p> To my knowledge there is no comprehensive and updated data on this . There are , however , some sectorial or regional surveys that suggest that these agreements are indeed very common in B2B contracts . The problem is that choice of court agreements are not always respected under divergent national rules . Especially when cases are brought to a court other than the one designated by the parties ; courts often do n't regard these agreements as binding . In the common law context , for example , you often hear courts saying ' you may have chosen me as the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given court elsewhere is better placed to hear the dispute ' ( or words to that effect ) . The Choice of Court Convention would change that . <h> Other than the EU , the only other party to sign but not ratify the Convention is the US . Has it taken any steps to ratifying it ? <p> Yes the ratification of the convention is very much being discussed by the relevant authorities in the US . The challenge is that they are still deciding whether to implement it at the federal level or state level . So the delay has nothing to do with the merits of the convention , which is clear to the US , but rather they are still assessing the best model for implementing the Convention into domestic law . <h> Which other countries have shown the greatest interest in signing ? <p> We know that the Convention is being assessed in Argentina , Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the Russian Federation , Paraguay , Singapore , and to some extent Turkey . In some of these jurisdictions , the Convention has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , underscored the importance of the Convention via the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Regime , which implements essential elements of the Convention and entered into force in October 2013 . And Hong Kong and Mainland China have concluded a bilateral treaty for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters . Again , that takes the Choice of Court Convention as a model to the extent it deals with choice of court clauses . <p> Some very senior people have also put their weight behind the Convention . Last year , Australia 's chief justice and solicitor general called for the country to sign and ratify the Convention . And the chief justice of Singapore has really championed the country 's accession . He was one of the first high ranking officials to recognise the Convention would be a very important alternative to arbitration which clearly has become too expensive to many players . There is also express support from the International Chamber of Commerce , German Bar Association and the Inter-American bar association . And in February 2014 the Council of Bars and Law Societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What feedback are you receiving on why the countries that have shown interest have n't signed yet ? <p> As with every other convention , domestic implementation sometimes raises delicate questions , because the country 's laws need to be adapted to align to the international framework . The Convention is no exception to this . <h> " Today , courts do not always regard these agreements as binding " <p> Take the example of common law jurisdictions . As I mentioned before , judges are very much used to applying forum non conveniens . The Convention does away with that when faced with an international contract containing a forum selection clause . So judges will have to be convinced that this is no longer a relevant tool for them to apply . The Convention also reverses the common law presumption that forum selection clauses are not exclusive . <p> In civil law jurisdictions , the Convention will do away with the principle of lis pendens <p> " a theory under which the first court seized has jurisdiction over the second court seized -provided there is a court chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this principle which , for many countries , is a long-established part of domestic law . <p> Overcoming these challenges and making the changes acceptable will take some time , but it is precisely these types of changes that will bring about the desired legal certainty and predictability . Forum non conveniens introduces an element of uncertainty , as does lis pendens which may lead to a race to the courthouse . The Convention is an improvement in that it creates a clear and predictable regime by operation of the parties ' choice but it comes with the cost of doing away with some deeply rooted principles . <h> Once the Convention does take effect , what do you expect to be any other challenges in its implementation by courts ? <p> We actually do n't expect the Convention to create a vast amount of case law . Its provisions are clear and straightforward , which is important for an instrument that is designed to provide certainty and predictability . So it should make life easier for courts and businesses , rather than create arguments about the rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a real spike in interest from states interested in becoming a party . <h> The New York Convention has around 150 members . Do you think the Convention could reach the same level ? <p> Why not ? We have a number of conventions with more or close to 100 contracting states . Given the Choice of Court Convention 's obvious merits " including the fact that it is fairly short and straightforward " it has great potential to become a very successful instrument . And in light of the strong support shown by the countries and authorities mentioned above , I 'm confident it could reach a very high level of acceptance by courts globally . Of course the support for the New York Convention is exceptional , so if we can come even close to that figure , it would be fantastic . <p> Christophe Bernasconi joined the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law in September 1997 as secretary .

They ended up borrowing $5,000 from a bank . The start-up that they originally named Starbucks Coffee , Tea , and Spice was able to get the financing it needed to grow and expand , eventually becoming the Fortune 500 company we now know as Starbucks . <p> Credit is the lifeblood of business . All firms , large and small , need it to grow and thrive . However , access to credit can be constrained , especially in developing countries . According to the World Bank , more than half of private firms in emerging markets have no access to credit . That figure rises to 80% in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa . <p> Banks in developing countries are usually reluctant to accept movable assets as collateral due to the inadequate legal and regulatory environment in which banks and firms co-exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as dead capital . Movable assets , as opposed to fixed assets such as land or buildings , often account for most of the capital stock of private firms and comprise an especially large share for micro , small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) . In the developing world up to 80% of the capital stock of businesses is typically in movable assets such as machinery , equipment or receivables , while only 20% is in immovable property . <p> The availability " or otherwise " of collateral is a binding constraint on financing . The relative lack of collateral in less developed financial markets is one of the main reasons firms in these regions are rejected when they apply for bank credit . <p> The above applies to Egypt to a great extent . In addition , banks in Egypt have a lot of unutilised liquidity . The numerous initiatives to encourage micro-finance and lending to SMEs have had a limited impact on the lending rate and one of the main reasons is the lack of eligible collateral . <h> New secured transactions law <p> On November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking of security over movable assets ( the Movables Security Law ) . This law is considered a major reform in the area of secured transactions in Egypt . <p> For the first time , the new law allows non-possessory charges over movable property to exist . It introduces collateral registries for movable assets as well as special enforcement of securities . <h> The scope of the legislation <p> The law is primarily concerned with non-possessory pledges/charges over movable property . Under the law all kinds of movables can be used as collateral , whether existing or future physical assets or moral rights . This includes : receivables and credit notes ; bank deposits or accounts ; equipment , tools and stock ; trees ; agriculture produce ; farm animals and birds ; metals ; as well as intellectual property rights . <p> The law is limited to banks , and other financing **25;495;TOOLONG . <h> Registering collateral <p> The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority ( EFST ) will set-up an electronic registry for collateral made pursuant to the law and any amendments or cancellation thereof . The registry fulfils two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security interest in movable property ( of existing charges ) ; and to establish the priority of creditors vis-a-vis third parties . <p> Upon registration , collateral becomes : <p> ( i ) effective vis-a-vis third parties on the date and time of registration . Any party , who has a legitimate interest in the movable property , may object to the registration before summary courts ; <p> ( ii ) in an insolvency event , movables subject to a registered collateral will not form part of debtor 's assets , provided registration occurred prior to commencement of the insolvency proceedings ; and <p> ( iii ) registered collateral grants the secured creditor first rank security over the asset . This ranks higher than all other forms of security or pledges provided by any other law , with the exception of judicial expenses and enforcement expenses of the security itself , and without prejudice to the rights of possessory creditors under the Civil Code . <h> Enforcement <p> The enforcement regime introduced by the new law represents a breakaway from the standard civil law system of enforcement . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from third party debtors of the borrower or directly sell the pledged movables without a court order , as well as direct set-off in the case of bank accounts . In the absence of contractual authorisation for the afore-mentioned actions , the creditor can always obtain a court order in a process that is more simple than the normal enforcement of debt or securities created under other laws . <p> It is noteworthy that , as the law provided banks with flexibility and discretion when it comes to enforcement , the law required banks to indemnify the debtor/guarantor and other rights ' holders against any damage caused by breach of the enforcement proceedings . <p> The executive regulation is expected to be issued by February 2016 , and there is still a lot of work to be done to implement the law and establish the registry . It is to be hoped that the implementation will be as innovative as the law . Overall , studies have shown that introducing collateral registries for movable assets increases firms ' access to bank finance . There is also evidence that this effect is larger among smaller and younger firms .
@@8538267 @1738267/ <h> REGULATORY FRAMEWORK <h> 1.1 What is the applicable legislation and who enforces it ? <p> The applicable legislation is Republic Act 10667 , otherwise known as the Philippine Competition Act ( RA 10667 ) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations ( IRR ) . These are enforced by the Philippine Competition Commission ( PCC ) . <h> JURISDICTIONAL TEST <h> 2.1 What types of mergers and joint ventures ( JVs ) are caught ? <p> The types of mergers and JVs that are caught are those which substantially prevent , restrict or lessen competition in the Philippines in the relevant market or in the market for goods or services , as determined by the PCC . These mergers and JVs must acquire decisive influence to be caught . <h> 2.2 What are the thresholds for notification , how clear are they , and are there circumstances in which the authorities may investigate a merger falling outside such thresholds ? <p> The thresholds for notification are reasonable and sufficiently clear . Parties to an M&amp;A must notify the PCC in the following situations : if the aggregate annual gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the assets in the Philippines of the ultimate parent entity of at least one of the acquiring or acquired entities ( including that of all entities that the ultimate parent entity controls , directly or indirectly ) exceeds 1 billion pesos ( $20 million ) ; and the value of the transaction exceeds 1 billion pesos . The criteria to determine whether the transaction value exceeds the threshold amount are intricately enumerated in Section 3 ( b ) , Rule 4 of the IRR . <p> Where an entity has already exceeded the 35% threshold for an acquisition of voting shares , or the 35% threshold for an acquisition of an interest in a non-corporate entity , another notification will be required if the acquiring entity will exceed the 50% threshold after making a further acquisition . <p> In a notifiable JV transaction , an acquiring entity shall be subject to the notification requirements if either the aggregate value of the assets that will be combined in the Philippines or contributed into the proposed JV exceeds 1 billion pesos ; or the gross revenues generated in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the proposed JV exceed 1 billion pesos . <p> Inasmuch as the PCC may , on its own , investigate mergers and JVs having a direct , substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade , industry or commerce in the Philippines based on factors deemed relevant by the PCC , it is reasonable to conclude that it may investigate a merger falling outside the notification thresholds . <h> 2.3 Are there circumstances in which a foreign-to-foreign merger may require notification , and is a local effect required to give the authority jurisdiction ? <p> Foreign-to-foreign mergers or JVs may require notification but only if a local effects test is met . RA 10667 and its IRR are applicable to international trade having direct , substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects in trade , industry or commerce in the Philippines , including those that result from acts done outside the Philippines . <p> The IRR expressly provides that a foreign-to-foreign merger requires notification even if the assets are outside the Philippines , if the aggregate value of the assets in the Philippines of the acquiring entity exceeds 1 billion pesos ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those assets acquired outside the Philippines exceed 1 billion pesos . <h> PRE-NOTIFICATION AND FILING <h> 3.1 Is filing mandatory or voluntary and must closing be suspended pending clearance ? Are there any sanctions for non-compliance , and are these applied in practice ? <p> Filings are mandatory for M&amp;As if the following elements are met : the transaction value exceeds 1 billion pesos ; and the aggregate annual gross revenues in , into or from the Philippines , or value of the assets in the Philippines of the ultimate parent entity of at least one of the acquiring or acquired entities , including that of all entities that the ultimate parent entity controls , directly or indirectly , exceeds 1 billion pesos . <p> In such a case , closing must be suspended pending clearance . The PCC has 30 days from the parties ' submission of all the required information to conduct its phase I review . If a phase II review ( more detailed and comprehensive analysis ) is needed , the PCC is required to inform the parties within the phase I period and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' receipt of the notice . The IRR limits the entire review process to 90 days from the submission of all the required information for phase I review . When these periods expire without the PCC having promulgated any decision , the M&amp;A transaction shall be deemed approved and the parties may consummate it . <p> Failure to comply with the notification requirement and to observe the waiting periods renders the transaction void and subjects the parties to an administrative fine of one percent to five percent of the value of the transaction . <h> 3.2 Who is responsible for filing and what , if any , filing fee applies ? <p> Each party to a merger or acquisition that satisfies the elements in Item 3.1 is required to notify the PCC . The PCC had not promulgated the rules on filing fees for notifications as of November 10 2016 . In practice , the Merger and Acquisition Office ( MAO ) currently does not impose any filing fees and has committed that it will not impose any until the rules on filing fees have been issued already . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? <p> Each party to an M&amp;A that satisfies the elements in Item 3.1 must submit a notification form and pay the applicable fee ( but see discussion in Item 3.2 ) . The notification form must be signed by a general partner of a partnership , an officer or director of a corporation or , in the case of a natural person , the natural person or his/her legal representative , and certified that the contents are true and accurate of their own personal knowledge or based on authentic records . Both the notification form and the certification must be notarised. <h> 3.4 Are pre-notification contacts available , encouraged or required ? How long does this process take and what steps does it involve ? <p> Parties to a proposed M&amp;A covered by Item 3.1 are allowed but are not required to request a pre-notification consultation with the staff of the PCC . During such consultations , the parties may seek non-binding advice on the specific information that is required to be in the notification . <p> The following information must be disclosed in order to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact information of the entities concerned ; the type of transaction ; and the markets covered or lines of businesses by the proposed M&amp;A . <p> Given that the PCC has just been recently organised , there is still no available information as to the length of time that a pre-notification consultation takes . <h> CLEARANCE <h> 4.1 What is the standard timetable for clearance and is there a fast-track process ? Can the authority extend or delay this process ? <p> The IRR provide the following clearance periods : for phase I " 30 days from submission of complete notification requirements ; and for phase II " 60 days from parties ' receipt of notice that more information and further analysis of the transaction is required . The PCC is allowed to issue its decision prior to the expiration of these periods but can not extend or delay as this will result to the transaction being deemed approved .

Please comment on the authority 's approach to acceptance and implementation of remedies . <p> In cases where the M&amp;A agreement is deemed prohibited , the IRR allow the PCC to prohibit the implementation of the agreement , to require a specific modification of the agreement before it is implemented or to require the pertinent party or parties to enter into other legally enforceable agreements before implementing the agreement .

The MCCG 2012 will supersede the 2007 Code on Corporate Governance when it takes effect on December 31 2012 . <p> In essence , the MCCG 2012 sets out the broad principles and specific recommendations on structure and processes which companies should adopt in ensuring good corporate governance and accountability as an integral part of their business dealings and culture . The MCCG 2012 advocates the adoption of standards that go beyond the minimum prescribed by regulation on a voluntary basis . <p> Among the key areas that have been strengthened in the MCCG 2012 are the roles and responsibility of boards of directors , composition of the board , commitment and remuneration of directors , risk management framework and internal controls systems , as well as the integrity of financial reporting . <p> Under the new MCCG 2012 , it is recommended that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of conduct to support , promote and ensure its compliance . Due attention should also be given to environmental , social and governance aspects of business in its strategies in order to promote sustainability . <p> Furthermore , companies are also encouraged to formalise and make public a board charter and ensure that it is periodically reviewed . Other additions include the recommendation for the board to establish a Nominating Committee which should comprise exclusively of non-executive directors , a majority of whom must be independent . The Nominating Committee will be tasked with the responsibility to develop , maintain and review the criteria to be used in the recruitment process and annual assessments of directors as well as a focus to seek out suitable female candidates to sit on the board . <p> The emphasis on the independence of independent directors is further accentuated by the recommendation that the tenure of independent directors should be capped to a cumulative term of nine years . Upon completion of the nine years , it is recommended that the director may continue his or her service as a non-independent director if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another important recommendation is that the positions of chairman and CEO should be held by two different individuals , as this is aimed at ensuring a balance of power such that no individual has unfettered authority .

Nevertheless , a publicly-listed company must publish a statement in its annual report on how it has applied the principles in the Code and the extent of compliance with the best practices , including specifically identifying the areas of non-compliance with reasons and alternatives for any such non-compliance . <p> Although the present comply-or-explain approach is expected for the MCCG 2012 , it remains to be seen whether the Securities Commission or Bursa Securities will decide in future that specific recommendations of the MCCG 2012 are prescribed as mandatory for a publicly-listed company or perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scepticism in certain quarters on the extent and efficiency of regulating sound corporate governance , the new MCCG 2012 must be applauded as a big leap towards the implementation of a culture of good corporate governance transparency and accountability in Malaysia .

To avoid breaching the 60%-40% Filipino-alien equity ratio required in many partly nationalised activities , a common shareholding structure was the issuance of non-voting preferred shares to foreign investors . <p> The recent Supreme Court case of Gamboa v Teves ( G.R. 176579 , June 28 2011 ( main decision ) and October 9 2012 , ( resolution on the motions for reconsideration ) ) has changed the structuring landscape . In Teves , the Supreme Court interpreted the 60%-40% Filipino-alien equity ratio/requirement in partly nationalised activities as applying to each class of a corporation 's shares . With this development , companies engaged in partly nationalised activities which have foreign investors will be constrained to restructure their shareholding to avoid breaching Philippine law , and accordingly foreign investors will have to consider certain rules affecting their restructuring exercise . <h> Defining capital in foreign investments <p> Article XII , Section 10 of the 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic and planning agency and when the national interest dictates , reserve certain areas of investment to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at least 60% of whose capital is owned by such citizens , or such higher percentage as Congress may prescribe .

Under the auspices of the FIA , the President of the Philippines must , every two years , issue the Foreign Investments Negative List ( FINL ) which sets out wholly nationalised ( where no foreign participation is permitted ) and partly nationalised ( where foreign participation is permitted but limited ) activities in the Philippines . <p> Section 3(a) of the FIA defines the term ' Philippine national ' as : ( i ) a citizen of the Philippines ; ( ii ) a domestic partnership or association wholly owned by citizens of the Philippines ; ( iii ) a corporation organised under Philippine law of which at least 60% of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or ( iv ) a corporation organised abroad and registered as doing business in the Philippines under the Philippine Corporation Code , of which 100% of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote is wholly owned by Filipinos or a trustee of funds for pension or other employee retirement or separation benefits , where the trustee is a Philippine national and at least 60% of the fund will accrue to the benefit of Philippine nationals . Nonetheless , where a corporation and its non-Filipino stockholders own stocks in a Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) -registered enterprise , at least 60% of the capital stock outstanding and entitled to vote of each of both corporations must be owned and held by citizens of the Philippines , in order for the corporation to be considered a Philippine national . <p> Ascertaining the nationality of a corporation for purposes of participating in a wholly or partly nationalised activity begins with the term ' capital ' . Over the years , there have been conflicting opinions as regards the proper construction of the term . Such conflicts should now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in Teves . The principal issue in Teves was whether the entirety of a corporation 's outstanding capital stock should be considered in determining its nationality for purposes of participating in wholly or partly nationalised activities . The petitioner there argued that ' capital ' should be interpreted to refer only to such stock entitled to vote for the board of directors , because only such class of stock effectively exercises control over the corporation . The Supreme Court agreed with that interpretation and held that in determining a corporation 's nationality for purposes of participating in wholly or partly nationalised activities , only such capital stock entitled to vote or elect for a corporation 's board of directors shall be considered ; thus , the percentage limits for foreign equity indicated in the Constitution , and also the FIA and FINL , should be applied only to such class of stock and not to the corporation 's total outstanding stock . <p> In an October 9 , 2012 resolution ( which was issued by the Court after the Teves respondents filed motions for reconsideration of the main decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled that where the law requires a minimum percentage of Philippine ownership for purposes of participation in a wholly or partly nationalised activity , such minimum percentage applies to and must be present for each class of shares , whether common , preferred non-voting , preferred voting or any other class of shares . The Court noted that " outstanding capital stock " under the Philippine Corporation Code includes all classes of stock and is not limited to shares classified as voting shares . In addition , the Court noted that even if preferred non-voting shares are denied the right to vote or elect directors under a corporation 's articles of incorporation , such shares are nonetheless entitled to vote on certain fundamental corporate matters under the Philippine Corporation Code . Accordingly , the Supreme Court concluded that the 60%-40% Filipino-alien equity ratio/requirement must apply not only to shares with voting rights but also to shares without voting rights , and each class of shares must comply with the 60%-40% requirement . <h> Increasing authorised capital stock <p> As a consequence of Teves , corporations which are engaged in partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its foreign corporate stockholders hold more than the allowable percentage of any class of share ( even if owning not more than 40% of the total capital stock ) would now be compelled to restructure to comply with this latest interpretation of the term ' capital ' . For this purpose , such corporations may , on the one hand , opt to issue to Philippine stockholders any unissued shares ( in each class ) in order to increase Philippine shareholdings . If there are no longer unissued shares in each class ( because the company 's capital stock in each class is fully subscribed ) , or the amount of unissued shares in each class is insufficient , however , a corporation may instead opt to increase its authorised capital stock and issue new shares to Philippine stockholders . <p> In effecting an increase of its authorised capital stock , a corporation has several options , which include using deposits for future subscriptions , and converting stockholders ' advances into equity . <p> In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v First Express Pawnshop ( judgment on June 16 2009 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an amount of money which a company receives with the view of applying it as payment for subscription to any future increase of authorised capital stock . That decision also ruled that deposits for future subscription are not subject to the payment of documentary stamp taxes , which it described as " taxes on documents , instruments , loan agreements , and papers evidencing acceptance , assignment , sale or transfer of an obligation , right or property incident thereto " . In essence , a documentary stamp tax is a tax imposed on the transaction rather than on the document . In essence , a documentary stamp tax is a tax imposed on the transaction rather than on the document . <p> Accordingly , documentary stamp taxes may be imposed upon amounts given as deposits for future subscription only when the actual subscription to capital stock has been made . Mere receipt by a corporation of an amount which it has identified as a " deposit for future subscription " does not by itself trigger the application of the tax . In fact , First Express Pawnshop appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to trigger the imposition of documentary stamp taxes . This pronouncement acknowledged that even when a deposit for future subscription is made , " the person making a deposit on stock subscription does not have the standing of a stockholder and he is not entitled to dividends , voting rights or other prerogatives and attributes of a stockholder . There is yet no subscription that creates rights and obligations between the subscriber and the corporation . " <p> First Express Pawnshop reiterated Ruling No. 15-2003 of the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) , issued on November 17 2003 . There , the BIR indicated that before documentary stamp taxes may be imposed upon the amounts deposited as future subscription , actual issuance of stocks must first be made . To facilitate this issuance , the appropriate government authority ( the SEC ) must have approved the increase of the capital stock and a subscription agreement between the depositor-stockholder and the corporation should have been executed . Without these conditions , no issuance of shares can actually be made and , accordingly , documentary stamp taxes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by stockholders to a corporation for the latter 's use may be treated as loans and thus may be subject to documentary stamp taxes . Section 173 of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines imposes documentary stamp taxes upon loan agreements . Section 3(b) of Revenue Regulations No. 9-94 issued by the BIR defines " loan agreements " as " a contract in writing where one of the parties delivers to another money or other consumable thing , upon the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be paid . The term shall include credit facilities which may be evidences by credit memo , advice or drawings . " In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v Filinvest Development Corporation ( judgment on July 19 2011 ) , the Supreme Court held that inter-company advances evidenced by instructional letters and journal and cash vouchers " qualified as loan advances upon which documentary stamp taxes may be imposed . " The Supreme Court partly relied on Section 6 of the BIR 's Revenue Regulations No. 9-94 which provides that " in cases where no formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities , the documentary stamp tax shall be based on the amount of drawings or availment of the facilities , which may be evidenced by credit/debit memo , advice or drawings by any form of cheque or withdrawal slip , under Section 180 of the Tax Code . " The BIR issued Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 48-2011 to direct all BIR officials and employees to assess documentary stamp taxes , when warranted under the circumstances described in Filinvest , in their audit of taxpayers . While the Filinvest case specifically dealt with inter-company advances , there appears to be no reason why the ruling therein would not apply to individual shareholders as the basis for the conclusion " sections 3(b) and 6 of Revenue Regulation No. 9-94 do not distinguish between individual and juridical persons . <p> Despite the Filinvest decision , many questions seem to be left unanswered , particularly in determining the exact date or time of that loan agreement . This is significant because the payment of documentary stamp taxes must be made on or before the fifth day from the close of the month when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1316 and 1933 of the Civil Code , a loan agreement is considered a real contract , which means the delivery of the loan amount is necessary for its perfection . The precise date of perfection of a loan-shareholder advance could be doubtful if a shareholder remits money to the bank account of the company without any prior agreement with , or even prior notice ( such as by way of an inter-company memo ) . As mentioned , the Supreme Court has relied on Revenue Regulation 9-94 which states that the documentary stamp taxes will be based on the amount of drawings or availment of the facilities , which may be evidenced by credit/debit memo , advice or drawings by any form of cheque or withdrawal slip . This seems to mean that in the absence of an inter-company memo , a loan agreement would have been entered into upon the recipient company 's withdrawal of the advances , and in that situation the date of the withdrawal slip is relevant . But , notwithstanding Filinvest , it seems the BIR should examine not only the time of withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9-94 itself defines a loan agreement as a contract in writing where one of the parties delivers to another money or other consumable thing , upon the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality is paid . Therefore , unless the parties clearly intended to enter into a loan agreement ( that is , money remitted by a shareholder to the company was intended and received as a loan/advance ) , the transaction should not be deemed as such . <p> Filinvest was also silent as regards a situation where there is no inter-company memo and the advances to the corporation are made in tranches spanning several months but only a portion of the amount is actually accepted and used by the corporation as an advance . That situation may likewise result in uncertainty as to which amount given by a stockholder the advance corresponds to . Notwithstanding the silence of Filinvest as regards the payment of documentary stamp taxes made in tranches , the ruling by the First Division of the Court of Tax Appeals in Manila Electric Company v Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the issue . In that case , the court stated that documentary stamp taxes are " due and payable at the time the transaction is had or accomplished , i.e. , at the time of the issuance of the document . " There , an Omnibus Loan Agreement was composed of voluminous documents and various securities corresponding to such documents . The court treated each document " although comprising one loan agreement " as separate taxable documents and separate transactions . Thus , it ruled that payment of documentary stamp taxes on each document was proper . The Court of Tax Appeals en banc affirmed the decision of the First Division on September 21 2011 , and ruled that while all documents pertain to one loan , each tranche pertained to a separate transaction and was thus separately subject to the imposition of documentary stamp tax . <p> Following Filinvest and Meralco , where there is no specific inter-company memo , the advances are made by the shareholder in tranches , and the corporation withdraws the advances also in tranches , then each amount withdrawn by the corporation should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the documentary stamp tax due should only be in proportion to the amount withdrawn by the corporation . This also means that that the corresponding documentary stamp tax is due on or before the fifth day from the close of the month when the withdrawal was made ( as evidenced by the date of the withdrawal slip ) . <h> Other considerations <p> If only on the basis of payment of documentary stamp taxes , it appears that using deposits for future subscription is the better option for corporations looking to increase their authorised capital stock . In addition to the fact that documentary stamp taxes need not be paid until such time as the subscription is actually made , the money already deposited may already be used even if the SEC 's approval of the increase of authorised capital stock is pending . As early as December 9 1981 the SEC opined that amounts deposited as additional paid-in capital may be used by the company pending the verification of the increase of the authorised capital stock by the SEC . In practice , however , it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authorised capital stock when the deposits have been used as the SEC would scrutinise the documents of the company to determine whether the deposits have been used solely for purely business operations and every expense has been accounted for or recorded in the books of the company . <p> Companies increasing their authorised capital stock ( whether by way of utilisation of deposits or conversion of advances/liabilities to equity ) should also be aware that the SEC may conduct an on-site verification of their financial records based on SEC Memorandum Circular No. 6 , s. of 2008 , applications for the increase of authorised capital stock . In practice , if the SEC is dissatisfied with the documentation of the company , it may require the company to produce additional documents or even reject the application for increase of authorised capital stock . <p> Following the Supreme Court 's ruling in Teves , companies engaged in partly nationalised activities which have foreign investors will be constrained to reconsider their shareholding structure to comply with the latest interpretation of the term ' capital ' . Increasing their authorised capital stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting shareholders advances into equity or using deposits for future subscription are available options .

Seven years since the onset of the GFC , the more recent collapse of commodity prices , the instability of certain sovereigns ' credit standing and political unrest in certain regions of the world have been contributing factors to the slow pace of the recovery of the project financing market . Despite this challenging and ever evolving environment , 2015 has seen the consolidation of the key trends in the project financing market which emerged post-GFC . Export credit agencies ( ECAs ) and multilateral and development finance institutions ( DFIs ) continue to play a pivotal role not only in plugging funding gaps but also providing structuring expertise to bring deals to market . Alongside traditional lending techniques , the project financing market continues to explore the increased use of project bonds ( noting that predominantly North America and Europe have realised this on any sizeable scale ) .

In addition to plugging funding gaps , ECAs and DFIs are now largely involved in the structuring of transactions in particular where , without their support , projects would not be able to successfully reach financial close due to political or geographical risks or credit standing of host countries . This trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future as ECAs and DFIs continue to evolve and develop intelligent strategies and funding techniques to strategically unlock , leverage and catalyse the flow of private and domestic money into projects . <h> " US government agencies have been critical to the successful financing of many large infrastructure and energy projects " <p> There are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing of large-scale energy and infrastructure projects such as the multi-billion pound Intercity Express Programme in the UK involving the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation 's ( JBIC ) first lending to a UK project alongside the EIB , or the Noor solar projects in Ouarzazate ( Morocco ) where several DFIs and other international institutions are providing funding . <p> In Africa , DFIs have historically been very active in funding strategic projects and projects where international commercial banks ' credit approvals would be difficult to obtain .

These instruments generally take the form of support in direct lending or through debt guarantees allowing the selected projects to benefit from the sovereigns ' credit standing . For example , HM Treasury is involved in the financing of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project in the UK under its UK Guarantees Scheme where it is anticipated that HM Treasury will provide a 2 billion ( $3.1 billion ) guarantee to the bondholders to cover interest and principal under their bonds and therefore wrap certain risks associated with the project . <p> Political and financial support from governments on projects such as Hinkley Point C give rise to a number of specific considerations ( for example state aid ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , a pipeline of nuclear projects " such as the Horizon 's Wylfa and NuGen 's Moorside nuclear power projects " are presently anticipated to be brought to the project financing market and will likely benefit from a certain level of governmental support in line with the national priority to develop sustainable low carbon energy generation . <p> Similarly , US government agencies have been critical to the successful financing of many large infrastructure and energy projects in the US . The US department of transportation 's TIFIA programme loans have been instrumental in the limited recourse financing of large US transportation projects , such as the $950 million in subordinated loans provided to finance the landmark I-4 Ultimate Highway Project in Florida . Equally , the US department of energy 's Loan Guarantee Programme has been active in the energy sector , including providing almost $8.5 billion in loan guarantees to support the financing of the Vogtle advanced nuclear power project in the state of Georgia , with the final guarantee commitments closing in June 2015 . <h> The return of commercial banks <p> The project financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of international commercial banks . As demonstrated by this year 's various project finance league tables , Japanese commercial banks continue to lead the pack , but an increasing number of banks are now more active in the project financing market . Chinese commercial banks , already managing large project portfolios , are extending their reach to Europe on the back of transactions such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project , following their Chinese clients like Japanese banks have successfully been doing for years . International commercial banks have become more familiar with post-crisis new capital adequacy requirements and are now more comfortable with the new landscape . Where long-term tenors remain an issue , short-term financing techniques " such as soft and hard mini-perms " continue to feature on deals leaving the refinancing risk a matter for the post-construction phase . <p> In some jurisdictions such as Turkey or China , strong local commercial banks have access to the liquidity required to finance large-scale energy and infrastructure projects presenting additional options to sponsors looking to invest in those countries . This has been seen on recent projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey which was arranged by a group of leading Turkish banks alongside one international commercial bank . <h> Continued development of project bond solutions <p> The project bond market continues to develop , most notably in North America and Europe . Unwrapped project bond deals are notably on the rise in Europe , attracting pension funds , asset managers and insurers . The M8 motorway project was the first UK roads project involving a project bond since the onset of the GFC . The unwrapped bond solution , however , has only had limited use to date . Investors have historically had little appetite for construction risk and will therefore usually continue to demand credit substitution or enhancement . The EIB 's Project Bond Credit Enhancement ( PBCE ) product first launched in 2012 has now successfully been used on several transactions , including the financing of the A7 motorway PPP in Germany , and more transactions are in the pipeline . <p> In the US , the unique market for ( US federal ) tax exempt bond debt has allowed many transportation projects to be financed with long-term ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to construction and other project risks , underwriters and bond purchasers are comfortable providing long-term bond financing on an unwrapped basis , such as in the case of the $600 million bond financing of the Pennsylvania Rapid Bridge Replacement Project , though partial credit wraps have been used when commercially beneficial , such as in the Goethals Bridge Project and the Portsmouth Bypass Project . Private placement issuances are also now actively considered as a means of financing projects in the US and an alternative to tax exempt bonds , and made up a portion of the financing of the $5.75 billion purchase of the Indiana Toll Road concession . <p> Project bonds may , however , be difficult to implement in a certain number of emerging markets not sufficiently mature or sophisticated to accommodate this alternative way of funding , and remain therefore a credible alternative funding solution in economically developed countries . <h> Equity financing <p> Africa and other emerging markets have seen a higher level of equity investments from funds and other financial investors . Private equity is on the rise . Funds and other investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenfield projects , including in emerging markets . Japanese and Chinese investors are particularly active but are not alone . Dedicated funds are created in Europe and elsewhere to channel investments in Africa and other emerging countries and provide additional sources available to fund energy and infrastructure projects . <h> Refinancing <p> Sponsors ( and sometimes authorities procuring the projects ) continue to seek opportunities for the refinancing of projects which closed in the aftermath of the GFC and with today 's favourable pricing , we expect to continue to see an abundance of projects seeking refinancing . In the UK , recent multi-billion pound refinancings have concluded on the Intercity Express Programme and Thameslink PPP projects and at the time of writing it is noted that several large refinancings are being structured in the oil and gas and utilities sector , particularly in the Middle East . In the US , the senior bank debt on the $1.83 billion Interstate 595 corridor project in Florida , which originally achieved financial close during the GFC , was successfully refinanced with long-term bond debt . <h> Commodity price effect <p> Plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the oil sector . The world 's largest energy companies have ( according to the Financial Times ) shelved $200 billion of spending on new projects in an urgent round of cost-cutting . There has been a knock-on effect for projects earmarked for project finance solutions most notably in the mining and LNG sectors . While most of these projects appear to be delayed rather than cancelled , it remains to be seen whether these projects will be considered economical as we move into 2016 . <p> In the US , the boom in inexpensive natural gas has resulted in a focus on LNG export facilities . A good example is the successful financing of the Freeport LNG $12.5 billion three-train natural gas liquefaction and LNG loading facility project in Texas . <h> A world of opportunities <p> The project financing market is still largely in transition but market players have found ways to adjust to the new dynamic resulting from the global financial crisis . There are opportunities on the market for sponsors seeking to raise funds and financiers willing to build or grow their project portfolios . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post-transition era.

Among the foreign enterprises that have invested in Poland , those from the EU have predominant position ( 87.1% of FDI stock for 2011 ) , which includes investors from the Netherlands ( 15.1% ) , Germany ( 13.5% ) , France ( 12.5% ) and Luxembourg ( 10.4% ) . The most significant investor from outside Europe is the US ( 4.9% ) . According to reports held by the National Bank of Poland , the FDI inflow in 2012 in Poland reached 4,716 million ( $6,338 ) . The majority of the inflow in 2012 came from Germany ( 3,494 million ) and France ( 3,132 million ) . Moreover , the 2,318 corporations registered in Poland at the end of 2011 were controlled by foreign investors mainly from Germany ( 332 ) , Netherlands ( 129 ) and the US ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your jurisdiction which attract , or the government is seeking to attract , FDI ? <p> In the document Programme for supporting investment of major importance to the Polish economy for the years 2011-2020 , the Polish government introduced a strategy to attract foreign investment . The policy regarding FDI concentrates on achieving two specific objectives : to increase the share of innovative , high-tech investment ; and to create highly productive jobs . Therefore , the government supports FDI in particular in the following priority sectors : automotive ; electronics ; aviation ; biotechnology ; modern services ; and research and development . <h> 1.3 Is the government generally supportive of FDI ? Which government , and regional , bodies are responsible for driving FDI in your jurisdiction ? <p> As nearly 90% of the important investments in Poland are made by foreign entities , the government is strongly supportive of FDI . As mentioned above , the Polish government has implemented a long-term strategy which includes supporting business by financial grants and creating special economic areas ( industrial and technology parks and special economic zones ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded the Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency ( PAIiIZ ) . The government also evaluates the condition of FDI in Poland in order to meet entrepreneurs ' expectations . For example , in July 2013 , as a response to business needs , the government extended the special economic zones ' existence from 2020 to 2026 . Besides PAIiIZ , there are no separate bodies responsible for FDI in particular , however , key expertise for FDI is passed onto the state agencies operating as state controlled companies ( such as the Industrial Development Agency ) . <h> 2 Investment vehicle <h> 2.1 What are the most common legal entities and ( pass-through ) vehicles used for FDI in your jurisdiction , and how long do they take to become operational ? <p> The most popular vehicle to operate business in Poland is the limited liability company ( sp z oo ) , as it meets requirements for both small and large scale activities . According to the official statistics , limited liability companies made up approximately 83% of all the companies in Poland in June 2013 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This form of activity is useful , as it enables investors to raise funds with the stock exchange , since only joint-stock companies may become a public company in the Polish jurisdiction . Moreover , some areas of business activity , such as banking or insurance , require a joint-stock company to run the business . <p> It should be noted that entities from countries outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) may only conduct business activity in Poland through the following vehicles : limited partnerships ; limited joint-stock partnerships ; limited liability companies ; or , joint-stock companies . Furthermore , in order to conduct business in Poland , foreign entrepreneurs may establish a branch office or ( only for advertising and promoting purposes ) a representative office . <h> 2.2 What are the key requirements for establishment and operation of these vehicles which are relevant to FDI ? <p> Company formation is very similar for both limited liability companies and joint-stock companies . At first , shareholders sign the bylaws . The bylaws require notarial deed and they should indicate the company 's seat in Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the moment of signing the bylaws the company may operate as an entity known as a company in the process of formation . Subsequently , the company should be registered in the entrepreneurs register of the National Court Register . The registration process includes notification to the relevant tax and social insurance authorities . <p> A company is managed and represented by a board of directors . In a joint-stock company , it is also mandatory to appoint a supervisory board , while in a limited liability company this is optional . There are no restrictions regarding the members ' nationality or residence . <p> Directors must prepare annual reports to be submitted to the National Court Register once a year , and these must generally include a financial report and directors ' report . <h> 3 Investment approval <p> a ) The regulator/s ' name , factors it must consider when making its decisions , and how much discretion it has ; <p> b ) Any investment caps and other legislative restrictions ; <p> c ) Which party must notify and when/if notification is mandatory or voluntary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is the review fee ; <p> e ) How long does the review and approval process take , and are there any fast-track options ; <p> f ) Is there the ability to consult on a named or unnamed basis ; <p> g ) Does notification/review occur pre- or post-closing , and are there any pre- or post filing requirements unique to FDI ; <p> h ) What is the position if no response is received on an application for approval and are there any rights of appeal from disapprovals ? <p> Not applicable in Poland . <h> 3.2 Briefly explain the investment restrictions for any special/restricted sectors . <p> In general , the same rules apply to the domestic , European and other entities in the matter of requirements to meet in order to run a business in certain sectors . Economic freedom is one of the principles stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland ; however , conducting business may be subject to restrictions . <p> Among the areas of activity that are subject to special restrictions , there are the following examples : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on the basis of the real right known as mining usufruct , which may be granted on the basis of an agreement between an entrepreneur and the Minister of Environment . A person who intends to operate a mining undertaking should also obtain a relevant mining permit ( which may be granted after a tender procedure ) and a decision on environmental conditions which specifies the environmental conditions to operate the undertaking . <p> Financial services sector : banking , insurance , financial markets and other financial services are subject to supervision by the Financial Supervisory Authority ( KNF ) . Economic activity in these areas usually requires special permit . The KNF issues a number of regulations and undertakes other legal measures to provide regular operation of the financial market . <p> Energy sector : manufacturing and trading in fuels and energy is subject to the Energy Law Act . The main authority in this area is the Energy Regulatory Office , which is competent for granting licences and monitoring the energy market . Companies intending to conduct business activities in electricity , gaseous fuels , heat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competition matters in Poland " including the merger clearance process " are under the supervision of the president of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection .

Among other typical foreign vehicles to operate in Poland , are UK limited companies , Dutch and Luxembourg companies . <h> 4.2 What are the applicable corporate tax rates ? <p> Poland remains among the most favourable EU countries in respect of the corporate tax rate , and the corporate income tax ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19%. <h> 4.3 Does the government have any FDI tax incentive schemes in place ? <p> The Polish legal system provides several incentives for entrepreneurs . Regarding the tax law area , the two main incentives should be indicated : <p> Income tax exemption : the exemption applies to investors operating in Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) . In order to establish a business in a SEZ , an entrepreneur should obtain a special permission . Receiving state aid requires the investor to meet several conditions , including that business activity and new jobs should be maintained for a specified period . Moreover , the minimum level of investment enabling the use of public aid is 100 000 . <p> Exemption for real property tax : the exemption may be granted by the municipal council as one form of state aid . In general , the level of public aid depends on such factors as costs of investment and the costs of creating new jobs . <h> 4.4 Other than through the tax system , does the government provide any other financial support to FDI investors ? If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers governmental grants . The support may be provided on the basis of an agreement between the minister of economy and the investor . However , the entity that operates the procedure for obtaining financial aid is the Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency . The financial support is offered for significant investments in the area of the specified priority sectors . The investor may also apply for public aid in other sectors if the project 's minimum eligible costs and number of new jobs exceed a specified level . <h> 5 Operating locally <h> 5.1 What is the most common governing law of contracts and local business language ? <p> The local business language is Polish , and the Polish law of contracts is subject to the Civil Code Act of April 23 1964 , which applies to the entire jurisdiction . <h> 5.2 Explain any local content or local participation requirements relevant to foreign investors . <p> There are no particular requirements related to foreign investors in this matter . <h> 5.3 How difficult is it for foreign investors to secure expatriate visas for shareholder representatives and workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member states of the EEA and Switzerland have full right to enter and live in Poland due to the EU free movement of people principle . For foreigners from third party states , entrance and stays in Poland require a visa . <p> A foreigner who wishes to work in Poland is required to obtain a work permit issued by the appropriate regional governor . This rule is subject to several exceptions ( for instance , the citizens of the member states of the EEA may generally work in Poland without obtaining a work permit ) , and simplified procedures are envisaged in certain circumstances , for example , in relation to persons authorised to represent a foreign entrepreneur in their branch or representative office . <p> Whereas Poland , as a European Union member state , is subject to the free movement of capital rule , in general there are no specific restrictions in the area of foreign currency and exchange . <h> 5.5 Does the country prohibit domestic companies from doing business in any foreign jurisdictions ? <p> Polish law does not prohibit domestic companies from operating business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a member of international organisations ( such as the United Nations ) , may be obliged to undertake specific actions such as sanctions and embargoes . Furthermore , foreign trade in some crucial areas may be subject to government control ( goods of strategic importance for national security and the maintenance of international peace and security ) . <h> 6 . Legal and regulatory framework <h> 6.1 Are there any other FDI-specific laws that foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> According to the Act on Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners , there is a general rule that foreigners ( foreign natural persons , foreign legal entities , but also domestic entities controlled by foreigners ) may acquire real estate in Poland or shares in the company owning real estate in Poland , only on the basis of prior permits issued by the minister of foreign affairs . However , with few exceptions , restrictions stipulated by such Act do not apply to entities from the EEA. <h> 6.2 What challenges if any do investors find in getting certainty around local law and regulation ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to economic and political stability , human capital and a large domestic market . In order to increase trust in the legal system , Poland has introduced regulations that allow investors to apply for binding legal interpretations ( including tax issues ) . Those who receive such interpretations may not be punished for conduct complying with the issued interpretation . The government has evaluated possible challenges to foreign investors " detailed information on this matter may be found in the document Obstacles to foreign direct investments in Poland issued by PAIiIZ ( available at the Agency 's website ) . <h> 7 Dispute resolution <h> 7.1 How efficient are local courts ' enforcement and dispute resolution proceedings , and are there any procedural idiosyncrasies foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> There are no specific features of court procedures that could be particularly challenging to foreign investors , and Polish courts ' efficiency is similar to other developed countries . It should be stated however , that Poland remains within the remit of the continental civil-law system , which may not be familiar to entrepreneurs from the common-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> Both arbitration awards and foreign judgments are generally enforceable in Poland ; but enforcement of such rulings requires certification by Polish courts . Polish regulations regarding arbitration implement United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( Uncitral ) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration . As for foreign European rulings enforcement , Poland is subject to the European Union Council ( EC ) Regulation 44/2001 of December 22 2000 , and the Lugano Convention of October 30 2007 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( covering European Union countries , Norway , Switzerland and Iceland ) . Finally , the Polish Code of Civil Procedure provides provisions regarding certifying foreign judgments from states other than those mentioned above . <h> 7.3 Are judgments and arbitration awards from the FDI jurisdiction generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> Polish courts ' judgments are generally enforceable in jurisdictions of other European Union countries , Norway , Switzerland and Iceland , on the basis of the above EC Regulation 44/2001 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries depends on the law of the country of enforcement . For example , there is no international treaty between Poland and the United States regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments in commercial matters , so in such cases the US law applies . <p> Founding and managing partner of Drzewiecki Tomaszek &amp; Partners , Zbigniew Drzewiecki specialises in dispute resolution , real estate and capital markets . He has been a recommended lawyer in real-estate law according to the rankings of Rzeczpospolita ( a leading Polish newspaper ) in the years 2007-2012 , in the rankings of the Polish edition of Forbes Magazine for the years 2010 and 2011 , and in Chambers Europe 2012 .

How long is the deal open to competing bids ? <p> This depends on whether the acquisition is effected by way of open market transactions or tender offers . <p> If the acquisition is effected through open market transactions , the timeline would primarily depend on the trading activity of the concerned share ( the availability of shares offered for sale ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effected relatively quickly . <p> If the acquisition is effected by way of a tender offer , the offer must be valid for at least 10 Egyptian Exchange ( EGX ) trading days ( EGX days ) and no more than 30 EGX days .

Acquisition of shares in companies in certain industries requires the written approval of the relevant regulator . <h> Section 8 : ANTI-CORRUPTION REGIMES <h> 8.1 What is the applicable anti-corruption legislation in your jurisdiction ? <p> There is no standalone anti-corruption legislation in Egypt .

The paper sets out the proposed changes to , and clarifications of , the detailed procedures that CIFs must follow to fulfil their obligations to safeguard clients ' funds . The consultation period ran until November 18 2016 ; the new guidance is expected to be issued early in 2017 . <p> Article 18(2) ( j ) of the Investment Services and Activities and Regulated Markets Law of 2007 , as amended , provides that : a CIF must , when holding funds belonging to clients , make adequate arrangements to safeguard the clients ' rights and , except in the case of credit institutions , prevent the use of client funds for its own account .

With the alternative funds market becoming more active , the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) proposed certain amendments to the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act ( FSCMA ) on April 24 2014 , which became effective on October 25 2015 ( FSCMA Amendments ) . The FSCMA Amendments , as well as other relevant changes , were intended to restructure the private funds regime in accordance with the Korean government 's policy to create a more dynamic capital market by stimulating the activities of private funds and allowing more flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate growth in the private fund sector . <h> Overview of Korea 's asset management regime and recent changes <p> The primary statute governing the investment management business in Korea is the FSCMA and its subordinate regulations . The FSCMA generally governs both domestic funds and offshore funds whose interests are offered and sold in Korea ( the regulations broadly categorise funds as either domestic funds or offshore funds depending on whether they were established in Korea or in an offshore jurisdiction ) . <p> The primary regulatory authorities are the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service ( FSS ) . The FSC is the umbrella regulatory agency responsible for the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry ( including investment management businesses ) . The FSS is the executive arm of the FSC ( with independent and separate governance ) and is responsible for the day-to-day supervision and regulation of the financial sector . <p> Under the FSCMA , Korea-domiciled collective investment schemes ( i.e. funds ) may only be established and managed by licensed Korean asset management companies ( which include foreign-owned companies ) and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prior to the FSCMA Amendments , the same license was required in order to establish and manage domestic funds ( the threshold requirements for capital , personnel , etc. , would depend on the scope of the licensing being sought ) irrespective of whether the intention was limited to managing only private funds . As discussed below , the FSCMA Amendments seek to regulate public fund and private fund businesses as more distinct businesses . With the goal of simplifying the regulatory framework of the domestic private funds market , the existing regulations were overhauled to provide for more flexibility in not only being able to set up as an asset management company that establishes and manages Korean private funds , but also to provide greater flexibility in the actual management of the domestic private fund . While the actual effect of these changes to the market would need to be judged over time , the Korean government is hoping that these changes will promote growth to the industry while also providing investors with more diverse products . <h> Classification of private funds <p> Under the previous regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hedge funds , private equity funds and financial stabilisation private equity funds ) and , depending on the type of fund , different rules would apply . The FSCMA Amendments reduce the types of private funds to two types : private equity funds ( i.e. funds established with the purpose of investing in , and having some degree of control over , the investee company ) and hedge funds ( the reference to hedge funds means all other private funds that are not regarded as private equity funds ) . <p> Moreover , the FSCMA Amendments abolished the previous classification system that applied to general private funds requiring the fund to be classified as either a securities-type fund , real estate-type fund , mixed asset fund or special asset fund . Under this classification system , a fund was subject to certain investment requirements depending on its classification ( for example , a securities-type fund must hold at least 50% of its assets in securities investments ) . With the abolishment of this classification system , fund managers are now given maximum discretion in managing the assets of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints imposed under the previous classification system . <p> In some sense , these changes can be viewed as placing more focus on the promotion of the market at the expense of investor protection directives . However , there is an expectation that the investment managers will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny and accountability as a result of the expansion of its fund management capabilities . Thus , while Korean hedge fund managers will be able to enjoy more autonomy and flexibility in managing the assets of private funds , they may ultimately be subject to sterner penalties for violation of regulations and fiduciary obligations . <h> Hedge fund company <p> Prior to the FSCMA Amendments , in order to create and manage a domestic fund ( whether a public fund or private fund ) a licence had to be obtained from the FSC and the FSC had discretion in granting such licenses to eligible applicants . In other words , even if the applicant was qualified to obtain the fund management licence , the FSC , as a matter of policy , could refuse to issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracting more qualified and experienced fund managers to the industry ( including foreign fund managers ) , the FSCMA Amendments changed the previous licensing system to a registration system in respect to entities that are looking to establish and manage private hedge funds . By moving this hedge fund business to a registration system , in theory , any applicant that satisfies the eligibility requirements should be approved for registration . <p> Furthermore , the FSCMA Amendments relax the substantive eligibility requirements for registering as a hedge fund asset manager ( as compared to the eligibility requirements applicable to the asset management company licence for the establishment and management of public funds ) . Under the FSCMA Amendments it is now possible for a foreign asset manager to set up a Korean hedge fund management company with less capital ( from ? 6 billion to ? 2 billion ) and staffing ( from five standing investment management experts to three ) . Also , some of the eligibility requirements imposed on the largest shareholder of a general asset management company do not apply to the largest shareholder of this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation that the changes and relaxation to the entry requirements and process will encourage more foreign fund managers to set up local hedge fund management companies in Korea , which in turn can result in a more dynamic and diverse local market . <h> Marketing of offshore funds <p> While the FSCMA Amendments focus on restructuring Korea 's private fund regime , there is also a notable change applicable to offshore funds that may reduce the cost and burden to offshore fund managers seeking to raise Korean institutional capital . <p> In respect of offshore funds , the FSCMA requires that offshore funds be registered with the FSC . If the target investors will be limited to ' qualified professional investors ' as defined under the regulations , a simplified registration process is available to the offshore fund . Separately from such product registration requirement , the marketing of the interest in such funds is a regulated activity and is required to be done through a local financial institution that is licensed to market and sell fund products ( Korean Distributor ) . In other words , legally speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prospective Korean investors . <p> While most Korean qualified professional investors are generally permitted to directly acquire the interest in the offshore fund , many Korean investors do prefer to make indirect investments through a Korean feeder fund established by a Korean asset management company . There may be various reasons for this preference ( including the convenience in dealing in the local language , investing in Korean Won assets , etc . ) . Prior to the FSCMA Amendments , even if the offshore fund was marketed and sold only through a Korean feeder fund , the offshore fund was still required to appoint its own Korean Distributor ( and the Korean asset management company would also appoint a Korean Distributor for the offer and sale of the Korean feeder fund to the end investor ) . <p> Under the FSCMA Amendments , where the interest in the offshore fund will be sold to only a Korean feeder fund , and not directly to the end Korean investor , the offshore fund is no longer required to appoint its Korean Distributor . Thus , it removes the redundancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be noted , however , that this does not necessarily mean that the offshore fund manager is free to market its product to the end investor without restriction . Rather , the marketing of the offshore fund should be limited to the Korean asset manager , and the Korean asset manager in turn should market the Korean feeder fund to the end investor ( through its Korean Distributor ) . <p> He joined the firm in 2000 and his practice is focused on advising multinational and Korean financial institutions and corporations in a wide range of cross-border and domestic transactions , including investment management , private equity and structured finance .

@@8538293 @1738293/ <h> Section 1 : PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES <h> 1.1 What reorganisation and insolvency processes are available for debtors in your jurisdiction ? <p> Under the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Law ( DRBL ) , there are two main proceedings for the insolvency of business entities : ( i ) Chapter 2 rehabilitation proceedings , which are primarily for the rehabilitation of insolvent business entities ; and , ( ii ) Chapter 3 bankruptcy proceedings , which are for the liquidation of insolvent business entities . <p> Korea offers another insolvency-related law called the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Law ( CRPL ) . The workout proceedings under the CRPL allow for the rescheduling of debts under out-of-court workout arrangements . The CRPL was recently amended to cover all creditors with financial claims against the debtor company , including foreign creditors holding financial claims and non-financial institutions holding claims that may be classified as financial claims . <h> 1.2 Is a stay on creditor enforcement action available ? <p> Yes , though such a stay is not automatic in cases where a petition is filed with respect to a debtor company for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition and before the commencement of any such proceedings , the court may grant a specific or comprehensive stay order . Following the commencement of rehabilitation proceedings , unsecured and secured rehabilitation claims are stayed , while common benefit claims are payable when due . Once bankruptcy proceedings have begun , unsecured creditors are stayed from enforcement , while secured creditors may enforce their securities at any time . <p> In a workout process under the CRPL , the creditors ' committee determines whether to grant a grace period for the exercising of claims , including secured claims . The grace period may not exceed one month ( or three months if it is deemed necessary by the financial creditors to conduct due diligence on the debtor 's assets and liabilities ) , but may be extended by a period not exceeding one month , as decided by the committee . However , creditors who hold non-financial claims can freely exercise their rights . <h> 1.3 How could the reorganisation and/or insolvency processes available in your jurisdiction be used to implement a reorganisation plan ? <p> Once the rehabilitation proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . A rehabilitation plan may call for the rescheduling of the debtor 's debt over a period not to exceed , in principle , 10 years , except when corporate debentures are issued under the rehabilitation plan . Once it has been prepared , the interested parties vote on the draft rehabilitation plan . The plan must be approved by unsecured creditors representing two-thirds of the debtor company 's unsecured debt and by secured creditors representing three-quarters of the debtor company 's secured debt . If the debtor company 's total assets exceed its liabilities , a majority of the debtor company 's shareholders must also approve the rehabilitation plan . If the plan is approved by the creditors , and if necessary , the shareholders , the plan will be referred to the court for approval . Any secured rehabilitation claims and unsecured rehabilitation claims which were not recognised under the court-approved rehabilitation plan would be irrevocably extinguished even if the rehabilitation proceedings were subsequently terminated . <p> In the case of a workout under the CRPL , the prime bank of a debtor company may or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of the total amount of financial claims held by such creditors ) must , call a meeting of the creditors ' council by sending out a written notice regarding the first meeting . The creditors ' council may approve a plan for rehabilitation of the debtor company and enter into an agreement with the debtor company for implementation of a rehabilitation plan . For this purpose , the creditors ' council may adopt a debt restructuring plan and/or assistance with new credit with the approval of : ( i ) at least three-quarters of the total amount of claims held by all creditors holding unsecured financial claims ; and , ( ii ) at least three-quarters of the total amount of the secured claims held by all creditors holding secured financial claims . <h> 1.4 How can a creditor or a class of creditors be crammed-down ? <p> There is no cram-down procedure in the rehabilitation proceedings per se by which secured creditors can legally force the junior claim-holders ( that is , unsecured creditors and shareholders ) to accept the terms of the proposed rehabilitation plan approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups do not approve the rehabilitation plan , the court may approve the plan by modifying it to prescribe additional terms which protect the rights of the group of creditors that did not vote in favour of the plan . <p> The CRPL does not provide for a cram-down mechanism . However , the creditors holding financial claims who opposed the restructuring under the CRPL are authorised to demand that the creditors ' committee buy their claims . If the opposing creditors do not exercise that demand , they will be bound by the restructuring plan . <h> 1.5 Is there a process for facilitating the sale of a distressed debtor 's assets or business ? <p> In the case of rehabilitation proceedings , the court-appointed receiver has the power to dispose of the debtor 's assets as part of the restructuring , though any asset sales usually require approval of the court . Purchasers who purchase any assets sold by the receiver generally receive good title , free and clear of claims . Creditors are generally permitted to credit bid in such sales subject to the court approval for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitation plan . <p> In the case of bankruptcy proceedings , the court-appointed trustee has the power to dispose of the debtor 's assets under the supervision of the court . This is done mainly through public auction . Purchasers who purchase any assets sold by the trustee generally receive good title , free and clear of claims . Creditors are generally permitted to credit bid in these sales . It is also possible for the trustee to dispose of the asset through a private contract as long as the process is transparent and the price is reasonable . <p> In the case of a workout under the CRPL , the prime bank submits a plan for the business normalisation of the company for discussion and approval by the creditors ' committee . The plan may also include sales of assets and other similar restructuring measures . <h> 1.6 What are the duties of directors of a company in financial difficulty ? <p> Directors owe a fiduciary duty to their company under the Commercial Code . If the directors act in contravention of the requirements of law , government regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they neglect to perform their duties , they will be jointly and severally liable for damages incurred by the company as a result . A breach of fiduciary duty can also potentially raise a criminal law issue under Korean law . <p> If a company is financially distressed and continuing business without obtaining court protection to an extent that would only increase the company 's losses , in compliance with their fiduciary duty , the directors can take measures to protect the company . There is , however , no case precedent to date where the directors ' failure to apply for bankruptcy or rehabilitation proceedings has actually been deemed to be a breach of their fiduciary duty to the company . <h> 1.7 How can any of a debtor 's transactions be challenged on insolvency ? <p> Before the onset of formal insolvency proceedings , under article 406 of the Korean Civil Code , a creditor of a company may apply to the court for the cancellation and restitution of any legal act as a fraudulent conveyance if : ( i ) that act is detrimental to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and the counterparty of the act had knowledge that the act would be detrimental to the company 's creditors . A transaction is deemed detrimental to creditors if the company becomes insolvent due to the relevant transaction , or if the company was already insolvent at the time of the relevant transaction , or if the financial condition of the insolvent company worsens due to the transaction . <p> Certain transactions entered into by a debtor may also be challenged after the debtor enters into formal insolvency proceedings on the grounds that preferential treatment of certain creditors by a debtor may be a basis for avoidance under Korean insolvency law . In this regard , the DRBL allows a trustee ( in the case of bankruptcy proceedings ) or a receiver ( in the case of rehabilitation proceedings ) of the insolvent debtor to prevent certain legal acts by the insolvent debtor from taking place before commencement of the insolvency proceedings . These avoidable acts include , among other things : ( i ) acts that would harm other creditors at the time the acts took place , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other creditors ; or , ( ii ) acts that repay debt or provide collateral after or within 60 days before a suspension of payment or the filing of insolvency proceedings ( collectively , the insolvency event ) when the insolvent debtor was not obliged to do so at that time , provided that the payee or secured party was aware that the insolvency event had occurred or that the acts would prejudice the equal treatment of the insolvent party 's creditors ; and so on . <h> 1.8 What priority claims are there and is protection available for post-petition credit ? <p> In rehabilitation proceedings , common benefit claims have priority and are payable when due . They include : new borrowing that was approved by the court after the commencement of the proceedings ; administration expenses ; tax claims which arose after the commencement of the rehabilitation proceedings ; employee salaries and severance pay ; and , disaster and accident compensation . In workout proceedings under the CRPL , creditors who hold non-financial claims are not bound by the workout and can exercise their claims as normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitation proceedings , any related claim would be regarded as a common benefit claim payable when due . A new injection can be secured by the assets of the company , if the company still has any unencumbered assets . The receiver must obtain advance court approval for new borrowing or for granting any security . <p> In the case of a workout under the CRPL , super-priority is not necessarily accorded to new loans . Creditors willing to provide new funding may ask for security , however distressed companies often do not have many assets left with meaningful security value . New loans , if extended , are provided by creditor banks which participate in the out-of-court restructuring in proportion to their claim amounts . <h> 1.9 Is there a different regime for credit institutions and investment firms ? <p> No . The treatment of credit institutions and investment firms depends mainly on the type of their investment ( for example , secured credit , unsecured credit , equity investment , and so on ) and whether it is bound by the relevant proceedings .

Theoretically , rehabilitation proceedings might also be possible if the foreign debtor company had business in Korea . Further , under the DRBL , it is possible for domestic insolvency proceedings ( either rehabilitation or bankruptcy proceedings ) to be commenced against the debtor separately or in parallel with the foreign insolvency proceedings recognised in Korea , under a petition by the debtor , a creditor , or any other qualified interested party . <h> 2.2 Can recognition and assistance be given to foreign insolvency or reorganisation proceedings ? <p> Yes . Articles 630 and 631 of the DRBL provide that the petition for the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings can be made by a representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised if there is sufficient evidence of those proceedings having duly taken place , and the recognition of those proceedings would not have an adverse effect on public order in Korea . <p> The recognition decision of the court is merely a basis for subsequently granting relief orders . Therefore , the foreign insolvency proceedings would affect Korean business and assets only through relief orders issued by a Korean court upon the petition by an interested party ( including the representative of the foreign insolvency proceedings ) or at its discretion . The cross-border insolvency receiver appointed by the relief order of the Korean court will have the exclusive authority and power to control and dispose of the debtor 's business and assets in Korea ( including the transfer of assets to a foreign country , disposition of assets and distribution ) , subject to the approval of the Korean court . <h> Section 3 : OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What other major stakeholders ( such as governmental or regulatory institutions ) could have a material impact on the outcome of the reorganisation ? <p> The Korean government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wholly state-owned policy bank , provides credit to various domestic companies and often takes the lead in facilitating the normalisation of larger troubled companies through a private workout process or the workout process under the CRPL . <h> Section 4 : CURRENT TRENDS <p> The filing of bankruptcy and rehabilitation proceedings by corporations in Korea has continued to increase in recent years .

All these acts have now been replaced by one single act that applies to all financial institutions on a cross-sector basis : the Act on Financial Supervision ( Wet op het financieel toezicht , or the WFT ) .

The CCA prohibits mergers that would ( or are likely to ) have the effect of substantially lessening competition . <p> The ACCC 's informal clearance process enables merger parties to seek the ACCC 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger from proceeding . The ACCC encourages merger parties to notify the ACCC where : the products of the merger parties are either substitutes or complements ; and the merged firm will have a post-merger market share of greater than 20% in the relevant market/s . <p> Pre-notification to the ACCC of mergers or acquisitions is not compulsory under the CCA . However , as non-compliance with the CCA attracts severe penalties , parties normally seek an informal clearance as a matter of course before completing a transaction . <h> 4 . Tax and grants <h> 4.1 Are there tax structures and/or favourable intermediary tax jurisdictions that are particularly useful for FDI into the country ? <p> As a general rule , there are no specific structures or intermediary jurisdictions that are particularly favourable for FDI . <p> Foreign investors may conduct business through an Australian branch rather than an incorporated subsidiary to consolidate the financial results of the company in the foreign jurisdiction . Australian subsidiaries of foreign companies may consolidate under the foreign parent . <p> Transactions between consolidated group companies are ignored for tax purposes and losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited partnerships are exempt from capital gains tax ( CGT ) subject to conditions . They are taxed at the partner level as flow-through entities . A partner 's share of income derived from an eligible venture capital investment is exempt , as is the gain made on disposal of an eligible venture capital investment . <p> The investment manager regime ( IMR ) ensures that certain investment income and gains of qualifying widely-held foreign funds that operate through an Australian financial intermediary are tax exempt . The exemptions are extended to foreign beneficiaries and partners of IMR foreign funds . <p> Disposals of non-land Australian assets by non-residents are not subject to CGT . ' Land ' includes interests in entities principally deriving their value from land , where a non-portfolio ( greater than 10% ) interest is held . <h> 4.2 What are the applicable corporate tax rates ? <p> 30% <h> 4.3 Does the government have any FDI tax incentive schemes in place ? <p> Immediate deductions are available for expenditure on mining and petroleum exploration , or income-producing activity with environmental protection as its sole or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forestry managed investment schemes . <p> Concessions and averaging offsets are available to primary producers , levelling the tax liability resulting from fluctuating yearly incomes . <p> Research and development expenditure , and investment in Australian films and television , attract tax offsets . <p> Interest withholding tax is not payable on loans from offshore banking units . <h> 4.4 Other than through the tax system , does the government provide any other financial support to FDI investors ? <p> The Government primarily encourages FDI through the establishment of Austrade ( see answer to 1.3 ) . Some state and territory governments encourage FDI through state agreements , which historically were directed at facilitating project approvals rather than financial assistance . Although less common now , it is worthwhile for investors to discuss these with relevant governments . <h> 5 Operating locally <h> 5.1 What is the most common governing law of contracts and local business language ? <p> Most contracts are governed by the law applying in the relevant Australian state or territory .

This visa enables a person to work in Australia for up to four years and must be paid at least the minimum entitlements that an equivalent Australian worker would receive for performing the same role . Companies seeking to utilise this visa must satisfy the Department that there is a lack of suitably qualified workers within Australia to perform the role . <h> 6 . Legal and regulatory framework <h> 6.1 Are there any other FDI-specific laws that foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> See answer to 3 above . <h> 6.2 What challenges if any do investors find in getting certainty around local law and regulation ? <p> Generally speaking , Australian law is well understood and generally consistently applied through courts .

Dispute resolution <h> 7.1 How efficient are local courts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural idiosyncrasies foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> Australia has both federal and state jurisdictions , with the appropriate forum dictated largely by the subject matter of the dispute . In each jurisdiction , the relevant case management rules ensure that cases run as efficiently as possible . Superior courts in Australia publish statistics in relation to efficiency and performance standards . For example , the Federal Court of Australia completes 92% of cases within 18 months . <p> A judgment creditor is generally able to enforce a judgment through a range of statutory procedures , including the seizure and sale of assets . A judgment debt may also form the basis of a statutory demand under the Corporations Act which , if unpaid , may allow insolvency proceedings to be brought against a corporate debtor. <h> 7.2 Do the courts of the FDI jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ( New York Convention ) and the Model Law on International Commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( UNCITRAL Model Law ) . <p> International arbitration awards made in a foreign jurisdiction are enforceable at the federal level in accordance with the provisions of the International Arbitration Act 1974 ( Cth ) , while domestic arbitration awards made in Australia are enforceable at the state and territory level according to the Commercial Arbitration Act applicable in that jurisdiction . <p> The judgments of certain foreign countries ' courts can be enforced in Australia by registration under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 ( Cth ) without the need for fresh proceedings . Generally this process is available only with respect to money judgments from countries with which Australia has reciprocal enforcement arrangements . Certain foreign judgments may also be enforceable in Australia at common law . <h> 7.3 Are judgments and arbitration awards from the FDI jurisdiction generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> Enforcement of arbitration awards made in Australia can generally be expected in those jurisdictions that are signatories to the New York Convention and/or the UNCITRAL Model Law . The enforcement of judgments of Australian courts can be expected in those jurisdictions with which Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see above ) . Otherwise , whether an Australian judgment is enforceable in a particular foreign jurisdiction will depend on the local laws of that jurisdiction . <p> His relevant experience includes representing Agrium in its A$1.3 billion acquisition of AWB Limited by scheme of arrangement .

The 1987 and 1992 ISDA Master Agreements are among the most regularly encountered master agreements , as are the Convention-Cadre AFB relative aux OpTrations de MarchT a Terme or the ( German ) master agreement for financial forward transactions ( Rahmenvertrag fnr FinanztermingeschSfte ) . These contracts generally provide that the individual transactions entered into under the master agreements are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The purpose of the contracts is the reduction of the amounts to be transferred and , thereby , the risks . In addition , whenever they are recognized by the supervisory authorities , they can lead to a lowering of capital-adequacy requirements . <p> Set out below are details of the conditions under which netting agreements are recognized from a supervisory law perspective and thus can be taken account of , in particular , in computing capital-adequacy requirements . After a brief presentation of the key legal bases for netting under Swiss law and an overview of the particularities of Swiss banking supervision , this article primarily highlights the role of the Netting Group of the Bank Audit Committee of the Swiss Institute of Certified Accountants and Tax Consultants ( Netting Group ) and its statements of opinion on the issue of recognizing netting arrangements pursuant to Article 12f of the Federal Banking Ordinance . <p> BASES FOR NETTING IN SWISS LAW <p> Article 12f of the Federal Banking Ordinance <p> As a result of the complete overhaul of provisions of the Federal Banking Ordinance of December 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12f BankO introduced a set of rules covering netting which are modeled , to a large degree , on the Amended Capital Accord of July 1994 of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision as well as the Proposal of April 27 1994 for the Directive 96/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 21 1996 amending Directive 89/647/EEC as regards recognition of contractual netting by the competent authorities . <p> Enforceability of close-out netting under Swiss law <p> In practice , close-out netting is the most predominant . For the Netting Group , it is primarily a question of whether , in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty , a netting agreement is recognized and is legally enforceable in accordance with pertinent insolvency regulations . <p> Under bankruptcy the debtor loses the capacity to dispose of its assets but all contracts they enter into prior to commencement of bankruptcy proceedings continue , in principle , to be valid . In the case of bilateral agreements which , at the time of commencement of bankruptcy proceedings , had not been executed or only executed in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 211 paragraph 2 of the Federal Law on Bankruptcy and Debt Enforcement , to execute performance in lieu of the debtor . <p> Already prior to the revision of Federal Law on Bankruptcy and Debt Enforcement of December 16 1994 ( which became law on January 1 1997 ) , the validity and enforceability of contract termination agreements as contained in customary master agreements recognized internationally had been investigated by Dieter Zobl and Thomas Werlen and had been deemed admissible under all possible interpretations of Article 211 paragraph 2 ( cf in particular Dieter Zobl/Thomas Werlen , " Rechtsprobleme des bilateralen Netting " , Zurich 1994 , same authors , " 1992 ISDA Master Agreements unter besonderer Berncksichtigung der SwapgeschSfte " , Zurich 1995 ) . <p> Since the revision , the right of option of the receiver as set out in the newly introduced Article 211 paragraph 2bis of the Federal Law on Bankruptcy and Debt Enforcement is expressly excluded in the case of firm deals , financial forward transactions , swap and option transactions insofar as , at the time of commencement of bankruptcy proceedings , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a market or stock-exchange price . The receiver and contracting party each have the right to claim the difference between the agreed value of the contractual consideration and its market value as at the time of commencement of bankruptcy proceedings . <p> SUPERVISORY SYSTEM IN SWITZERLAND <p> Federal Banking Commission <p> The supervision of banks , as well as securities dealers and investment funds is the responsibility of the Federal Banking Commission ( FBC ) . The latter consists of a commission comprising seven to eleven members who must be specialist and also fulfill certain independence requirements , as well as a secretariat . The task of the secretariat is the monitoring of compliance with the supervisory laws . It conducts all administrative proceedings and , in case of need , may itself make inquiries with persons subject to duties by virtue of a lex specialist . At the present time the Commission consists of seven members and the secretariat , which at the end of 1998 employed some 70 staff with specialist knowledge . Although reporting administratively to the Federal Department of Finance , its areas of responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aegis . It is independent of both the Federal Council and the Swiss National Bank , and fulfills its functions unbound by instructions . Nevertheless , it must submit an annual report to the Federal Council . The members of the Commission -- excepting its chairman -- have other positions and they meet on average once a month . <p> Banking-law audit firms <p> The Swiss model of banking supervision is peculiar in that the FBC is responsible " only " for overall supervision . Direct supervision , ie direct control and auditing activities are effected principally through the use of audit firms . These constitute , so to speak , the extended arm of the FBC . The audit firms thus find themselves in an interesting dual role in that , on the one hand , they must fulfill their responsibilities in relation to their mandate under civil law and , on the other hand , fulfill their legal duties which may be equated to an official function . In fulfilling its supervisory tasks the FBC is dependent on the audit firms to a very large degree . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the audit firms are important as well as the detailed annual audit reports to be submitted to the FBC by each audit firm for each of the institutions supervised by it . <p> Netting Group <p> As part of their duties audit firms must verify , among other things , compliance by banks with the capital adequacy requirements . In doing so , they must also be satisfied that , from a supervisory law point of view , the prerequisites set out in Article 12f BankO for the recognition of close-out netting are met and that the netting agreements are valid in relation to their recognition and enforceability in the relevant jurisdictions . To assure a uniform approach to issues relating to the recognition of netting agreements and to avoid duplicate investigations , the FBC proposed close cooperation among the audit firms and the banks . Business and banking secrecy are not violated by such an approach as it concerns only the assessment of purely legal issues . <p> As a result , the Netting Group came into being in 1995 comprising representatives of both the Swiss Institute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 and at annual intervals , the Netting Group has issued its " statement of opinion addressed to Banking-Law audit firms concerning the recognition of netting as set out in Article 12f BankO " . A French translation of the opinion statement is available from the Swiss Bankers ' Association ( SBA ) . No English translation exists . <p> OPINION OF THE NETTING GROUP <p> International minimum standards <p> In principle , in accordance with the Recommendations of the Basle Committee as well as with the EU Directive , banks must be able to demonstrate to their national supervisory authorities that they possess the following : <p> a netting agreement with the counterparty , as a result of which a standardized contractual relationship is created covering all transactions included therein in such a manner that in the event of a counterparty failing to settle as a consequence of insolvency , bankruptcy , liquidation or a similar occurrence , the bank is entitled to receive , or obligated to pay , only the balance of the positive or negative market values , respectively , of the transactions covered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred that , should the agreement be challenged , the competent courts and administrative authorities would rule that the open positions of a bank are to be computed on such a net basis in accordance with the laws of all the countries involved . <p> Implementation within Switzerland <p> General <p> The Netting Group , in adapting these international minimum standards to Swiss circumstances , issues statements of opinion as to the recognition and enforceability of those netting agreements and jurisdictions in respect of which the Netting Working Group of the Commission for Financial Reporting of the Swiss Bankers ' Association submits to it expert opinions . <p> In doing so , it limits itself to assessing the recognition and enforceability of close-out agreements in accordance with the law of various countries . Furthermore , it does not opine on possible further prerequisites of validity which must be heeded depending on the applicable law ( eg written form as prerequisites of validity , capacity of the parties to act etc ) . As in any other contract , attention to such matters is incumbent on the parties themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the banking-law audit firms . <p> In the absence of detailed knowledge of foreign legal systems it can not be the task of the Netting Group in a particular case to draw legal conclusions from the opinions rendered . Rather , it assesses the expert opinions in relation to the question posed , the validity and consistency of the reasoning , the clarity of the conclusion and the reputation of the expert . The examination of the expert opinion seeks only to find out whether it may be assumed with adequate certainty , from a supervisory law point of view , that the netting agreements in question are recognized and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions . <p> The Netting Group , as a general rule , reviews its statements of opinion annually on the basis of the expert confirmations to be submitted to it on a timely basis concerning the current relevance of the expert opinions and/or of the updated expert opinions . If a review is not conducted because , for instance , no expert confirmations or no updated expert opinions are submitted , the statement of opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . <p> Importance of the opinion of the netting group <p> A statement of opinion of the Netting Group is not an indispensable prerequisite for the recognition , from a supervisory law perspective , of netting agreements by the banking-law audit firms . The Netting Group came into existence only to assure a uniform practice and the conduct of as rational investigations as possible in relation to the recognition of close-out netting . Rather , the banking-law audit firms are free to examine further netting agreements on the basis of expert opinions submitted to them and to recognize the netting in case they conclude positively . <p> For instance , it may happen that netting agreements have been amended or expanded to result in a material amendment to the ( close-out ) netting provisions or to include products not covered by the standard netting agreements . Such amended agreements are to be subjected to a special review . As a precondition for such a special review , banks must submit corresponding expert opinions to the audit firms . <p> Despite the existence of a positive statement of opinion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which bear ultimate responsibility , have the absolute liberty to refuse recognition for a netting agreement , in particular if additional circumstances or the overall assessment of the situation makes this appear to be the appropriate thing to do . <p> Status of recognition of netting agreements in Switzerland from supervisory law perspective <p> In accordance with the latest version of the Opinion of the Netting Group ( December 1999 ) , the recognition of close-out netting extends to the following master agreements : <p> the 1987 and 1992 ISDA Master Agreements , provided they are concluded between a bank with seat in Switzerland and a counterparty in one of the jurisdictions listed in Table 2 . The ISDA Master Agreements have to be subject to the laws of New York or England ; <p> the Swiss Master Agreement for over-the-counter ( OTC ) Derivatives , 1994 version , provided it is concluded between parties with seat in Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law ; <p> the Convention-Cadre AFB relative aux OpTrations de MarchT a Terme , 1994 version , provided it is concluded between a party with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is subject to French law ; and <p> the ( German ) Rahmenvertrag fnr FinanztermingeschSfte , June 1994 version , provided it is concluded between a party with seat in Switzerland and a party with seat in Germany and is subject to German law . <p> It is important to know that the statements of opinion contain reservations in part . Thus , it can not be demonstrated with the necessary degree of certainty that in all jurisdictions the termination of a contract is recognized as of a time other than the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings . In this manner , the possibility of " optional early termination " , as foreseen in the 1992 ISDA Master Agreements , ie the possibility of the solvent counterparty terminating the contract and determining the time of cancellation in the event of the insolvency of the other counterparty , can not be recognized , from the supervisory law point of view , in all jurisdictions reviewed . Also , reservations are to be noted in part in relation to the counterparties and inclusion of individual derivative products . <p> INPIDUAL QUESTIONS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It is conspicuous that , in accordance with Article 12f BankO , netting agreements must be " demonstrably recognized and enforceable " which may point to a stricter benchmark than is applied in other legal systems . Thus , in accordance with the Recommendations of the Basle Committee , it must be clear from the expert opinions that , in the event of any contestation , " it would be decided by the competent authorities that the open positions of a bank are to be computed on such a net basis ... " . The Federal Reserve Board demands in a relevant Guideline " a high degree of certainty that the netting contract will survive a legal challenge in any applicable jurisdiction " . For the Bank of England the prerequisites for the supervisory recognition of netting are not fulfilled whenever " material doubts as to the enforceability of the agreement " exist . In agreement with the Federal Banking Commission , Article 12f BankO is interpreted to the effect that an in-depth review of serious expert opinions may not leave open any reasonable doubt as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This against the backdrop of the consideration that the Swiss authorities do not wish to impose any higher requirements on netting than the G-10 countries . <p> Inclusion of branches <p> Depending on the master agreement , the parties thereto may designate the branches and also the transactions with the counterparty and with the counterparty 's branches to be covered by the master agreement ( so-called multi-branch netting ) . Although particularly the expert opinions commissioned by ISDA take position on individual questions of multi-branch netting , the Netting Group has decided in favour of a differentiated approach in relation to the inclusion of branches . <p> It differentiates between the following forms of " branch netting " : <p> Single branch netting , in which case the amounts receivable can only be offset against each other if they arise from transactions concluded between a party with a registered office in Switzerland or one of its branches which is covered by the netting agreement and a party with a registered office abroad or one of its branches which is covered by the netting agreement in a netting country ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the close-out netting is in principle recognized and enforceable ) . <p> Passive multi-branch nettingincluding all of its branches covered by the netting agreement and the foreign registered office of the counterparty or one of the branches in a netting country covered by the netting agreement . <p> Active multi-branch netting , in which case the amounts receivable can only be offset against each other if they arise from transactions concluded between a party with a registered office in Switzerland , including all of its branches covered by the netting agreement and the foreign registered office of the counterparty , including its branches in a netting country covered by the netting agreement . <p> From the Netting Group 's point of view the lack of standardized systems of bankruptcy laws makes it very difficult to confirm , with the required degree of certainty , the recognition and enforceability of active multi-branch netting without further cost and time-consuming investigations . Wherever positive statements of opinion are available , nothing bars the recognition however , for supervisory law purposes , of single-branch and passive multi-branch netting . <p> Non-contractual netting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need be a pre-condition for the recognition of netting from a supervisory law perspective . In relation to Article 211 paragraph 2bis of the Federal Law on Bankruptcy and Debt Enforcement , close-out netting for firm deals , financial forward transactions , swap and option transactions -- under which categories a major part of the derivative products may be included -- would already be assured by virtue of the legal rules . Even if this question is restricted to parties with registered offices in Switzerland , it should still be checked from a supervisory law point of view whether Article 211 paragraph 2bis of the Federal Law on Bankruptcy and Debt Enforcement applies to all eventual types of debtor insolvency as are described in Article 12f paragraph 2 a of the Federal Banking Ordinance . It is exactly in this respect that doubts remain open for Swiss Law above all in connection with receivership proceedings . In the view of the Netting Group , therefore , " non-contractual netting " even in the case of transactions between two Swiss parties can not be recognized from a supervisory law point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may off-set positive replacement values and all add-ons on the one hand , and negative replacement values on forward contracts and purchased options with the same counterparty as per paragraph 2 , on the other hand , in so far as a bilateral agreement with this counterparty exists which is demonstrably recognized and capable of being enforced according to the following laws : <p> a ) according to the law of the country in which the counterparty has its registered office and , if the foreign branch of an enterprise is involved , in addition according to the law of the place in which the branch is established ; <p> b ) according to the law which is applicable for the individual transactions covered by the agreement ; and <p> c ) according to the law to which the agreements are subject and necessary to effect the off-set . <p> 2 Netting is permitted in the following cases : <p> a ) for all transactions covered by a netting agreement according to which the bank , in case of default by the counterparty as a result of insolvency , bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive or pay over the difference of the unrealized gains or losses on transactions covered by the agreement ( close-out netting ) ; or <p> b ) for all offsetting receivables and payables maturing on the same day and in the same currency and which through a debt rescheduling agreement between the bank and the counterparty are summarized in a manner which results in a single net amount and thus creates a new legally binding contract which replaces the previous contractual arrangements ( netting by novation ) ; or <p> c ) for contracts which are closed out , in so far as an agreement for payment netting exists , according to which on maturity the offsetting payment obligations per currency are expressed on a net-balance basis and only this net balance is paid over ; <p> 3 Netting in accordance with paragraph 2 is not permitted whenever the agreement contains a provision that allows the non-delinquent party to make only limited payments or no payment to the delinquent party even if the latter on a net basis is a creditor ( walk-away clause ) .

Of the five sitting Justices , only one explored the effect of novation on arbitration clauses contained in abrogated contracts . <p> The Learned Justice J A Fabiyi , considering the issue of novation , however , made a sweeping observation that an arbitration clause survives novation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails . In arriving at that conclusion , the Learned Justice relied on the English case of Heyman v Darwins Ltd 1942 AC 356 . <p> It is noteworthy , however , that at no time during his two-paragraph opinion on the issue did the Learned Justice address the observation made by Lord Macmillan in Heyman v Darwins which confirmed parties ' freedom to treat a contract as one that never existed and to substitute a new contract for the contract which they have abrogated . Lord Macmillan observed that in such a case , any arbitration agreement in an abrogated contract can not be invoked for determination of questions under the new agreement . <p> Some observations of the Law Lords in Heyman v Darwins have been distinguished in subsequent English cases . Steyn J in Habour v Kansa1992 1 Lloyds Rep 81 stated that Lord Macmillan 's view that an issue of fraud is incapable of falling within the scope of an arbitration agreement is no longer the law . <p> Nevertheless , it is pertinent to note that without specifically referring to the separability doctrine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an arbitration clause can exist independent of the underlying contract from which it was created . The same principle is established in Article 12(2) ACA ( which is modelled after Article 16(1) of the Uncitral Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 ) . <p> Article 21(2) of the Arbitration Rules , made pursuant to Article 12(2) ACA , essentially provides that arbitration clauses in contracts are independent of the contract and a decision of an arbitral tribunal that a contract is null and void shall not entail by operation of law the invalidity of the arbitration clause . Article 12(2) ACA is amply supported by Article 12(1) which confers on an arbitral tribunal the competence to rule on questions pertaining to its jurisdiction and on any objection relating to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement . <p> The difficulty in this instance is determining when a party is challenging " the existence of an arbitration agreement " . Would a party 's challenge of the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to entertain claims based on an arbitration clause contained in an abrogated contract be classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is submitted that a party would only be bound by the provisions of Article 12(1) ACA to submit objections to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to that tribunal in the first instance if the question can be answered in the affirmative . Otherwise , it would then be difficult to justify the decision of the Supreme Court in NNPC v CLIFCO on the basis of Article 12(3) ( a ) ACA . <p> In conclusion , it is difficult not to wonder what would have been had the issue been explored further ; but for now , the law in Nigeria is that arbitration clauses in contracts survive subsequent novation arrangements . Corporate bodies operating in Nigeria would do well to specify their intended obligations in new contracts where they do not wish to be bound by arbitration clauses contained in old agreements . 
@@8538310 @1738310/ <h> 1.2 How , by whom , and by what measures , are takeover regulations ( or equivalent ) enforced ? <p> Generally , the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority ( EFST ) is legally entrusted with enforcing chapter 12 of the Capital Market Law 's Executive Regulations on Tender Offers ( Chapter 12 ) . Chapter 12 sets out , among other things , certain disclosure requirements and other regulatory measures and thresholds to achieve its purposes . Failure to comply with such requirements , measures or thresholds is punishable by monetary fines and imprisonment . <h> 2 . STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 2.1 What are the basic structures for friendly and hostile acquisitions ? <p> Acquisitions can be carried out through open market transactions or tender offers . <p> If the bidder intends to acquire up to less than one-third of the shares or voting rights of a public or listed company ( the target ) , it may do so by either : ( i ) acquiring the shares through open market transactions by placing buy order through a licensed broker ; or ( ii ) launching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be acquired . <p> If the bidder intends to acquire one-third or more of a target 's shares or voting rights , it must launch a mandatory tender offer whereby it must offer to acquire up to 100% of the target 's shares . <h> 2.2 What determines the choice of structure , including in the case of a cross-border deal ? <p> The choice of structure depends on the threshold of ownership offered to be acquired in the target , as well as other tax , regulatory and deal-specific considerations . <h> 2.3 How quickly can a bidder complete an acquisition ? How long is the deal open to competing bids ? <p> This depends on whether the acquisition is effected by way of open market transactions or tender offers . <p> If the acquisition is effected through open market transactions , the timeline would primarily depend on the trading activity of the concerned share ( the availability of shares offered for sale ) . With respect to actively-traded shares , the acquisition should be effected in a relatively short time span . <p> If the acquisition is effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valid for at least 10 Egyptian Exchange ( EGX ) trading days ( EGX days ) and no more than 30 EGX days . Competing offers may be made during the original offer 's validity period provided that a competing offer may not be made during the last five EGX days of the original offer 's validity period . If the EFST accepts a competing offer , it may extend the validity period of the original offer . <h> 2.4 Are there restrictions on the price offered or its form ( cash or shares ) ? <p> Generally , the consideration for shares offered to be acquired by way of a tender offer may be cash , shares in another company or a hybrid of both . From a practical perspective , if the acquisition is made by way of open market transactions , the consideration must be cash . <p> If the price of a tender offer is in the form of a share swap or a hybrid the offer , EFST may require the target to appoint an independent financial adviser to assess the offer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shareholders must have the option to choose to receive cash instead of shares . <p> In addition , the price of the offer must not be less than the highest price paid by the bidder ( or any of its related parties ) in a previous tender offer made during the 12 months preceding the relevant offer . <p> Further more , in certain circumstances , shareholders holding at least three percent of the target 's shares may request the shareholder holding ( whether directly or indirectly ) 90% or more of the shares to submit a tender offer to acquire their shares . In such circumstances , the price of such offer must be made in cash and must not be less than the highest price paid by the majority shareholder in a previous tender offer made during the 12 months preceding the relevant offer . <p> In addition , all competing offers must be in cash . <h> 2.5 What level of acceptance/ownership and other conditions determine whether the acquisition proceeds and can satisfactorily squeeze out or otherwise eliminate minority shareholders ? <p> A voting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed . <p> Egyptian law does not recognise the squeeze-out concept and , as such , no shareholder may be under a statutory obligation to sell its shares . <h> 2.6 Do minority shareholders enjoy protections against the payment of control premiums , other preferential pricing for selected shareholders , and partial acquisitions , for example by mandatory offer requirements , ownership disclosure obligations and a best price/all holders rule ? <p> As a general principle , parties relevant to the tender offer ( the bidder , the target , the independent and related advisers and their respective related parties ) must deal with all the target 's shareholders on an equal basis . <p> As noted above , if the bidder intends to acquire one-third or more of a target 's shares or voting rights , it must a launch a mandatory tender offer whereby it must offer to acquire up to 100% of the target 's shares . The price offered in such offer may not fall below the highest price paid by the bidder ( or any of its related parties ) in a previous tender offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2.7 To what extent can buyers make conditional offers , for example subject to financing , absence of material adverse changes or truth of representations ? Are bank guarantees or certain funding of the purchase price required ? <p> A tender offer may only be conditional on : ( i ) 75% of the target 's shares being tendered by the shareholders , if the bidder intends to merge the target after completion of the tender offer ; ( ii ) 51% of the target 's shares being tendered by the shareholders ; or ( iii ) if the price offered is shares in another company to be issued by way of increasing the share capital of such other company , the offer must be conditional on the approval of such company to issue the capital increase shares . <p> The tender offer may not be subject to any other conditions . <p> As part of the tender offer 's documentation , the bidder must submit a statement issued by a bank licensed by the Central Bank of Egypt confirming the availability of cash resources sufficient for payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 3 . TAX CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What are the basic tax considerations and trade-offs ? <p> The Income Tax Law has been amended so that capital gains achieved in respect of divesting listed shares are now subject to tax . <h> 3.2 Are there special considerations in cross-border deals ? <p> One of the special tax considerations in cross-border deals is the jurisdiction in which the sellers are incorporated and whether the country of such jurisdiction is a party to a double taxation treaty with Egypt . <h> 4 . ANTI-TAKEOVER DEFENCES <h> 4.1 What are the most important forms of anti-takeover defences and are there any restrictions on their use ? <p> Anti-takeover defences may take the form of the refusal of the target 's board to cooperate with the bidder with respect to providing due diligence information . <p> In general , the target 's board must pursue the best interests of the target and refrain from any action that may restrict the shareholders from determining the value of the target 's shares on a proper basis . In addition , the parties relevant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to submit offers and equality between the target 's shareholders . <p> In particular , the Capital Market Law prohibits the target 's board and managers to cause any material adverse change to the target from the date of the EFST 's approval of the offer until the announcement of the offer 's results . This includes : ( i ) approving a capital increase that may frustrate the offer ; or ( ii ) taking any actions that may materially affect the target 's assets , increase its financial liabilities or hinder the target 's future activity . <h> 4.2 How do targets use anti-takeover defences ? <p> The target 's board may advise the shareholders against accepting the bidder 's offer . <h> 4.3 Is a target required to provide due diligence information to a potential bidder ? <p> There is no explicit statutory provision requiring a target to provide due diligence information to a potential bidder . <h> 4.4 How do bidders overcome anti-takeover defences ? <p> A bidder ( whether individually or along with other shareholders of the target ) may submit a petition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal . <h> 4.5 Are there many examples of successful hostile acquisitions ? <p> There are not many examples of successful hostile acquisitions ; friendly acquisitions are more prevalent . <h> 5 . DEAL PROTECTIONS <h> 5.1 What are the main ways for a friendly bidder and target to protect a friendly deal from a hostile interloper ? <p> As noted above , the relevant parties to the tender offer must deal with all the target 's shareholders on an equal basis and must also abide by the principles of competition and freedom to submit offers and bidding . <p> From a practical perspective , however , the EFST has accepted the concept of the bidder entering into lock-up agreements with existing shareholders of the target to protect the deal . <h> 5.2 To what extent are deal protections prevented , for example by restrictions on impediments to competing bidders , break fees or lock-up agreements ? <p> There are no explicit prohibitions on specific deal protections , however , the general principle in 5.1 applies . <h> 6 . ANTITRUST/REGULATORY REVIEW <h> 6.1 What are the antitrust notification thresholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection of Competition and the Prohibition of Monopolistic Practices ( ECA ) requires , among other things , a post-closing notification of any transaction which results in the acquisition of assets or shares , or the merger of entities if the annual turnover of the relevant parties to the transaction exceeds EGP100 million ( $13 million ) . Moreover , the ECA does not have the statutory power to approve , block or modify any terms or conditions of the transaction . <h> 6.2 When will transactions falling below those thresholds be investigated ? <p> Transactions below such threshold are not required to submit notification . The ECA may investigate these transactions if a complaint is submitted that there is a violation of Egyptian Competition Law 3 2005 . In addition , the ECA may investigate these transactions with respect to anti-competitive agreements or practices . <h> 6.3 Is an antitrust notification filing mandatory or voluntary ? <p> Antitrust notification filing is mandatory only with respect to transactions that might the criteria explained in 6.1. <h> 6.4 What are the deadlines for filing , and what are the penalties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than 30 days after effecting the transfer of shares .

Moreover , with the discovery of giant reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas in the so-called pre-salt area in 2007 , the offshore exploration and production gained further importance . The need for a large number of vessels , from drillships to FPSOs and support vessels , combined with a local content policy , has made the Brazilian naval industry reemerge . <p> Nevertheless , the infrastructure sector in Brazil is still facing difficulties . Among all the bottlenecks that still hinder Brazilian development , logistics is definitely one of the top concerns for the Brazilian Government and investors and its improvement is considered to be an inevitable step for the achievement of the sharp development targets ahead . <p> Therefore , it is not without a reason that the shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive public policies for the financing and revitalisation of the Brazilian naval industry , with a special focus on supplying vessels for the exploration and production of oil and gas in the pre-salt area . In connection with that effort , Brazil has been undergoing a major public debate since the Federal Government decided to change the regulatory framework for the operation and improvement of ports by means of a Provisional Measure ( MP 595 ) that aims at boosting investments . <h> What is the current situation of the Brazilian naval industry and what are the factors driving its development ? <p> The resurgence of the Brazilian naval industry is one of the most outstanding issues in the current infrastructure sector . In 2003 , there were 3,000 people working in this industry in the country ; today , this number has mounted to 62,000 , and an additional 40,000 job positions are expected by 2017 , according to the Brazilian Union of the Offshore and Naval Industry ( Sinaval ) . <h> " This new life in the sector is led by the oil and gas perspectives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is led by the oil and gas perspectives in the country . The discovery of giant reserves in the Brazilian territory , with a special emphasis on the pre-salt area , has brought the need for a dramatic increase in the availability of all kinds of vessels required for offshore activities . For example , the Energetic Research Company ( ' EPE ' in the Portuguese acronym ) , a federal state-owned company responsible for planning studies of the Brazilian energy sector , estimates that Brazil will need 90 FPSOs by 2021 . By 2020 , Petrobras alone , the company with the most significant budget for offshore heavy industry , is expected to acquire 43 floating production units , 38 drillships and 88 oil tankers through Transpetro , its subsidiary for transport services . To get an idea of the size of this market , there are currently 159 FPSOs worldwide . Furthermore , to meet some of Petrobras ' needs , the Federal Government launched the Program for Expansion and Modernization of Transpetro 's Fleet " PROMEF , which has as its target the construction of the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being precisely one of the reasons for the revitalisation of Brazilian shipyards . <h> What are the main challenges for shipbuilders in Brazil ? <p> The main challenge is to develop a well-qualified network of national suppliers , as a result of the local content policy implemented by the Federal Government , especially for oil and gas vessels such as oil tankers and floating production units . According to the concession agreements for the exploration and production of oil and gas blocks signed between oil companies and the National Agency of Petroleum , Natural Gas and Biofuels ( ANP ) , all the concessionaires are contractually bound by minimum local content requirements , which reflect directly in the shipbuilding business . As mentioned above , in the case of Petrobras and Transpetro , the national content percentage contractually established with Brazilian shipyards can mount to 70% . <p> Penalties for the non-compliance with such requirements are considerable , and have become a problem for oil companies and their main suppliers in Brazil . Especially in the shipbuilding industry , a heavy user of high technologies for services and equipment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of such fines has not been followed by the development of local suppliers , and sometimes there is no option for shipyards other than going abroad for services and equipment and consequently facing the applicable penalties . Finding the correct balance in this trade-off is the most challenging task for national shipbuilders . <p> Furthermore , the shipyards must face the tight deadlines required by the operators of the oil industry in view of the pressure to accelerate the production of oil and natural gas in the country . <p> Another important and time-consuming aspect to be considered is excessive regulation . Red tape is a long-term issue in Brazil and it is no different when it comes to the bureaucracy involved with all the steps for the final achievement of the ready-to-use status of a vessel . The difficulties comprise a significant range of areas . <p> In terms of regulation , the Brazilian legal system provides for registration in several different public bodies . One of the required registrations is the Construction License , to be requested before an entity especially accredited before the Maritime Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship for some kind of vessels is registered before the same Maritime Court . In order to enjoy tax benefits for the operation of the ship , another registration before the same Maritime Court is required , called Special Brazilian Register ( ' REB ' , in the Portuguese acronym ) . The REB , in turn , has a previous and optional version allowing the shipyard to derive tax benefits during the construction of a vessel , called Previous Special Brazilian Register ( ' PrT-REB ' in the Portuguese acronym ) . <p> The issuing of such registrations demands numerous documents of several natures , and the whole procedure can take months . It is important for investors interested in the Brazilian shipbuilding sector to understand the dynamics so as to avoid unexpected situations and to make sure that all the related contracts provide protection against the red tape factor , especially when considering liabilities and loss of profit . <p> Labour issues should also be considered carefully . Being a heavy user of labour force , the shipbuilding industry might face considerable labour costs and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazilian National Confederation of Industries ( ' CNI ' in the Portuguese acronym ) , the cost of a Brazilian employee can reach an additional 183% cost in relation to the gross salary , besides all the regulatory burdens represented by a substantial amount of information to be provided on a regular basis to the Ministry of Labour . <p> Still concerning labour , finding qualified personnel is yet another issue to be tackled . The need for work force ranges from highly qualified professionals such as engineers , to others like welders , planners and assemblers . The lack of well-trained people makes the Brazilian industry more costly , less qualified and therefore uncompetitive in light of international standards , which still encourages many companies to acquire or charter vessels abroad ( specially in Asia ) , despite the risk of facing penalties for not meeting local content requirements . <h> Are there any tax incentives or special schemes for financing shipbuilders in the country ? <p> Brazilian shipyards are entitled to important tax benefits , such as exemptions of the Import Tax ( ' II ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' IPI ' in the Portuguese acronym ) , and reduction of tax rates to zero in case of social contributions ( PIS and Cofins ) whenever they purchase parts and components destined to conservation , modernisation , refurbishment and conversion of vessels that own a REB registration with the Maritime Court . The same benefit can be extended to vessels under construction if they own a PrT-REB registration . <p> In relation to financing , most of the funding for the naval sector in Brazil comes from public sources . There is a public fund called Merchant Marine Fund ( ' FMM ' ) , managed by the Brazilian Development Bank ( ' BNDES ' ) and formed by revenues from a tax collected on domestic or international operation involving freights performed in Brazilian ports . The tax is called Freight Additional for the Renovation of the Merchant Marine ( ' AFRMM ' ) and it was created to support the development of the Brazilian merchant marine and of the Brazilian naval repairing and construction industry . Most of the shipyards and vessels currently under construction in Brazil are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth sectors and market opportunities ? <p> The Brazilian shipping sector is a land of good opportunities . As mentioned earlier , the oil &amp; gas sector is more appealing than ever as a result of the huge investments in offshore infrastructure expected in the next years . The current scarcity opens a market for several different kinds of embarkations , such as FPSOs , FPUs , drillships , tankers , offshore support vessels , and also for services and equipment providers for the naval industry . Companies with local content might have advantages when the client is bound by national content requirements , but such market reserve should not be an obstacle for business in Brazil given the current scarcity of qualified providers , a circumstance that opens a generous market also for products and services from abroad . As an example , according to the Brazilian Agency for Waterway Transportation ( ' ANTAQ ' ) , the expenses in Brazil with the charter of foreign offshore vessels summed $3 billion in 2012 , a 22.8% increase in comparison to the 2011 figure . Due to the slow development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of exploration and production of oil and natural gas , companies are seeking suppliers elsewhere . <h> " Another important and time-consuming aspect to be considered is excessive regulation . Red tape is a long-term issue " <p> The naval sector in Brazil is also expected to grow in regard to coastal navigation due to the currently unsustainable situation of Brazilian roadways , which account for most of the load transportation in Brazil . A change in navigation rules in Brazil is under discussion in the Brazilian National Congress , which currently only allows ships bearing the Brazilian flag to perform coastal navigation ( foreign ships are only allowed under a charter agreement for a Brazilian navigation company , in certain situations ) . This would open the market to international navigation companies and would represent a significant blow to the Brazilian shipping sector . <h> Regarding the port sector , what is the current scenario in the country ? <p> The port sector is going through a major regulatory change in Brazil . Over the last decade , the country has experienced positive growth and economic stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size . The capacity of the ports , however , has not experienced the same growth and should the current situation persist , by 2015 the capacity of public ports will be completely exhausted . <p> Driven by the need for changes in this picture and for an increase in private investments , the Federal Government decided to introduce a set of new rules into the regulatory framework by enacting MP 595 so as to guarantee more legal certainty and wider competition in the sector . <p> Besides , the Federal Government has also announced a program for investments in logistics that embraces all the modals : ports , airports , railways and roadways . Among its core goals , this program aims at ending the barriers to the entry of new investors and encouraging an increase of private investments in the sector . Concerning ports , it comprises an estimate of $30 billion throughout all the regions of the country by 2017 , besides special financing facilities at more favorable rates . <h> What are the main concerns and risks that clients interested in port investments should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former legal framework was entirely revoked by MP 595 , which is still subject to approval by the National Congress ( though it is already binding ) . Only after approval and promulgation of the New Ports Law will it be possible to know the definitive rules , how investments shall be made , the rights and obligations of private investors and the risks involved . <p> Therefore , it is necessary to wait for the final enactment of the new legal framework for a better analysis of eventual investments in this sector in Brazil . <h> What are the main opportunities in the port sector ? <p> Infrastructure problems also generate opportunities . If one considers the strong need for major improvements in the infrastructure of Brazilian ports due to the current inappropriate situation of their facilities , the new regulation imposed by the Government and yet to be enacted by the Congress has eliminated important barriers to the entry of private capital into the sector . <p> Before MP 595 , owners of private terminals were obliged to manage their own cargo together with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport services to other companies ; they were expected to manage their own goods as well , which meant that they could not have transportation as their sole business purpose ) . According to the new rules , the difference between a company 's own cargo and that pertaining to third parties no longer exists . This is an innovation that allows private terminals the possibility of having the specific purpose of transporting third party goods . This factor is expected to be seen by investors as a positive measure . <p> Thus , the setup of new private ports with the specific purpose of providing transportation services to the market is also considered to be an outstanding opportunity arising from the new regulation . <p> Claudia has a deep knowledge of public sector-related matters .

@@8538315 @1738315/ <h> Harneys <h> Address <h> Telephone <h> Fax <p> The BVI company has enjoyed immense popularity and success in Asia as the offshore company of choice and enjoys an unrivalled reputation for cost effectiveness , flexibility , investor familiarity , ease of incorporation and low costs of maintenance . Recent case law from the Commercial Court of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court concerns the test for restoring a dissolved company and should be noted by Asian businesses using BVI companies who will benefit from understanding the effect of these cases , managing their risk and developing their strategy accordingly . <p> Restoration of a company is a concept that will be familiar to common-law practitioners , but different jurisdictions apply different statutory regimes to the striking off , dissolution and restoration of a company . At its simplest , a restoration is a court process by which application is made seeking a declaration that a company , having been dissolved , be restored as a company . More precisely , under BVI law it is a declaration that the dissolution of the company is void and is restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BVI Business Companies Act 2004 ( BCA ) an application for such a declaration can be made by the company , creditor , member or liquidator of the company . This section is concerned with restoration following dissolution and there are separate provisions for restoration following mere administrative striking off . <p> By virtue of the fact that restoration is a statutory process , careful regard has to be given to the precise terms of the legislation . Inevitably English common law guidance on restoration ( which is persuasive in the BVI ) is likely to be of limited assistance in understanding the true meaning of the specific BVI provisions . <h> Why restore a company ? <p> The traditional , and by far the most obvious , reason for an application for restoration is where a creditor wants the company restored so that it can sue the company on a debt . A company that has been dissolved has no capacity to be sued . Another reason to restore a company might be if , subsequent to its voluntary liquidation , further and undistributed company assets are discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have no capacity to distribute these newly-discovered assets to shareholders . Occasionally , the company may wish to restore itself in order to tender performance for an obligation that crystallised when the company was in good standing , but which only fell due for performance following dissolution . In the normal course of events the counterparty to the obligation would likely move any application to restore the company and take action to enforce the obligation or sue for its breach . In YKM v Financial Services Commission BVIHCM/2011/02 , however , the application to restore was made on the basis that the company felt obliged to tender performance to the obligee , and in turn to do everything possible , including restoring itself , to do so . This will be a rare occurrence because : ( i ) strictly speaking , a dissolved company is no longer an obligor pursuant to the contract because following dissolution its debts and obligations are totally extinguished ; and ( ii ) there would in principle be nothing to stop a third party from tendering performance on behalf of the dissolved company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant restoration . <h> Some thorny questions <p> There has been substantial debate as to the effect of a section 218 restoration of a company which had previously been voluntarily liquidated . Does the company become restored to the position it was in immediately before dissolution ( in a state of voluntary liquidation ) or is it restored to good standing and in the hands of the directors ? In a recent case , ( Dedyson Enterprises Limited v Registrar of Corporate Affairs BVIHCM 2008/0011 ) it was held that a company that was in voluntary liquidation immediately before dissolution will not be in liquidation following restoration , but instead would be put back in good standing . The reasoning was that , unlike the provisions of the English Companies Act 1985 , there was nothing in section 218 BCA to infer that the purpose of restoration was to enable a liquidation to be re-opened so that unfinished business which had been identified subsequent to dissolution could be completed . <h> The scope of restoration <p> In Dedyson it was held that a restoration application following a voluntary winding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judge held that where an application to restore is made by or in relation to a company whose liquidation had previously been reported to the Registrar as complete , it will generally be inappropriate for the application to be granted otherwise than for the purpose of enabling newly-discovered assets to be distributed by the company or claims to be made against it which had not previously been made . There could , otherwise than in the most exceptional circumstances , be no good grounds for avoiding the dissolution of a company that had been wound up simply so that its owners could resume carrying on business through it as if nothing had happened . <h> Welcome clarification <p> It is of fundamental importance that the supervisory jurisdiction of the BVI court over the companies incorporated within its territory is properly exercised . The Commercial Court has substantially clarified the area of law relating to company restorations which will serve to give added confidence to users of BVI companies .

Since its establishment more than a decade ago , it has become a popular alternative offshore financial centre . <p> In a tropical island 358km off the coast of the east Malaysia state of Sabah , north-west of Borneo , Labuan IOFC is now an integrated offshore financial centre that offers the full range of offshore financial services , including banking , insurance , trust business , fund management , investment holding companies , investment management , and management services activities . Labuan IOFC is also becoming increasingly popular for advising and structuring Islamic financing . <p> The better-known centres for setting up funds have always been traditional tax haven jurisdictions , such as the British Virgin Islands , the Cayman Islands , Luxembourg and Dublin . Operating in different time zones , these locations may not be suitable for fund investments in the Asia region , particularly in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to these traditional jurisdictions . Labuan is also fast becoming a popular tax haven for Middle Eastern funds . <p> Why Labuan for setting up funds ? <p> The attraction and rapid development of Labuan IOFC as an offshore financial centre for funds can be attributed to its strict laws and regulations that protect investors ' interests , its effective privacy laws and the fact that it is constantly reviewed to meet global offshore market demands . The legislation governs and facilitates the smooth establishment and operation of funds . Among other things , the legislation and rules provides that private and public funds are required to appoint trustees to maintain records , to ensure investors are protected . <p> Properly structured , activities of the fund could fall within the definition of an offshore business activity and specifically as an offshore trading activity . When carrying on offshore trading activity , the fund will benefit from a low tax regime of 3% or a lump sum payment of $5,300 a year . <p> The proceeds from redemption of units ( in a unit trust fund ) or preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends from fund companies are also exempted from withholding tax as income derived from an offshore business activity or out of exempt income , as well as interest paid by a Labuan offshore company ( LOC ) to a non-resident person , a resident person or another offshore company . Technical or management fees paid by an LOC to a non-resident person or another offshore company are also not subject to tax . <p> An LOC is able to access some of Malaysia 's double taxation agreements with over 47 countries to minimize withholding and capital gains . <p> From an Asian perspective , the operational cost of a fund in Malaysia is lower than other offshore financial centres in the Asia Pacific region . The operational cost is estimated to be 40% less than the cost in Hong Kong and Singapore . It is also undoubtedly lower than tax havens in the US and Europe . <p> With over 50 international banks to choose from in Labuan , fund administrators have the flexibility to hold multi-currency accounts as well as access to the cost-effective and fast transmission of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the government of Malaysia , when establishing Labuan IOFC , equipped it with infrastructure facilities such as information and communication technology , facilities to set up e-commerce platforms , international class infrastructure for setting up offices and a trained and highly efficient pool of human resources .

The roles required for a typical fund set-up are set out in diagram 1 ( please refer to diagram 1 below ) . Although not legally necessary , each of the different roles can be carried out from Labuan IOFC by licensed trust companies , investment banks and fund managers . <p> In addition to the benefits above , the Labuan International Offshore Financial Exchange ( LFX ) also provides a venue for listing and trading funds .

LOFST is the one-stop regulatory agent in Labuan IOFC . <p> A fund may be established in the form of a unit trust , Labuan offshore company or partnership . Two types of funds may be established : a private fund or public fund . A private fund allows a maximum of 100 investors and a minimum first-time investment of $26,500 . However , the private fund may also have unlimited number of investors if the first-time investment is set at a minimum of $132,000 . <p> Before establishing a fund , the promoter must first ascertain the form of the fund .

After that , an application must be made to LOFST for its consent or registration . <p> When registering with or seeking consent from LOFST , the constitution documents , private placement memorandum or public prospectus must be lodged . In the event of a public fund , deeds , documents or agreements relating to the instruments might be required .

A company that raises capital must therefore offer existing shareholders the opportunity to subscribe for new shares or equity-linked instruments in proportion to their shareholdings . Compared to many other jurisdictions there is no threshold size ( for example 10% ) below which shareholders do not have pre-emptive rights . <p> Pre-emptive rights can be excluded by shareholders with a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes and an absolute majority of the nominal value of the shares represented at the shareholders ' meeting . <p> In addition to this supermajority , the CO requires a valid reason for the cancellation of pre-emptive rights and adherence to the principles of equal treatment of shareholders and considerate exercise of rights . <p> A valid reason to exclude pre-emptive rights requires an objective and justified interest of the Company issuing the shares . Generally accepted as valid reasons are , for example : <p> ( i ) M&amp;A transactions and employee participation ( specifically mentioned in the CO as examples of valid reasons ) ; <p> ( ii ) under certain conditions , welcoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a takeover offer deemed insufficient by the board ; and <p> ( iii ) recapitalisation in financial distress , for example by way of debt-for-equity swap , the issuance of mandatory convertible securities or where an investor can only be found when offering a substantial shareholding . <p> Whereas in an ordinary capital increase the shareholders themselves exclude the pre-emptive rights , by creating authorised capital the shareholders delegate the decision to exclude pre-emptive rights to the board . In a non-pre-emptive capital increase from authorised capital , the board must , therefore , decide to exclude the pre-emptive rights on the basis of the authorised capital in the articles of association that must authorise the board to do so and state a valid reason for such an exclusion . <p> Because a cancellation of pre-emptive rights may constitute a major impairment of the existing shareholders ' rights in the company , the board must also adhere to principles of equal treatment of shareholders and considerate exercise of rights . Failure to do so may expose the board to liability . <p> Whether shareholders can give the board maximum flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favourable conditions on the capital markets on short notice is unclear . An objective reason for such exclusion would be that it would allow a company to raise equity at relatively low cost , for example by way of a private investment in public equity ( Pipe ) transaction . <h> Private placement safe harbour <p> Because Swiss law does not have a clear statutory private placement safe harbour , there is considerable uncertainty as to when an offering of new shares is considered an offering to the public and thus subject to the prospectus requirements discussed below . Article 652a CO simply states that any offering is public " unless addressed to a limited group of persons " . In the absence of a quantitative threshold and an exemption for qualified investors , what that means exactly has been extensively debated in Swiss doctrine . <p> The most restrictive view is that any offer made to more than 20 investors is deemed a public offer . While certain authors advocate an increase of this statutory threshold to up to 100 , others take the view that any offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterion , an offer to existing shareholders or employees , for example , should not be deemed a public offer . Other authors take the view that an offer to so-called qualified investors ( as defined in the Swiss Federal Statute on Collective Investments ) should not be considered a public offer . This view is supported by the fact that Swiss law includes private placement safe harbours for investment funds and structured products . A proposed amendment of the CO would include a qualified investor exemption for equity and debt offerings as well . In the absence of a private placement safe harbour , however , each offering must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis , weighing all the relevant facts . <h> Prospectus requirements <p> Switzerland is not an EU Prospectus Directive ( PD ) jurisdiction and Swiss law prospectus requirements , when securities are offered to the public or admitted , to trading differ from jurisdictions where the PD applies . <p> Article 652a CO requires an offering prospectus when new shares are offered to the public in Switzerland and also contains certain disclosure items that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investors but is not subject to any filing or approval requirements with any Swiss regulator . A breach of the CO prospectus requirements may , however , result in prospectus liability . <p> With the exception of the requirement to include the most recent unconsolidated statutory financial statements of the issuer , the CO disclosure requirements are not particularly demanding and a PD compliant prospectus generally contains the minimum disclosure requirements of the CO . <p> If shares are listed on a stock exchange in Switzerland , the respective listing rules apply . The listing rules of SIX Swiss Exchange , Switzerland 's main stock exchange , for example , are largely modelled after the PD , but are less extensive and more flexible . For a discussion of the SIX prospectus approval process and prospectus-free rights offerings , see below . <p> Swiss issuers that list shares on SIX prepare a prospectus that complies with both the SIX Listing Rules and the CO prospectus requirements ( a so-called Offering and Listing Prospectus ) . The question whether or not a prospectus complies with the CO prospectus requirements is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in Switzerland , but not listing shares on SlX . Typically , additional disclosure items required , if any , will be included in a Swiss wrapper or in the prospectus . <p> According to prevailing doctrine , article 652a CO is not applicable to offerings of existing shares . Accordingly , an offer of existing ( treasury ) shares by the issuer ( or a shareholder ) do not trigger an article 652a CO offering prospectus requirement . Nevertheless , undocumented sales of existing shares are typically made by way of private placements . <p> The SIX Listing Rules require that an approved prospectus be published before shares are admitted to trading on the SIX . The SIX prospectus review and approval process takes 20 SIX trading days . <p> In practice the approval process is timed such that SIX approval has been obtained before printing of the prospectus and the start of the subscription period . Generally , the SIX prospectus approval process is less onerous than in most EU jurisdictions and the US . For example , amended drafts of the prospectus may be filed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; also , the review by SIX is generally limited to a rule check . <h> Structuring considerations <h> Rights offerings and non-pre-emptive placements <p> Due to statutory pre-emptive rights , rights offerings in Switzerland are not limited to troubled or distressed companies but most secondary equity offerings in Switzerland are rights offerings . The most common form of rights offerings in Switzerland are traditional rights offerings , where a company raises capital by offering existing shareholders the opportunity to subscribe for new shares in proportion to their shareholdings , under the same terms as each other investor . <p> Where companies need to raise funds more quickly and with more certainty as to the funds that will be in place at a certain point in time , Swiss companies typically place shares sourced from authorised capital with institutional investors in a non-pre-emptive placement by way of accelerated bookbuilding . Rights offerings that are structured as a two-stage process with an accelerated institutional and a secondary retail tranche and other types of accelerated rights offerings are uncommon in Switzerland . While also uncommon in the Swiss market , companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwriting or backstop commitments from underwriters or third parties . <p> Table two sets out the largest secondary market transactions of SIX listed issuers in 2010 and the first half of 2011 . <h> Prospectus-free and short-form prospectus offerings <p> For rights offerings , where shares are listed on SIX , the SIX Listing Rules require publication of a listing prospectus , which is not substantially different in content to what is required in an initial public offering . There are certain exemptions that allow the listing of prospectus-free rights offerings , for example if the shares offered in the rights offering account for less than 10% of the shares ( including conditional capital ) of the issuer already listed . The SIX Listing Rules do not include a proportionate disclosure regime for pre-emptive rights offerings as proposed in the Prospectus Directive amendments adopted by the European Council in October 2010 . <p> It is important to note that exemptions under the SIX Listing Rules do not apply to the requirement to publish a CO-compliant offering prospectus discussed above ; if the new shares are offered to the public in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required even if no SIX listing prospectus would be needed . <h> Discounted v at-market <p> Where new shares are offered at a discount to current market price , the ( nil paid ) rights of the shareholders to subscribe for the new shares are typically tradable so that shareholders that are unable or unwilling to exercise their rights can realise some value as a compensation for the dilution of their shareholdings . <p> In the absence of financial distress , discounts may not exceed 33 1/3% as higher discounts may be qualified as taxable distributions under Swiss tax laws . If market conditions are such that a deep discount to current market price is required to attract investors , it is advisable to seek a tax ruling in advance of the rights offering to avoid adverse tax consequences . A tax ruling typically takes two to four weeks from filing until grant . <p> Recently , issuers with a strong equity story have been able to use the positive market environment to conduct rights offerings without discount . Because the rights allocated to shareholders in these so called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no trading of these rights . <p> Table three compares the main features of at-market and discounted rights offerings . <p> Table three : Features of at-market and discounted rights offerings <p> At-market rights offering <p> Discounted rights offering <p> Pricing <p> -Subscription period starts without publication of subscription price -Maximum subscription price can be set to provide investors with some price guidance -Subscription price will be set after rump placement on the back of a book-building process : In most cases , a book-building process ( global offering ) is started parallel to the subscription period -Subscription price will be set within a certain range of the market price of the shares , typically not above or below 5% of the market price on the day before the pricing date . <p> -Subscription price set before subscription period at a ( significant ) discount <p> +Certainty of proceeds at launch +Rights have intrinsic value encouraging shareholders to take up their rights and avoid dilution or sell them -Discount leads to greater dilution on per share basis in the event existing shareholders decide not to fully participate -Greater exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment -Strong equity story -Issuer issuing from a position of strength <p> -Commit major holders to the extent possible to subscribe <h> Timing considerations <p> There are no rules on how long the rights offer period must last . Market practice is for the rights offer period to be between five and 10 SIX stock exchange days . If a shareholders ' meeting is required to create the new shares offered , the rights offer period typically does not start until the necessary shareholder approvals have been obtained . <p> Because a shareholders ' meeting must be called at least 20 days in advance , the availability of authorised capital that allows the board to issue shares without shareholder approval is a key timing factor . <p> Under Swiss law , shares only come into existence upon registration of the capital increase with the competent commercial registry . This , in combination with the fact that SIX requires the delivery of a certified excerpt from the commercial registry evidencing registration of the capital increase , before start of trading , makes it necessary to effect the share issuance ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new shares and filing of a public deed with the commercial registry ) before pricing ( in case of an at market offering ) , start of SIX trading and closing ( payment of offer price net of pre-paid nominal versus delivery ) of the offering .

As discussed above , the SIX prospectus review and approval process takes 20 SIX stock exchange days . <p> The time required for the preparation of the prospectus for initial filing with SIX varies , depending on different factors , including the issuer 's experience with capital markets transactions . <h> New types of capital <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that aims at strengthening the stability of the financial system by introducing new rules for systematically important banks . <p> Part of the proposed new rules is the creation of new types of equity capital for all ( not only systematically important ) Swiss banks : reserve capital and conversion capital . <p> Reserve capital ( Vorratskapital ) is a new type of authorised capital , designed to give the board of a bank organised as a corporation maximum flexibility to issue new share capital at short notice in the event of a deterioration of the bank 's capital base . <p> Conversion capital ( Wandlungskapital ) is a new type of conditional capital available for banks organised as a corporation , designed as a source of shares for contingent capital securities that convert into shares upon certain regulatory capital triggers . <p> While the Swiss parliament may decide on some modifications to these legislative proposals , generally , it is fair to assume that these new capital tools , together with the new Basel III capital requirements and Swiss finish rules thereto , will have a significant impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial institutions . <p> About the firm <p> Established in 1936 , Niederer Kraft &amp; Frey has been instrumental in the development of Swiss capital markets law and practice .

@@8538320 @1738320/ <h> 1.2 Is a stay on creditor enforcement action available ? <p> Under Spanish law , insolvency proceedings ( concurso ) are considered collective enforcement proceedings that affect the debtor 's estate . Therefore , the enforcement of security interests and related actions can not usually be initiated , or , if initiated , they may be stayed : <p> Once the debtor is declared insolvent , the automatic stay lasts until the first of the following circumstances occurs : ( i ) a court approves a composition agreement that does not affect the credit ; or , ( ii ) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated . After that , the automatic stay expires and foreclosure actions can be reinitiated or admitted . <p> Recent amendments to the SIA establish that this stay of remedy enforcement begins on filing a 5 bis communication or on the admission of any homologated refinancing agreement . <p> This said , in cases where the security interest has been granted according to what is established under Royal Decree 5/2005 on financial securities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insolvency or by the 5 bis communication/the admission of a court-sanctioned refinancing agreement . <h> 1.3 How could the reorganisation and/or insolvency processes available in your jurisdiction be used to implement a reorganisation plan ? <p> Reorganisation and insolvency processes are the best way to implement a reorganisation plan when a company is undergoing financial difficulties , mainly because of the security they offer ( to debtors and creditors ) . <h> 1.4 How can a creditor or a class of creditors be crammed-down ? <p> Some creditors can be crammed-down in an insolvency procedure and through a homologated refinancing agreement under the Fourth Additional Disposition of the SIA . <p> Some covenants of a court-sanctioned refinancing agreement will be binding on dissenting or non-participating financial creditors ( including secured financial creditors ) if the agreement is entered into by an established majority of financial creditors .

Additionally , the insolvency proceedings must be conducted through an abbreviated procedure when the debtor files , along with the petition for a declaration of insolvency , a liquidation plan containing a binding written offer to purchase an existing business unit , or when the debtor has ceased carrying out its activity and has no employment contracts in force . <p> When , among the insolvency administrator 's essential functions , the insolvency report should indicate whether the debtor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumption of continuity of operations and liquidation . <h> 1.6 What are the duties of directors of a company in financial difficulty ? <p> Regardless of the company 's financial situation , company directors have a duty to be diligent and loyal to the company . <p> The main criterion governing directors ' performance is that they must act in the company 's best interests . In this case , this means choosing the course that will produce the least damage to the company 's assets . In other words , seeking ways to refinance the company 's debt and obtain write-offs and grace periods , and avoid the company entering into insolvency proceedings . Some scholars argue that this refers to the directors ' obligation of responsible management , protecting the company 's interests in a reasonable manner , that is , maximising , in the medium- and long-term , the value of the company , its sustainability , its reputation , and ensuring that its adverse economic situation does not worsen , thus affecting the company 's interests . <p> Directors must act more carefully if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests at stake . They need to take a cautious approach in the decision-making process , considering the creditors ' interests so that , without focusing on the payment of the remaining debts , they can ensure the debts do not increase and avoid any risky transactions that could prevent subsequent payment to creditors . <p> In addition , it 's worth mentioning that : ( i ) directors may incur liability by not filing for insolvency within two months of knowing that the company is insolvent ( the 5 bis communication extends this duty ) ; and , ( ii ) the directors ' liability regime under the SIA is only triggered when the categorisation phase of the insolvency proceedings is opened , allowing for civil liability to be imposed on directors who have contributed to the negligent or culpable creation or aggravation of the insolvency situation that leads to the insolvency proceedings being initiated . <h> 1.7 How can any of a debtor 's transactions be challenged on insolvency ? <p> Under article 71 of the SIA , once a company is declared insolvent , any action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its declaration of insolvency can be challenged if the action is considered detrimental to the insolvency estate . <p> This article specifies the general terms in which an action of this kind can be initiated : <p> Temporary requirement : only actions ( or omissions ) carried out in the two years before the declaration of insolvency can be rescinded . <p> Qualitative requirement : even actions carried out without fraudulent intent can be rescinded . <p> The insolvency administrator or any creditor can exercise the claw-back action if it has requested this action and the insolvency administrator does not seek the rescission within two months from the date of the creditor 's written request ( subsidiary legitimacy ) . <p> Objective requirement : actions or omissions to be rescinded must be detrimental to the insolvency estate . <p> Actions carried out in the debtor 's ordinary course of business and under market conditions can not be rescinded .

There are few exceptions to this rule , and those allowed by law are regulated in accordance with the principle that ordinary claims are considered equal . Based on that consideration , there is a distinction between privileged , ordinary and subordinated claims . Privileged credits are given preferential treatment over ordinary credits , which in turn have preference over subordinated credits . <p> Privileged claims can have a special or general privilege , depending on whether the security is created over a specific asset ( special privilege ) or over all of the debtor 's assets ( general privilege ) . Credits with special privilege include those in which collateral consists of specific property or rights ( mortgage , pledge or antichresis ) or equivalent rights ( financial lease agreement for the leased property ) . The privilege will only cover the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee . <p> Aside from the ranking of claims described above , post-petition credits " or claims against the insolvency estate " are considered a special and prioritised category of claims . These claims are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and , in principle , must be paid by the insolvency administrator when they fall due . <h> 1.9 Is there a different regime for credit institutions and investment firms ? <p> Yes . The SIA establishes in its second additional provision that ' the special provisions established in the specific legislation on insolvency situations , except those on composition , appointment and operation of the insolvency administration , will apply in insolvency of credit entities or their legally assimilated entities , investment services firms and insurance companies , entities that are members of official securities markets and those participating in securities clearing and settlement . ' <p> Therefore , Spanish law now has a specific regulation for insolvency and for restructuring credit institutions and investment firms .

The SIA and the applicable European legislation ( Council Regulation number 1346/2000 , of May 29 , on insolvency proceedings " the Regulation ) regulate this possibility when the debtor 's centre of main interest ( COMI ) is located in a member state . For debtors whose COMI is not in the EU , the Regulation does not apply . Under article 199 of the SIA on relations between different jurisdictions , the provisions contained in the SIA apply without prejudice to the conventional rules applicable . <p> In the case of foreign debtors located in a member state other than Spain , a Spanish court could declare them insolvent under any of the following proceedings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> ( i ) principal insolvency proceedings : universal insolvency proceedings comprising all the debtor 's assets and liabilities and initiated in the member state where the debtor 's COMI is located ; <p> ( ii ) secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings : these national proceedings only comprise the debtor 's assets located in the member state where they are opened and are processed in parallel with the principal insolvency proceedings . They can be declared in Spain if the company 's COMI is not in Spanish territory but the debtor has an establishment there . <h> 2.2 Can recognition and assistance be given to foreign insolvency or reorganisation proceedings ? <p> In Spain , only cross-border insolvency proceedings declared within the EU ( except Denmark ) are automatically recognised through the rules established under the Regulation . <p> This will change once Insolvency Regulation 2015/848 enters into force for insolvency proceedings on June 26 2017 . <p> However , when the insolvency procedure is not declared in a member state , and there is no bilateral treaty in force between the two countries , SIA rules apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of the insolvency proceedings resolutions will be subject to the reciprocity principle , meaning that they can not be alleged by the parties when there is no reciprocity or cooperation with the authorities of the foreign country where the resolutions were issued . <p> Foreign rulings that declare the opening of insolvency proceedings ( whether principal or territorial ) will be recognised by means of the exequatur process regulated in the Spanish Civil Procedural Act . Once a foreign resolution is recognised , any other resolutions issued after the former has been issued , do not need to fulfil an exequatur procedure . <p> Recognition can only be rejected if its effects would be contrary to Spain 's public policy . <p> The insolvency administrator of the insolvency proceedings declared in Spain and the administrator or representative of foreign insolvency proceedings related to the same debtor that are recognised in Spain will be subject to a duty of reciprocal cooperation when exercising their functions , under the supervision of competent courts or authorities . <h> Section 3 : OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What other major stakeholders ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on the outcome of the reorganisation ? <p> Any reorganisation may be subject to its creditors , but also to its shareholders , its group companies , and so on .

These courts were created at the same time that the existing Insolvency Act came into force . <p> The legislative policy over the last couple of years has focused on eliminating the problems arising in relation to refinancing agreements . <p> The most recent reforms approved clearly seek to offer better solutions to debtors that , despite being operating companies , have a debt so high that it has limited their growth and , in many cases , left them adrift ; and to investors that want to help these companies , either by financing them or by acquiring assets or productive units . <p> Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less successfully tried to strengthen pre-insolvency institutions .

This means that ( i ) upon issuance , the notes have an initial principal amount and the relevant initial subscription price is paid and ( ii ) the principal amount of the notes may be increased by means of further subscription payments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the notes . <h> Example of a partly paid notes securitization transaction <p> To clarify the possible structure , the following steps have been individuated , considering a sample scenario where : ( i ) the issuer proposes to issue three classes of notes ( class A , class B and class C ) , ( ii ) the principal amount of each class could be increased up to ? 100 million ( a total amount of ? 300 million for the three classes ) , in a minimum denomination of one euro and integral multiples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole subscriber purchases all the notes . <p> The issuer initially purchases a portfolio of initial receivables of ? 30 million and the notes issued on the issue date are : ? 10 million class A notes , ? 10 million class B notes and ? 10 million class C notes ; <p> The initial subscriber of the notes makes , upon purchase of the notes , a payment equal to ? 10 million for each class ; <p> When purchasing further receivables , in addition to the initial receivables ( up to ? 300 million ) , during a subscription period to be determined in the transaction documents , the issuer will increase the principal amount of the notes in the minimum amount of one euro and integral multiples thereof ; <p> In order to carry on the increase , the issuer proposes to the holders of the notes to increase the principal amount of the notes ( the noteholders would be convened in a meeting and decide in accordance with the relevant rules of the organization of the noteholders ) ; <p> Once the noteholders have passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , they would pay the relevant amount to the issuer so that the latter would be able to pay the purchase price of further receivables ; <p> Taking into account that , in our scenario , there are three classes of partly paid notes , an order of priority among the classes would be established , to fill the principal amount up to which the notes may be increased . As an example : the terms and conditions of the notes may set out that ( i ) only after full subscription of the whole amount ( ? 100 million ) of the class A notes , would the holders of the class B notes and the class C notes be allowed to make payments so that the principal may be increased and ( ii ) only after full subscription of the whole amount ( ? 100 million ) of the class B notes , will the holders of the class C notes be allowed to make payments so that the principal may be increased ; or alternatively , the terms and conditions of the notes may set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Feasibility under Italian law <p> Having looked at how partly paid notes work , it can be asked whether provisions of Italian law would prohibit the parties from structuring such securitizations . <p> As a matter of Italian law , taking into account that the main feature of a partly paid notes securitization transaction , as described above , is the increase of the principal amount of notes by means of an amendment to the relevent terms and conditions of such notes , the feasibility of the issuance of partly paid notes finds its ground on the following considerations . <p> On one hand , it should be noted that the Italian securitization law ( Law 130 of April 30 1999 ) does not say much in relation to the main features of asset-backed securities to be issued and , in particular , nothing is specified as regards the possibility to issue notes to be partly paid . However , nothing in the Italian securitization law expressly prevents a securitization company from issuing partly paid notes . Therefore , it may be argued that the whole structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parties and , more generally , has been conceived to simplify and increase the use of securitization as an alternative financing technique . <p> On the other hand , it should be also noted that provisions of the Italian civil code concerning the representation of the noteholders ( it is to be specified that such provisions refer to notes issued by joint stock companies only ) expressly grant the noteholders ' meeting with the power to pass resolutions concerning amendments to the terms and conditions of the notes . The prevailing opinion of Italian scholars is that such power of the noteholders ' meetings includes any kind of amendment , whether ancillary or material , which is deemed to be necessary to the interest of the noteholders ( which would seem to include also the increase of principal amount of notes ) . Even though the Italian securitization law does not specifically provide for noteholders ' meetings or the joint representation of noteholders , it can not be inferred that noteholders are prevented from creating such joint representation . A joint representation may be deemed an internal organizational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also an expression of their contractual autonomy . So , in principle , nothing prevents a securitization company from issuing notes under the Italian securization law whose specific terms and conditions set out the possibility to increase the principle amount of such notes . <h> Market practice <p> Taking into account the peculiarities of the transaction as described above , and the issues of Italian law , it seems the terms and conditions can set out mechanics for each increase of principal amount of one or more classes of notes . <p> In market practice , the following are the common features when issuing partly paid notes : <p> Any principal increase is equal to the minimum denomination of each class or multiples thereof ; <p> If more than one class of notes is issued , an order of priority among the classes is established for the increase of their principal amount , so that the class of notes which ranks in priority in respect to the others will become a " fully paid class of notes " prior to the increase of the other classes ; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any other class with respect to the increase of the relevant principal amount ; <p> The holders of each class are entitled ( but not be obliged ) to accept the request of the issuer to increase the principal amount of the relevant class(es) of notes ; <p> The subscription period to be determined in the transaction documents does not fall after the service of an enforcement/trigger notice . <h> Why issuing partly paid notes ? <p> A partly paid notes securitization structured in accordance with the Italian securitization law would be documented as a usual securitization ( including a prospectus , transfer agreement , servicing agreement , intercreditor agreement , agency and accounts agreements ) . The main difference from fully paid notes securitizations and programmes is that the issuance of partly paid notes would not imply additional issuances of notes further to additional purchases of portfolios since the initial documentation would govern the transaction throughout its entire life and in connection with each principal increase . <p> As mentioned , the documentation would set out from the beginning the possibility of increasing the principal amount and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request from the issuer to the noteholders and acceptance from the noteholders to the increase ? to be given in accordance with the rules of the organization of the noteholders ) . <p> The author was helpfully assisted in the drafting of this analysis by Raul Ricozzi and Alessia Frisina , associates at Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe <p> Author biography <h> Patrizio Messina <h> Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe <p> Patrizio Messina is a qualified Italian lawyer , a partner in Orrick 's Rome office and head of the Italian finance department .

But due consideration must be given to the issues of withholding tax on certain interest payments and stamp duties ( securities issue tax and securities transfer tax ) . <p> Debt instruments are not subject to Swiss securities issue and transfer taxes or to Swiss withholding tax as long as they do not qualify as a collective fundraising scheme . Collective fundraising schemes such as bonds ( Anleihensobligationen ) and medium-term notes ( Kassenobligationen ) are subject to securities issue tax ( bonds : 0.12% of the nominal value for each year of the maximum duration ; medium-term notes : 0.06% of the nominal value for each year of the maximum duration ) if a Swiss issuer issues them . A Swiss issuer is an issuer with legal domicile in Switzerland or an enterprise domiciled abroad and registered in a cantonal register of commerce in Switzerland , for example , as a branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered securities dealer ( EffektenhSndler ) is either a party or an intermediary to a sale of bonds or medium-term notes , whereby an increasing number of exceptions is available . Interest payments on bonds and medium-term notes are subject to Swiss withholding tax at a standard rate of 35% , which is substantially reduced if a treaty from Switzerland 's broad double taxation treaty network applies . The Swiss withholding tax must be charged to the recipient of the interest payment . If the Swiss withholding tax is not withheld from the interest payment , the Swiss issuer will have to pay the Swiss withholding tax of 35% , based on the gross interest payment being deemed to be 65% . This results in a Swiss withholding tax burden of 53.8% of the gross interest payment . Any provision in the terms of the bonds or notes providing for a gross-up obligation of the issuer could be held , based on a respective legal provision , as void and not enforceable against the Swiss issuer . Should the non-Swiss lender be protected in case of unexpected Swiss withholding tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate provision separately from any tax clause or gross-up provision . <p> Mortgage secured loans need special attention because the direct federal tax law as well as the Swiss cantonal tax laws provide for an income tax to be levied at source on interest payments on loans secured by Swiss real estate . The applicable tax rates vary from canton to canton and are limited by Swiss double taxation treaties to rates between 0% and 15% , depending on the treaty in question . In the canton of Zurich , the standard source tax rate is 17% . <p> A loan facility is treated as a bond for Swiss withholding tax and stamp duty purposes if the loan is considered a collective fundraising scheme , pursuant to the Swiss Withholding Tax Law , the Swiss Stamp Duty Law and the practice of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration as published in the Guideline regarding Tax Treatment of Syndicated Loans , Non-bonded Loans , Notes and Sub-participations ( published in January 2000 ) . A collective fundraising scheme is assumed if the following conditions are all met : <p> there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least SFr500,000 ( $400,000 ) ; and <p> the loan conditions are identical , referring to a single loan agreement only . <p> Pursuant to the Guideline regarding Bonds issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration in April 1999 , a company creates medium-term notes for the purposes of the Swiss Withholding Tax Law and the Swiss Stamp Duty Law ( the Laws ) if the following conditions are all met : <p> money is borrowed under varying conditions on a continuing basis ; <p> more than 20 non-bank lenders are involved ; and <p> the total loan amount is more than SFr500,000 . <p> As a consequence , the conditions for a medium-term note for the purposes of the Laws are met if the number of non-bank lenders and of all private placements and single loans ( including intra-group loans ) from non-banks of a Swiss borrower exceeds 20 . <p> Therefore , as a rule of thumb , if more than 10 non-bank lenders effectively participate or could participate - directly or indirectly - in a loan facility or if the Swiss borrower is financed by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financing structure must be carefully investigated . <p> Any lender not qualifying as a bank within the meaning of the Laws counts as a non-bank lender . A foreign bank will be considered a bank if the laws of the jurisdiction of the office in which it accounts for the loans qualify it as a bank and if it carries on a genuine banking activity there . Finance companies , holding companies , investment companies and investment funds do not qualify as banks . <p> In order to avoid adverse Swiss withholding tax consequences , loan facilities with Swiss borrowers should provide for the following : <p> if any ( potential ) lenders under the loan facility are not banks within the meaning of the Laws , the legal documentation should explicitly exclude that the 10 non-bank rule could be violated ; <p> transfers , assignments or sub-participations are allowed only if the transferee , assignee or sub-participant is again a bank within the meaning of the Laws ; <p> the Swiss borrower is obliged to represent that at any time the aggregate number of non-bank lenders that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borrower taken together ( other than bond issues or medium-term notes issues which are subject to Swiss withholding tax ) does not exceed 20 . <p> To admit non-banks as lenders it is necessary to have detailed approval procedures in place to make sure that at any time the 10 non-banks rule and the 20 non-banks rule are complied with . As the Swiss borrower is liable for Swiss withholding tax and Swiss issue stamp duty towards the Swiss Federal Tax Administration , an involvement of such a borrower in these approval procedures is necessary . <p> Structures involving foreign vehicles <p> In general , Swiss tax authorities accept structures where foreign vehicles raise funds through a collective fundraising scheme and the funds raised are transferred to Switzerland through a single loan , as long as the foreign vehicle does not issue sub-participations in the single loan and as long as the structure is not considered a tax-avoidance scheme according to the practice of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration . In particular the two following basic structures will probably be considered as tax avoidance schemes : <p> The funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or SPV ) that has one single purpose - to issue one bond and to transfer the funds to a Swiss company . <p> The funds are raised by a foreign subsidiary of a Swiss company and the bond is guaranteed by the Swiss parent company . Swiss tax authorities do not accept such a structure , unless the funds raised are used abroad . <p> Structures involving a foreign SPV must be carefully investigated on a case-by-case basis and it is advisable to obtain an advance tax ruling from the Swiss tax authorities . <p> In recently ruled cases the Swiss Federal Tax Administration accepted a foreign vehicle as a lender under a loan facility although the foreign vehicle was being refinanced by collective fundraising schemes ( but the foreign vehicle was not issuing sub-participations in its portion of the loan facility ) based on the following criteria : <p> the foreign vehicle must be a multi-purpose vehicle that is not established for one specific refinancing transaction only and that has a record of its issuing activity ; <p> the owners of the foreign vehicle are independent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders ; <p> the portion of the loan is recorded as an asset in the balance sheet of the foreign vehicle and the foreign vehicle bears the full debtor loss risk ; <p> the foreign vehicle 's equity is the counterparty risk of the investors under the collective fundraising scheme and the Swiss borrower does not secure such counterparty risk . <p> This practice of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration offers the opportunity for Swiss companies to be financed under market conditions on the growing international market by financial institutions that do not qualify under the narrow notion of banks within the meaning of Swiss Withholding Tax Law and Swiss Stamp Duty Law . <p> For foreign branches of Swiss banks , the funding by way of collective fundraising schemes does not trigger Swiss withholding tax and stamp duty issues if the foreign branch qualifies as a bank pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it accounts for the loans and if it carries on genuine banking activity there . <p> Securitization <p> Securitization schemes are also reviewed by Swiss tax authorities under tax avoidance criteria , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss withholding taxes and stamp duties . A favourable tax ruling confirming that the securitization structure does not constitute a tax avoidance scheme may be obtained even though proceeds are being used in Switzerland and the funds are raised through a foreign SPV provided that the following particular conditions are met : <p> the transfer of the assets to the SPV is at arm 's length ; <p> the assets transferred are eliminated from the financial statements of the originator and are replaced by the sales price ; <p> the risk for the assets , in particular the bad debt risk , must be fully borne by the SPV ; and <p> no obligation exists on the part of the originator to take back the assets . <p> In other words , there must be an irrevocable transfer of assets and of all related risks , that is , a true sale .

The tax is calculated at an increasing rate depending on levels of profit , up to a maximum of 55% . <p> In practice tax is imposed on foreign non-GCC corporate bodies only . GCC corporate bodies are companies that are incorporated in countries comprising the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) . The Department of Income Tax ( DIT ) seeks to tax not only non-Kuwaiti corporate bodies , but also foreign corporate shareholders in Kuwait ( and GCC ) companies . The DIT taxes the percentage interest of the foreign corporate shareholders . <p> Carrying on business : The term carrying on business in Kuwait is interpreted in a broad manner by the DIT and the full value of operations related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kuwait are relatively insignificant . The term is defined in the Tax Law to include : <p> purchasing and selling property or goods , or rights to them , in Kuwait and maintaining a permanent office in Kuwait where the contracts of purchase and sale are executed ; <p> operating of other manufacturing , industrial , or commercial enterprise in Kuwait ; <p> letting any property in Kuwait ; and <p> rendering services in Kuwait . <p> However , it does not include merely purchasing property or goods , or rights to them , in Kuwait . <p> The Tax Law also provides that companies operating in Kuwait through an agent are subject to tax . An agent for the purposes of the Tax Law has been defined as : " a person authorized by a principal to enter into a binding contract with a third party on the principal 's behalf within the scope of that authority . " However , the DIT does not restrict itself to assessing tax based on this narrow definition of agent . Increasingly , the DIT has endeavoured to tax foreign companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority to bind the foreign principal contractually . <p> Taxation of exclusive distributorship relationships : the DIT asserts that foreign companies with exclusive distributors in Kuwait are subject to taxation on the basis of exclusive distributorship relationships are tantamount to an agency relationship indicative of a foreign principal carrying on business in Kuwait ( and on that basis payments to a foreign principal are taxable ) . In this regard , the DIT seeks to rely on Article 286 of the Law of Commerce , which is limited in application to confirming that an exclusive distributor is entitled to certain rights afforded to contract agents set out in the provisions stated in that Article ( for example , receipt of compensation upon termination or expiration of the distributorship relationship ) . This interpretation expands the definition of agent in the Tax Law . <p> Some of the grounds the DIT seeks to rely on ( including the exclusive distributorship interpretation of the DIT ) in determining what constitutes carrying on business in Kuwait are increasingly being challenged . These issues have not yet been fully tested before the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become more proactive in pursuing foreign companies , an increasing amount of tax cases are being litigated . <p> Tax treaties : Double-taxation treaties have been signed and ratified between Kuwait and a number of countries and the DIT has been increasingly applying these treaties . <p> Ministerial Order 44 of 1985 : Although , strictly speaking , there is no withholding tax in Kuwait , according to Ministerial Order 44 of 1985 there is a requirement for government agencies and private entities in Kuwait to notify the DIT of all contracts entered into by them and to retain 5% of the payments due to contractors or subcontractors until the contractor is able to provide a tax-clearance certificate or until the DIT demands the 5% . <p> The DIT has interpreted the term contractor in a broad manner to the extent that any foreign party conducting business in Kuwait , regardless of its characterization , could be subject to Ministerial Order 44 of 1985 . <p> Challenging a tax assessment : If the DIT issues a tax assessment against a foreign company , the company has to object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative process , culminating with taking action before the Administrative Court . <p> It has been common practice for foreign companies not to initiate this administrative process and take action before the Administrative Court but instead wait until the Ministry of Finance takes action , demanding payment of unpaid taxes . However , the Court of Appeals recently decided that a taxpayer 's failure to challenge the DIT 's assessment in accordance with the administrative challenge procedures and before the Administrative Court represents a waiver by the taxpayer to challenge the DIT 's assessment . <p> Potential tax exemptions : Subject to certain conditions being met , tax exemptions may be obtained for foreign non-GCC companies establishing their operations within the Kuwait Free Trade Zone and/or in accordance with the Direct Foreign Capital Investment Law . Foreign companies intending to conduct business operations in Kuwait should assess whether they can benefit from either of these possibilities . <p> Government initiatives on income taxation : The Kuwaiti government is reportedly considering a new income tax law that would expand the scope of income taxation to apply to individual and non-employment income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever nationality .

In addition to the above , bankruptcy laws ( especially the Civil Rehabilitation Procedure ) are increasingly important due to the increase in bankruptcy-related transactions resulting from the current worldwide financial crisis . The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trades Law ( the FEFTL ) is also important for cross-border M&amp;A activity . <p> In addition to the above legislation , it is worth noting that there are various guidelines published by governmental organisations and stock exchange rules that have a significant influence on M&amp;A transactions involving listed companies in Japan . Such guidelines include the Guidelines on Management Buyouts for the Purpose of Enhancing Corporate Value and Securing Due Process , published by the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry on September 4 2007 . <p> While there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been nothing as significant as the changes resulting from the implementation of the new Corporate Law in 2006 and the FIEL in 2007 . But due to the increasing number of M&amp;A transactions involving public companies over the last few years , there have been a number of notable court cases relating to M&amp;A transactions . Those cases are expected to help establish a more stable structure for M&amp;A transactions . <p> Due to the current global recession , the type and nature of M&amp;A transactions has been changing . M&amp;A transactions between companies in similar business fields contemplating strategic alliances and reorganisations have been particularly interesting . One of the symbolic deals of this type was Panasonic Corporation 's acquisition of Sanyo Electric , where the principal line of business of both companies was the manufacture and sale of electronics and electric equipment . On the other hand , M&amp;A transactions of a more purely financial or investment-type nature have decreased in the past year . <p> According to Mergers &amp; Acquisition Research Report , the largest M&amp;A transactions relating to Japanese companies announced in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in Morgan Stanley for 948,860 million ( $9.65 billion ) ; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company 's acquisition of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for 899,888 million ; Shinsei Bank 's acquisition of GE Consumer Finance for 580,000 million ; and Panasonic Corporation 's acquisition of Sanyo Electric for 567,098 million . It was also reported that tender offer activity , which achieved a record amount in 2007 ( 3,149 billion ) , decreased in amount to 986 billion in 2008 . <h> Foreign restrictions <p> Under the Corporate Law , the transfer of the shares or business of a Japanese company to a foreign entity pursuant to a mutual agreement between the buyer and the seller may be freely consummated . Japanese law does not permit a foreign corporation to merge directly with a Japanese corporation ; however , the shares of a foreign corporation may be used as consideration in statutory corporate reorganisations involving Japanese corporations , such as statutory mergers , stock swaps and corporate splits ( demergers ) under the Corporate Law . For example , a foreign acquirer that wants to acquire a Japanese company may use a triangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target Japanese company will be merged , with shares of a foreign company being distributed to the target Japanese company 's shareholders as consideration . This type of transaction has only been permitted since May 2007 when prior restrictions on merger consideration ( which limited consideration to shares of the surviving Japanese company ) were lifted , and there have subsequently been a couple of cross-border transactions consummated using a triangular merger structure . <p> The FEFTL regulates foreign investors in Japanese companies . In most cases , foreign investors are only required to file a report with the Bank of Japan within 15 days of an inward investment that includes any acquisition of shares in a closely held company , or an acquisition of more than 10% of a publicly listed company 's outstanding shares . Prior notification requirements for inward foreign direct investment , however , apply to specific cases such as investments from entities in countries that have not been approved ( more than 160 countries are approved ) , or investments in certain regulated industries . <h> Disclosure <p> In statutory corporate reorganisations such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporate Law , there is a list of matters that must be disclosed . Among other things , information relating to adequacy of consideration must be disclosed . In a triangular merger , the matters to be disclosed are more detailed than is the case with a statutory corporate reorganisation that uses the shares of the direct acquirer as consideration . <p> There are also a number of disclosure requirements in connection with tender offers . The tender offer regulations under the FIEL generally apply when certain percentage acquisition thresholds are to be crossed as a result of off-market ( and certain types of on-market ) purchases . A public tender offer would ordinarily be required if such off-market transactions of a listed company would result in ownership of more than one-third of outstanding shares , but they may also be applicable in some situations when a 5% threshold would be crossed . <p> While there were a number of notable amendments to the FIEL that became effective as of December 2008 , several stiffened the sanctions for violations of disclosure requirements . For example , an administrative monetary penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other documents filed by tender offerors . The FIEL already imposed civil liabilities and criminal penalties in relation to tender offer statements . Unlike criminal liabilities and civil liabilities , however , administrative penalties can be imposed without proof of negligence on the part of a tender offeror so long as a document contains false statements with respect to any material facts , or omits to state any material facts required to be stated . Thus , it is intended that the implementation of an administrative monetary penalty system will be more effective in deterring violations of disclosure obligations . <p> An administrative monetary penalty system was also implemented in connection with shareholders who neglect to submit required reports with respect to large shareholdings or who make material mis-statements or omissions in connection with those reports . Under the FIEL , a holder of more than 5% of the shares of a listed company is generally required to submit a large shareholding report and thereafter has certain continuous reporting obligations . <p> These amendments are part of a concerted effort by the Japanese government , stock exchanges and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A takeover can be achieved through a statutory corporate reorganisation , such as a statutory merger , stock swap or corporate split , as well as through a contractual business transfer , share acquisition or some combination of the above . Control may also be acquired through the target company 's issuance of shares , stock acquisition rights , or convertible bonds , particularly in cases where the target company is seeking new capital . <p> When an acquirer contemplates acquiring 100% of the shares of a listed company using cash consideration , it ordinarily conducts a tender offer to purchase a significant percentage of the shares of the target as a first step . After successful completion of the tender offer , the acquirer would then proceed to cash out any remaining minority shareholders using either a statutory corporate reorganisation or a somewhat technical scheme involving classified shares . <p> If the acquirer is itself a listed Japanese company and wants to use its own shares as consideration , it is not uncommon to conduct a statutory corporate reorganisation with the target without a first-step tender offer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of M&amp;A transactions involving listed companies over the last few years , there have recently been decisions issued in several notable court cases relating to takeover transactions . <p> Examples of the issues addressed by these cases include the following : <p> i ) Right of access to a list of shareholders by a shareholder who was a business competitor of the target in the context of a proxy fight ( Tokyo High Court , June 12 2008 ) : The court set forth a rule that permitted the business competitor of the company to access the company 's list of shareholders . <p> ii ) Issuance of new shares to a White Knight in the context of a contest for corporate control ( Tokyo District Court , June 23 2008 ) : The court enjoined the issuance of new shares to the White Knight pursuant to a primary purpose rule that has been adopted as a general rule by a number of court decisions . Generally speaking , this rule provides that the issuance of new shares can be enjoined by action of shareholders if the primary motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third party is to affect the contest for corporate control , rather to procure funds . <p> iii ) Appraisal of the fair value of shares of the target company in a cash-out process conducted as a part of a Management Buy-Out ( MBO ) transaction ( Tokyo High Court , September 12 2008 ) : The court stipulated that in deciding the fair value of the shares acquired in a cash-out process , it is necessary to take into account the expected future price increase of which the shareholder would be deprived as a result of compulsory acquisition , in addition to the objective value of the share . As a result , the court appraised the shares to be acquired in the cash-out process at 336,966 per share , as opposed to the 230,000 per share amount that was the original price in cash-out process offered by the target as well as the offer price proposed by the acquirer in the first-step tender offer . <p> iv ) Insider trading regulations in the context of an attempt to acquire a significant portion of shares of a listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Court , February 3 2009 ) : This case is a famous criminal case relating to an attempt to acquire a significant portion of shares in a listed radio broadcasting company . The important issue addressed by the court was a determination of the point at which the acquirer 's board made the decision to go forward with an acquisition of the shares in the listed company , after which point it would be unlawful for an insider aware of the decision to purchase shares of the target until the proposed acquisition was publicly disclosed . <h> Transactions involving financially distressed companies <p> The current economic recession will likely create a number of legal issues for M&amp;A transactions involving financially distressed companies . The issuance of preferred shares is widely used as a means to effect both a financial investment in , and a strategic alliance with , a financially distressed company . Preferred shares are sometimes issued as a part of Debt Equity Swap transaction .

There now appears to be an argument that a statutory corporate reorganisation involving insolvent companies could be possible under the new Corporate Law . Some critics are arguing that such a corporate reorganisation is now permitted , but subject to an issue relating to the adequacy of the consideration . <p> Issues relating to the disclosure of walk-away clauses in a definitive agreement require careful consideration , especially in transactions with financially distressed companies where the failure of the transaction would lead to bankruptcy . A material adverse change clause ( Mac clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch-all provision to allow the acquirer to refuse to close the deal in the event of certain unexpected circumstances . Especially in domestic Japanese transactions , the Mac is often provided without a detailed definition . A financing-out clause may also be found in a definitive agreement . <h> Insolvency procedure <p> There are three major types of insolvency procedures that are most often used in Japan : the Civil Rehabilitation Procedure , the Corporate Reorganisation Procedure , and the Bankruptcy Procedure . The Civil Rehabilitation Procedure and the Corporate Reorganisation Procedure are designed to return the company to normal solvent trading , whereas the Bankruptcy Procedure is a liquidation-type procedure . <p> Among these three major procedures , the Civil Rehabilitation Procedure is often used in the context of reorganising a business . The Civil Rehabilitation Procedure is characterised as a debtor-in-possession ( DIP ) type of process , but subject to supervision of the court and supervisor(s) appointed by the court . <p> The transfer of control of a company in the process of a Civil Rehabilitation Procedure is often achieved through a business , or asset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and applicable to a company in the process of the Civil Rehabilitation Procedure ? a business transfer may require approval of the transferor 's shareholders depending on the amount of the transferred assets in comparison with the total assets of the company . However , a company in the process of the Civil Rehabilitation Procedure may omit this shareholder approval requirement and execute a business transfer by acquiring the court 's approval instead of shareholder approval , if it meets certain conditions provided in the Civil Rehabilitation Law . <p> The transfer of control in a Civil Rehabilitation Procedure is also sometimes effected through the acquisition of all the shares by the issuer with no consideration and the issuance of new shares to a sponsor . <p> Japanese insolvency laws as well as the Japanese Civil Law provide a series of provisions setting out the right to avoid transactions executed by financially distressed companies .

One is the law of July 27 2003 , which approves the Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and their recognition and regulates fiduciary contracts . The other is the much-anticipated law on securitization of March 22 2004 . <p> The law on trusts and fiduciary contracts <p> The Law of July 27 2003 ( the 2003 Law ) is of considerable practical interest and pursues various purposes . Firstly , it ratifies the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition ( the Hague Convention ) . Secondly , it is intended to enhance the recognition of fiduciary contracts , previously governed by the Grand-Ducal Regulation of July 19 1983 and to broaden its scope by extending the categories of operators that qualify as a fiduciary . <p> Ratification of the Hague Convention <p> The conflict-of-law rules laid out in the Hague Convention prove useful for civil law countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules on trusts in their legal system . <p> The absence of a clear framework on how to assimilate a foreign trust had a particular impact on securitizations carried out by Luxembourg vehicles because the legal documentation , usually governed by English law , makes ample use of the trust . It normally provides for the noteholders to be represented by a trustee , who often also acts as security trustee , holding and enforcing security granted by the securitization vehicle for the benefit of the creditors of the vehicle . Although there was some fragmented Luxembourg case law on the question of the recognition of trusts , which gave effect , in certain circumstances , to trusts , some doubts remained and a recharacterization of a trust by a Luxembourg court could not be ruled out . <p> In this respect , the 2003 Law represents a significant improvement , because a trust created in accordance with the law specified by the conflict-of-law rules of the Hague Convention must be recognized as such . As a principle , Luxembourg courts have to apply the substantive law of another country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of that country , or , where no applicable law has been chosen , the substantive law of the country with which the trust is most closely connected . <p> The concept of trust has no equivalent under Luxembourg Law and it is not possible to introduce such a right in rem in the Luxembourg legal system , so the 2003 Law expressly determines the effects of a trust covering assets in Luxembourg . The rights and obligations of a trustee are determined by reference to those of an outright owner . This analogy does not prejudice the principle of separation of the estate formed of the trust assets from the personal estate of the trustee . <p> Fiduciary contracts <p> The 2003 Law defines a fiduciary contract as any contract by which a person , the fiduciant , contracts with another person , the fiduciary , whereby the fiduciary , subject to the conditions laid down by the parties , becomes the owner of the fiduciary assets . <p> As was stated above , fiduciary contracts were previously governed by a Grand-Ducal Regulation of 1983 ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be used for purposes as varied as wealth management , security and liberalities . It also served as a structured finance tool . In one of the more commonly used structures , a bank , acting as fiduciary , would issue fiduciary notes that incorporated a fiduciary agreement between the bank and each noteholder . The fiduciary agreement would set out how the fiduciary was to invest the proceeds of the note issue . The assets purchased by the fiduciary and any income received would be transferred to the noteholders , whose recourse against the fiduciary was limited to such assets . The proceeds and the assets acquired with the proceeds by the fiduciary together with any income generated by these assets would be segregated from the personal assets of the fiduciary by virtue of the Regulation , and this segregation would survive even in case of bankruptcy of the fiduciary . These transactions had no affect on the bank 's regulatory capital because they were recorded off balance sheet . <p> The 2003 Law , while repealing the Regulation , reinstated all its attractive features and substantially enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , in addition to banks , investment enterprises , investment companies of fixed or variable capital , securitization companies , fund management companies , pension funds , insurance or re-insurance enterprises or national and international public organizations operating in the financial sector , whether they are in Luxembourg or abroad . <p> Under the Regulation , the definition of fiduciary contracts did not correspond to the criteria of trusts contained into the Hague Convention , the scope of which includes not only trusts of common law countries but also institutions of civil law countries , whether these are patterned on the trusts of common law countries or otherwise bear the essential traits of trusts . The 2003 Law modified the definition and effects of fiduciary contracts to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Hague Convention . As a result , contracting states of the Hague Convention are bound to recognize fiduciary contracts entered into under Luxembourg law and must apply the substantive law related to it . <p> The law on securitization <p> The first securitization transactions were carried out in Luxembourg in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the main international centres for securitizations due to a large extent to an unobtrusive regulatory environment and a stable tax framework . <p> However , unlike countries such as France or Belgium , Luxembourg did not have specific legislation on securitization . In a bid to modernize the laws on the financial sector in Luxembourg , and mindful that the absence of a dedicated legal background created a few grey areas that were likely to hamper the development of the securitization sector in Luxembourg , the new law was passed on March 22 2004 ( the 2004 Law ) . The 2004 Law is a comprehensive text that spans all aspects of law that impact on securitization : company law , contract law , security law , bankruptcy law and tax law . <p> It has been designed to meet the expectations of the market by creating a dedicated yet flexible legal environment in which the market actors are able to pick and choose the features they want to apply to each individual structure . Existing transactions will not be affected unless the securitization vehicle expressly chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the 2004 Law to new transactions is elective . Only if a securitization vehicle issues notes to the public on a continuous basis ( the condition of the continuous issuance and the condition of issuing to the public being cumulative ) will it have to place itself under the 2004 Law and be licensed and supervised by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier ( CSSF ) , the regulator of the Luxembourg financial sector . It should be stressed that neither the conditions for obtaining a licence nor the ongoing supervision by the CSSF are onerous and any properly organized securitization vehicle that issues notes to the public on a continuous basis should be able to meet the legal requirements for obtaining a licence and conducting its activity as a licensed securitization vehicle . <p> Securitizable risks <p> The benefit of the 2004 Law will be available to all types of securitizations . Indeed , one of the merits of the 2004 Law , which differentiates it from legislation adopted elsewhere , is its broad scope .

The securitizable risk may be attached to assets of any nature , to obligations of third parties , or to the activities of third parties regardless of the way in which the vehicle bears such risk ( true sale , guarantee , swap , or any form of contractual obligation ) . Conventional securitizations , and also more recent forms of securitizations such as synthetic securitizations or whole business securitizations , fall squarely under the 2004 Law . <p> The 2004 Law introduces a host of provisions aimed at facilitating the transfer of risks to the securitization vehicle and dispelling uncertainties related to it . Here are but a few examples : <p> The 2004 Law sets out that the assignment of receivables is valid between the assignor and the assignee and enforceable vis-a-vis third parties by the mere agreement between the assignor and the assignee , that is , without notification to the third parties . Their protection is guaranteed by the possibility to discharge their obligation against the assignor , which from a practical point of view should not be detrimental to the assignee that often appoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also validates the true-sale character of a transfer of receivables where such receivables , subsequent to their assignment to the securitization vehicle , are transferred to a third party or even the initial assignor ( which is often the case when credit enhancement is obtained by an over-collateralization ) . The 2004 Law excludes the re-characterization of such transactions , for example as secured indebtedness of the initial assignor . <p> Finally , the 2004 Law clarifies the question of the enforceability of the assignment of receivables against third parties other than the assigned debtor ( as this situation is not foreseen in the Rome Convention on Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations ) and states that it is governed by the law of the state where the assignor is situated . This provision is in line with the UN Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade signed in New York in 2001 and may well become a more generally accepted conflict-of-laws rule . <p> In Luxembourg , and elsewhere , synthetic securitization and the transfer of credit risks by means of credit derivates have caused some concern as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would require that the seller of insurance obtain a licence . The 2004 Law expressly excludes securitization transactions from the realm of the Luxembourg law of December 6 1991 governing the insurance sector . <p> Securitization vehicles <p> The 2004 Law proposes two forms of securitization vehicles . One is a special purpose company , the other a securitization fund managed by a management company . <p> The securitization company <p> The securitization company may be set up exactly as was done before the 2004 Law , but the company may now elect to place itself under the 2004 Law . <p> It may be subdivided into autonomous compartments . The 2004 Law also allows a dissociation of the acquisition and issuing functions , which can be performed by different entities . It is therefore possible to reach outstanding levels of customization in the design of securitization structures depending on the characteristics of each project and on the desired risk-allocation pattern . <p> The distinctive feature of the securitization company compared with the securitization fund is that the former has full legal and tax personality . It remains subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize . Consequently , the securitization company is fully entitled to tax treaty benefits , which is sometimes an essential feature of the securitization structure . <p> Securitization companies are exempt from net worth tax . Like securitization funds , they bear a fixed capital contribution duty ( maximum 1,250 ( $1,509 ) ) instead of the regular 1% duty , and their management by an external management company is not subject to VAT . <p> As a matter of principle , there is no withholding tax ( WHT ) in Luxembourg on payments of all items of income from capital other than dividends . In particular , Luxembourg does not apply any WHT on interest paid by one of its residents to either a resident or a non-resident . The WHT exemption also covers dividend payments made by securitization companies on shares . Shares and bonds issued by securitization companies are exempt from any duty . <p> Securitization funds <p> The securitization vehicle may also take the form of a securitization fund , managed by a management company . Although the fund has no legal personality , the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their participation . Securitization funds are of an exclusively contractual nature . The fund can be structured through a Luxembourg law fiduciary agreement , under which its assets will be held by a fiduciary . Alternatively , simple co-ownership of the fund 's assets by the investors is also possible . <p> Each fund has a set of management regulations . If the fund has compartments , it is possible to specify a different set of management regulations for each compartment . <p> The fund has to be managed by a management company , acting in the exclusive interest of the fund and the investors . <p> Unlike securitization companies , securitization funds fall under the tax regime applicable to investment funds . This results in securitization funds being exempt from all direct taxes . The only difference with investment funds is that securitization funds are not subject to subscription tax ( taxe d'abonnement ) . They only have to bear a capital contribution duty ( maximum 1,250 ) . <p> There is no withholding tax on distributions made by the fund . Tax consequences will arise exclusively in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The management of Luxembourg securitization funds is exempt from VAT , that is , no VAT will apply on management fees paid . <p> Bankruptcy remoteness <p> Luxembourg securitization vehicles are insulated from bankruptcy to the greatest extent possible : <p> The rights of investors and creditors are limited to the assets of the securitization vehicle . If the securitization vehicle has created several compartments , the assets of each compartment are exclusively available to satisfy the claims of the investors who funded them and of the creditors whose claims arose in connection with these assets . So far , this so-called limited recourse has been established on a contractual basis , but in the absence of any express legal rule and court precedents on this matter , its enforceability could not be guaranteed . It is now anchored in the 2004 Law . This recognition was awaited by securitization professionals , especially rating agencies , because limited recourse is essential in ensuring the bankruptcy remoteness of securitization vehicles , especially when they issue multiple series of notes , for example in the context of a programme . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility for a securitization vehicle to issue several tranches of securities corresponding to different collateral and providing for different value , yield and redemption conditions . <p> Subordination provisions between the securitization vehicle and its creditors whereby the creditors establish a ranking of their respective claims and so-called no-petition provisions whereby the creditors agree not to petition for the bankruptcy of the securitization vehicle are commonly found in securitization transaction documents . Until now there was some doubt as to their validity and enforceability . The 2004 Law expressly confirms the effectiveness of these clauses . <p> Trustee based in Luxembourg <p> The 2004 Law creates a legal framework for trustees ( **25;606;TOOLONG ) based in Luxembourg . <p> A trustee may be included in a securitization structure at the investors ' request or pursuant to the articles of incorporation or management regulations of the vehicle . <p> The powers of the trustee are defined by the investors or by the securitization vehicle , depending on the issues raised . <p> The trustee can act in the name and on behalf of the investors - the representative function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of the investors - the fiduciary function . The investors can transfer on a fiduciary basis the ownership of the assets and rights they hold and any security in relation those rights to the trustee .

Korea has repeatedly announced the mid-term target of emission reduction at 30% compared to the BAU ( business-as-usual ) of green house gases . While this target is considered to be quite challenging and ambitious given the country 's energy intensive industrial structure , the efforts to cultivate a renewable energy business have not been sufficient as Korea has placed significant importance on the large-scale development of nuclear power and LNGs to lessen its dependence on imported fossil fuels . As of 2010 , renewable energy resources comprised only 2.61% of primary energy sources produced , and energy generated from renewable resources comprised 1.24% of the total energy generated in Korea . These rates are the lowest among the 34 OECD member countries , and the government aims to increase the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 . <p> In 2012 , a dramatic change in renewable energy policy has finally been introduced after much fierce discussion . Feed-in-tariffs ( FIT ) , which had been adopted in most European countries , were previously assessed on each renewable energy source , and the renewable energy generators were able to earn a premium in accordance with the price table promulgated by the government . This usually represents the difference between the market price of the electricity and the power production cost using renewable resources . From 2012 , Renewable Portfolio Standards ( RPS ) has begun to be applied to major power generators . Under the RPS scheme , a certain portion of their supply of electricity is to be generated by renewable energy . The government replaced the FIT with the RPS on the grounds that the FIT did not promote the distribution of renewable energy technology as expected , bringing about instead an unexpected and heavy financial burden . In the meantime , opponents have been concerned that such policy change would discourage investment into renewable energy , especially that involving small-scale power technology such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price and demand . <h> Mandatory RPS requirement <p> The RPS applies to power generators with a capacity of 500MW or more , Korea Water Resources Corporation and Korea District Heating Corporation ( Target Generators ) " covering 13 publicly-owned and privately-owned power generators . The RPS in Korea does not directly regulate retail suppliers but instead imposes obligations on power generators . Both publicly-owned and privately-owned power generators are subject to the RPS . This is because only one power retail distributor exists in the Korean market and most of the big power generators are still owned by the public sector . The renewable portfolio to be supplied by Target Generators starts from 2% of all power generated ( net of power from renewable resources ) in 2012 , increasing by 0.5% each year up to 2016 . Thereafter it will rise by 1% per annum until 2022 , by which time the portfolio amounts to 10% . This ratio may be subject to adjustment based on a review of technology , performance and other circumstances by the Ministry of the Knowledge Economy ( MKE ) every three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are designed to promote photovoltaic technology for the first five years . Such provisions require Target Generators to supply a certain amount of energy generated from photovoltaic facilities ( Solar Carve-Out RPS ) . The amount gradually increases for a period of five years , beginning in 2012 and ending in 2016 . Furthermore , a Target Generator that has a facility with the capacity of 5GW or more is required to purchase not less than 50% of solar energy from power generators other than Target Generators that have facilities with capacities of 5GW or more . This rule aims to promote small-scale photovoltaic energy generators , which expressed great concern that the RPS would seriously undermine any incentive to invest in photovoltaic power . <p> The MKE is responsible for announcing the amount of energy subject to the RPS , as well as the Carve-out-RPS applicable to each Target Generator for a given year by January 31 of that year . <p> Target Generators are permitted to borrow up to 20% of the total amount of renewable energy they require for a given year from their renewable portfolios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quantity to be borrowed . <h> Creation and trading of compliance RECs <p> The Korean RPS programme also awards the Renewable Energy Certificates ( REC ) to a certified eligible facility to be used to demonstrate compliance with the RPS requirement . The REC is issued by the Korean New and Renewable Energy Center ( KNRE ) of the Korean Energy Management Corporation , as designated by the MKE . It documents one MWh of electricity generation from an eligible renewable energy facility . A renewable energy generator intending to qualify as an eligible facility ( Eligible Facility ) must apply for certification by the KNRE . The KNRE insists that the generator 's renewable energy facilities conform to designated standards for any given renewable resource . Within one month from the date of application submission , the KNRE inspects , usually by an onsite visit , the facility in question to decide whether it meets certification standards . Once certified , the generator ( Eligible Facility ) is automatically registered with the New and Renewable Energy RPS Management System ( Management System ) , which is created and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking of the RECs . <p> Only Target Generators , Eligible Facilities and qualified and approved brokers are permitted to be registered with the Management System and to participate in the trading of the RECs . Currently , however , there are no such qualified and approved brokers registered . The RECs may be issued generally to Eligible Facilities commencing commercial operation on and after January 1 2012 , and exceptionally to : <p> renewable energy power facilities passing inspection for completion and operation on and after September 17 2010 , <p> water power facilities with capacity exceeding 5,000KW , <p> certain renewable energy facilities receiving the FIT , <p> certain renewable energy facilities that are not supported by the FIT and that are not covered under the renewable purchase agreements scheme ( RPA ) , which was designed as the early action RPS plan , <p> off-gas power generators that obtained permits on or before April 12 2010 and passed the inspection for completion and operation on and before December 31 2011 , and <p> renewable energy facilities certified as green buildings . Furthermore , the RECs may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy generators in proportion to the support they offer . The RECs issued to the government will be used for market-making and market stabilisation , but detailed plans have not yet been finalised . <p> The issuance of the RECs is determined by using a weighted basis , considering the actual electricity generated from renewable sources to electricity distributors . Licensed electricity distributors are Korea Electric Power Corporation ( the publicly-owned entity and holding company for six publicly-owned Target Generators and of the Korean Electric Exchange ) , the retailer , and Korea Power Exchange , the wholesaler . For photovoltaic energy , four weighed points ( 0.7 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.5 ) are assigned . These depend on whether the facility uses existing buildings or structures , which land the facility is located , or whether the capacity exceeds 30KW . For the rest of the energy sources , five weighed points exist from 0.25 to 2.0 " the lowest of which is assigned to IGCC and off-gas , and the highest of which is assigned to offshore wind and tidal energy without embankment and fuel cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the RECs on a monthly basis , not later than 90 days from the end of the month in which they supply the corresponding amount of electricity . However , purchasers of the RECs under the RPA scheme may directly apply for the issuance of the RPS to themselves . Within 30 days of the application , the KNRE issues the RECs after checking the record of the electricity supply . The fee for the issuance of the RECs is KRW50 per one REC . Once issued , the RECs will be effective for thee years from the issuance date . <p> Target Generators must submit their performance report specifying the amount of their supply , as well as the amount of borrowing , if any , and the cause of borrowing to the KNRE by the end of February each year . When Target Generators submit the RECs for compliance purposes , the RECs are ' retired ' and the KNRE removes such REC from the Management System . <p> For the purpose of satisfying its Solar Carve-Out RPS , the six publicly-owned Target Generators may use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their equity ownership . <p> If any Target Generator fails to meet its RPS requirement , it pays the penalty equivalent to 150% of the weighted average market price for each unit of shortage . The method for calculating the weighted average market price is dependent on various factors : renewable energy sources , market prices for the corresponding year or three consecutive years prior to the corresponding year , and generation costs . <h> Transfer and settlement <p> The RECs are traded in the over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets , in which seller and purchaser enter into a sale and purchase agreement and report the contract to the KNRE for the transfer of the RECs . They are also traded on the spot market , where the sales are executed via auction or tendering . The spot market opens once a month , every Wednesday and every Thursday of the third week of each month , the former for the photovoltaic RECs and the latter for the rest of energy sources . This year the first spot market of the year opened on February 28 and 29 . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price of approximately US$20.5 , and 1031 RECs were traded on the spot market for the rest of energy sources at an average price of about US$4 . <p> In order to meet the requirement of the Solar Carve-Out RPS , Target Generators may request that the KNRE select photovoltaic generators for them . They then enter into contract with qualified photovoltaic generators selected via tendering procedures , and the purchaser buys the entire amount of the RECs to be issued to such selected generators for not less than 12 years . <p> The secondary market is not created for the RECs in Korea since regulation prohibits REC purchasers from reselling the RECs . <p> The settlement of the price is not made within the Management System but by the contracted parties . Within five business days of rendering payment , the parties register the transaction with the Management System . The transfer of ownership for the RECs occurs by later of either the registration date of payment by the seller , or the payment date for fees to the KNRE . <h> Legal issues <p> In comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in renewable resources . The price of the RECs is hard to estimate in advance , and the financial feasibility study for the development of renewable resources is more difficult . However , a generator that can produce electricity from renewable resources with lower generation costs may encounter better market opportunities under the new RPS scheme . <p> The general prohibition of resale of the RECs also operates as an obstacle for investment in renewable energy . Regardless of the OTC market and spot-market transactions , purchasers can not re-transfer the RECs . But it is unclear whether this prohibition applies to forward contracts for buying and selling the RECs that have yet to be created . For example , it is unclear whether Target Generator A that enters into a sale and purchase agreement with a company desiring to be an Eligible Facility may transfer its right to Target Generator B. It is reasonable to interpret that the prohibition of resale of the RECs applies only to the issued RECs , since the current registration requirement of the REC transaction and other regulations on the REC transaction market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrower can pledge the RECs is also in dispute . It seems that the Management System does not recognise the creation of a security interest in the RECs . If the ownership of the RECs is to be construed as a right to environmental benefits and attributes relating to renewable energy generations , such ownership of right may be pledged by notifying the obligor with a fixed date stamp and by possessing the certificates . However , the RECs are a hybrid of property and administrative certification , and it is questionable whether such hybrid form can be secured under the Civil Act of Korea . Also , it is clearly stated in the regulations that possession of the certificate alone does not represent ownership of the effective rights , and the transfer and removal of the RECs are made through the Management System by the KNRE . Furthermore , it is hard to determine whether the KNRE owes obligations to owners of the RECs for their rights , which is the case for property rights under the Civil Act . <p> Unclear attributes of the RECs raise further issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that transactions regarding the RECs are subject to Value Added Tax , since intangible property under VAT laws include any manageable natural force and rights . However , it is still unclear whether the RECs are regarded as underlying assets or commodities under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act ( FISCMA ) or under the Debtor Rehabilitation and the Bankruptcy Act ( DRBA ) . If the RECs are regarded as underlying assets or commodities , forward contracts with the price to be determined based on the market index as well as purchasers of such forward contracts fall under the purview of FISCMA . Accordingly , such forward contracts are not subject to cancellation or termination even in the case of the seller 's bankruptcy . <p> Do-Yo Kim is a partner at Jipyong Jisung Attorneys at Law , adviser to the Ministry of the Knowledge and Economy on climate change , and is a member of the Korean Delegate to the UNFCCC conference .

If the shareholding ratio increases or decreases by more than 2.5% , the holder must also file an exceptional report by the 15th day of the month after the month during which the increase or decrease occurs . <h> Amendment to exceptional reporting <p> In one of several cases in Japan that have recently captured public attention , a discretional investment advisory company for an activist fund , widely known as an outspoken shareholder , made a sudden acquisition and disposal of shares to temporarily become a large shareholder . At the same time another company made a proposal for management restructuring as a large shareholder to a listed company . Because that investment advisory company was eligible for the exceptional reporting and the shareholding ratio was less than 10% , it did not need to file a report on change within five business days , but rather could wait until the 15th of the month after its relevant record date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact on a timely basis that it had obtained and disposed of the target shares at issue when a merger proposal had been made . This event has highlighted the need for big changes in shareholdings to be disclosed to the public as soon as practical . This led to the amendments to the SEL in 2006 in respect to the exceptional reporting . <p> The 2006 amendment comes into effect in three steps . In December 2006 , a change regarding eligibility for the exceptional reports will take effect . Enforcement of the new exceptional reporting ( which was previously on a quarterly basis , but will change to a two-week regular basis ) is expected to begin in January 2007 . Lastly , compulsory filing through EDINET ( Electronic Disclosure for Investors ' NETwork ) is scheduled to start from April 1 2007 . <h> The material proposal exclusion <p> On one occasion , the above-mentioned investment advisory company described the purpose of holding shares of a listed electric railway company as a " pure investment under a discretionary investment advisory contract , " but made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . One of the requirements for exceptional reporting was that the purpose of holding the shares must not be to control the business of the issuer , which was criticized as being unclear . Accordingly , the new law replaced this purpose restriction with other wording to the effect that the purpose of holding shares must not be to make material proposals that would materially change or influence the business of the issuers . Material proposals include proposals made to officers ( such as directors and executive officers ) or proposals made at an issuer 's shareholders meeting regarding the issuer 's ( or its subsidiaries ' ) : ( a ) acquisition or disposal of material assets or the whole or a material part of the material business ; ( b ) appointment and/or removal of representative directors ; ( c ) a material change of members of the board of directors ; ( d ) restructuring of the issuer such as a merger and company split ; and ( e ) dividend policy and/or capital policy . <p> The 2006 amendment introduced some other related changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional investor is eligible for the exceptional reporting but changes its purpose and makes certain material proposals . <p> Once this amendment takes effect , a so-called activist fund would be unable to take advantage of the exceptional reporting if it aims to make a proposal to , for instance , go private through a management buyout and listing a subsidiary of the issuer . Instead it must file a report on change before making material proposals . Similarly , if an institutional investor , who is subject to exceptional reporting and has not made any proposals , wishes to request higher dividends to directors of an issuer at a shareholders meeting , it must file a large holding report five business days before the meeting . But despite this detailed provision , some uncertainty remains regarding the interpretation of material proposals , and in determining whether an action constitutes a material proposal , such as where the investor asks questions of directors in an implicitly coercive tone regarding items at a meeting . <h> Reporting twice a month <p> The regulatory changes should come into effect from January 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for the exceptional reporting to set its record date twice a month and to file reports within five business days from these record dates ( not by the 15th day of the next month , as was previously required ) . Along with this amendment and under another new rule , an institutional investor will have to make a report within five business days from the day it decreases its shareholding ratio below 10% . It is not required to make a report at this time , but must file by the relevant reporting due date if an event occurs under the pre-amendment regulations . <p> There used to be only four record dates a year , but there will now be at least 24 . This facilitates earlier and more frequent disclosure by all institutional investors , who could possibly act as active shareholders , providing general investors with more market information . On the other hand , it means that all institutional investors have to check every two weeks whether their shareholding ratio of listed companies exceeds 5% or has changed by more than 1% , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is argued that such frequent reporting of institutional investors ' transactions could have an unnecessary impact on the market , and might increase the risk that professional speculators seriously damage the market . If this happened , it would disadvantage general investors . <h> Compulsory EDINET reporting <p> Large holding reports are made available for public inspection on a paper basis and also electronically through an internet website , called EDINET ( Electronic Disclosure for Investors ' NETwork ) . Holders may elect to file either by submitting paper documentation or through EDINET . However , beginning from April 1 2007 , large holding reports may only be filed through EDINET . ( It will not be necessary to separately send a copy to the stock exchange but a copy must still be sent to the issuer . ) Filing through EDINET requires certain procedural steps to be taken , such as registering and acquiring I 'd numbers and passwords . So any investors , Japanese or foreign , who could possibly be obliged to make large holding reports should allow enough time for this preparation , because registration could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fails to file a report or who files a report containing any material false statement is subject to criminal penalty , and the maximum level of the penalty has been raised in the course of recent amendments to the SEL . As a result , criminal breaches could lead to imprisonment for up to five years or a fine of up to 5 million ( $43,500 ) , or both . In case of a company 's breach , the fine would be up to 500 million . Given such strengthened penalties , it is reasonable to infer that the competent body might tighten its supervisory practice with regard to large holding reports , including providing it with the power to inspect books or other materials held by a holder , any of its joint holders or concerned parties . <h> Scaring off investors ? <p> It has been acknowledged that increasing reporting frequency might cause institutional investors to avoid the Japanese market . Some foreign investors , who are not familiar with the extent of the publicity received by the cases ( and other similar cases ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting system . This is more than understandable , especially considering the fact that the amendment law was introduced six months before the scheduled enforcement of the first set of amendments , and that , at the time of going to press , the exact date of enforcement of the second phase has not yet been set . It has been argued that these amendments are experimental in nature . Whether or not investors will avoid the Japanese market is yet to be tested . But legislation that so greatly changes the environment for institutional investors should only be implemented after thorough research and careful analysis of the impact of the changes , and the application of the amendments should have been limited to specific listed shares . It has also been pointed out that , if these amendments result in the loss of investors in the Japanese market , this regulatory regime will need to be fundamentally re-examined . <p> Author biographies <h> Hirohito Akagami <h> Anderson Mori &amp; Tomotsune <p> Hirohito Akagami is a partner at Anderson Mori &amp; Tomotsune , engaged principally in the fields of financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities work and M&amp;A .

Revised PPP legislation has been drafted but by November 2016 there has been no progress with regards to its enactment . General procurement laws and regulations no longer apply directly to PPP projects following changes in 2014 . Both solicited and unsolicited PPP proposals are envisaged but in each case competition is now clearly required . <p> Local content requirements are an increasing area of development and are set out in detail in recent legislation for oil and gas . The government tends to prefer public ownership of assets , so limited recourse projects are being developed alongside on-balance-sheet government projects . A draft bill of new legislation has recently been circulated for comment , seeking to clearly permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees of contractual obligations of public entities . However , the draft does not yet clearly enable this , so it is hoped the final Act will be appropriately amended . <h> Section 2 : ECAs and Multilaterals <h> 2.1 What role have export credit agencies , multilateral agencies and international financial institutions played in supporting project finance transactions in your jurisdiction ? Please include an overview of the main institutions domiciled in your jurisdiction . <p> There are many international agencies operating in Tanzania , including export credit agencies ( among them the African Export-Import Bank , Nordic Development Fund and OPEC Fund for International Development ) , multilateral finance institutions ( for example the International Finance Corporation and African Development Bank ) , and other finance agencies ( including KfW , USAID , Canadian CIDA and Swedish SIDA ) .

However , there are restrictions on foreign investment in certain sectors , such as mining , telecommunications and shipping , which require some local ownership . <p> Recent 2016 legislation requires large scale Special Mining Licence ( SML , being a mine project more than $100 million ) holders to issue shares to the public and list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange within one year of the SML , and to have a minimum 30% local shareholding .

However , note there is an equivalent requirement for the investor to compensate the contracting authority for loss suffered if the project is terminated due to the failure of the investor to meet its obligations . <h> Section 5 : Foreign exchange , remittances and repatriation <h> 5.1 What , if any , are the restrictions , controls , fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal , interest or premiums on loans or bonds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no major restrictions on remittances of investment returns or loan payments to parties in other jurisdictions , but there are certain foreign currency exchange restrictions for payments in Tanzanian shillings to or for the credit of a person resident outside Tanzania . <p> Withholding tax applies on dividend payments and to interest , except the government may agree to an exemption on withholding tax on interest paid to a registered financial institution or on interest paid to a non-resident bank by a strategic investor . <p> Payments relating to repatriation of capital and income to foreign shareholders in respect of direct investments are allowed . However , financial institutions making payments are required to demand audited accounts and tax clearance certification from the Tanzania Revenue Authority confirming up to date payment of taxes . <p> Foreign exchange laws require that interest rates in loan agreements reflect the prevailing market conditions for the relevant currency of borrowing and that the repayment period is tied to the ability of the project to generate enough funds to service the loans in a progressive manner . The loan agreements should not include conditions requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanzania , unless Bank of Tanzania consent has been obtained . <p> Generally , there is no restriction on a project company to establish and maintain an onshore foreign currency account in Tanzania , since any person may hold any amount of foreign currency and may open and maintain a foreign currency account with a bank which is an authorised dealer in Tanzania . <p> However , a company can only establish an offshore foreign currency account in another jurisdiction with approval from the Bank of Tanzania . The Bank monitors offshore foreign currency accounts to ensure that they are not used to facilitate unauthorised outward capital transfers . <h> Section 6 : Insurance <h> 6.1 Are there any restrictions , controls , fees or taxes on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies ? <p> Insurance policies generally are required to be placed with Tanzanian insurers .

Recognition of a foreign jurisdiction may be refused where a dispute relates to a matter that is exclusively governed by Tanzanian law <p> As regards sovereign immunity , where the government of Tanzania is a party to a contract , it is deemed to have waived its immunity , and will be subject to all liabilities that arise in the contract , as if it were a private person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the government . However , enforcement is restricted to payment by the treasury department of amounts due and no other form of execution or attachment may be used to enforce payment . <h> 7.2 Is English or New York law recognised as a valid choice of law in your jurisdiction ? <p> Generally , parties have a right in a contract to choose which law will govern the contract . If the contract is silent then Lex loci contractus will determine that the governing law will be the law of the place where the contract was made . <h> 7.3 Would courts recognise a foreign arbitral tribunal award or court judgment ? If so , what are the conditions applicable to such recognition ? <p> Tanzania law will recognise a foreign court judgment where there is a reciprocal enforcement of judgments agreement in place with that foreign country . In order for a foreign judgment to be recognised in Tanzania , the judgment must be filed , by way of an application to the High Court . The court will then recognise the foreign judgment , unless the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be contrary to public policy . <p> Further , Tanzania has ratified the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards . Therefore , a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Tanzania using the mechanism provided under the New York Convention . <p> Generally , according to the Arbitration Act , a foreign arbitration award is enforceable in the High Court of Tanzania . It is treated as binding for all purposes on the persons between whom it was made , and may be relied on by any of those persons by way of defence , set " off or otherwise , in any legal proceedings . <p> For a foreign arbitral award to be enforceable it must fulfil certain specified conditions , such as : having been made under a valid arbitration agreement , in conformity with the law , become final in the country in which it was made and may have been lawfully referred to arbitration under Tanzanian law . <p> A foreign arbitration award can not generally be enforceable if the High Court is satisfied that , for instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made or does not deal with the relevant questions , or goes beyond the scope of the agreement . <h> Section 8 : Security <h> 8.1 What types of security are usually seen in project finance transactions in your jurisdiction , and are there any notable exclusions , including assets which can not be secured ? <p> Collateral available in Tanzania includes mortgages over land , fixed charges over assets ( including cash at bank ) , share charges and pledges , assignment by way of security , ( including the benefit of contracts and receivables ) liens and floating charges ( together with security interests ) and guarantees . <p> There are certain classes of assets which can not be attached , which should be checked depending on the facts of the project security package ( for instance land or buildings belonging to an agriculturalist and immediately appurtenant land ) . <h> 8.2 Would the law of your jurisdiction enforce arrangements whereby debt is subordinated by way of a contractual agreement ( including in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings ) ? <p> Generally , inter-creditor agreements are commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust the ranking of secured creditors by way of contractual agreement .

Preferential debts include specified taxes , specified government rents and specified wages or salaries . <p> Tanzanian law recognises that any arrangement entered into between a company about to be , or in the course of being , wound up and its creditors will be binding on the company if sanctioned by the shareholders and creditors , subject to the right of appeal to the court by any aggrieved creditor for the court to amend , vary or confirm the arrangement as it thinks just . <h> Section 9 : Perfection , priority and enforcement <h> 9.1 How is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established ? <p> Generally , a security interest is perfected by registration at the Business Licensing Regulatory Authority ( Brela ) within 42 days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the insolvency of the company against the liquidator or administrator , or any creditor of the company . <p> Mortgages must also be registered at the relevant land registry and some documents should also be registered at the registry of documents . <p> The priority of security interests is generally determined by the date of the document and the priority of mortgages is generally determined by the date of registration at the relevant land registry , in each case provided it is registered in time and there is not an agreement otherwise . <h> 9.2 Are any fees , taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and , if so , are there lawful techniques to minimise or defer them ? <p> Nominal registration fees are payable for the registration of a security interest at Brela the land registry or the registry of documents .

Any attachment or execution against a company 's assets after the commencement of winding up proceedings by the court will be void . Any disposal of the company 's property , including things in action , any transfer of shares or any alteration in the status of the shareholders of the company without the court 's consent will also be void . <h> 10.2 Outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding , what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral/security ? <p> A project lender may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged to the lender , by giving reasonable notice of the sale to the borrower , or completing the blank share transfer forms and proceeding with the transfer where shares have been charged . <p> The lender can similarly take possession of any land it has a security interest over after service of a notice of default on the borrower and either lease the land or sell it 30 days after the date of the notice . <h> 10.3 What processes , other than court proceedings , are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement ? For instance , is contractual enforcement ( such as receivership ) recognised ? <p> A receiver may be appointed without court proceedings , subject to the terms of appointment set out in the relevant security interest .

After a registration statement has been filed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospectus . <h> Rule 433 <p> Rule 433 sets forth the additional conditions for use of a free writing prospectus . These include the following . <h> ( i ) Prospectus-delivery requirements <p> In connection with offerings of any Rule 164 eligible securities by WKSIs , and most primary offerings by seasoned issuers , the issuer and other offering participants may use a free writing prospectus at any time during the offering process once a registration statement has been filed. 132 There is no requirement to deliver a statutory prospectus in connection with a WKSI or seasoned issuer free writing prospectus ; a legend containing information regarding how to obtain a statutory prospectus suffices . <p> Non-reporting and unseasoned issuers , and other offering participants , may use a free writing prospectus if a statutory prospectus ? including a price range in the case of an IPO ? is on file with the SEC. 133 In addition , the statutory prospectus must accompany or precede the free writing prospectus , with two exceptions : <p> once a statutory prospectus has been provided , if there is no material change between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no additional statutory prospectus will need to be delivered ; and <p> in the limited situation where a free writing prospectus is not prepared by or on behalf of or used or referred to by the issuer or its underwriters ? for example , an article by an unaffiliated journalist ? and no consideration by the issuer or other offering participant is given for publication , no statutory prospectus will need to be provided ( although one will need to be on file with the SEC prior to the communication ) . <p> For electronic free writing prospectuses , this prospectus-delivery requirement can be met by including an active hyperlink to the statutory prospectus in the free writing prospectus. 134 In other words , a physical prospectus will not need to be delivered if the free writing prospectus is delivered by email . As for WKSI and seasoned issuer free writing prospectuses , once the registration statement has become effective a final prospectus must precede or accompany any free writing prospectus used by an non-reporting or unseasoned issuer . <h> ( ii ) Information and legend requirements <p> Under Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance of which is not included in the registration statement " . 135 But this information must not " conflict with " : <p> information contained in the registration statement ; or <p> information in the issuer 's Exchange Act reports that are incorporated by reference into the registration statement . <p> The SEC has explained that disclaimers of responsibility or liability that are impermissible in a statutory prospectus are also impermissible in free writing prospectuses. 137 These would include disclaimers regarding accuracy , completeness or reliance by investors ; statements requiring investors to read the registration statement ; language indicating that the free writing prospectus is not an offer ; and , for filed free writing prospectuses , statements that the information is confidential . <h> ( iii ) Filing requirements <p> With certain exceptions noted below , an issuer or offering participant must file a free writing prospectus with the SEC no later than the day the free writing prospectus is first used . <p> any issuerfree writing prospectus , which is defined as : 139 - a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or referred to by the issuer ; <p> any issuer information ( that is , material information about the issuer or its securities provided by or on behalf of the issuer ) contained in a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of or used by any other offering participant ( " but not information prepared by or on behalf of a person other than the issuer on the basis of or derived from issuer information " ) ; 140 and <p> a description of the final terms of the issuer 's securities contained in a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or any offering participant . <p> Information is considered prepared or provided by or on behalf of an issuer if the issuer or an agent or representative of the issuer authorizes the communication or information or approves the communication or information before it is used. 141 The SEC has stated that a selling security holder unaffiliated with the issuer is treated like any other offering participant , but a selling security holder that is an affiliate of the issuer and prepares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider whether it is acting by or on behalf of the issuer. 142 <p> Any other offering participant , such as an underwriter , must file a free writing prospectus it uses or refers to , and is distributed by it in a manner reasonably designed to lead to its " broad unrestricted dissemination " . 143 The SEC has explained that a website restricted to an investment bank 's customers or a subset of its customers will not require filing , regardless of the number of recipients to which it is distributed. 144 Similarly , an email sent by an underwriter only to its customers will not require filing , regardless of the number of customers receiving the email distribution . <p> There are certain exceptions to the requirement to file a free writing prospectus . These include : <p> issuers and other offering participants do not need to file a free writing prospectus that does not contain substantive " changes from or additions " to a previously filed free writing prospectus ; 145 <p> issuers do not need to file issuer information contained in a free writing prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering participant if that information is already included in a previously filed statutory or free writing prospectus relating to the offering ; 146 and <p> issuers and other offering participants do not need to file a free writing prospectus that is a preliminary term sheet , although a free writing prospectus that is a final term sheet must be filed by the issuer within two days of the later of establishing the terms and the date of first use. 147 <p> Under Rule 433 , offers of securities contained on an issuer 's website or hyperlinked from the issuer 's website to a third party website will be free writing prospectuses that must be filed ( unless a filing exemption applies ) . Historical information about an issuer , however , that is identified as such and is located in a separate section of an issuer 's website will not be considered a free writing prospectus if that information has not been incorporated by reference into or otherwise included in a prospectus for the offering , or otherwise used or referred to in connection with the offering . Information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may also be protected under Rule 168 or 169 without segregation , if the requirements of those rules are satisfied . <h> ( v ) Media free writing prospectuses ? the Google provision <p> Rule 433 provides that any written offer that includes information provided , authorized or approved by the issuer or any other offering participant that is prepared and disseminated by an unaffiliated media third party will be deemed to be an issuer free writing prospectus. 149 Nevertheless , the requirements for prior or current prospectus delivery , legending and filing that would otherwise apply to these free writing prospectuses will be deemed satisfied if : 150 <p> no payment is made or consideration given for the publication by the issuer or other offering participants ; and <p> the issuer or other offering participant files the media free writing prospectus with the required legend within four business days after the issuer or other offering participant becomes aware of publication or dissemination ( provided that the free writing prospectus need not be filed if the substance of the written communication has previously been filed ) . <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may include information that the issuer or offering participant believes is needed to correct information included in the free writing prospectus. 151 In addition , in lieu of filing the media free writing communication as actually published , the issuer or offering participant may file a copy of the materials provided to the media , including transcripts of interviews . <h> ( vi ) Record retention <p> Rule 433 requires issuers and other offering participants to retain all free writing prospectuses they have used and that have not been filed for three years from the initial bona fide offering of the securities. 152 <h> ( vii ) Minor deviations ? Rule 164 <p> The failure to comply with the conditions of Rule 433 will result in a violation of Section 5(b) ( 1 ) . Rule 164 provides some relief from the harsh consequences of such an event in the case of certain " immaterial or unintentional " deviations from the requirements of Rule 433 . In particular : 153 <p> a failure to file or delay in filing a free writing prospectus will not be a violation so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with the filing requirement and the free writing prospectus is filed as soon as practicable after the discovery of the failure to file ; <p> a failure to include the required legend will not be a violation , so long as ( i ) a good faith and reasonable effort was made to comply with the legending requirement , ( ii ) the free writing prospectus is amended to include the required legend as soon as practicable after the discovery of the omitted or incorrect legend and ( iii ) if the free writing prospectus has been transmitted without the required legend , it must be retransmitted with the legend by substantially the same means as , and directed to substantially the same purchasers to whom , the original free writing prospectus was sent ; and <p> a failure to comply with the record retention requirements of Rule 433 will not be a violation so long as a good faith and reasonable effort is made to comply with the record retention requirements . <h> Road shows <p> Rule 433 defines a road show as an offer ( other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering by one or more members of an issuer 's management , and includes discussion of the issuer , management or the securities being offered. 154 <p> Under Rule 433 , a road show that is deemed to be a written communication is a free writing prospectus , but with one exception need not be filed. 155 Bear in mind that the term written communication includes most electronic communications , but not communications ( other than TV broadcasts ) in real-time to a live audience that do not originate in recorded form. 156 Accordingly , a live road show is not a free writing prospectus , even if it is simultaneously retransmitted to other locations ( such as overflow rooms ) . In addition , slides or other visual aids transmitted simultaneously with communications of this sort would also not be considered written communications. 157 <p> The one exception where filing is required is for road shows that are written communications and hence free writing prospectuses ( such as pre-recorded electronic road shows ) in connection with an IPO. 158 But even these road shows need not be filed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fide electronic road show159 available without restriction electronically to any person ( for example on its unrestricted website ) . 160 Pre-recorded road shows outside the context of an IPO are considered to be free writing prospectuses but need not be filed . <p> Practice point <p> In view of Rule 433 , the SEC has withdrawn a series of no-action letters that governed the use of electronic road shows in connection with registered offerings. 161 Embedded in these no-action letters were many restrictions and conditions that will no longer apply to electronic road shows under Rule 433 . There will no longer be any reason , for example , to limit the audience of an electronic road show in any way , to permit the re-transmission only of a live presentation in front of an audience , to limit viewers to seeing it only within a 24-hour period or a limited number of times , or to prohibit the printing or copying of the road show . <p> Practice point <p> Certain road shows ( such as pre-recorded road shows ) will be considered free writing prospectuses . Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on free writing prospectuses , and prohibits disclaimers that are commonly inserted in many road show slides today . Failure to comply with Rule 433 's legending requirements would potentially turn a written road show into a non-conforming prospectus violating Section 5(b) ( 1 ) . <h> Endnotes <p> For purposes of determining whether an issuer qualifies as a WKSI , the determination date is the later of : ( i ) the time of filing of the issuer 's most recent shelf registration statement ; ( ii ) the time of the most recent amendment to its shelf registration statement for purposes of satisfying Section 10(a) ( 3 ) ; or ( iii ) the date of filing the issuer 's most recent annual report on Form 20-F ( if it has not filed a shelf registration statement for the prior 16 months ) . I 'd . Paragraph ( 2 ) . <p> The SEC interprets common equity for these purposes to include a class of participating voting or non-voting preferred stock of a foreign issuer where the issuance of the preferred stock results from requirements of the applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidation or dividend preferences and other terms that cause it to be the " substantial economic equivalent " of a class of common stock . Securities Act Reform Release , Section II.A.1.a. , at 26 - 27 . <p> An ineligible issuer includes issuers that : ( i ) are not current in their Exchange Act reporting obligations ( other than certain enumerated Form 8-K filings ) ; ( ii ) are blank cheque companies , shell companies , penny stock issuers or limited partnerships offering other than through a firm commitment underwriting ; ( iii ) have filed for bankruptcy within the past three years ; ( iv ) within the past three years , have been convicted of any felony or misdemeanor under certain provisions of the Exchange Act ; ( v ) within the past three years , were made the subject of any judicial or administrative decree or order arising out of a government action that prohibits certain conduct or activities regarding ( including future violations of ) the US federal securities laws , requires them to cease and desist from violating the anti-fraud provisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated those anti-fraud provisions ; or ( vi ) have had any registration statement subject to a refusal order or stop order within the past three years . 1933 Act Rule 405 , definition of ineligible issuer . <p> Securities Act Reform Release , Section III.D.3.b.iii(C) ( 3 ) ( a ) ( i ) , at 145 . In addition , such a security holder must evaluate whether it has access to material information about the issuer and whether that information is included in the free writing prospectus . I 'd . <p> Rule 433 defines a bona fide electronic road show as a road show that is a written communication transmitted by graphic means . 1933 Act Rule 433(h) ( 5 ) . If the issuer is using more than one electronic road show , the bona fide electronic road show must include a discussion of the " same general areas of information regarding the issuer " , management and the securities being offered as contained in other electronic road show or road shows for the same offering . I 'd . The SEC has stated that the bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects or provide the same information as the other versions , and also need not provide an opportunity for questions and answers ( even if this is done in other versions of the road show ) .

In 1991 and 1992 , the Mexican government initiated the privatisation process of the Mexican banking institutions . As a result of the Mexican Government 's intent on attracting potential buyers for the banks , there was a lack of due oversight of the banks ' transactions by the financial authorities , which allowed unlimited insurance of deposits These were guaranteed by the Mexican Government through the Banking Deposits Savings Protection Trust ( Fondo Bancario de Protecci=n al Ahorro ) , a government owned trust specifically formed for such purposes . <p> However , the disastrous implications of the 1994 banking crisis ? caused , in part , as a result of the government 's lax regulation and poor supervision of the banks ? forced the Mexican government to implement extreme economic measures . They wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systemic risk . Hence , important amendments to the regulatory framework governing the banking and financial sectors were enacted . <p> The Banking Deposits and Savings Protection Act ( Ley de Protecci=n al Ahorro Bancario or LPAB ) was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on January 19 1999 , becoming effective the next day . The LPAB regulates , among other matters , the insurance coverage of insured deposits maintained in banks by individuals and entities , as well as the financial support granted to banks aimed to protecting depositors ' savings . <p> Since the enactment of the LPAB , funds placed in banks are mandatorily insured and guaranteed , on a limited basis , by an independent agency of the Mexican Government , the Mexican Institute for the Protection of Savings and Banking Deposits ( Instituto para la Protecci=n al Ahorro Bancario or IPAB ) . The IPAB has the authority to ( i ) provide Depositary Insured Institutions with limited Deposit Insurance in favor of banking depositors , and ( ii ) suggest and oversee any capital restoration plans ( programas de saneamiento financiero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition to the limited deposit coverage granted by the IPAB , during 2004 certain regulations specifically intended to early identify financial problems of banks were enacted . This regulation is based on a ' prompt corrective actions system based on the capitalisation index of the Banks . <p> As a result of the foregoing , banking deposits ' coverage is comprised of two main elements : ( i ) the Prompt Corrective Regulation , as a preventive mechanism , and ( ii ) the limited deposit insurance provided and managed by the IPAB . <h> Limited deposit insurance <h> Deposit insurance <p> Quote of the insured depositary institutions . The IPAB manages a trust fund to which State-insured Depositary Institutions contribute for the constitution of deposit insurance . Each Bank usually contributes , on a monthly basis , an amount equal to 0.4% of its total liabilities . <h> Insured and uninsured deposits <p> Not all banking deposits are insured or covered by the deposit insurance . In accordance with article 6 of the LPAB , only funds deposited on saving accounts , checking accounts , deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credits derived from credit and debit cards are guaranteed by the deposit insurance . The insurance does not cover any investments in insurance companies , stock brokerage firms , development banks , investment companies , savings entibies and savings and lending companies . <h> Automatic deposit insurance coverage <p> Insured deposits of banking depositors are automatically insured by the deposit insurance , so there is no need for any such depositor to apply it . <h> Limited protection of the deposit insurance <p> Upon creation of the IPAB , a seven stage transition program was instituted , allowing for a gradual decrease of the deposit insurance coverage . Limitations on this insurance were imposed not only on the total amount of insured deposits , but also on the kind of the deposits to be protected , as stated above . Therefore , starting in 2005 and as per the provisions of article 11 of the LPAB , deposit insurance coverage of insured deposits is limited to a maximum of 400,000 investment units or udis ( unidades de inversi=n ) , per bank , and per depositor ( the deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount in charge of an insured depositary institution in excess of the deposit insurance limit will depend on the financial ability of the corresponding Bank to honour such liability . <h> Prompt corrective action regulation <p> The IPAB has authority to intervene an insured depositary institution as a protection mechanism of depositors ' interests . In that regard , the IPAB , together with the CNBV , are constantly monitoring the financial standing of each Mexican banking institution . They base their supervision on the Prompt Corrective Action Regulation enacted in 2004 . Furthermore , the Mexican Banking Institutions Act ( Ley de Instituciones de CrTdito ) was amended in 2004 to allow the CNBV to identify , during the supervision process , any problem evidencing the poor financial health of insured depositary institutions . It also provides the authority to preventively and promptly take any actions deemed necessary for the benefit of depositors . <p> As a consequence of the Prompt Corrective Action Regulation , the CNBV is entitled to classify each insured depositary institution in accordance with its fulfillment of the mandatory capital requirements . The CNBV may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is determined in consideration of the banks ' capitalisation standard ( fndice de capitalizaci=n or ICAP ) , which is the relevant benchmark for the measurement of said insured depositary institutions ' capital . <h> Conditioned operations regime <p> Notwithstanding the prompt corrective action regime , in the event insured depositary institutions are in extreme financial distress , resulting from their failure to achieve the necessary capital standards , the financial authorities are entitled to perform certain actions . These result in either allowing banks to operate under a conditioned regime , pursuant to article 29-Bis-2 of the Banking Act , or even to liquidate the insured depositary institution concerned . <p> In July 2006 , the Banking Act was further amended in order to facilitate financial authorities to promptly implement the aforementioned corrective actions in the event that a bank 's capital standard is below 8% , in line with the provisions of article 28 of the Banking Act . In such a case , a bank will be allowed to continue operating as on-going business , but will be subject to the regime . Under the conditioned regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely monitored by the financial authorities . <p> In that scenario , the bank shall be bound to comply with capital restoration plans that will be periodically reviewed by the authorities . Any restrictions imposed and applicable requirements to the undercapitalised insured deposit institution will also be periodically reviewed in order to determine whether the plan , restrictions and requirements are resulting in an increase of the capital standard . The conditioned regime also allows shareholders to recapitalise the bank without risking their ownership interests . <h> Receivership and liquidation of the bank <p> When an insured depositary institution fails to exercise its right to operate under the conditioned regime or its capital standard is less than 8% but greater than 4% , the CNBV must carry out immediate actions to intervene the operations of the bank . In accordance with article 138 of the Banking Act , if the CNBV determines that intervention is necessary , the IPAB shall appoint a receiver to act as the sole administrator of the Bank . It will be vested with full powers and authority otherwise granted to the shareholders ' meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's operations . The receiver may be assisted by an advisory board . <p> The advisory board shall be constituted by three to five members and appointed by the IPAB . The role of the receiver is to preventively manage the bank . The receiver must explain in detail every action taken during the performance of its duty , determine the actual assets and liabilities of the bank , and prepare an inventory . It must provide the IPAB with a report on the financial , accounting , legal , economic and administrative status of the insured depositary institution , in order for the IPAB to determine whether or not the bank should be liquidated . <p> If the capitalisation standard falls below 4% , the bank will be automatically liquidated . When an insured depositary institution has a negative capital standard , it becomes essential to protect the interests of the depositors . It is important to bear in mind that the current Mexican Bankruptcy Act ( the Concursos Law ) provides special regulations in the event an insured depositary institution is declared insolvent . <h> Insolvency matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous Mexican Bankruptcy and Suspension of Payments Law . Under the Concursos Law there is a single insolvency proceeding known as Concurso Mercantil ( Concurso procedure ) . The Concurso Procedure consists of two main stages ; the conciliation stage , and the bankruptcy stage . Both of these stages are supervised by the Federal Institute of Specialists in Concurso Procedures ( IFECOM ) . <p> The Concursos Law forms part of the Federal commercial legislation of Mexico . It requires certain jurisdictional prerequisites . Jurisdiction over a commercial insolvency case lies in the Federal District Court of debtor 's corporate domicile , or its principal place of business , as the case may be . The Concursos Law further provides that all claims against debtor must be brought before the court hearing the case , in order to avoid different courts hearing claims against the estate in a piecemeal fashion . <h> Involuntary or voluntary proceeding <p> As a first step , a creditor is required to establish a valid claim for payment of an obligation against debtor . If appropriate , the creditor would proceed to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , requesting payment of a debt . At such stage , the creditor would request the notary public or court officer to attest to the inactivity of debtor or its inability to perform its payment obligations . The purpose of this request would be to establish that debtor is in a condition where it can no longer perform its obligations , giving rise to a valid cause for commencing a Concurso procedure . Having established a valid cause , creditor could then file a petition with the court requesting the commercial bankruptcy of debtor . The debtor itself , any creditor , the district attorney , a court ( if the situation ever actually arises ) , and tax authorities in their capacity as creditors , may file insolvency claims . <p> A debtor may be declared insolvent if it has generally failed to comply with its obligations . For purposes of the Concursos Law , an individual or entity has failed to comply with its obligations if it has failed to repay its due obligations to two or more different creditors . The obligations of the debtor must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 35% or more of all the debtor 's obligations on the date on which the demand or insolvency petition is filed . <p> Failure to comply is also indicated if the debtor does not have any of the following assets in an amount sufficient to repay at least 80% of its obligations due on the date on which the demand or insolvency petition is filed : <p> cash and demand deposits ; <p> term deposits and investments becoming exercisable or due in a term no longer than 90 calendar days following the date on which the demand or insolvency petition was filed before the Court ; <p> customer receivables with a maturity date not exceeding 90 calendar days after the date on which the demand or insolvency petition was filed before the Court ; <p> securities or negotiable instruments available at the relevant markets which may be sold within a term of 30 business days , with a known value on the date on which the demand or insolvency petition was filed at the Court . <p> The debtor itself , any creditor , the district attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors , may file insolvency petitions . <p> With the involuntary petition filed by creditors , or the voluntary insolvency petition filed by the company , a guarantee must be posted to secure the examiner 's fee payment . <p> The court will rule against the creditor that filed the involuntary petition , or the company that filed the insolvency voluntary petition , to pay attorney 's fees and expenses ( the amount is regulated by statute ) , including the examiner 's fees , if any dismissal judgment is issued declaring that the company is not in insolvency status . <h> Preliminary stage <p> Immediately after the insolvency petition is filed and accepted by the court , it must request the IFECOM for the appointment of an examiner . Once the examiner has been appointed , it must report to the court , within the following 15 to 30 days , whether the debtor is in fact insolvent andi f it is in one or more of the hypothesis contemplated by the Concursos Law to be declared in Concurso . The debtor and , in cases where the insolvency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such creditors , may challenge the examiner 's report . The Court must resolve as to the solvency or insolvency of the debtor within the 15 days following the date of its receipt of the examiner 's report . If the court resolves that the debtor is solvent , the Concurso procedure ends . If the court resolves that the debtor is in fact legally insolvent , it must so declare and the conciliation stage shall begin . <p> The declaration of insolvency must establish that the debtor has incurred a general default of its payment obligations , and must include a provisional list of creditors identified in the debtor 's accounting records . This list does not exhaust the proceeding for recognition , ranking and determination of the priority of creditors ' claims . <p> Pursuant to the Concursos Law , the declaratory of insolvency will include the look-back date ( the date to which the effects of the Concurso Procedure will be applied retroactively ? 270 days hardening period ) . It also includes a declaration that the conciliation stage has commenced and instructions to the IFECOM to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the debtor to immediately provide to the conciliator debtor 's books , records and all other documents , and allow the Conciliator and interveners , if any , to carry out the activities necessary to accomplish their duties , and to suspend the payment of debts . <p> The declaration of Concurso will also include an order to register the resolution with the Public Registry of Commerce corresponding to debtor 's domicile . It also provides for the Publishing of an abstract in the Official Gazette and in one of the newspapers of largest circulation in the domicile where the procedure is taking place . Finally , there is an order to the Conciliator to begin the proceeding of acknowledgement or recognition of creditors , and to notice creditors to request the recognition of claims . <h> Stages <h> Conciliation stage <p> The first stage of a Concurso Procedure is the conciliation stage , which is purported to encourage a binding reorganisation agreement among the debtor and its creditors . This is a plan to avoid the debtor 's bankruptcy or liquidation . The conciliation stage may not last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two additional consecutive periods of 90 calendar days each . However , the Conciliation stage can not last more than 365 calendar days . <p> Once the commercial insolvency of the debtor has been declared , the conciliation stage will initiate and attempts to find formula to allow the debtor and creditors to come to an agreement will begin . A conciliator , who initially acts as an intermediary between the company and its creditors , must direct this attempt . The roll of the examiner and of the conciliator may be performed by the same person . <p> Pursuant to the purposes of the Concursos Law , the idea is for the conciliator to act as an amicable intermediary between the parties . One of the functions or powers of conciliator is to recognise claims based on the debtor 's accounting records in order to make the claim recognition process faster . The conciliator will also collaborate in the decision on whether the business will continue to be operated by debtor 's restructuring the debt , or whether it is necessary to remove existing management from the operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to preserve the operation of the debtor 's business . The conciliator is responsible for publishing the deadline for creditors to submit proofs of claims , processing proofs of claims , serving as a mediator among the debtor and creditors , and proposing to the court a plan of reorganisation . <h> Bankruptcy stage <p> The second stage of a Concurso Procedure is the bankruptcy stage . The debtor may be declared bankrupt if : ( i ) the conciliation stage finishes without having reached a creditors ' agreement ; ( ii ) the debtor fails to comply with the creditors ' agreement ; or ( iii ) the debtor requests its bankruptcy , or the conciliator requests the debtor 's bankruptcy and the court agrees to grant it . <p> In addition to the effects attributed to the declaration of insolvency , the bankruptcy judgment : <p> ( i ) suspends the ability of the debtor to perform legal acts ; <p> ( ii ) causes the appointment of a receiver , with full authority , to replace the debtor or the conciliator in the management of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtor and any third party having possession of the debtors ' assets to deliver all such assets to the receiver ; <p> ( iv ) requires that payments to the debtor only be made with the receiver 's authorisation ( failure to obtain such authorisation causes double payment ) ; <p> ( v ) invalidates any acts performed by the debtor or its representatives after the bankruptcy judgment without the receiver 's authorisation ; and <p> ( vi ) invalidates any payments made by the debtor after the bankruptcy judgment . <h> Special rules for insured depositary institutions <p> Under the Concursos Law , special rules are provided for the Concurso procedure of insured depositary institutions . It provides that only the IPAB or the CNBV may request the Concurso of an insured depositary institution . From the date on which a petition for the Concurso Procedure of a insured depositary institutions is filed , such insured depositary institutions shall shut down all the offices that provide service to the public . It must also suspend any type of borrowing , lending and service transactions . The court may adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the workers , premises and assets of the institution .

@@8538349 @1738349/ <h> Russia <h> Author : Published : 1 Oct 2006 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> As the body of Russian corporate legislation continues to grow ( as shown , for example , by a new draft of changes to the Joint-Stock Company Law of January 26 2006 ( the JSC Law ) , some key questions of control over general directors and director liability remain problematic . The common perception in Russia is that general directors are too powerful and insufficiently controlled by non-executive directors or shareholders , that minority shareholders do not have the necessary tools to block collusion between controlling shareholders and general directors , and that , despite the powers of the general director , as yet there is little evidence of actual accountability to shareholders . When considering the statistical data of the National committee on corporate governance , out of 1635 cases involving shareholders that were brought before the Arbitration Court of Moscow in 2004 , none resulted in liability being placed on company managers or directors . This is of course in marked contrast with the risk of administrative and criminal liability that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian directors . <h> Powers of the general director <p> The main executive body in a Russian company ( joint stock company inclusive ) is referred to as its sole executive body . Most frequently ( but not exclusively ) , this is the general director . The sole executive body is normally elected by the shareholders ' meeting , although the foundation documents of the company may provide for election by the board of directors or supervisory board ( which is unusual in practice ) . In accordance with the JSC Law , the main duty of the sole executive body is to " conduct the current activities of the company " . <p> The powers of the sole executive body , including a general director , are determined by the foundation documents of the company and also , importantly , in the employment agreement that must be concluded between the company and the general director ( Article 69.3 of the JSC Law ) . Under the JSC Law certain minimum authorities are conferred on the general director , which can not be constrained ( the exclusive competence ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company without having to produce a power of attorney . In a formalistic environment such as Russia , where it is common practice to request notarized and legalized powers of attorneys even for mundane transactions , this is viewed as giving the director considerable freedom to act . <p> Beyond this general right of representation , there are also other powers , including for example the right to hire and fire employees and the right to sign powers of attorney as might be necessary . The law also indicates that the sole executive body is competent for all other current affairs not reserved for the competence of the other governing bodies , that is , the general meeting of shareholders and the board of directors ( or supervisory board ) ( the residual competence ) . <p> Russian law specifically refers two types of matters to the competence of the shareholders meeting or the board of directors , away from that of the general director : the so-called major transactions ( that is , transactions involving more than 25% of the total assets of the company ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shareholders , or in which a member of the company 's board of directors , or management board , or general director has an interest ) . These transactions are clearly beyond the pale of general director control . For the rest , however , the law does not allow the indefinite expansion of the powers of the shareholders meeting and board of directors . There is a debate , for example , as to the enforceability of quantum limitations on transactions that may be entered into by the general director on their own authority . Shareholders will often seek to enter such limitations into the foundation documents , however their enforceability in relations with third parties may be questioned . Ultimately , on all these questions , there is still some sense of unpredictability or risk ( including in judicial proceedings ) . <h> Management board <p> In view of the above , one of the more logical routes to control the powers of an individual general director would be a collective executive , in which double-signature would , for example , be required . Russian law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorate , in the form of the pravlenye . However instituting a pravlenye will not usually achieve the desired result ( for example , double-signature ) because the pravlenye does not replace the general director as sole executive body . Rather , it coexists alongside the general director , the latter being the chairman of the collective executive . Ultimately , the general director retains the ability to bind the company on their own . For example , in the event of a three-member management board or pravlenye ( including the general director as chairman ) , it will not normally be possible for the two remaining members to prevent the general director from binding the company vis-a-vis third parties with their sole signature ( as chairman of the management board ) . In this case the only remedy against the general director will be internal , that is , termination , or possibly director liability in case of losses ( see below ) . <h> Management company <p> One of the unusual features of Russian company law is that the general director or sole executive body does not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation documents so allow , it is possible to appoint a corporate to the position of sole executive body ( or general director ) , meaning that the company will be managed by a management company , which will exercise all the powers of a general director and hold all the corresponding responsibilities . This form of corporate governance is now frequently used , in Russia , by the large privately held groups , because it is viewed as ultimately increasing shareholder control over the general director . In practice , when a management company is appointed as sole executive body , the work is executed by individuals who are employees of the management company and individually appointed to represent the management company when performing its duties . Such employees can be replaced or removed with greater ease than a physical person officially holding the position of general director ( and sometimes even named in the charter of the company ) . In short , many shareholders view a management company as a more pliant tool than a physical person in the same position . <h> Director liability <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly in Article 71 of the JSC Law . There are few ( if any ) precedents of judicial enforcement , before the courts , of this form of civil liability ( as opposed to administrative or criminal liability of directors , of which there are examples ) . <p> Under the JSC Law , all directors ( including the general director ) must act reasonably , in good faith and in the best interests of the company ( this is also repeated in Article 53 of the Civil Code ) . The JSC Law further indicates that directors are liable towards the company ( not the shareholders ) for any damages that their actions ( or failure to act ) cause the company , provided that these actions ( or this failure to act ) are constitutive of a fault . After the January 2006 changes , directors are now also liable towards the shareholders , as well as the company , for losses incurred by them in the specific case of breach of new tender offer rules on acquisition of large shareholdings ( in excess of 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle is that directors are liable to the company in the event of fault in the performance of their duties . The existence and measure of liability must be determined in light of customs of commerce and other circumstances . Customs of commerce is generally defined in the Civil Code ( Article 5 ) as rules of conduct that have taken form and are widely applied , but are not provided for in any specific legislation . This can of course be viewed as a fairly open-ended , race to the bottom clause , especially if the usual standards of conduct of business are not high . According to some commentators , the actions or inactions of directors constitute a fault that would lead to liability only if the actions or inactions were specifically performed with a view to causing damage . Poor business judgment in itself is not , by the same analysis , normally constitutive of fault . Directors are only liable if they voted for a certain resolution . Voting against ( or failure to vote , for example , in the case of absence ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JSC , general liability suits can be brought against directors either by the company or by shareholders owning more than 1% of ordinary shares ( derivative lawsuit ) . For the specific case of breach of the new tender offer rules for open joint-stock companies , the January 2006 changes now allow any shareholder to file suit ( regardless of percentage of shares owned ) . It has been pointed out that , in a JSC , shareholders need to own 25% or more voting shares to access copies of board resolutions . Beneath this threshold , therefore , minority shareholders ( including those owning 1% or more ) might simply not be in a position to access enough materials to enable them to consider a potential liability claim . <p> Perhaps as a corollary to what has just been said , Russian law does not look fondly on the question of limitation of director liability . Because the liability is statutory , it can not normally be limited in the foundation documents , nor for example in the employment contract between the general director and the company . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right of claim ( for example a shareholder ) could validly waive the right by contract ; under Russian law , it is likely that this waiver would have no legal effect . Lastly there is the question of director liability insurance . Such insurance appears legal under Russian law ( except for damages caused by fraud or other intentional misconduct ) , and certain Russian insurance companies have now begun to advertise such services . However , it is too early to predict whether and how the availability of insurance policies will impact the current market practice of not suing directors . <h> The paradox of minority shareholders <p> As mentioned above , director civil liability does not yet seem a realistic option for defending minority shareholder rights ( at least for now ) , and there is a sense that it is difficult for minority shareholders to effectively combat collusion between controlling shareholders and top management . <p> In one area , however , minority shareholders are given an extraordinary power by Russian company law , and that is in relation to the approval of interested-party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , under Russian law , as to normally include any affiliate that is more than 20% owned , or 20% of which is under common ownership or control . Importantly , a direct parent company also constitutes an interested party . <p> In accordance with the JSC Law , any transactions between the company and an interested party must be approved by a higher body , generally the shareholder meeting . The interested party , of course , can not take part in the vote . In groups of companies with minority shareholders , this means that any intra-group contract , even if concluded in the ordinary course of business , is subject to prior approval by the majority of the minority shareholders . This sometimes also applies to charter capital increases by the parent company . According to Article 83.4 of the JSC Law , if an increase of charter capital is performed issuing new shares representing more than 2% of the existing voting share capital , it constitutes an interested-party transaction , for which the parent can not take part in the vote . The operation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of non-interested shareholders . If a subsidiary company is 80% held by its parent , for example , with 20% held by various dispersed minority shareholders , to increase its subsidiary 's charter capital , the parent will need to ensure the prior consent of minority shareholders representing at least 10% of the vote . The minority shareholders have this right in addition , and in parallel , to their pre-emptive subscription right . In short , the law gives obstructive minorities ( which exist even in Russia ) the ability to block the charter increase altogether . Certainly by international standards this has to be viewed as another idiosyncrasy of Russian company law . <p> Biographies <h> Delphine NougayrFde <h> DLA Piper <p> Delphine NougayrFde has worked in the CIS since 1995 .

Only six cases transitioned to a second-phase review in the 2015 fiscal year . <p> In the 2015 fiscal year , the JFTC cleared four cases after second-phase review , of which one case was cleared with the condition that one of the parties implement a remedial measure . This was the case of NXP Semiconductors ' merger with Freescale Semiconductor , which was cleared on the condition that the NXP group sells its Radio Frequency Power Transistor business to an independent third party .

It can also be defined as a way of joining legally independent companies that are uniting resources to carry out specific projects . <p> Joint ventures are only a temporary structure : a contract that might constitute , for instance , a company or a consortium . It might or might not adopt a specific company type as defined by law . <p> Issues such as the liability of members to the joint venture are closely related to the legal type of company chosen to support it . If the members of a joint venture decide to incorporate a company , it is possible to limit their liability according to the type of company chosen to carry out the joint venture and its respective legal regime . <p> In Portugal it is usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , or at least one lasting for an unlimited period of time , to adopt the form of a stock company or a private limited company . <p> Various forms for companies can be associated under Portuguese law when forming a joint venture scheme to bring a group of companies together for a specific purpose or activity , including : <p> a consortium ; <p> an association in partnership ( associatpo em participatpo ) <p> a complementary group of companies ; or <p> a European group of economic interest . <h> Consortium <p> This is a particular type of contract , with a specific scope that is determined by Decree-Law 231/81 of July 28 ( DL 231/81 ) . According to this Decree-Law , a consortium is defined as a contract entered into by two or more legal persons ( individuals or companies ) that carry out an economic activity , to proceed with a specific business activity ( which constitutes the scope of the contract ) , binding themselves to proceed with that activity or to carry out a particular contribution , so as to : <p> carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity or to an enterprise ; <p> pursue a certain project ; <p> supply goods to a third party , produced by each member of the consortium ; <p> research or exploit natural resources ; or <p> produce goods that may be shared between the members of the consortium . <p> Any of the above-mentioned objectives must be common to all the consortium members , and all actions taken by each of them must be undertaken jointly . <p> Consequently , the basis of this contract relates to the obligation undertaken by all contracting parties to act jointly . <h> Aspects of the legal regime <p> Consortium contracts must be set out in writing . Formalization by way of a notarial deed will only be necessary if an element of real estate is included in the contract establishing the consortium ( for example , the creation of a security interest or the transfer of title of a given property ) . <p> The guiding principle of this form of contract is the freedom of the parties to define the content of the relevant contractual clauses . This prerogative is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consortium contracts and the mandatory provisions of the law in general . <p> According to Portuguese law , consortium contracts may adopt one of two forms : <p> Internal consortium : the activities or goods are supplied to one of the consortium members and only this member is empowered to establish relations with third parties ; or , the goods and activities are supplied directly to a third party by each consortium member , without declaring the fact that they are members of the consortium . <p> External consortium : the activities or goods are supplied to a third party by each of the consortium members , with an express reference to the existence of the consortium contract . This emphasises the organizational element and the joint actions of all members . <p> A consortium does not have legal personality and , as such , contracts entered into with third parties are executed on behalf of one or several of the consortium members ( depending on the terms agreed under the consortium agreement ) . This raises issues : for example , are consortium members subject to joint and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a general rule , each consortium member is liable according to the terms of general civil law . This means that the parties may freely stipulate in the contract clauses regarding the liability of the members . The joint and several liability exists between the consortium members in their relations with third parties ( even in the case of the external consortium ) because the limitation of liability is not presumed . Therefore it is possible to establish a full liability between the members , in which case this option must be stated explicitly ( usually under the expression joint liability consortium ) . <p> The same principle as that applicable to liabilities can be applied to profits , because the parties have full capacity to determine how profits are distributed . If this is not foreseen in the consortium contract , specific provisions of DL 231/81 apply . Furthermore , Article 20 of DL 231/81 forbids consortium members to create common funds ( any consortium member receiving funds from another member will be regarded as an agent of the latter ) . This prohibition applies both to internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the consortium was formed , it can be considered as envisaging a lasting relationship between its members although not for an unlimited time . Under Portuguese law the following situations are foreseen for the termination of a consortium : <p> Resignation of a consortium member <p> Pursuant to Article 9 of DL 231/81 , a consortium member has the right to resign whenever one of the following situations occur : <p> whenever , without fault , it becomes impossible for the consortium member to fulfil its obligations ; <p> whenever a situation that constitutes just cause for termination occurs , in relation to one consortium member , and relevant damage has occurred , and it is impossible to come to an agreement with the party breaching the contract . <p> Consortium termination for just cause <p> Whenever just cause for termination arises , it is legally possible to exclude one of the consortium members . If this situation occurs , the written consent of all the remaining members is required . Under DL 231/81 , a just cause for termination exists whenever any of the following events occurs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a one-off event or continuously , regardless of the existence of fault , with the members ' obligations as members of the consortium ; <p> failure to comply with the obligation to carry out an activity or a contribution . <p> Consortium termination <p> As said above , the consortium is not intended to last for an unlimited time , and Portuguese law foresees the following causes for its extinction : <p> unanimous agreement of the consortium members ; <p> fulfilment of the object of the consortium , or if the object becomes impossible to fulfil ; <p> the coming to term of the time limit established by the consortium contract , if there is no extension of this limit ; <p> reduction of the number of the consortium members to the extent that continuing the contract becomes impossible ( that is , when it is reduced to less then two members ) ; or <p> due to any other cause foreseen in the contract . <p> If none of these situations arises , and given the fact that a consortium contract is not intended for an unlimited period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its execution date . This termination may be delayed if the members expressly agree to a contract extension . <h> Association in partnership ( associatpo em participatpo ) <p> This type of agreement is also governed by DL 231/81 . The agreement consists of the association of two or more entities where one of them ( the contributor or associado ) participates in the profits , or in both the profits and losses of the economic activity of the other ( director or associante ) . While the contributor raises the necessary funds and/or goods to pursue an economic activity , the director manages this activity , and the funds and/or the goods raised , as if it were the owner . <p> These agreements do not have to be set out in writing unless the goods brought by the contributor require a special form , for example , when an element of real estate is present . <p> Throughout the duration of this agreement the director holds the title to the raised funds and goods . The director is liable to the contributor for any damages that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or funds raised . As in consortiums , common funds are prohibited in these partnerships . <p> Given the fact that partnerships do not have to be set out in a written contract , the contributor may remain anonymous in the dealings of the partnership . This form of joint-venture vehicle is not as commonly used as others because it represents a considerable risk to the contributor , considering the transfer of title to the funds raised by the contributor , even taking into account the fact that the director is under the obligation to report the results of the economic activity on a year-by-year basis . <p> The termination of an associatpo em participatpo will take place upon the occurrence of any of the following events : <p> insolvency of the contributor ; <p> termination of the economic activity pursued by the agreement ; <p> if it becomes impossible to pursue the economic activity ; <p> dissolution of any of the parties ; <p> merger of both parties ; and <p> unilateral wish of one of the parties whenever there is a default by the counter-party . <h> Complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporate entity incorporated to improve the performance conditions of an activity or the economic activities of an individual or corporate entity with legal personality .

It has the capacity to undertake all the necessary or appropriate rights and obligations to enable it to carry out its objectives . <p> A CGC 's members will be held jointly and severally ( and unlimitedly ) liable for the debts incurred by the CGC . There may be exceptions if specifically set out in the contracts signed with specific creditors . The creditors of a group may not , however , require group companies to pay amounts due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized first . <p> CGCs may not make and distribute profits as their main purpose . Article 1 of Decree-Law 430/73 of August 25 ( DL 430/73 ) , modified by Decree-Law 36/2000 of March 14 , also establishes that CGCs may make and distribute profit as an accessory activity when explicit authorization is granted under the terms of its articles of association . The incorporation of a CGC with or without its own capital is entirely at the discretion of the contracting parties and can provide an indication as to whether or not the group carries out profit-making activities in accordance with the terms with which it is allowed to do so . If the CGC foresees profit making as its accessory activity , the group members must make capital contributions , which will constitute the CGCs share capital . <p> According to Article 5 of DL 430/73 , the capacity of a CGC does not include : ( i ) " the acquisition of property rights or other rights in rem over property , unless the property is to be used as premises for the company 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own use " ; ( ii ) " participation in companies with a civil or commercial status or , in addition , other complementary groups of companies " ; and ( iii ) " the holding of offices in any companies , associations or complementary groups of companies " . <p> A member of a CGC may leave the group in the following two cases ( in addition to any further set out in the articles of association ) : <p> if alterations are made to the articles of association with which the member does not agree ; <p> ten years from the date the member was admitted , provided it has fulfilled its obligations . <p> The exclusion of a member must be approved by the general meeting and may occur : <p> when the group member to be excluded has ceased to carry out the activity that was deemed to be complementary to the CGC ; <p> when the group member has been declared insolvent ; <p> when the group member has failed to pay ( within the period established by the management ) the contributions for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or <p> in additional situations foreseen in the contract . <p> In addition to the grounds for dissolution as stated in the contract , Article 16 of DL 430/73 also establishes the following grounds for dissolution : <p> if there has been a breach of legal rules governing competition ; <p> if a direct profit-making activity as been persistently carried out as a main purpose ; <p> at the request of a member who has been held responsible for the overdue and outstanding commitments of the group . <p> Article 16(2) of DL 430/73 establishes that death , restraint , incapacity , insolvency , dissolution or the wish of one or more members does not determine the dissolution of a group , unless the contrary is foreseen in the articles of association . <h> European group of economic interest ( EGEI ) <p> The EGEI ( a contract based in EU law ) was created to increase cooperation between companies and service providers in EU member states . It is similar to the French regime of the groupement europTen d'intTrOt Tconomique , which was also an influence on Portuguese legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal regime applicable to EGEI is that of CGCs . <p> The law governing EGEIs is EC Regulation 2137/85 of July 25 , the Decree-law 148/90 , of May 9 , and the Portuguese Companies Code ( C=digo das Sociedades Comerciais ) regarding general partnerships . <p> EGEI members have unlimited personal , several and joint liability , and any EGEI member that leaves the group will remain liable for the debts resulting from the group 's activity before the date it ceased to be a member . Nevertheless , the Regulation foresees the possibility of an agreement entered into by the EGEI and a third party , according to which one or more EGEI members are liable for certain debts . <h> Joint ventures look to consortiums <p> All of these types of associations would be perfectly valid under Portuguese law , but it is most common for a joint venture in Portugal to adopt the form of a consortium to bring a group of companies together for a specific project , usually towards the incorporation of a commercial company .

@@8538362 @1738362/ <p> The Italian government has introduced a series of reforms aimed at encouraging economic growth , including a significant relaxation of legal and tax restrictions on the issuance of debt securities by Italian unlisted companies . This process began last summer with the enactment of Law Decree No. 83 of 22 June 2012 and has now been completed with the coming into force of Law No. 134 of 7 August 2012 and Decree No. 179 of 18 October 2012 ( as subsequently converted into law by Law No. 221 of 7 December 2012 ) , which made a number of amendments to the original legislation . Happily , the overall effect of the subsequent amendments is to take the reform process a step further , removing many of the more controversial aspects of what the legislator was originally proposing . <p> The provisions dealing with the issuance of debt securities by unlisted companies are set out in Article 32 of Legislative Decree No. 83 of 22 June 2012 , as amended ( " Decree No. 83 " ) and are summarised below but should be read in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the flow-charts ( showing the requirements and restrictions that apply to unlisted corporate bond issuers in a more user-friendly form ) . <h> Restrictions on bond issuance <h> Disapplication of statutory limits on bond issuance by S.p.A 's <p> Article 2412 of the Italian Civil Code imposes limits on the principal amount of bonds ( obbligazioni ) that may be issued and/or guaranteed by companies limited by shares ( societa per azioni or S.p.A 's ) other than banks , i.e. up to an amount equal to twice the aggregate of the issuer 's share capital , legal reserves and distributable reserves . <p> These limits no longer apply to bonds which : <p> are intended to be listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility ; or <p> give the right to acquire or subscribe for shares . <p> With respect to the previous regime , the main changes are as follows : <p> the first exemption previously only applied to companies whose shares were also listed on a regulated market , whereas it now benefits any S.p.A. , regardless of whether its shares are listed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed on a regulated market , whereas now a bond listed on a multilateral trading facility ( such as Euro MTF in Luxembourg ) would fall outside of the statutory limits ; and <p> the exemption for bonds that give holders a right to acquire or subscribe for shares is entirely new and , interestingly , it applies ( i ) regardless of whether the shares are listed ; and ( ii ) both to convertible bonds ( i.e. convertible into shares of the issuer or of a company in the same group ) and to exchangeable bonds ( i.e. for shares of a company outside the group ) . <h> Restrictions on bond issuance by S.r.l 's ? no change <p> The legal scenario for debt security issuance by a limited liability company ( societa a responsabilita limitata or S.r.l 's ) is somewhat different from that envisaged for an S.p.A . In contrast to S.p.A 's , there are no limits on the principal amount of debt securities that an S.r.l. may issue but , instead , there are restrictions on the type of investor to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 2483 of the Civil Code provides that : ( i ) the debt securities of an S.r.l. may only be subscribed for by professional investors subject to capital adequacy requirements ; and ( ii ) in any subsequent transfer of the securities to any other category of investor ( other than the issuer 's shareholders ) , transferors are liable to transferees if the issuer becomes insolvent . This is potentially unattractive to investors and , disappointingly , Decree 83 has not made any amendments to Article 2483 of the Italian Civil Code and the transfer restrictions remain in force . <h> A more favourable tax regime for bonds <h> Introduction <p> Although the legal obstacles to the issue of bonds and similar securities have in the past presented difficulties , the main disincentive for unlisted corporate issuers to date has been tax related . In essence , there have been two key obstacles : <p> for investors , the deduction of a 20% withholding tax from interest paid on the securities ; and <p> for issuers , severe limitations on the deductibility of interest payments for corporation tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the yield equal to ( i ) twice the base rate , for bonds traded on a regulated market , or ( ii ) the base rate multiplied by one and two-thirds , in all other cases . <h> Withholding tax <p> Where bonds or similar securities are issued by an Italian unlisted company and are traded on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility situated or operating in a white list country in the European Economic Area , as long as they are not atypical securities , the same regime applicable to bonds issued by banks and listed companies will apply , namely : <p> the issuer is no longer required to apply a 20% withholding tax on interest from the bonds ; and <p> as provided for under Legislative Decree No. 239 of 1 April 1996 , a 20% substitute tax applies ( normally via the clearing systems ) on interest , premium and other income from the bonds but , in most cases , investors in white-list countries and institutional investors in Italy are entitled to receive those payments without any deduction of substitute tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the issuer is unlisted and is not a bank ) , the withholding regime is unchanged , i.e. a 20% withholding tax is applied . <h> Deductibility of interest <p> The payment of interest on bonds and similar securities by Italian unlisted companies ( other than micro enterprises ) is no longer subject to the severe limitations on deductibility for corporation tax purposes that previously applied . This is as long as the securities are : <p> issued on or after 20 October 2012 ; and <p> traded on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility situated or operating in a white list country in the European Economic Area . <p> If the bonds or similar securities are unlisted , in order to benefit from the more favourable tax deductibility regime : <p> the securities must be held by qualified investors who do not hold more than 2% of the issuer 's share capital , either directly or indirectly , including any holding of shares or other interests via fiduciary companies or other intermediate persons ; and <p> the beneficiary of interest payments must be resident in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fees and other expenses related to the issue of bonds and similar securities traded on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility situated or operating in a white list country in the European Economic Area are deductible when incurred regardless of their accounting treatment . <h> Commercial paper <p> Under Decree No. 83 , limited companies , co-operatives and mutual insurance companies ( other than banks and micro enterprises ) may issue commercial paper ( cambiali finanziarie ) with a maturity ranging from at least one month to a maximum of three years . Decree No. 83 also allows for commercial paper to be issued in dematerialised form . <h> Unlisted issuer requirements <p> For unlisted companies , the issue of commercial paper is subject to the following requirements : <p> if the issuer is a small or medium-sized enterprise , it must be assisted by a sponsor ; <p> the most recent financial statements of the issuer must be audited by independent auditors ; and <p> the commercial paper must be issued and subsequently transferred solely to " professional investors " who must not be shareholders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these purposes : <p> a company is " unlisted " if its capital is not represented by securities traded on a securities market but , in contrast to the other provisions of Decree No. 83 , regardless of whether that market is a regulated market ( which means , for example , that a company whose shares are traded on an HKEx market would not be regarded as " unlisted " ) ; and <p> although " professional investors " is not defined in Decree No. 83 , it is presumed to mean qualified investors . <h> Role of sponsor <p> Where the unlisted issuer requirements apply , the role of the sponsor is , inter alia , as follows : <p> it assists the issuer in the issue and placement of the commercial paper ; <p> it holds a proportion of the commercial paper to maturity , namely : ( i ) 5% of any principal amount of up to Euro 5 million , ( ii ) 3% of any further principal amount falling within the band between Euro 5 million and Euro 10 million ; and ( iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euro 10 million ; <p> if the amount of the issuer 's outstanding commercial paper exceeds its current assets , it reports those circumstances ( presumably to the issuer , although the legislation does not specify ) ; and <p> it classifies the issuer at the time of issue according to its creditworthiness and publishes the classification . <p> All of this represents a much reduced role in comparison to that originally envisaged under the legislation , which included obligations to ensure the liquidity of the commercial paper , to carry out periodic credit assessments of the issuer ( i.e. not just at the time of issue ) and also to perform periodic valuations of the securities at least every six months . Nevertheless , there are doubts over whether operators in the financial markets will be particularly enthusiastic about taking on the role of sponsor . <p> The following persons may act as sponsors : banks , investment firms , asset management companies ( societa di gestione di risparmio or SGR ) , harmonised EU asset management companies or SICAV 's , in each case as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuer requirements <p> The unlisted issuer requirements are subject to the following exemptions : <p> the issuer does not have to appoint a sponsor if it is not a small or medium-sized enterprise ; <p> the sponsor is not required to hold a proportion of the commercial paper in its portfolio if repayment of at least 25% of the principal amount of the commercial paper is guaranteed by , inter alia , a bank or investment firm ; and <p> if the guarantee described above covers at least 50% of the principal amount of the commercial paper , then the statutory provision requiring the issuer 's financial statements to be audited is suspended for the first 18 months from its coming into force . <h> Taxation <p> The tax treatment of commercial paper has been largely aligned to that applicable to bonds and similar securities . <p> Subordination and profit participation clauses <p> Decree No. 83 also allows for the issuance of bonds containing profit participation and subordination provisions , subject to those bonds having an initial maturity of at least three years . For bonds with a profit participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit-related component ( i.e. depending on the financial results of the issuer ) but must also contain a fixed income component , which can not be less than the ECB base rate from time to time . <h> Questions and areas of uncertainty <p> Some of the questions arising from the Decree are set out below . <h> Limited liability companies ? no change <p> The vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in Italy are S.r.l 's . The selling and transfer restrictions under Article 2483 of the Civil Code make debt securities of S.r.l 's unattractive to the market and , disappointingly , Decree No. 83 has not made any changes to Article 2483 . One option for an S.r.l. might be to make use of the opening-up of the commercial paper under the new legislation . However , the issue of commercial paper is subject to a number of requirements which , as discussed below , represent one of the more doubtful areas of Decree No. 83 . As a result , one option for an S.r.l. wishing to issue bonds might be to convert into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from the relaxation of legal and tax restrictions under Decree No. 83 . However , any S.r.l. would need to consider carefully whether this might be outweighed by the loss of the benefits of being an S.r.l. ( e.g. lower share capital requirements and a lighter corporate governance structure ) . <h> Meaning of " traded " <p> To enable investors to benefit from the substitute tax regime ( including the possibility for many investors to receive payments free of substitute tax ) and for the issuer to benefit from the more favourable deductibility regime for corporation tax purposes , the bonds must be " traded " on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility in a white list country in the EEA : in other words , not just " admitted to trading " but actually " traded " . If narrowly interpreted , this would be problematic for certain bond issues , such as private placements , in which the intention of the initial investors may be to hold the bonds to maturity . <h> Unlisted bonds <p> For issuers wishing to issue unlisted bonds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the statutory limits on bond issuance that previously applied under Article 2414 of the Civil Code still apply , unless the bond is a convertible or exchangeable ; ( ii ) a 20% withholding tax would need to be applied ; and ( iii ) the deductibility of interest depends on the issuer being able to ascertain ( not just at issue but during the whole life of the bonds ) whether the investor receiving payment is a qualified investor who does not hold more than 2% of the share capital of the issuer and whether the beneficiary of interest payments is resident in Italy or in a white list country . <h> Commercial paper ? unlisted issuer requirements <p> The requirements imposed on unlisted companies wishing to issue commercial paper may be problematic , even though some of them have been significantly relaxed by subsequent amendments to Decree No. 83 . In particular , it is still not known how many banks or other institutions eligible to act as sponsor would be willing to take on all of the responsibilities envisaged under that role and , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commercial paper to maturity and to perform and publish credit assessments of the issuer may be unattractive . Similarly , it is far from clear how the issuer ( or anyone else ) can verify compliance with the requirement that commercial paper be held solely by non-shareholder professional investors and neither is it clear what the consequences of non-compliance would be . Furthermore , aside from any legal considerations , it remains to be seen whether there is a significant market for commercial paper . <h> Conclusion <p> As the Italian economy is largely made up of SME 's and unlisted companies , it is not surprising that the coming into force of Decree No. 83 has elicited extensive public comment , both from market operators and in the media . Overall , notwithstanding the areas of uncertainty highlighted above , it is fair to say that the legislation has successfully removed many of the legal and tax obstacles to the issue of debt securities by unlisted Italian companies and this can only be welcomed at a time when there is an increasingly pressing need for Italian businesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending from banks . <p> GLOSSARY OF TERMS <p> atypical securities <p> Debt securities not classified as bonds or similar securities . <p> bonds or similar <p> Debt securities classified as obbligazioni or titoli similari , which must contain : ( i ) an unconditional obligation to repay the principal amount at maturity ; and ( ii ) no direct or indirect right for bondholders to control or participate in the management of the issuer . <p> Decree No. 83 <p> Law Decree No. 83 of 22 June 2012 , as amended . <p> Issuers ?

However , pledges over rights are still a main security method in project finance .

As , the relevant facilities of utilities are owned by the government or government-owned enterprises , such assets are unlikely to be provided as security . <p> In addition , according to the Mining Act , only Taiwanese persons or entities are allowed to obtain the mineral right in Taiwan , and the establishment , extension , alteration , closing or transfer due to assignment or entrustment will not be valid without approval by and registration with the competent authorities . <p> A change of control in the project company does not automatically trigger a forfeit of rights in natural resources .

Under the Bankruptcy Act , the trustee may apply for the invalidation of the following acts made by the debtor , the project company , within six months prior to the bankruptcy adjudication : ( i ) provision of security for outstanding debts within six months prior to the bankruptcy adjudication except when the provision is due to a promise made by the project company more than six months before the bankruptcy adjudication ; and ( ii ) repayment of debts not yet due .

For instance , is contractual enforcement ( such as receivership ) recognised ? <p> A project lender and the project company may sign an agreement whereby the ownership of the mortgaged or pledged assets will be transferred to the mortgagee or pledgee automatically when the project company defaults . However , in the case of a pledged security , such agreement to transfer can not be enforced against a bona fide third party , and in the case of a mortgaged security , such agreement is not a valid mortgage , unless the mortgage or pledge is registered with the competent authorities . <h> 6.4 Outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding , what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral/security ? <p> In general , the project lender should ensure that it has all of the documentation necessary to enforce its security without any further action being required on the part of the project company .

For example , a legal entity may process the foreign exchange settlements against the New Taiwan dollar without further approval from Taiwan 's Central Bank , provided that the foreign exchange purchased or sold by a local company is within the annual aggregate settlement amount not exceeding $50 million , or the foreign exchange purchased or sold by an association or an individual is within the annual aggregate settlement amount not exceeding $5 million .

What legislation and/or regulatory bodies are responsible for regulating the relationship between landlord and tenant ? The Acts that govern the relationship of landlord and tenant in Ireland are the Landlord and Tenant ( Amendment ) Act ( Ireland ) , 1860 ( Deasy 's Act ) , the Landlord and Tenant Act , 1931 ( the 1931 Act ) which was repealed by the Landlord and Tenant ( Amendment ) Act , 1980 ( the 1980 Act ) and the Landlord and Tenant ( Amendment ) Act , 1994 ( the 1994 Act ) ( which amended sections 13 , 17 , 23 , and 80 of the 1980 Act ) , ( collectively known as the Landlord and Tenant Acts ) . <p> Deasy 's Act defines a lease as any instrument in writing , whether under seal or not , containing a contract of tenancy in respect of any lands in consideration of a rent or premium . It is founded on the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land under or from another in consideration of rent . The minimum requirements are that all leases , not being from year to year or for a lesser period , must be by deed executed or noted in writing signed by the landlord or his agent lawfully authorized in writing . <p> In essence , there must be an intention to create the relationship of landlord and tenant and compliance with the legal formalities laid down by law . Once these requirements have been fulfilled the tenant obtains the benefit of all rights and protections afforded to an occupier of premises under the provisions set out in the Landlord and Tenant Acts . <p> Notable exceptions are leases with business or commercial users stated to be for temporary convenience or to meet the temporary convenience of the landlord or tenant and which are excluded from the provisions of the 1980 Act pursuant to the provisions of section 82(b) of the Housing ( Private Rented Dwellings ) Act , 1982 . <p> 2 . What is the effect of a tenant 's insolvency and what remedies are available to landlords ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Companies Acts , 1963 to 2001 and the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act , 1881 . The principal mechanisms for dealing with insolvencies are as follows : <p> a ) LiquidationPursuant to section 290 of the Companies Act a liquidator has the power , within 12 months of the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as may be allowed by the court , to disclaim any onerous contracts entered into by the company . Failure by the liquidator to apply to the court within the 12 month period will render the liquidator liable to discharge all rents payable under the lease . Under section 295 ( of the 1990 Act ) the liquidator may not disclaim if he has failed to give notice of his intention to disclaim within 28 days of receiving written application from the landlord requiring him to decide whether or not he will disclaim . By virtue of section 290 ( 3 ) of the 1963 Act the disclaimer operates as and from the date thereof to determine the rights , interests and liabilities of the company and the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaimed . <p> Section 290 ( 7 ) enables the court , on application by any interested party , to make an order vesting the property in any person entitled thereto on such terms as it thinks fit . Section 290 ( 8 ) of the 1963 Act provides that where the relevant property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature the court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company except upon the terms of making the applicant subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company was subject under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up or , if the court thinks fit , subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date . This subsection goes on to provide that any mortgagee or underlessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all interests in and security upon the property . <p> A disclaimer of a lease by the liquidator amounts to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the company whereby the landlord can prove in a liquidation for the loss sustained by it as a result of the disclaimer as an unsecured claim . <p> Section 217 of the Companies Act 1963 provides that once a petition is presented for the winding up of a company , the court can order a stay or restrain any new proceedings . Section 219 of the Companies Act 1963 provides that any execution against the goods or property of the company is void . Under section 291 of the Companies Act 1963 a creditor may only retain the benefit of an execution against lands of a company where the execution is completed before the winding up is commenced or the date on which it got notice of the creditors meeting ( whichever is earlier ) . Therefore the landlord can not execute a judgment for rent or for possession once liquidation proceedings have commenced . He can always seek permission of the court to continue any proceedings which were in existence at the time of the liquidation and may recover the arrears of rent as an unsecured claim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain circumstances , but , there is no guarantee that the landlord will recover these rents . <p> Therefore while legal proceedings are ruled out , it may be possible for the landlord to execute a quick and speedy forfeiture if he can execute a peaceable re-entry under the forfeiture clause in the lease . Under Section 14 of the Conveyancing Act , 1881 as amended by section 2(2) of the Conveyancing Act 1892 , the right to re-enter on the appointment of a liquidator can not be exercised against the company until one year after the date of the appointment of the liquidator . The landlord 's right to enforce re-entry on forfeiture is also restricted by section 14(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act , 1881 , as amended by section 35 of the Landlord and Tenant ( Ground Rent ) Act , 1961 . This provides that , with certain exceptions , any provisions for re-entry are subject to section 14 of the Conveyancing Act , 1881 , which provides that the landlord must serve notice on the tenant before re-entry in certain circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time has elapsed under the notice the landlord may demand possession once again and re-entry may be affected if it can be done peacefully , but , if re-entry can not be affected peacefully the landlord can not use force under the prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act , 1971 where it makes it a criminal offence to do so . <p> If a peaceful re-entry can not be effected the landlord 's remedy is to issue an ejectment civil bill on title based on forfeiture and seeking an order for possession from the courts where the tenant refuses to vacate . The local sheriff or county registrar executes this order . <p> Summary of practical steps to be taken by the landlord <p> Determine the tenancy as appropriate by serving a section 14(1) notice . <p> Issue the appropriate legal proceedings . <p> Serve a motion for judgment or set the case down for a full hearing as the circumstances may require . <p> Obtain an order for possession . The terms of the order will also cover arrears of rent and mesne rates ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of the order ) and legal costs if all or any of these items are claimed . <p> Serve a true copy of the order on the tenant and demand immediate possession . <p> If the tenant still does not leave , lodge an execution order ( Circuit Court ) of fifa ( High Court ) with the sheriff or county registrar who will then eject the tenant . <p> Landlords should be aware that procedures for effecting forfeiture through the courts can be very long and cumbersome and needless to say , costly , particularly if the tenant decides to strenuously defend the proceedings . <p> The landlord may also continue to rely on any collateral security arrangements that are made at the time of the lease such as a third party guarantees or rental deposits which are unaffected by the liquidation <p> Forfeiture of a lease does not necessarily determine all interests arising thereunder . Section 78 of the 1980 Act provides that any sublease to which the act applies does not automatically terminate under such circumstances but continues to exist as if the superior landlord were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subject to an increase . The Conveyancing Act , 1892 ( the 1892 Act ) also dealt with the rights of tenants by virtue of section 4 , which gave the court the power to vest property comprised in the lease , or any part thereof , for the whole of the term of the lease or any lesser term , in any person entitled as underlessee . In fact the provisions of the 1892 Act are much more far reaching as they appear to include any person deriving title under or from and underlessee . <p> Tenants should be mindful that these reliefs are only available to subtenants who have entered into possession with the consent of the superior landlord and where they have set up rights of renewal under the Landlord and Tenant Acts . Relief is always given sparingly and with caution and the court must be satisfied that the subtenant is blameless and has taken all reasonable precaution . Under section 20 of the 1860 Act the landlord also has the right to serve a notice on a subtenant to pay rent directly to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> b ) ReceivershipA receiver is appointed by a secured creditor pursuant to the terms of the creditors mortgage , charge or debenture to act in realizing for the benefit of that secured creditor the assets of a company which are subject to the mortgage , charge or debenture in question . Most security documents under which a receiver is appointed will contain a provision whereby the company authorizes the receiver to act as its agent to perform various functions . The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act , 1881 implies certain statutory powers to a security holder enabling that security holder to appoint a receiver to take control of the assets subject to the security with a view to liquidating such assets and discharging in whole or in part the liabilities owed to the holder of the security . When a receiver is appointed there are no statutory prohibitions against the landlord seeking to exercise his rights in the normal way nor does it affect the landlords rights regarding third party guarantees or security deposits . <p> c ) Court protection and examinershipThe process of examination was introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 for the purposes of avoiding liquidation and to facilitate survival of the company , despite the fact that the company may in fact be insolvent . In short , examination provides a maximum of a one hundred day period in which the court appointed examiner seeks to take control of the company and manage it so that the company may continue to trade . The court will only appoint an examiner if it is satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of the survival of the company and the whole or any part of the undertaking as a going concern . Once appointed by the court it is the examiners function to assess the viability of a company and prepare a scheme of arrangement which must in turn be submitted to and be approved by a majority of the creditors and by the courts . Section 5 of the Companies Act , 1990 contains a prohibition against any steps being taken against guarantors . From the day the company applies to the court seeking protection the commencement of new proceedings against the company are prohibited and a stay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to re-enter on foot of a forfeiture clause in a lease on foot of failure to pay rent is questionable in the light of the provisions of section 9 of the 1990 Act which provides that the examiner has the power to reverse or remedy any proposed acts in relation to the assets of a company which would benefit the company . In addition , once the scheme of arrangement has been agreed by the creditors and the court it becomes binding on all parties and their rights are accordingly modified . <p> Section 66 of the 1980 Act ( as amended by the 1994 Act ) impacted seriously on the covenants against alienation in commercial leases . The 1980 Act , which came into operation on the August 10 , 1994 provided for new tenancy renewal rights to tenants in respect of premises which came within the definition of a tenement as set out in section 5(1) of the 1980 Act , subject to the tenant setting up one of the following four equities ; <p> Business equity under section 13 ( 1 ) ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( b ) ; <p> Improvements equity under section 13(1) ( c ) ; <p> Rent Acts Equity under sections 14 and 15 . <p> These rights could not be contracted out of by the tenant . <p> Section 13 ( 1 ) ( a ) , dealing with business equities , has proved to be the most far reaching of the provisions dealing with business tenancy renewal rights as it provided that a tenant had a business equity if " the tenement ( as defined ) was , during the whole of the period of five years ( as inserted by s.3 of the 1994 Act ) ending at that time , continuously in the occupation of the person who was the tenant immediately before that time or of his predecessors in title and bona fide used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business " <p> The period of occupation previously required under the 1980 Act was three years , however , this period was subsequently extended to five years under the 1994 Act and has resulted in the standard short term letting agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months but for a period of four years and 11 months , similar to the European average . <p> More importantly , the 1994 Act also introduced a new provision allowing an office tenant to contract out of his rights to a new tenancy where the premises are used wholly and exclusively as offices by executing before the commencement of the tenancy , a valid renunciation and where the tenant has obtained independent legal advice . <p> The act is disappointing because it limited the contracting out provisions to premises used " wholly and exclusively as offices " and it failed to define what constitutes an " office " . It also appears from the wording of section 4 of the 1994 Act that a tenant of premises with non-office use or ancillary non-office use is not in a position to contract out of the provisions of the 1980 Act . It is hard to understand why this section was not extended to all commercial leases including businesses , retail and manufacturing and it is something which will have to be addressed in future statutory reform . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landlord-tenant relationship ? While there is no specific human rights legislation in Ireland , any lease provisions that are contrary to the basic rights guaranteed in the Irish Constitution will not be upheld by the Irish Courts . In the case of commercial leases the courts will tend to uphold the contractual terms incorporated in the leases on the basis that they are normally drafted and negotiated by the solicitors acting for the landlord and tenant respectively . In the case of residential leases the Irish Courts , in dealing with any particular dispute between a landlord and tenant , do tend to have regard to the general equitable principles of fairness and will , in certain circumstances , where they consider the interests of justice or fairness require such action , set aside or disregard the provisions of the lease . <p> 5 . What is the effect of conditions restricting tenants wishing to divest themselves of surplus properties ( ' alienation ' ) , and how can those restrictions be satisfied or circumvented ? It is common for leases to contain provisions absolutely prohibiting alienation or prohibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this nature must be considered in the light of section 66 of the 1980 Act , which provides that covenants in leases of tenements ( as defined ) absolutely prohibiting alienation , regardless of the terms of the lease , will be interpreted as stating that alienation may be made with the consent of the landlord which consent must not to be unreasonably withheld . The section applies to all leases including yearly tenancies arising by operation of law or by inference on the expiration of a lease and a statutory tenancy implied by holding over premises on the expiration of a lease . The word alienation would include assignments and sublettings , but the general view appears to be that the implied covenant only applies to the alienation of the whole and does not apply to alienation of a part . <p> If the lease contains a covenant requiring consent and stipulating that same is not to be unreasonably withheld or if the property demised is a tenement within the statutory meaning of the word and the lease contains a covenant against alienation and the landlord refuses consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the tenant is to apply to the court for relief in the form of a declaration that in the circumstances the consent has been unreasonably withheld . The onus of proving that consent has been unreasonably withheld lies on the tenant and it is generally accepted that the landlord must not act arbitrarily or capriciously . <p> Securitization of real estate assets <p> 1 . How significant is the real estate securitization market in your jurisdiction ? ( a ) The real estate securitization market is not significant in the Irish market . To date there have been no securitization of Irish real estate/property. ( b ) On the other hand the Irish Mortgage Backed Securitization market is quite significant in the Irish context with about 10% of Irish residential mortgages having been securitized . <p> 2 . What have the key real estate securitization deals been in your jurisdiction over the past 12 months ? The volume of mortgage backed securities in Ireland for the year 2002 was only around 500 million which is down marginally from the 2001 when the figures were about 1.8 billion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ) are the parties obliged to disclose the lease terms on a formal registry ( for example , the land registry ) in your jurisdiction ? There are two systems of registration of title in Ireland . <p> a ) Registry of Deeds Title ( otherwise known as unregistered title ) Introduced under the Registry of Deeds ( Ireland ) Act , 1707 ( the 1707 Act ) it was set up for the purpose of giving priority to deeds registered in the Registry of Deeds as against deeds that had not been registered and to prevent fraud in dealing with land . <p> The registration of a deed in the Registry of Deeds is achieved by the completion of a memorial which is in essence an extract from the deed containing details of the date of the deed , the names and addresses of the parties to the deed , the nature and effect of the deed and a full description of the property affected by it . Titles have to be continually examined in detail every time a transaction is undertaken . Section 17 of the 1707 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 years , where actual possession goes with it is not registerable nor is it normal in the case of any lease for the memorial in respect thereof to record details of the individual provisions of the lease . Registration in the Registry of Deeds is not compulsory under the 1707 Act . There is , however , an obligation upon a solicitor to ensure the registration of a particular deed for the purposes of obtaining priority against any subsequent deeds or mortgages on title . <p> b ) Land Registry Title ( otherwise known as registered title ) Registration in the Land Registry is governed by the Registration of Title Act , 1964 and the Land Registry Rules , 1972 ( as amended ) . This is an alternative system of registration to the Registry of Deeds , being a system providing a state guaranteed title and which is computerized and based on Ordinance Survey maps . In the Land Registry the title itself is registered and not just the particular deed . Each registered title has a separate folio number which details the county to which it relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular map reference on the registry map , the class , title and ownership and details of any charges or burdens registered against the property . <p> All leases created for period of 21 years or more must be registered in the Land Registry . In the case of leases for shorter periods registration is neither necessary nor appropriate . The Land Registry retains a copy of the original lease and a copy can be obtained from the Land Registry with the written consent of the registered leaseholder . <p> When acting on behalf of a borrowing company or for a lender in a commercial loan transaction it is also crucial to remember the provisions of the Companies Act , 1963 section 99 , which states that unless a notice of the charge created by a company is lodged within 21 days of the date of its creation with the Companies Office the charge will be void as against the liquidator or any creditor of the company . While it is not necessary to detail all of the charging provisions contained in the mortgage , details of any negative pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to ensure the priority of the charge . <p> 4 . Is there any debate in your jurisdiction as to who holds the legal title to a mortgaged property ? While there is no debate on this issue in Ireland it should first be understood that unregistered property is mortgaged and registered property is charged and the position regarding title differs in each instance . <p> In unregistered title the property is conveyed leased or assigned by the borrower to the lender subject to the equity of redemption in the property . For as long as the loan is in place the title is vested in the lender and the borrower has only an equity of redemption , with the right to get the title back and have it vested in him once more when the loan is repaid . <p> In the case of registered title land may be mortgaged only by the registered owner by means of a registered charge . This does not , unlike a mortgage , involve the transfer of ownership to the lender . Ownership remains with the registered owner and the lender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . What are the relative benefits of private finance initiatives ( PFIs ) and public-private partnerships ( PPPs ) ? The term PPP in the Republic of Ireland and the term PFI in Northern Ireland provides for projects commissioned by the public sector and financed by the private sector . Normally the private investment will be supplemented by an exchequer contribution to the capital and/or the operating cost . To date PPPs and PFIs have been adopted to implement public policy in the realm of toll roads , bridges , science projects , education projects and sports infrastructure . In essence it helps to allocate risk to the person best placed to manage and deal with a particular risk . It is advantageous from the point of view of the public sector 's balance sheet as the cost incurred in an infrastructure project is transferred from the capital account to a series of future payments from the current account , that is , off balance sheet . It should also lead to an ultimate cut in the costs of infrastructure , accelerated rate of investment , more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands and requirements <p> Financing of real estate transactions <p> 1 . What are the most common methods by which purchasers finance high-value real estate transactions in your jurisdiction ? Secured lending through the creation of a mortgage over the property to be acquired or a floating charge over company assets is still a common way of financing property transactions in Ireland . In the case of developments it is quite common for lenders to take additional security through assignments of contracts or agreements entered into by a developer . In some instances there may be more than one lender who would enter into priority agreements to cover the manner of distribution of the sale proceeds in the event that the security has to be realized . <p> 2 . To what extent does stamp duty ( or the equivalent in your jurisdiction ) affect the cost and method of financing real estate transactions ? Stamp duty is charged at the rate of 9% on commercial property transactions ( exceeding 150,000 ) . It has therefore proved to be quite prohibitive and it is for this reasons that some investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assets owned by the company where the stamp duty charged is 1% of the consideration paid for the shares . <p> The stamp duty charged on the creation of a lease is 1% of the annual rent , ( although up to 9% stamp may still be charged on any premiums ) <p> Conveyancing issues <p> 1 . What are the various forms of property ownership in your jurisdiction ? Title to property may be described as freehold where it will be one of the following , namely : <p> fee simple ( tantamount to absolute ownership ) ; <p> fee tail ( where the entitlement to lands is confined to the descendants of the person in whom the original estate was vested ) and ; <p> a life estate ( which lasts for the duration of a named individual 's life only ) . <p> Or leasehold , which is divided into the after categories , namely : <p> Term certain ( this is very common in Ireland and is a lease for 25 years that automatically determines on the expiry of the term ) ; <p> Periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either party terminates the lease and where the period of notice required to determine the lease is determined by the manner in which the rent is reserved or calculated ) . <p> Tenancy at will ( a lease which continues indefinitely but may be determined by either party at any time . This is an uncertain type of tenure and it is questionable whether a tenant would have an interest to assign to a third party . There is no rent reserved under the lease . ) <p> Property can be owned by a number of parties under a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common . In the case of investors it is normal to hold property as tenants in common and it is advisable to have an agreement put in place before the acquisition of the property dealing , at the very minimum , with matters such as decision making , expenditure , division of profits , disposal , dispute resolution and exit strategies . <p> In the case of joint tenancies there is a right of survivorship whereby the property automatically passes by law to the survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general rule , where a deed is silent on whether a joint tenancy or tenancy in common is created there is a common law presumption that the purchasers are acquiring the premises as joint tenants , save where the purchase money was provided in unequal shares . In this instance it is presumed that property will be held under a tenancy in common in accordance with each parties respective contribution to the purchase price . <p> 2 . Other than the general principles of contract law governing agreements between vendor and purchaser , what other statutory governance , regulations or guidelines exist to protect the parties to a property transaction ? The Competition Act , 2002 ( which replaced the Competition Acts 1991 - 1996 ) regulates the law relating to the control of monopolies and the abuse of dominant position by certain undertakings ( as defined ) . <p> The European Communities ( Safeguarding of Employees rights on transfer of Undertakings ) Regulations 1980 ( as amended ) regulates and protects the interests of employees where there is a transfer of an undertaking , business or part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the rights and obligations arising from an employment contract or relationship are transferred from the original employer to the new employer . The potential liability of a new employer should be noted in the context of the Unfair Dismissals legislation . <p> 3 . How has the legislation and recent case law in your jurisdiction addressed the issue of adverse possession ? There has been no recent legislation in Ireland dealing with the issue of adverse possession , which in essence means possession of property that is inconsistent with the title of the true owner , that is , possession giving rise to a right of action in the owner . Pursuant to the provisions of the Real Property Limitation Act , 1874 ( the 1874 Act ) a true owner has a period of 12 years from the date of accrual of the action , meaning the date of possession , during which he can assert his rights , failing which , his title is automatically extinguished . The 1874 Act stipulates that a person must be in undisputed possession of lands for a minimum period of 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the true owner fails to assert his rights within the limitation period the true owner is dispossessed of his title and his right of action and the squatter acquires a title good against anyone other than a person with a better title to the land . It is generally accepted that the squatter must show possession to the exclusion of the real owner , which is inconsistent with the enjoyment of the land by the real owner and that mere abandonment is not enough . <p> In the case of tenancies , a tenant is estopped from claiming adverse possession during the period of a tenancy and the landlords right of action does not accrue , that is , time does not begin to run against the landlord until the expiry of the term of the lease or when the freehold or leasehold interest vests in the reversioner . <p> There have been several recent cases in the area of adverse possession in Ireland , none of which would appear to have made any significant impact on the core principles that are now firmly set up in Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a High Court judgement of Ms Justice Carroll delivered on February 14 2001 , the applicant claimed possessory title to a disputed plot either by using it himself or by receiving rent for it . The legal owner claimed he accessed the plot four or fives times annually and that he had affixed a For Sale sign on the plot and entered into negotiations to sell the plot to a prospective purchaser , but the sale did not complete . It was held that there was no abandonment . The acts of advertising for planning permission on the site in local newspapers and the erection on the site of a For Sale sign by auctioneers meant there was no abandonment . Twelve years continuous occupation and possession to the exclusion of the true owner could not be set up . <p> Another case in point is that of James Battelle and Mary Pauline Batelle v Pinemeadow Limited . Judgement was delivered on May 9 2002 . The plaintiff moved into property in February 1978 . The plot of land between the rear boundary and river was overgrown and neglected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending with his ground landlord who was unsure as to whether or not it owned the plot , but given that there was no access to it , advised that it would have no further use or interest in the plot . The plaintiff began works consistent with the presumption that he was the owner of the plot , that is , he cleared away overgrown briars , planted shrubs and laid out garden furniture . The court found that just because the ground landlord maintained that it had no interest in the plot that it could not be presumed that it had no title to the plot . But in this case it was held by the court that the plaintiff had effectively enclosed the plot and incorporated it into his garden and had acquired title by adverse possession .

The law prohibits a company or its subsidiary from giving financial assistance to acquire the company 's shares or to reduce or discharge a liability incurred for that purpose . The changes , which the Companies Act 2006 brings in , will make LBOs with UK target companies easier to complete . The new law differs from the German and French position on the acquisition of a target company incorporated in either of those jurisdictions . <h> Whitewashing <p> In October 2008 the Companies Act 's rules on financial assistance will take effect . The law on financial assistance prohibits assistance being given for the proscribed purposes for both public and private companies , subject to a variety of exceptions ( some of which are broadly considered unreliable in practice ) . It grants an exemption for private companies in certain circumstances . This is called the whitewash procedure . Public to private deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before giving security to a lending bank after the public target has been reregistered as a private company . The lender 's ability to perfect its security over the target 's assets is delayed . This prohibition has become a problem for LBOs because it creates extra cost , complexity and delays . The Law Commission estimated that the whitewash procedure cost the UK economy 20 million ( $39.45 million ) in 2000 ; and with the explosion in leveraged buyout activity since then , that sum must now be much higher . <p> A whitewash cleanses what would otherwise constitute the giving of unlawful financial assistance by a private company . In the whitewash procedure , before the assistance is given , the directors satisfy themselves that the company giving the assistance is solvent . They swear a statutory declaration , backed up by an auditors ' report , confirming that the company will be able to pay its debts for at least 12 months after providing the assistance . These requirements cost money . And if it emerges that the statutory declaration was not based on a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors are exposed to personal liability . The risk of personal liability can cause nervousness among management buyout teams , which may not be intimately involved in the structuring of the loan ? the incident that will need to be whitewashed . <h> Fewer restrictions <p> The new law will now allow UK companies to give financial assistance , removing the need for the whitewash procedure . But it will still not be possible for a private company to grant financial assistance for the proscribed purposes in an acquisition of shares in its public holding company , or for a public company to grant financial assistance for the proscribed purposes relating to an acquisition of shares in its private holding company . The prohibition on the giving of financial assistance by public companies remains in place . It is likely that this would have been removed as well , had it not been that EU law ? ironically heavily influenced by UK company law ? prevents its removal . At the EU level , proposals now exist to relax the prohibition on public companies when the amount of financial assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when certain other requirements are also met . <p> Three aspects of a typical deal reveal the practical impact of this legislation for leveraged buyouts . First , regarding the target company 's granting of security over its assets to secure the bank loan that makes an LBO possible , the new legislation will remove the restriction preventing a private company from giving financial assistance , in many circumstances , from October 2008 . Thus it removes the need for the whitewash procedure . This development has advantages in the context of LBOs . It eliminates the need for the complex structures that have been employed to avoid problems relating to financial assistance . It also reduces the legal and audit fees associated with the whitewash procedure and compliance with the legislation . Some commentators have speculated that banks will ask companies engaged in a leveraged buyout to go through a process as cumbersome and expensive as the whitewash , even without the formal need to do so . But banks do not require such procedures for other loans , and it seems unlikely that they would require it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second , the issue of what amount ( if any ) might not be considered material for the purposes of the statutory prohibition as a proportion of a private target company 's net assets , and therefore might be paid towards the LBO team 's professional fees without whitewash , no longer exists . Last , the lifting of the restrictions on financial assistance for private companies will solve the often highly contentious issue of the directors ' declarations that have been required under the whitewash procedure . <h> And on the Continent <p> The new UK law is much more liberal than German and French legislation . Some similarities exist between legislation for German limited liability companies ( GmbHs ) and limited companies in the UK . But in the past the UK need for the whitewash procedure made its laws more cumbersome than those of Germany . Under German law the key factor is the maintenance of equity capital ( non-freely available equity of the company ) . This is reflected in the requirement that the assets of a GmbH can not be reduced by the grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . The definition of financial assistance under German law includes the grant of security over the company 's assets for the liability of shareholders to a third party . Following the implementation of the new law in the UK , the German stance will seem much more restrictive . For German public companies ( AGs ) the prohibition covers all the company 's assets . As with UK laws on public companies , it is possible that the German public companies position will be amended as a result of any change in European legislation . <p> French legislation states that a company may not advance funds , grant loans or give guarantees in view of the subscription or the acquisition of its own shares by a third party . This general prohibition applies to French sociTtTs anonymes ( SA ) , sociTtTs en commandite par actions ( SCA ) and sociTtTs par actions simplifiTes ( SAS ) . The prohibition on financial assistance applies to all schemes that could be directly or indirectly considered as granting a loan or giving guarantees by the company for the purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal exceptions to this prohibition exist , and there are practical ways of dealing with it , subject to certain conditions . But unlike the UK , France does not have the equivalent of the whitewash procedure , making the French position more restrictive . As with Germany , the UK 's new stance on giving financial assistance will be substantially more liberal than that in France . <p> The impact of the removal of the prohibition of financial assistance by private companies will be positive for the LBO industry in the UK , reducing the costs and complexity of leveraged buyouts . It remains to be seen whether the increased permissiveness of UK law will result in calls to reform the laws in Germany or France , to bring them in line with the UK position . <p> To download a full copy of IFLR 's Private equity and venture capital review , please click here

A pledge can be created over any asset that : ( i ) exists ; ( ii ) is owned by the pledgor at the time of creating the pledge ; ( iii ) is clearly identifiable and is identified in the pledge agreement ; and ( iv ) is capable of being sold . <p> As such , it is not possible for a borrower to grant a floating charge of the type often used in western jurisdictions and each pledged asset must be specified in reasonable detail in the pledge agreement . <p> The absence of floating charges ( and therefore of common law-style debentures ) is a significant challenge for many creditors , since it forces them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perfect a pledge over personal moveable property , the pledgee ( usually an onshore bank acting as security agent for the lender or lenders ) must obtain physical possession of the pledged asset . Alternatively , if the pledgee is not able to obtain physical possession ( for example due to the nature of the asset being large and fixed to the ground , such as an item in a process plant ) , the pledgee must obtain recognised title documents for the pledged assets and/or ( where possible ) physical control over the pledged asset . The pledgor should not be permitted to retain any right to dispose of the pledged assets . <p> The Commercial Pledge Law covers both tangible assets and certain intangible assets , such as intellectual property . However , to the extent that intellectual property is unregistered , it will be difficult for the pledgee to obtain physical possession or control over the pledged intellectual property . <p> In addition to the tenet of possession and control , the asset must also be registered to the extent that an official form of registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , a register of ships or the Saudi Arabian patent , copyright and trade mark registries . <p> In the context of a pledge over bank accounts , a pledge will attach only to credited funds of the pledged account on the date the pledge is created , which may well be a zero or minimal balance . As a result , a pledge over a Saudi Arabian bank account will usually contain an obligation requiring the pledgor to execute supplemental pledges on each date on which amounts in excess of a threshold specified in the account pledge are received into the secured account . <p> In addition , because currency is a fungible asset , there is a risk that the constant fluctuations in the secured asset ( the account balance ) may result in the pledge being held to have been released . Although lenders continue to take pledges over bank accounts as part of a security package , on enforcement lenders will more often seek to rely on their right of set-off as a remedy ( although note that the right of set-off may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security assignment <p> Borrowers in Saudi Arabia , seeking to borrow funds for a particular project , will often assign proceeds of specific contracts to lenders . As in many GCC jurisdictions , a valid assignment can not be effected unilaterally and must be notified to and acknowledged by the counterparty to the assigned contract . Even where the assignment is perfected by acknowledgement , it is not clear whether the Saudi Arabian courts would hold that the assignee has priority over other creditors on the assignor 's insolvency . <p> Security power of attorney <p> Lenders often also require borrowers to issue an irrevocable power of attorney in favour of the lenders ' security agent to enable lenders to exercise rights in relation to the secured assets in a default situation . However , shariah principles state that even where a power of attorney is unequivocally expressed to be irrevocable , it will nevertheless be revocable at will by either party . Some Islamic scholars have expressed the view that , as an exception to this rule , a power of attorney may be held to be irrevocable where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with a third party interest , with such third party relying on the irrevocable nature of the power of attorney . However , the existence of this exception remains subject to debate , and although lenders generally seek irrevocable powers of attorney , success in using the power to enforce security remains untested and uncertain . <p> In addition , as a practical point , powers of attorney granted in Saudi Arabia must be made before a notary , who may refuse to notarise a power of attorney granted in connection with a security document on the basis that it is being granted with a view to recovering interest . The recovery of interest , or payments in the nature of interest , is of course contrary to the principles of shariah law . <p> Guarantees and promissory notes <p> Guarantees from people or business entities related to the borrower are a common form of security in most jurisdictions . However , in contrast to common lending practice in many western jurisdictions , in Saudi Arabian transactions wealthy individuals related to the borrower ( either as shareholders or ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all or part of the borrower 's obligations under a loan facility . <p> Promissory notes <p> In addition , loan documents in respect of Saudi Arabian projects will often provide for the delivery at regular intervals or on the occurrence of specified events ( often on each drawdown date ) by the borrower to the security agent of promissory notes , payable on demand , with a face value equal to the amount then outstanding under the facility . <p> Although not strictly speaking security for lending , lenders will view the promissory notes as an important part of the lending package since the use of a promissory note usually comprises free-standing evidence that the amount stated in the promissory note is due for payment , without the need to further prove the debt or ask the court to examine the loan instrument . <h> Recent developments <p> Real estate <p> Real estate interests often constitute one of the most substantial assets held by a borrower , and as such in many jurisdictions real estate is a primary source of security for lenders . However , at present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for commercial lenders to obtain enforceable security over Saudi Arabian real estate . <p> In theory , it is possible for a borrower to grant security over real estate in Saudi Arabia by way of a pledge , perfected ( in part ) by the recording of the pledge on the title documents relating to the property by a notary public . In the context of commercial lending , this has proved problematic : since the early eighties , notaries in Saudi Arabia have refused to notarise mortgages or pledges of real estate in favour of commercial lenders , assuming that a mortgage or pledge in favour of a commercial lender would seek , contrary to shariah law , to secure obligations relating to payment of interest . <p> There has recently been a significant development in this area . At the end of June 2008 , Saudi Arabia 's Shura Council approved the long-awaited Draft Mortgage Law , which will provide a framework for the mortgage and lease-financing of real estate . <p> The new law is yet to be enacted and brought into force , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to allow registration and perfection of a mortgage granted under the law , but the approval of the law , which has been in preparation and consultation for several years , is a significant development in the context of secured lending . <p> The new law contains a clearly expressed regime of creating security with priority of interest ( against other ordinary creditors ) over real estate , including provisions for tracing and preserving the secured property and provisions for enforcement . <p> The new mortgage law will be of key significance to banks and financial institutions lending to the increasing number of developers active in Saudi Arabia 's surging real estate market . <p> A study published in March of this year predicted that just under $240 billion will be invested into Saudi Arabia 's real estate market over the next 12 years , and as Saudi Arabia 's real estate sector becomes increasingly sophisticated , developers will , as has been the trend in other GCC jurisdictions , seek to finance real estate development to a far greater extent than at present . <p> Market commentators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new law will have , but without doubt the ability of lenders to take effective and enforceable security over real estate in commercial real estate development projects will be key to the development of the wider real estate sector in the Kingdom . <p> Shares <p> Security can be granted under the Commercial Pledge Law over certain types of shares and other securities by way of a share pledge . <p> The most commonly seen form of share pledge is a pledge over shares held in a joint stock company , perfected ( as outlined above ) by the delivery to the pledgee of physical possession or control of the pledged shares . In practice , the pledge is perfected by the recording of the pledge on the face of the share certificates relating to the pledged shares and in the company 's shareholding register and the delivery of the original share certificates to the pledgee . In relation to tradable securities , the existence of the pledge should also be registered at the Securities Deposit Centre operated by the Tadawul , which will then block the pledged securities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares in a Saudi Arabian limited liability company ( LLC ) is more problematic . As outlined above , in order to perfect a pledge of shares the pledgee must obtain physical possession or control of the pledged shares . However , limited liability companies in Saudi Arabia do not issue share certificates to represent shares held by each shareholder ; rather , ownership interests are recorded in the company 's articles of association ( the articles must be amended to reflect each transfer of shares ) and evidenced by the entry of the shareholder 's name in the company 's register of shareholders . As such , it is very difficult for a pledgee to obtain the requisite physical possession and control . In addition , shares in limited liability companies are subject to statutory pre-emption rights in respect of which shareholders can not give an advance waiver . Therefore , upon enforcement , the shares can not be transferred to lenders without first being offered to other shareholders pursuant to the pre-emption right . <p> On some of the recent financings we have seen in the Kingdom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares held by shareholders in the limited liability company ( LLC ) borrower was used . To try to address the perfection and enforcement issues described above , a " synthetic " pledge was created , structured as if it were a pledge over joint stock company shares . The pledge was " perfected " as follows : <p> each of the shareholders in the LLC purports to pledge all of its shares in the LLC to the security agent ; <p> the LLC 's shareholders procure that the LLC issues share certificates in respect of the pledged shares ; <p> the existence of the pledge and a no-transfer instruction is recorded on the share certificates and on the LLC 's share register ; <p> the share certificates , and all other documents evidencing title to the pledged shares other than the LLC 's articles of association are delivered to the security agent as pledgee ; <p> the LLC 's shareholders pass a resolution approving the pledge and resolving not to dispose of any pledged shares without the prior consent of the security agent ; <p> the LLC is formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pledge ; <p> the LLC notifies the Companies Registrar at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the existence of the pledge , the no-transfer instruction and the contractual restrictions against dealing , attaching to the pledged shares and requests a copy of the notice , and a copy of the shareholders ' resolution , to be filed in LLC 's file ; and <p> the shareholders and the security agent agree that the above actions constitute delivery for the purposes of the Commercial Pledge Law . <p> While the above structure is untested in terms of enforceability , the synthetic perfection of the pledge by the creation of share certificates represents , for the time being , the closest lenders can come to obtaining a perfected pledge over shares in an LLC in the Kingdom . <p> Enforcement <p> One must consider what happens to those security interests when the security agent seeks to enforce its rights . There is in fact very limited precedent of actual enforcement of security , and as such the topic remains uncertain . <p> Where a dispute arises between a bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the exceptions set out below ) , the dispute must be in the first instance referred to the Banking Disputes Settlement Committee of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency ( the SAMA Committee ) for settlement . The SAMA Committee aims to propose settlements in accordance with the terms of the agreements under dispute , and has tended to apply shariah principles less strictly than the mainstream Saudi Arabian courts so as to give effect to practices that are recognised in international banking practice . <p> As noted above , there are a number of exceptions to the SAMA Committee 's general jurisdiction in respect of banking disputes . <p> Disputes relating to negotiable instruments , including promissory notes , are heard before the Office for Settling Negotiable Instruments Disputes ( NIO ) . <p> Provided a promissory note meets certain criteria as to form , the NIO generally does not look behind the note to ascertain whether the underlying transaction complies with shariah ? hence the popularity of the promissory note in Saudi Arabian lending transactions . <p> Enforcement by way of sale of assets pledge under the Commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Grievances . <p> A secured lender can seek to enforce security where there is a payment default in respect of a payment of principal . Security can not , under shariah law , be enforced because of a default in respect of payment of interest , or any payment in the nature of interest . It is uncertain whether a secured lender could successfully enforce security in respect of any other default ( other than failure to pay ) . <p> In respect of pledged or mortgaged assets , the security documents will typically provide that , on enforcement , the security agent will have the right to sell the pledged assets and apply the proceeds towards extinguishment of the debt . However , the implementing regulations of the Commercial Pledge Law provide for a statutory procedure for enforcement of any security created under the law . Where the borrower defaults on a payment of principal , the pledgee can , after a short notice period , apply to the Board of Grievances to sell all or part of the pledged assets . Assuming the application is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured obligations must then be sold by public auction , again following a short notice period to the borrower and any guarantors . <p> Where the lender or security agent holds a valid power of attorney to deal with the secured assets , the security agent as attorney can sell the assets and apply the proceeds of the sale to repay the debt . <p> In the context of insolvency , including determining priority of creditors , the Board of Grievances has general jurisdiction . <p> There are a number of legal challenges that need to be considered by lenders seeking to obtain enforceable security in respect of loans advanced to Saudi Arabian borrowers or in respect of Saudi Arabian projects , as well as by the lawyers and financiers structuring those transactions . These are not new challenges and there are numerous international banks regularly lending substantial sums into Saudi Arabia ( the past few months have seen the close of several major financings , such as the Hajj and Umrah terminals financing , the $4.5 billion Maaden/SABIC Ras Al Zour fertiliser plant financing and the $6 billion Kayan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the boundaries of the Saudi system .

Following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and a number of bitter disputes with foreign investors , particularly in the power sector , private infrastructure investment came to a virtual halt .

SMI then established Indonesia Infrastructure Finance ( IIF ) in 2010 , in collaboration with the ADB , International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) and Germany 's DEG , to provide financing to qualified projects . <p> Crucial support for the PPP framework was also put in place in 2010 , with the establishment of the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund ( IIGF ) , the purpose of which is to extend guarantees to PPP projects , thereby helping boost their creditworthiness . The risks that may be covered by the IIGF include those that arise at both the pre-construction stage , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaches of contract , legal and regulatory changes , and problems in closing financing . While the IIGF is a state-owned company , it operates on a commercial basis . It does not guarantee risks that can be insured in the private market , and has proved itself highly professional and competent since its establishment , insisting on tightly drafted project documentation and conducting close monitoring of progress . <p> In addition , the Ministry of Finance has drafted a decree on viability gap funding , although this is not yet on the statute books . <p> The Indonesian National Development Planning Agency ( Bappenas ) , the body charged with progressing PPP schemes , has identified 100 projects valued at around $47.3 billion available under the PPP programme , including one marine transportation project ready for offer valued at $36 million , 27 priority projects ( 18 toll roads , six water supply and three sanitation projects ) valued at $8.3 billion , and 72 other potential projects worth $38.9 billion . <p> Despite significant advances on the regulatory and financing sides , overall progress has been slow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2006 now actually under construction . These are the 2000 MW , Central Java IPP coal-fired power plant ( which is being built at a cost of $3 billion under the new PPP regulations and is expected to serve as a model for other projects ) , and the 9.7km Nusa Dua ? Ngurah Rai ? Benoa tolled expressway in Bali . <h> Progress to date by sector <p> Power <p> The power sector in Indonesia continues to be dominated by the State Electricity Company ( PLN ) , which enjoys a monopoly over electricity transmission . The company both generates its own power and purchases electricity from independent power producers ( IPP ) . While demand has been growing by between 7% and 10% over the last five years , the electrification rate across the country stood at only 70.4% in 2011 , one of the lowest rates in the region . As a result , some 80 million Indonesians , primarily in the countryside , have no access to reliable power sources . <p> To counter the country 's lack of investment in the power sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MW Generating Capacity Development Programme , which focused on the construction of new coal-fired power plants across Indonesia . This was followed by phase 2 , which concentrates on the development of renewable power sources , particularly geothermal . <p> Unfortunately , phase 1 turned out to be a less than resounding success , with only about 45% of the planned capacity on stream for the end of 2012 . There are a number of reasons for this , most significantly the non-availability of government guarantees ( in addition , tender winners frequently turned out to lack the capacity to develop their projects ) . As regards phase 2 , government guarantees are available , but only since earlier this year . It is only now that work is actually getting underway , with guarantees having been issued for four projects so far . <p> The Ministry of Finance is no longer willing to extend blanket guarantees . This is a result of its traumatic experiences at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s , when Indonesia found itself on the losing end of a number of multi-million dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The Ministry also appears intent on restricting coverage to lenders , rather than sponsors , and to reducing the terms of guarantees from 20 years to 15 years . <p> The IIGF will also provide a guarantee , backed by government or multilateral agencies , for a qualified project provided it is initiated by central or local government , or a state-owned enterprise . <p> As for geothermal , the development of this sector in the past was hampered by the legislation 's treatment of it as something of a hybrid creature , and as a result of both PLN and the state oil and gas firm Pertamina competed with each other for control . That problem was remedied by the Geothermal Act 2003 , under which rights to exploit geothermal resources are granted through concessions awarded on the basis of competitive bidding . <p> However , the geothermal sector continues to be plagued by pricing difficulties . The whole ethos of competitive bidding appears to be somewhat undermined by the government 's issuance of a new regulation that will set maximum feed-in tariffs at between 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.7 cents at present . It is difficult to conceive how competitive bidding can be achieved if the price is already fixed beforehand . <p> To date , Bappenas has identified a total of six potential PPP projects worth some $6,478.50 in the power sector , of which only one is currently underway ( the Central Java IPP project , as mentioned earlier ) . <p> Toll roads and railways <p> The development of tolled expressways in Indonesia has been painfully slow , with the bulk of the existing network being built prior to the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98 . The principal reason for the slow progress has been persistent problems with land acquisition . In addition , government guarantees are not available for the development of expressways . <p> On the land acquisition issue , it is expected that the new Land Acquisition Act ( 2012 ) , and its ancillary regulations , will help to significantly speed up the process . However , as mentioned earlier , the legislation only applies to acquisition processes commenced subsequent to its enactment , while acquisitions initiated prior to its enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby perpetuating the uncertainty that has plagued a number of major expressway projects , particularly in Java . <p> To date , a total of 87.51km of new expressway ( mostly in Greater Jakarta ) are at the contract negotiation stage with PPP sponsors , while 9.7km are currently under construction in Bali . In all , a total of 14 potential PPP expressways worth $33,147.53 million have been identified by Bappenas . <p> In the rail sector , the bulk of Indonesia 's rail network is focused in Java , which is densely populated and thus ideal for both passenger and freight services . Despite this , the history of Indonesian railways since independence has been a sad one , at least until recently , with many lines being closed or abandoned since the 1970s . At present , the country has some 6900km of track , of which only around 4800km is in use . <p> Until the Railways Act ( 2007 ) and its subsequent amendments , Indonesia 's rail sector was the domain of a state railway monopoly . The sector has now been liberalised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slow in populous Java , possibly due to government-mandated fare caps and the poor reputation of state rail operator PT KAI . <p> The story outside Java is different , with a number of major railway projects ( both private and PPP-based ) planned for Sumatra and Kalimantan ( Indonesian Borneo ) on the back of the coal boom of recent years . <p> Indonesia has become the world 's biggest exporter of thermal coal , mainly from Sumatra and Kalimantan . To date , the coal has been transported along narrow country roads in Sumatra , much to the chagrin of local people , or by barge along Kalimantan 's wide rivers , such as the Mahakam . <p> In all , Bappenas has identified three potential PPP schemes in the railway sector worth a total of $4783 million . Only one project is actually underway : a dedicated coal railway in Central Kalimantan Province from Puruk Cahu to Bangkuang and eventually onwards to the coal port of Lupak Dalam . The project has commenced but has been delayed due to the need to revise the proposed alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . <p> Ports <p> If Indonesia 's economy is to achieve its long-term growth potential and meet the targets set in the MP3EI , it is essential that its port infrastructure be upgraded . The country has some 2000 ports , most of which are state-owned and managed , and almost all of which fail to meet modern efficiency standards . Bappenas has identified four port projects worth $2875.12 million that are suitable for development as PPP schemes . While work has not yet begun on any of these , one project is ready for offer , namely , the Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal in Karangasem , Bali . <p> Aviation <p> As an archipelagic nation made up of 17500 islands , Indonesia has become enormously dependent on air travel since the liberalisation of the sector a decade ago . With the advent of low cost carriers , the country now boasts one of the most rapidly expanding domestic air traffic markets in the world , with passenger numbers increasing from 43.8 million in 2009 to 58.85 million in 2011 . The Ministry of Transport 's directorate general of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 20% this year . <p> Bappenas has identified a total of four projects worth $1,354 million in the aviation sector for development as PPP schemes , of which none are as yet underway . <p> Environmental technology <p> Indonesia has fallen badly behind many of its neighbours in terms of environmental health and sanitation , and now faces an uphill struggle to bring adequate clean water and sanitation to a rapidly growing population . Demand for clean water is increasing on the back of economic development in both urban and rural areas , plus a burgeoning middle class . While it is expected that around 50% of the Indonesian population will have access to clean water by the end of 2012 , this proportion is still far below the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) for clean water access . Similarly , the level of access to adequate sanitation is also extremely low . <p> Bappenas has earmarked 24 sanitation and water supply projects worth $2431.82 million for development as PPP schemes , with negotiations or work having commenced on three of these . <h> How much longer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges for PPPs are corruption and legal uncertainty . There is also a lack of coordination between governmental agencies at central and local levels . This is related to regional autonomy , introduced in the late 1990s , which accords wide-ranging powers to municipal governments . This has given rise to constraints in many sectors as inadequate governmental capacity , corruption , vote-buying and other abuses have resulted in local governments frequently clashing with the centre over the issuance of mining permits and zoning rules , among other things . A recent example is the Sei Mangke special economic zone in Simalungun County , North Sumatra Province , where the local government is adamantly refusing to rezone land from agricultural to industrial use for the construction of a new Unilever plant . <p> Other constraints persist , such as the fear of changes in government policy in response to short-term political exigencies , the continued unavailability of gap funding ( hopefully to be remedied soon ) , and weak preparation of PPP schemes , all of which tend to discourage investment by financial institutions . <p> In addition , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many wonder whether the MP3EI will survive the advent of a new administration . <p> Nevertheless , the Government to date appears serious about implementing the Masterplan , and has produced an impressive collection of documentation , facts and figures to back up its intentions .

This growth is due to the country 's robust financial centre , free trade zones and container ports , and the $5.25 billion expansion of the Panama Canal . Consequently , Panama has emerged as a hotspot for foreign investment . <p> Panama 's aviation industry has faced significant changes in recent years because of this economic expansion . The principle airport in Panama City , Tocumen International Airport ( Tocumen ) , is currently undergoing its third phase of expansion . This is part of an ambitious renovation programme launched by the Panamanian government in 2006 . With an investment of $800 million , the third phase is scheduled to be completed in 2017 .

The answer is that Panama enjoys an enviable geographical position compared to its central and south American neighbours . As a result , many of the world 's top airlines have seen Panama as an attractive hub from which to develop their expansion plans in Latin America . Additionally , the strong and efficient operation of Copa Airlines out of Tocumen , and the execution of many code-sharing agreements between Copa Airlines and numerous European , Latin American and Middle Eastern operators , have facilitated the arrival of foreign airlines to Panama . <p> These geographical and economic advantages have been integral to the strategic marketing campaigns put into place by Panama 's tourism ministry , as well as by Copa Airlines itself . As a result of this partnership , Tocumen has become known as the ' Hub of the Americas ' in the aviation industry . <p> Another reason for the airport 's success is the way it is run .

Tocumen also has its own procurement law , which gives its board of directors the authority to approve concession agreements . Tocumen can manage its own procurement processes and issue bonds or any other financial instrument to finance its expansion programme . This structure has been efficient in terms of decision-making and has added a degree of flexibility to the airport 's management . <h> Air transportation agreements <p> Panamas legal framework has not been an obstacle to the development of bilateral agreements in relation to commercial aviation rights with other countries , or to the access of foreign or national airlines to the Panamanian air transportation market .

@@8538378 @1738378/ <h> 1 . REGULATORY FRAMEWORK <p> The Investment and Securities Act ( ISA ) and the Rules and Regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC Rules ) govern M&amp;A in Nigeria . The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is responsible for reviewing and approving M&amp;As . Where the target is listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange ( NSE ) , the listing rules may be relevant . <h> 1.2 How , by whom , and by what measures , are takeover regulations ( or equivalent ) enforced ? <p> The ISA and the SEC Rules regulate takeovers and they are enforced by the SEC . Section 131 of the ISA sets out the conditions that will trigger a requirement to make a mandatory takeover offer ( MTO ) and where such conditions occur , the SEC will usually give the acquiring party three months to make the MTO and can impose administrative sanctions for non-compliance. <h> 2 . STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 2.1 What are the basic structures for friendly and hostile acquisitions ? <p> Friendly acquisitions are achieved by means of a negotiated buy-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger or a takeover bid ( which may be voluntary or mandatory ) . <p> Nigerian law does not provide a framework for hostile acquisitions . <h> 2.2 What determines the choice of structure , including in the case of a cross-border deal ? <p> The structure for an acquisition will usually depend on the shareholding of the target company , and the disposition of the shareholders of the target . <p> Where the shares are closely held , the acquisition could be easily and quickly achieved through a negotiated buy-out between the acquirer and the controlling shareholders . Where the shares are more widely held , the acquisition could be by means of a scheme or a takeover bid . Under the terms of a scheme , shareholders representing not less than 75% of those present and voting must approve a resolution for the acquisition of their shares by the acquirer at a specified price . If approved , all the shareholders are bound , whether they voted for or against the scheme . By contrast , under the takeover bid , each shareholder chooses whether or not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to take an active view of their investments and will consider and respond to a takeover bid , this is not perceived as being true of retail investors . <p> Where an acquirer is able to acquire more than 30% of the issued share capital of a public company by a negotiated sale or a scheme , this will trigger an obligation to make an MTO to the remaining shareholders of the company . <h> 2.3 How quickly can a bidder complete an acquisition ? How long is the deal open to competing bids ? <p> This will depend on the means by which the acquisition is to be carried out , and whether any approvals are required . From the point at which a bidder is chosen the acquisition could take from one to three months . Where the acquisition is for a majority interest in the target company , the SEC is responsible for carrying out a merger control review to ensure that the transaction will not have an impact on competition in the relevant industry . The NSE must be notified and its consent obtained if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These approvals can impact the timing for completion of the transaction . <p> The question of how long the deal is open to competing bids depends on the structure of the acquisition . A takeover bid is required to remain open for at least 21 days and could remain open for up to 35 days . <p> An acquisition by way of a scheme or a merger can usually be completed within three months . <h> 2.4 Are there restrictions on the price offered or its form ( cash or shares ) ? <p> With the exception of a takeover bid ( in relation to the price offered to shareholders ) , there are generally no restrictions on the price or the form of the consideration and this is usually determined by the valuation of the target and the negotiations between the sellers and the bidders . <p> In a scheme , in order to be attractive , the price will usually be a mark up on the price at which the shares of the target are trading on the floor of the NSE. <h> 2.5 What level of acceptance/ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily squeeze out or otherwise eliminate minority shareholders ? <p> In order for an acquirer to be entitled to squeeze out minority shareholders under a takeover bid , 90% of the shares that were the subject of the bid must have been tendered . For the purposes of this threshold , the shares already held by the acquirer are not included . Once a scheme has been approved by the relevant percentage of shareholders , all other shareholders of the target will be bound by the scheme and can be squeezed out . <h> 2.6 Do minority shareholders enjoy protections against the payment of control premiums , other preferential pricing for selected shareholders , and partial acquisitions , for example by mandatory offer requirements , ownership disclosure obligations and a best price/all holders rule ? <p> Yes . The takeover rules require that shareholders of the same class be treated equally by a buyer ; they should be given the same information and offered the same price for their shares . If the acquirer purchases shares of the target in the market at a price that is higher than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be deemed to have been amended accordingly . <p> The takeover bid document must disclose the number of shares which the offeror and its affiliates already hold in the target . Any existing agreement or arrangement between the offeror and any of the directors of the target which is connected to , or dependent on the takeover offer must be disclosed . <p> In relation to schemes , the new NSE Rules prohibit a party that is interested in a transaction from voting on any decision in relation to that transaction . <h> 2.7 To what extent can buyers make conditional offers , for example subject to financing , absence of material adverse changes or truth of representations ? Are bank guarantees or certain funding of the purchase price required ? <p> The ISA requires an offeror to make adequate arrangements to ensure that the funds required to pay for any shares that are tendered under a takeover offer are available . The SEC would , therefore , expect to see clear evidence that the relevant funds are available in the form of bank statements or audited financials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . <p> It is possible to make an offer subject to certain conditions , for instance , the offer can be made conditional on the acquirer receiving a specified minimum level of acceptances . <h> 3 . TAX CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What are the basic tax considerations and trade-offs ? <p> The consent of the Board of the Federal Inland Revenue Service must be obtained for every merger and asset transfer in Nigeria . <p> There is no capital gains tax on the transfer of shares and this makes an acquisition by means of a transfer of shares more tax efficient than the transfer of the target 's assets . <h> 3.2 Are there special considerations in cross-border deals ? <p> No. <h> 4 . ANTI-TAKEOVER DEFENCES <h> 4.1 What are the most important forms of anti-takeover defences and are there any restrictions on their use ? <p> There is no provision in the ISA or SEC Rules for anti-takeover defences . However , the most effective ways in which a company could seek to prevent a takeover would be to limit access to information such as information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also not clear whether it will be possible to complete a takeover bid if the board of the target company does not issue a directors ' circular . <h> 4.2 How do targets use anti-takeover defences ? <p> See 4.1. <h> 4.3 Is a target required to provide due diligence information to a potential bidder ? <p> No. <h> 4.4 How do bidders overcome anti-takeover defences ? <p> Not applicable . <h> 4.5 Are there many examples of successful hostile acquisitions ? <p> No. <h> 5 . DEAL PROTECTIONS <h> 5.1 What are the main ways for a friendly bidder and target to protect a friendly deal from a hostile interloper ? <p> Not applicable . <h> 5.2 To what extent are deal protections prevented , for example by restrictions on impediments to competing bidders , break fees or lock-up agreements ? <p> It is unusual for a Nigerian target to provide break fees . <p> In relation to takeover bids , the listing rules of the NSE provide that no offer may be conditional on the payment of compensation for loss of an offer . Where such a payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target could require an acquirer to continue to hold a minimum amount of equity in the target for a specified period . Lock-up arrangements that restrict the ability of the target or certain key shareholders to enter into discussions with future bidders for an agreed period of time are not uncommon . <h> 6 . ANTITRUST/REGULATORY REVIEW <h> 6.1 What are the anti-trust notification thresholds in your jurisdiction ? <p> The provisions of the ISA and the SEC Rules empower the SEC to determine whether any merger , acquisition or business combination is likely to substantially prevent or lessen competition . <p> Mergers are divided into three categories : small mergers ; intermediate mergers ; and , large mergers . Both intermediate and large mergers are subject to prior review and approval by the SEC . A small merger is where the combined assets or turnover of the merging companies is less than N1 billion ( $5 million ) . In relation to intermediate and large mergers , a pre-merger notification is required to be filed at the SEC . <p> An acquisition for a majority interest in a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC , except where the acquisition is in a private or an unlisted public company with assets or turnover below N500 million . <h> 6.2 When will transactions falling below those thresholds be investigated ? <p> Within six months of a small merger being completed , the SEC may require the parties to notify it of the merger if , in the SEC 's opinion : ( i ) the merger may substantially prevent or lessen competition ; or ( ii ) the merger can not be justified on public interest grounds . <p> Following its investigation , the SEC may approve the small merger , prohibit it from being completed , or declare that the merger is prohibited if it has been completed . <h> 6.3 Is an anti-trust notification filing mandatory or voluntary ? <p> The pre-merger notification filing is mandatory for intermediate and large mergers . Parties to a small merger may voluntarily notify the SEC of the merger at any time . <p> The notification is mandatory for acquisitions involving companies with assets or turnover above N500 million <h> 6.4 What are the deadlines for filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The pre-merger notification must be filed before the merger is concluded . For acquisitions involving companies with a turnover of more than N500 million , the SEC must be notified before the acquisition is completed . Failure to comply could attract a penalty of N100,000 and N5,000 for every day of default . <h> 6.5 How long are the anti-trust review periods ? <p> For an intermediate merger , the SEC review must be completed within 20 working days although the SEC may extend this period by 40 working days . The SEC 's review period for large mergers is 40 working days . <h> 6.6 At what level does your anti-trust authority have jurisdiction to review and impose penalties for failure to notify deals that do not have local competition effect ? <p> The obligation to notify the SEC of , and obtain its approval for , intermediate and large mergers is absolute . This is also the case for acquisitions even if the transaction may not have any local competition effect . <h> 6.7 What other regulatory or related obstacles do bidders face , including national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation and other governmental regulation ? <p> In certain sectors such as banking and insurance , the prior approval of the relevant regulator is required for transactions involving the acquisition of shares or voting rights that exceed certain thresholds . <h> 7 . ANTI-CORRUPTION REGIMES <h> 7.1 What is the applicable anti-corruption legislation in your jurisdiction ? <h> 7.2 What are the potential sanctions and how stringently have they been enforced ? <p> Any person who is convicted under the CPA for corruptly receiving any property for himself or for another , in relation to his acts or omissions in his official capacity is liable to imprisonment for seven years . The CCA also contains similar provisions and penalties . Similar penalties apply for concealing a crime or frustrating the investigation of any suspected crime of corruption . Sanctions imposed under the EFCC Act include the forfeiture of assets and the freezing of bank accounts . <p> There has been some degree of criticism by the Nigerian public that these sanctions have not been effectively enforced against public and government officials . <h> 8 . OTHER MATTERS <h> 8.1 Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect a public M&amp;A transaction ? <p> Please see 8.2. <h> 8.2 What are the key recent M&amp;A developments in your jurisdiction ? <p> The new rules published by the SEC in May 2014 introduced exemptions to the MTO regime , the most notable of which is that there is no requirement to make an MTO where an ailing company undertakes a private placement which results in a strategic investor acquiring more than 30% of the voting rights of the company . <p> The new NSE Rule which prohibits a party that is interested in a transaction from voting on any decision in relation to that transaction reflects the desire of the NSE to protect minority rights and entrench global best practice in Nigeria . <p> The NSE recently implemented a five-year exemption from value added tax on stock market transaction fees , which has reduced the cost of transactions for potential acquirers . <p> Yinka Edu is a partner in the firm 's banking , finance and capital markets and M&amp;A teams .

The ensuing decrease in the value of real estate in Japan severely impacted the real estate finance market . Numerous loans secured by real estate were accelerated or defaulted . While new investments into real estate have been limited after the crisis , recently some distress funds and offshore investors have been purchasing defaulted loans and distressed assets . <p> Before the financial crisis , Japan enacted the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ) , which came into force on September 30 2007 . The FIEA broadened the scope of the definitions of " securities " and " financial instrument businesses " and imposed stricter obligations and regulations on businesses and the real estate finance market in Japan . Most notably affected were GK-TK Schemes , which were the prevalent finance schemes before the FIEA was enacted . Subsequent to the enactment of the FIEA , these Schemes have become heavily regulated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaisha are used as special purpose vehicles have become the preferred finance scheme in Japan 's real estate finance market . <h> Typical structures <p> In the Japanese market , aside from investments into real estates through the use of real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , TMK Schemes or GK-TK Schemes are the most commonly used forms of real estate finance . When an investor plans to invest into real estate in Japan by obtaining part of its purchase proceeds through debt financing , the investor needs to consider which Scheme is most suited for the investment . <p> Figure 1 : Typical structure of the GK-TK scheme <p> Figure 2 : Typical structure of the TMK Scheme <h> GK-TK Scheme <p> Under the GK-TK Scheme , a SPV will be established in the form of a godo kaisha ( GK ) , which is a simple structured limited liability company incorporated under the Corporations Act of Japan . The GK will act as the borrower and the holder of the assets to be invested . <p> A parent SPV will contribute and hold capital on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Common examples of parent SPVs used in the GK-TK Scheme include ( i ) Cayman SPVs whose common shares are entrusted to a charitable trust and ( ii ) ippan shadan hojins , non-profit corporations incorporated under the Act on General Incorporated Associations and General Incorporated Foundations of Japan . <p> The GK acquires equity through a tokumei kumiai ( TK ) investment , which is a bilateral contractual arrangement under the Commercial Code of Japan . This is used to form a commercial venture between a passive investor ( the TK Investor ) and a business proprietor ( the TK Operator ) . The business operations of the TK are managed solely by the TK Operator . The TK Investor is entitled to distributions from the profits of the commercial venture . <p> The GK will generally enter into an asset-based financing arrangement with a lender in order to purchase the target asset . More often than not , the lender is a money lending business operator registered under the Money Lending Business Act of Japan , or a bank . <p> The GK usually acquires the asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset is the target real estate . Accordingly , if the target asset is not held within a trust , the seller will be required to establish a trust by entering into a trust agreement with a trust bank or a trust company before transferring the asset to the GK . <p> In order to avoid licensing obligations , the GK will tend not to own real estate ( known as hard assets ) directly . If the GK , which is also the TK Operator , owns a hard asset , the GK will be required to adhere to the regulations under the Real Estate Specified Joint Enterprise Act and as such obtain the necessary licences applicable under the Act . Additionally , if the GK invests directly into a hard asset , the GK may also be required to obtain a licence under the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act . <h> TMK Scheme <p> Under the TMK Scheme , a TMK will be established as a SPV to acquire the target asset . TMKs are corporations which have a separate legal personality . While GKs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are incorporated under and governed by the Securitisation Act . <p> As is the case with the GK-TK Scheme , in order to ensure the bankruptcy remoteness of the TMK , all common shares in the TMK will typically be contributed and held by a Cayman SPV , ippan shadan hojin , or other SPV . The voting rights in a shareholders ' meeting of the TMK are vested in common shareholders , with the exception that preferred shareholders have limited voting rights in some significant matters . The subscription amount of the common shares is usually limited to a nominal amount and the subscription money will not be used to purchase the asset . <p> If certain qualifying conditions are met , the TMK will be entitled to deduct the amount of dividends distributed to its shareholders from the taxable income of the TMK . In order for the TMK to enjoy this deductibility of dividends , in principle the TMK must issue more than 50% of its common shares to Japanese residents . However , even if more than 50% of the common shares are held by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available if the non-resident common shareholder waives its rights to receive dividends . <p> Other than the nominal amount contributed by the common shareholder , the TMK will predominately raise equity through issuing preference shares to investors . As is the case with common shares , in order to enjoy the benefit of the deductibility of dividends , more than 50% of the preferred shares in the TMK must be issued to Japanese residents . In order to satisfy this requirement , an offshore investor will generally set up a subsidiary in Japan in the form of a GK or other company . The newly-incorporated Japanese subsidiary will then acquire 51% of the preferred shares in the TMK , while the remaining 49% of the preferred shares will be issued directly to the offshore investor or its offshore subsidiary . <p> Under the Securitisation Act , the acquisition of funds through debt financing by the TMK to purchase the target assets must be made either through specified loans ( tokutei kariire , or TMK Loans ) or specified bonds ( tokutei shasai , or TMK Bonds ) . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must either ( i ) issue TMK Bonds whose aggregated subscription amount is more than 100 million ( $1.3 million ) through a public offering ; or ( ii ) issue TMK Bonds solely to Qualified Institutional Investors ( QIIs ) as defined in the Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxation . The definition of the QII includes banks , insurance companies , securities firms and certain other institutional investors . In practice , most TMK Bonds are issued by way of private placement in order to avoid the application of the disclosure obligations under the FIEA , and the holders of such TMK Bonds are generally limited to the QIIs as per the terms and conditions of the TMK Bonds in order to fulfil condition ( ii ) above . <p> In some TMK Schemes , debt financing is obtained solely by issuance of TMK Bonds . However , from the perspective of a financier , TMK Loans are preferable to TMK Bonds . TMK Bonds contain restrictions which limit the ability of a lender to possess security interests over the assets of the TMK for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to create security interests over certain assets to secure the payments of bonds , including TMK Bonds , the title holder of the assets has to enter into a trust agreement with a trust company or a trust bank in relation to management and enforcement of the security interests . Since compliance with the Secured Bonds Trust Act is arduous and costly , creation of security interests for the benefit of the holders of TMK Bonds in accordance with the Secured Bonds Trust Act is rarely used in the market . <p> In practice , TMK Bonds are secured solely by the statutory lien which is automatically created under the Securitisation Act upon purchase . In contrast to TMK Bonds , security interests created for the benefit of the TMK Loans are free from the limitations under the Secured Bonds Trust Act . Since the statutory lien under the Securitisation Act is generally believed to be subordinated to mortgages or pledges created over the assets of the TMK in priority of payments , in some deals not only are TMK Bonds used , but TMK Loans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The TMK is able to acquire the target asset either in the form of a hard asset or trust beneficiary interests . This is because the Real Estate Specified Joint Enterprise Act does not apply to TMK Schemes . Further , under the Securitisation Act , TMKs are explicitly exempt from the regulations under the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and therefore , and most notably , avoid the licensing obligations set out in each respective Act . <h> Advantages of TMK Schemes <p> Before the FIEA took effect in 2007 , GK-TK Schemes were heavily used compared to TMK Schemes . This was predominantly due to the notably higher costs and setup times required of TMK Schemes . Under the Securitisation Act , before the commencement of business , a TMK is required to file a notification of commencement of business , together with additional documentation including an asset liquidation plan which describes the TMK 's plan to acquire the target asset , to a Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance . <p> The plan must cover : <p> ( i ) the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities issued by the TMK ( including TMK Bonds , common shares and preference shares ) and the TMK Loans borrowed by the TMK ; <p> ( iii ) details of the assets to be purchased , including the timing of the acquisition and the name of the seller ; <p> ( iv ) details concerning the administration and disposition of the assets ; and <p> ( v ) details of loans other than the TMK Loans ( if any ) . <p> In contrast to TMK Schemes , in principle there were no compulsory filing obligations required under the GK-TK Schemes . Since the inception of the FIEA , however , GK-TK Schemes have been subject to more onerous regulations . While the regulations under the FIEA also apply to TMK Schemes in certain circumstances , it is generally believed that TMK Schemes now have greater benefits in relation to the regulations when compared with GK-TK Schemes . <h> Hard asset v beneficial interest <p> In Japan , a transfer of the title of real estate is subject to a substantial percentage of registration tax and real estate acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficiary interest ( TBI ) whose trust asset is real estate is only subject to nominal registration tax . Therefore , from a tax viewpoint , it can be said that investments into TBIs are a more appealing method of investing in real estate . <p> On the other hand , in respect of regulations , investments into hard assets are preferable to investments into TBIs . TBIs generally fall within the definition of securities under the FIEA . Accordingly , investments into TBIs will be subject to the regulations under the FIEA . Since GK-TK Schemes usually take investments in the form of TBIs , investments by a GK will be subject to the regulations under the FIEA , including those relating to investment management . Pursuant to these , the GK will be required to be registered with the Financial Services Agency of Japan , unless the GK satisfies one of the exemptions . In addition , where an asset manager provides asset management services in conjunction with the GK , then the asset manager will also be subject to FIEA regulations relating to investment management or investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acquiring hard assets without being subject to the regulations within the Real Estate Specified Joint Enterprise Act or the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act . In relation to TMKs which invest into hard assets , the FIEA regulations will apply only to issuances and solicitations of the securities issued by the TMKs such as TMK Bonds , common shares and preference shares . Neither the TMK nor its asset manager will be subject to the regulations relating investment management or investment advisory under the FIEA . In that sense , the TMK Schemes allow investors to choose an option to invest in hard assets in order to limit the application of the FIEA regulations . <h> Applicable FIEA regulations <p> As mentioned in the preceding section , asset managers in the GK-TK Schemes are subject to FIEA regulations in respect of either their investment management business or their investment advisory business . <p> Asset managers which provide asset management services in connection with TMKs which directly hold hard assets will not be subject to FIEA regulations on either their investment management business or their investment advisory business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services with the TMKs whose assets are TBIs will be subject to such regulations . <p> Under the GK-TK Schemes , GKs are subject to the FIEA regulations which relate to investment management . As such they are required to be registered with the Financial Services Agency , unless the GKs satisfy one of the exemptions to such registration requirements . <p> In contrast , TMKs are not subject to the regulations pertaining to investment management , even if TMKs invest in TBIs . Therefore , even in cases where investments are made in the form of TBIs , the TMK Schemes are less regulated by the FIEA and more flexible in terms of structuring when compared to the GK-TK Schemes . <p> Table 3 : Significant differences between TMK and GK-TK Schemes <p> TMK Scheme <p> GK-TK Scheme <p> Filing with the regulator <p> Notification of commencement of business together with asset liquidation plan must be filed with the competent Local Finance Bureau . <p> No filing with the regulator is necessary except for the filings required under the FIEA regulations . <p> Type of asset <p> Hard asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager <p> If the investment is made directly into hard asset(s) , the FIEA regulation will not apply to the asset management by the asset manager . <p> The FIEA regulation will apply to the asset management by the asset manager and the asset manager must be registered with the FST . <p> FIEA regulations applicable to SPV <p> If the investment is made directly into hard asset(s) , the FIEA regulation will not apply to the TMK other than the regulations applicable to the issuances and solicitations of the securities issued by the TMK . <p> The FIEA regulation can be applicable to the GK in relation to its acquisition and disposition of TBI , unless qualifying conditions of one of the exemptions are met. <h> 2011 amendments <p> Following the commencement of the FIEA in 2007 , TMK Schemes are seen as more advantageous than GK-TK Schemes as the application of the regulations under the FIEA are limited . <p> The Securitisation Act has , however , imposed limitations and restrictions on the operation of TMKs . One of the purposes of the 2011 Amendments is to eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to make them more flexible and user-friendly . The 2011 Amendments are expected to come into force by November 25 2011 . Although they were enacted on May 25 , details of the Amendments are to be set forth by the enforcement orders and ordinances which are expected to be enacted by the effective date of the amendments . Some of the key amendments are as follows : <h> Acquisitions of ancillary assets <p> Under the current Securitisation Act , TMKs must entrust furniture , fixtures and equipment and other assets which are ancillary to the target real estate with a trust bank or a trust company . Since trust banks and trust companies are hesitant in accepting entrustments of furniture , fixtures and equipment , and other movables , this requirement makes it difficult for TMKs to purchase real estate which accompanies such movable assets ( typically hotels and serviced apartments ) . <p> Following the 2011 Amendments , certain ancillary assets are exempt from the trust obligations . Subsequently , it is anticipated that acquisitions by TMKs of hotels , service apartments and other real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible . The exact scope of the ancillary assets which are to be exempt from the trust obligations will be set forth in the enforcement orders and ordinances which are under preparation by the regulator . <p> Abolition of the limitation on use of TMK Loans <p> Under the Securitisation Act , the use of the proceeds from TMK Loans is in principle restricted to acquisitions of the target assets . There has been extensive debate regarding whether such proceeds can be used for other purposes such as refinancing of current debt . <p> The 2011 Amendments have abolished the restriction on the use of the proceeds from the TMK Loans . Consequently , TMKs are likely to be entitled to use proceeds from TMK Loans for purposes other than acquisitions of the target assets , within the amount specified within the asset liquidation plan . <p> About the author <p> Ko Hanamizu is a partner at Anderson Mori &amp; Tomotsune .

The Ministry of Finance , which is responsible for the implementation of the Payment Services Directive , presented a draft Government bill ( lagrsdsremiss ) on March 9 2010 . On June 22 2010 , the parliament decided to adopt the new Payment Services Act ( Lag ( 2010:751 ) om betaltjSnster ? the Act ) . It entered into force on August 1 2010 . <p> The Act is similar to the Payment Services Directive in both framework and content . The legislator 's intent is clearly stipulated in the preparatory work ; the Act shall deviate as little as possible from the Payment Services Directive and gold-plating shall be avoided as much as possible . In the Act , the member states are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , certain options have been used . <p> The most prominent example of the options chosen is Article 52.3 in which a member state can choose to prohibit a payee to charge any fees against the payer when using a payment instrument ; including surcharging of credit cards . This choice of the legislator has caused some confusion and created some ambiguities as the preparatory work is somewhat indistinct and unclear in this matter . <p> In the preparatory works ( Proposal 2009/10:220 ) , it is stated not only that Sweden opted for a prohibition , but also that companies within the European Union could not contract out of the prohibition against surcharging . The question was raised by the Swedish Consumer Agency , which had received multiple complaints as consumers were charged when paying by credit card for airline travels . The position of the Swedish Consumers Agency has changed , since the Swedish law entered into force , from arguing that Swedish consumers paying by credit/debit cards can not be surcharged ( with some minor exceptions ) to the position that a consumer can be charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning is that surcharging for payment by credit/debit card is to be considered as part of a contract of carriage and that the parties ( in reality the airline ) can chose which law is applicable in accordance with Article 5 of the Rome Convention ( Rome I ) . <p> It shall be noted that the prohibition for surcharging is in respect of consumers only . Fees , information requirements when performing payment services and the rights and obligations under the Act in relation to the provision and use of payment services , can be excluded from agreements in respect of non-consumers . <p> A separate act on the implementation of Article 61 in the Directive regarding payers ' liability for unauthorised payment transactions ( Lag ( 2010:738 ) om obehriga transaktioner med betalningsinstrument ) entered into force on August 1 2010 replacing 34 of the Consumer Credit Act ( Konsumentkreditlag ( 1992:830 ) ) . The scope of the act is extended to payment instruments other than debit and credit cards . Where an unauthorised transaction results from use of a personal code , such as a PIN-code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kr1,200 ( $180 ) . Where the unauthorised transaction results from gross negligence on the side of the payer , this limit does not apply , although a maximum limit of kr12,000 is set for consumers . In case of fraud or other blameworthy circumstances , a consumer may have to bear the whole cost . <p> As the Swedish Payment Services Act has only been in force for a short time , some more clarification issues will presumably arise and it will be interesting to follow this new legislations development and any case-law that might follow .

In order to remain financially competitive in the region , Singapore introduced a similar guarantee scheme . <p> The Ministry of Finance and Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) issued a joint statement on October 16 2008 announcing that the government will guarantee " all Singapore Dollar and foreign currency deposits of individual and non-bank customers in banks , finance companies and merchant banks licensed by the MAS " . The joint statement stated that this guarantee is backed by S$150 billion ( $103 billion ) of the reserves of the government and will remain in effect until December 31 2010 . The guarantee will cover the full amount of deposits by all non-bank depositors , both corporate and individuals , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation . <p> According to the ministerial statement by the Minister for Trade &amp; Industry and Deputy Chairman of the MAS dated October 22 2008 , this move was made to pre-empt any loss of deposits in local financial institutions in view of the implementation of blanket government guarantees on deposits by various governments in the region . The guarantee can bolster confidence in the financial system and provide stability during such uncertain times . <p> After more than six months , apart from the joint statement and the ministerial statement , there is no official publication on the exact terms of the guarantee . It is thus difficult for depositors to determine whether they fall within the scope of coverage under the guarantee . Further , in the event claims should arise under the guarantee , the lack of rules can create unnecessary administrative problems and may even lead to arbitrary standards being imposed in assessing the amount of compensation . <p> In contrast , the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had in February 2009 announced the scope of coverage of a similar blanket guarantee by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong government 's guarantee is based on its deposit insurance scheme . <p> It remains to be confirmed officially by the Singapore government whether Singapore may adopt a similar approach as that of the Hong Kong government . If a similar approach is taken , it is likely that the coverage of the guarantee will be limited to deposits which are insured under the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme ( and also extended to cover foreign currency deposits ) and depositors in Singapore will do well to note that only current , savings and fixed deposits will be guaranteed . " Structured deposits " and deposits that are " pledged , charged or secured as collateral " and deposits that are set aside and subject to a contractual right of set-off are not guaranteed . <p> Pending any official clarification by the Singapore government on the terms of the guarantee or instructions from the MAS , it is the writers ' view that the guarantee remains to be governed by official announcements and it is arguable that any restriction under the Singapore Deposit Insurance Scheme should not apply . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in Singapore 's financial system during this period of economic turmoil .

Are there tax structures and/or favourable intermediary tax jurisdictions that are particularly useful for FDI into the country ? <p> Typical entities used to make corporate acquisitions in the UK include English limited companies , Dutch coops/BVs and Luxembourg companies . <h> 4.2 . What are the applicable corporate tax rates ? <p> From April 1 2013 , the main corporation tax rate is 23% for companies whose taxable profits exceed 1.5 million per annum . This will reduce to 21% from April 1 2014 and 20% from April 1 2015 .

How difficult is it for foreign investors to secure expatriate visas for shareholder representatives and workers ? <p> Nationals of countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland generally have a right to live and work in the UK . <p> For people from outside these regions , the UK government has introduced new rules to enable visa applications for entrepreneurs and high value investors to be fast tracked .

This requirement will apply even if the goods are being exported to a group company in an affected jurisdiction . <h> 6 . Legal and regulatory framework <h> 6.1 . Are there any other FDI-specific laws that foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> There are no legal or regulatory restrictions specific to FDI into the UK . Generally speaking , the same rules apply to overseas owners of , and investors in , businesses as apply to British or European owners and investors . <p> Common with many countries globally , foreign ownership of airlines is limited .

Companies in which the UK government currently holds a golden share include BAE Systems , Rolls-Royce , QinetiQ , National Air Traffic Control Systems and certain dockyards . <p> In certain other sectors ( particularly in regulated industries ) , prior authorisation may be required before a change of control or a significant investment occurs . Although these apply equally to UK and foreign investors , a number of these are worth mentioning here : <p> Businesses regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority : Most companies carrying on business in the banking , insurance and investment sectors in the UK are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) .

However , if a company has any contracts with the UK Ministry of Defence , these will contain terms which will be relevant to consider in the context of a takeover or investment , including a provision allowing the Ministry of Defence to terminate the contract upon a change of control . <p> Media : There are media ownership rules for television , radio and newspapers . The rules aim to help protect plurality of viewpoints and give citizens access to a variety of sources of news , information and opinion .

What challenges if any do investors find in getting certainty around local law and regulation ? <p> The UK has an extremely stable and mature legal and regulatory system and this is one of the reasons why the UK is a favoured jurisdiction for inward FDI . <p> The UK is ranked by the World Bank as one of the top jurisdictions in terms of ease of doing business . Notwithstanding this , the UK government has a continuous focus on reducing and eliminating so-called red tape to ensure that the UK remains a competitive and attractive place to do business . <h> 7 . Dispute resolution <h> 7.1 . How efficient are local courts ' enforcement and dispute resolution proceedings , and are there any procedural idiosyncrasies foreign investors must be aware of ? <p> The courts in the UK are very efficient at dealing with disputes and parties are able to effectively enforce their rights through court proceedings . Proceedings are generally completed within one to two years , although more complex cases can take longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts employ an adversarial system , with each party 's case being extensively tested . The parties are required to disclose all documents in their possession that are relevant to the dispute ( save for privileged documents ) . Witnesses generally provide evidence in chief by way of witness statements and are then cross examined orally at trial . <p> The UK has a loser pays rule in relation to the costs of court proceedings , so that an unsuccessful party generally pays the successful party 's costs . Claimants from outside the EU or European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) may be required to provide security for costs . <p> Investors should note that England and Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland are each separate jurisdictions within the UK , with their own court systems . <h> 7.2 . Do the courts of the FDI jurisdiction respect foreign judgments and are arbitration awards enforceable in the jurisdiction ? <p> The UK courts generally respect foreign judgments , unless the foreign judgment can be challenged on the grounds of fraud or public policy . <p> Save for certain exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead will need to be enforced by way of fresh legal proceedings in the UK . However , a proceeding on a foreign judgment is often determined on a summary basis and the UK courts take a narrow view of the possible defences to such an action . <p> If a foreign judgment is from a court in certain Commonwealth jurisdictions , or an EU or EFTA member state , the judgment may be enforced directly in the UK once it has been registered . <p> Arbitration awards are enforceable in the UK by way of an application to a UK court . The UK is a party to the New York Convention of 1958 and so enforcement of an arbitration award made in a contracting state to the New York Convention may only be refused on very limited grounds . <h> 7.3 . Are judgments and arbitration awards from the FDI jurisdiction generally enforceable in other jurisdictions ? <p> The question of whether a judgment from a UK court is enforceable in another jurisdiction is one for the law of the state where enforcement is to take place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration in other EU and EFTA member states . UK judgments are also enforceable in certain Commonwealth countries . <p> As mentioned above , the UK is a party to the New York Convention and so arbitration awards from the UK are relatively easily enforced in the courts of other contracting states to the New York Convention . <p> Ronan O'Sullivan is the chair of the London office of Paul Hastings and vice chair of the global Corporate Department of the firm .

In support of such efforts , the Asset-backed Securitization Act ( the ABS Act ) and the Real Estate Investment Company Act ( the Reits Act ) were enacted in 1998 and 2001 , respectively . <p> Also , the enactment of the Indirect Investment Asset Management Business Act ( Iiamba ) gave rise to more diverse real estate financing methods , making investments by institutional funds in real estate permissible . The popularity of real estate financing under Iiamba is evidenced by statistical figures ? as of June 1 2007 , 164 real estate investment funds existed under Iiamba , amounting to W5.6 trillion ( $6 million ) in equity value . <h> Structure <p> Real estate funds ( REF ) can generally be subdivided into two broad categories under Iiamba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REF . Because the corporate REF is statutorily limited from investing more than 70% in real estate assets , the trust REF is the favoured option . As of June 1 2007 , out of the 164 REFs in operation , only four were corporate REFs and the remaining 160 were trust REFs . In light of the foregoing , this article will primarily focus on the trust REF . <h> The trust REF <p> The trust REF is established when the asset management company ( AMC ) and the trust company enter into a trust agreement . Unlike the corporate REF , because the trust REF is not a juridical person , the legal relationship is , in principle , governed by the Korean trust laws . <p> Equity offering <p> AMC delegates to the sales company the functions of selling the beneficiary certificates by entering into an entrustment agreement with the sales company . The sales company enters into a sales agreement with each beneficiary certificate holder ( BC holder ) for the sale of the certificates . BC holders pay the consideration for the beneficiary certificates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to the trust company . <p> The AMC may sell beneficiary certificates directly to potential BC holders if the aggregate amount of certificates sold directly by the AMC is the lesser of ( i ) 20% or less of the aggregate amount of certificates for all the funds managed by the AMC ; and ( ii ) W400 billion . <p> Debt financing <p> At the AMC 's instruction , the trust company may borrow funds from lenders by entering into credit agreements with such lenders . Under Korean trust laws , the trust company is the borrower , but the decision to borrow funds is made by the AMC . As such , lenders would generally request that the AMC sign the relevant credit agreement . <p> Under the Iiamba , an REF can , in principle , borrow up to two times its net asset value from Korean financial institutions . ( It is theoretically possible for BC holders to resolve to debt finance beyond this threshold and/or to borrow from entities that are not Korean financial institutions , through a resolution at a BC holders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Issuance of bonds does not appear to be a feasible financing option under the Presidential Decree of the Iiamba and the Korean trust structure . ) <p> However , borrowed funds may only be used to invest in real estate assets . It is notable that , of all the fund formats that are available under the Iiamba , debt financing is only permitted for REFs . <p> Buying real estate <p> The trust company acquires real estate at the instruction of the AMC by entering into a sale-and-purchase agreement with the seller . Under the Korean trust laws , the acquirer is the trust company ( and is the title holder in the relevant real estate registry ) , however , because the decision-making authority is with the AMC , a seller will usually request that the AMC be a party to the agreement . <p> Leasing real estate <p> At the instruction of the AMC , the trust company may enter into lease agreements with tenants . Under Korean trust laws , the trust company is the lessor but , because the decision-making authority is with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party to the lease agreement . The AMC may delegate the leasing , management , maintenance , repair and improvement activities for the subject real estate to a third party . <p> Diagram 1 : the trust REF <p> Notes : <p> An asset management company ( AMC ) , licensed by the Korean Financial Supervisory Committee ( the FSC ) , is given the power to establish and terminate the trust REF and to manage and instruct the management of the assets of the trust REF . <p> A trust company is an entity registered with the FSC that holds title to and manages the assets of the trust REF and audits the asset management activities of the AMC . <p> A sales company is a financial institution , such as a securities company , bank or an insurance company registered with the FSC , that engages in the sale of the beneficiary certificates ( BC ) . <p> An administrative management company is a corporation registered with the FSC , which engages in the trust REF 's corporate governance activities . Unlike the company REF , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an administrative management company , but the general market practice is to do so . <h> Benefits of the REF structure <p> By way of comparison , under the ABS Act 's ABS structure , there are strict originator ( that is , seller of real estate ) qualifications . That is , to sell to an ABS special purpose company ( an ABS SPC ) , the originator must be a financial institution , a listed company or must have at least a certain minimum credit rating . <p> As for the three types of real estate investment companies under the Reits Act , corporate restructuring Reits ' assets have to be composed of at least 70% of real estate that are disposed of by the seller for corporate restructuring purposes . As for the other two Reits structures : no tax incentives exist for K-Reits , and a 30% cap per investor requirement exists for paper Reits . <p> Under the REF structure , however , there is no preset requirement to be a seller of real estate to the REF , tax incentives are provided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seller for corporate restructuring purposes , and the maximum cap on equity one investor can make in the REF is 80% . <p> An ABS SPC is prohibited from investing in real estate development projects . As for Reits , investment in real estate development projects is limited to 30% or less of their assets , except for certain limited cases . <p> In the case of an REF , investment in real estate development projects is limited to 30% or less of its assets , however : ( i ) loans to real estate development companies are permissible up to 100% of the REF 's net assets ; ( ii ) acquisition of up to 100% of a company that has a limited duration and that is established for a specific real estate development purpose is permissible ; and ( iii ) obtaining rights to real estate that is in the process of development is permissible ( whereby the trust company and the counterparty would enter into a sale-and-purchase agreement before the project 's completion ) . <p> Establishment and procedure <p> For both ABS and Reits structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To structure an ABS , about two weeks is required to submit a pre-filing of an ABS plan with the FSC . To structure a Reit , more than one month is required to obtain preliminary approval and the main approval from the Ministry of Construction and Transportation . <p> On the other hand , establishment of a corporation is unnecessary for the trust REF . Also , the trust agreement only has to be reported to the FSC before the execution of the trust agreement , in the case of a public offering , or reported to the FSC within seven days after the execution of the trust agreement , in the case of a private offering . <p> Tax perspectives <p> Substantial tax benefits are afforded to the trust REF , compared to a case where the real estate is acquired , held and disposed of by an ordinary corporation . Some of the distinctions are shown in Table 1 . <p> Table 1 : Tax benefits of a trust REF structure <p> Ordinary corporation <p> Trust REF <p> Capital registration tax on the acquirer company <p> 0.48% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Seoul Metropolitan Area ) of the paid-in capital of the corporation <p> N/A <p> Acquisition tax ( including 10% special tax for rural development ) <p> 2.2% of the acquisition value of the real property <p> 1.1% of the acquisition value of the real property <p> Registration tax ( including 20% local education tax ) <p> 2.4% ( 7.2% if the real property is in the Seoul Metropolitan Area ) of the acquisition value of the real property <h> Trust REF limitations <p> BC Holder 's control issue <p> The management of a trust REF 's assets is governed primarily through the trust agreement entered into between the trust company and the AMC , whereas the investors ( that is , the BC holders ) have limited powers to control the asset management process . The authority empowered upon the BC holders ' meeting under Iiamba is limited to : ( i ) approval of certain amendments to the trust agreement , such as a proposal to increase the fees for the AMC or the trust company ; and ( ii ) the cancellation or merger of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FSS ) disfavours transaction parties adopting concepts in the trust agreement that provide additional powers in favour of BC holders . <p> 80% cap on equity investment per investor <p> Although not explicitly stated in the relevant statutes , the FSS has a policy whereby an investor ( including its specially related parties ) is prohibited from holding more than 80% of the equity in an REF that acquires and holds real estate . The rationale behind this position appears to be that various tax incentives are and should be afforded to the REF structure only if the AMC obtains funds from multiple investors , and operates and controls the subject real estate assets independently of these investors . That is , it appears the FSS 's intention is to prevent a single investor from using the REF structure solely to reap the tax incentives afforded under the REF structure . <p> Limitation on the disposal of real estate <p> Assets acquired by REFs may not be disposed of for three years . However , exceptions to this time limitation are afforded if land and structures developed or constructed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if the REF is involved in a merger or when the REF is cancelled or dissolved . <p> Capital gains from the sale of beneficial certificates <p> The Korean tax authorities have not provided specific guidance as to whether capital gain obtained through the sale of beneficial certificates is capital gain from sale of real estate or whether if it is capital gain obtained from the sale of securities . As such , discussions with the Korean tax authorities will be called for on a case-by-case basis based on the applicable tax treaty and the relevant transaction documents . <h> Issues for foreign purchasers <p> Foreign exchange regulation <p> For a foreign investor to acquire beneficial certificates in a trust REF , it must either : ( i ) file a securities acquisition report with the Bank of Korea and obtain its acceptance ; or ( ii ) establish a securities investment exclusive account with a local bank . Foreign investors in practice usually prefer the latter route . <p> Buying beneficial certificates <p> Generally , upon completion of the sale and purchase of beneficial certificates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition report and a BC account book . The sales company will also issue the beneficial certificates in non-bearer form and in the name of the Korea Securities Depository ( that is , certificates are not physically issued to BC holders ) . Under the Iiamba , BC holders have the right to request that the physical certificates be returned , however , such requests are rarely made . <h> Prospects <p> Due to its tax benefits and the viability of its structure , the REF is expected to be the indirect investment structure of choice for many foreign and domestic investors . Once the Act on the Capital Market and Financial Investment Business , which is pending at the National Assembly 's Finance Legislation Sub-committee , is enacted into law a new type of fund ( the hybrid asset fund ) will come into existence , allowing for investments in any type of assets . Also the present positive list system ( whereby a fund can invest in financial products specifically permitted under the relevant laws ) will likely be replaced with a negative list system ( whereby a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited under the relevant laws ) with respect to financial investment products . In light of the foregoing , new types of REFs could evolve to meet investors ' demand for flexibility , viability and favourable tax planning . <p> Author biographies <h> Yon-Kyun Oh <h> Kim &amp; Chang <p> Yon-Kyun Oh is a senior partner at Kim &amp; Chang and heads the real estate practice group .

The Law and its subsequent amendments created a new framework that contributed to the success of these vehicles . By 1999 there were 2,477 collective investment vehicles holding assets representing around 44% of the annual Spanish gross production . <p> CIVs are either financial institutions or real estate investment vehicles . In turn these may either be companies or funds . The real estate investment funds and companies as their name would imply invest in properties which are to be leased . The financial institutions may be either long-term or short-term investment companies or funds . Investment companies investing in long-term securities are called Sociedades de Inversi=n Mobiliaria de Capital Fijo while those investing in short-term securities are known as Sociedades de Inversi=n Mobiliaria de Capital Variable . Similarly investment funds are divided into Fondos de Inversi=n Mobiliaria which invest in long-term securities and Fondos de Inversi=n en Activos del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies have legal personality and their capital is represented in shares . Investment funds lack legal personality and their wealth is represented by participating fund members . Although fund members are the actual legal owners of the fund 's assets , companies are allowed to manage the fund 's wealth . <p> Around 96% of investments in Spain are held by investment funds . <p> Law 46 and the taxation of Spanish investment vehicles <p> Both investment companies and investment funds are taxable entities for corporate income tax purposes . CIVs do not have to distribute income or profits to the share or participation holders . CIVs set up and ruled by Law 46 are not therefore transparent . This applies indifferently to investment funds despite their non-legal personality . <p> However , most of the European tax systems have incorporated the see through approach to their legislation for investment funds . Germany , Austria , the Netherlands , the UK and Switzerland consider investment funds as transparent . Therefore any gain or income obtained by the fund is exempt . In these cases , dividends obtained by the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax credit and interest obtained by the fund is effectively taxed against the investor at the usual rates . The aim of this transparency is to avoid double taxation . <p> Other countries such as Belgium , France , Greece and Luxembourg tax the investment funds at very low rates or even zero rates . Italy and Portugal have special taxes on income/gains of investment funds of up to 10% . Spain has chosen to tax investment companies and funds as entities but the tax rate amounts to 1% , provided that the investment vehicle falls within the Law 46 regulations . However , resident individuals can not avoid double taxation entirely . <p> The 1% rate of financial institutions also applies to real estate investment companies and funds which must invest in real estate located in urban areas destined for leasing and at least 50% of the total assets must be personal homes or buildings occupied by senior citizens and students . <p> Investment companies and funds are registered with the Spanish stock market regulator , the Comisi=n Nacional de Mercado de Valores ( CNMV ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a general rule , dividends and interest paid to non-residents by Spanish entities and gains obtained by non-residents from securities issued by Spanish entities are subject to tax at a rate of 15% . <p> Notwithstanding the above , the taxation of the non-resident will be different in each of the following scenarios : <p> A resident in an EU Member State transfers or reimburses quotas , shares or participations in a financial Spanish collective investment company or fund . Any yield obtained would be considered an exempt gain , not subject to withholding tax . <p> Please note that in this case a distribution of dividends from the investment company or fund will be subject to 15% tax unless the recipient can benefit from a reduced rate as per a double taxation agreement or it can benefit from the parent-subsidiary Directive . In practice , Spanish investment funds do not distribute dividends although it would be possible under our legislation . <p> A resident in a state with a double taxation agreement in effect with Spain , including the exchange information clause , transfers or reimburses quotas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish stock exchange . Any gain would be exempt . <p> A non-resident obtains income from an investment fund to which Law 46 does not apply . In this case , any profits obtained by the fund will effectively be directly obtained by the non-resident and the usual tax rules for non-residents will apply . In other words , an investment fund which at any point does not fulfil the requirements of Law 46 becomes transparent . In this case , any profits obtained by the fund are allocated to the holders . More importantly , the yield obtained by the quota holder is no longer considered a gain and there is no possibility to claim exemptions described in 1 and 2 . <p> A non-resident receives income from a foreign investment company or fund contracted through a Spanish financial dealer . This would fall outside the scope of Spanish tax . <p> A resident in a State with a double taxation agreement in effect with Spain , regardless of the inclusion of an information exchange clause , transfers or reimburses shares or quotas in a Spanish collective investment vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant limitation applies . In contrast with scenario 2 , if the assets of the investment vehicle consist mainly of Spanish real estate and the double taxation agreement allows taxation in Spain of entities holding mainly real estate , the gain will be subject to Spanish taxes even if the non-resident is resident in an EU territory . <p> A resident of a territory classified as a tax haven obtains income or gains from an investment company or fund . The resident will be taxed at a rate of 15% , even if the investor may be exempt under any of the previous scenarios . <p> In this regard , it is worth noting that there exists an opportunity for tax havens which wish to avoid being short-listed . The regulations associated with the reform of the 2003 Budget Law set out that any tax haven which signs an agreement of information exchange with Spain will be automatically excluded from the short list from the effective date of the agreement . This provision is in line with what the OECD offers to low taxation regimes to become more transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not provide a certificate of tax residency in an EU member state or in another state with a double tax convention in effect , any income or gain will be subject to 15% withholding tax . <p> However , if the recipient is a non-resident individual who obtains a gain from the sale or redemption of participation in a collective investment vehicle which was acquired before 31 December 1994 , the non-resident will still benefit from a reduction on the gain of 14,28% for each year of ownership achieved before that date . This reduction of the gain will be considered upon assessing any withholding tax . <p> The withholding tax is collected by the investment company , the management company of an investment fund , or in certain cases the recipient will account for it . The tax is assessed as an amount equal to 15% of the difference between sale and subscription prices . <p> Although this article aims to describe in general terms how returns from investment companies and funds are taxed , there are certain particular cases that are worth commenting on : <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tax system for returns on savings . The new system guarantees a flow of information between Member States or a minimum tax on returns obtained in Austria , Belgium and Luxembourg of up to 35% . <p> The proposed Directive will also apply to CIVs . When income and gains are obtained from investment companies and funds which have credits or other similar securities as more than half their assets , returns will be treated as interest for the purposes of the Directive and not as gains or dividends . <p> The Directive tries to prevent institutions and individuals from investing in investment companies and funds in order to avoid application of the Directive on Savings . It would be easy to transform interest from securities into dividends and gains obtained from collective investment vehicles that initially were not within the scope of the Directive on Savings . Under the draft of the Directive setting out the basis for the new system of taxation , income from investment companies and funds are dealt with as interest if most of their assets consist of credits . The draft 's 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed Directive but it was a political decision taken to exclude certain investment vehicles originating from France and Luxembourg . <p> Double tax conventions may protect non-residents from the withholding tax on returns obtained from investment funds and companies , especially if they are dealt with as gains . Nobody disputes that collective investment companies that enjoy legal personality may themselves benefit from the double tax convention if they are a resident in the corresponding state . However , funds are transparent entities in most countries , have no legal personality and are just a form of collective investment . The question is whether an investment fund is a taxable person for the purposes of a double tax convention . <p> As each country has its own regulations and each double tax convention differs , the matter should be addressed on a case-by-case basis . However , if internal regulations or the double tax convention do not expressly grant the status of taxable person to a foreign investment fund , they should be dealt with as transparent . <p> In Spain , it is only clear that investment funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be that other CIVs regulated by Directive 85/611/CEE would also be given this status although there is no clear provision to that effect . Any other investment fund is transparent . <p> Effective beneficiary clauses , included in most double tax conventions , allow states to see through entities that claim the advantageous provisions of a double tax convention . Considering that even in those states where investment funds are not transparent the tax burden of the fund is very low or nil , it is the sort of scenario where the clause might be applied . Effectively this means that the issue of whether an investment fund is a taxable person who may benefit directly from the double tax convention provisions is not that relevant . The Spanish Tax Administration may always request information on the holders of the investment fund and deny the benefits of the tax convention when the investment fund is used as a means to avoid the withholding tax of the effective beneficiary . <p> Finally , the internal foreign-controlled company ( CFC ) rules should also be considered in structuring an investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1% corporate income tax rate . <p> Tax on foreign investment funds investing in Spanish real estate <p> Foreign investment funds that own real estate in Spain will become a transparent taxable person for the purposes of the non-residents income tax if their activities constitute a business exploitation . <p> Real estate income can be taxed as investment income or as business income . Income obtained by foreign investment funds would normally be taxed gross at a 25% tax rate . However , provided that sufficient presence is established in Spain , the investment fund might be taxed as a taxable person performing business activities and in this case only net income is taxed at a 35% tax rate . <p> As a transparent taxable person for the purpose of the non-residents income tax , the fund has its own tax obligations such as filing an annual self-assessment in representation of all non-resident fund holders . However , the fund shall prove that any of the non-resident holders may benefit from a double tax convention in order to apply a reduced rate . <p> A special case applies to German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German law and therefore all its assets are held by the management company in its name . In this case , the Spanish administration overrides the trust agreement between the fund and its management company and , thus , is dealt with as stated above . <p> Spanish residents ' income from foreign collective investment companies and funds <p> As described before , gains generally receive more tax advantages than income in the Spanish tax system . This explains why the Spanish investment funds do not distribute dividends to its holders . <p> Returns obtained by Spanish individuals and entities from foreign collective investment institutions regulated by Directive 85/611/CEE , incorporated and domiciled in another EU member state , and registered with the CNMV for the purposes of being distributed to Spanish nationals would be considered either dividends or gains . <p> In the case of individuals , dividends will be taxed at the marginal rate but gains on assets held for more than a year will only be taxed at 15% . In addition , gains on assets owned before December 31 1994 can benefit from the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved by that date . Corporations will be taxed at the general tax rate . <p> As of January 1 2003 , there has been a major development in the tax system applicable to earnings obtained from collective investment institutions although it is only effective for Spanish resident individuals . It also has big implications for subscribers of EU foreign investment funds . <p> The new legislation sets out that earnings obtained by resident individuals on the reimbursement of investment fund participations , as well as in the transfer of shares in investment companies with more than 500 partners , ( as long as the participating partner has not held more than 5% of the company capital within the previous 12 months ) will not be computed for income tax purposes when the proceeds obtained in the reimbursement or transfer are reinvested in the participations or shares of another collective investment institution . The new shares and participations will keep the value and acquisition date of the shares or participations transmitted or reimbursed . <p> The tax postponement is also applicable to partners or participants in collective investment institutions regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the European Union and registered with the CNMV as long as : ( i ) entities registered with the CNMV carry out the commercialization ; ( ii ) the above-mentioned limits on the number of partners and the proportion of capital is respected in each commercialized sub-fund . <p> No withholding tax shall be applied to the earnings obtained when the tax postponement is applicable . <p> Special rules also apply to Spanish resident individuals and companies holding participation in collective investment institutions incorporated in tax havens . The difference between the market value and the acquisition value of the participation shall be allocated to the Spanish resident . The acquisition value is increased by the amount of previous allocations . The Spanish legislation presumes this difference to be 15% of the acquisition value . Luxembourg funds ruled by Directive 85/611/CEE are not included in these provisions . <p> Returns obtained from investment funds not regulated by the Directive 85/611/CEE might not be treated as gains or dividends . Spanish internal legislation might treat them as interest income although it will depend on the type of income received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Returns on hedge funds are normally considered gains for tax purposes and they will be taxed as described above . However , certain hedge investments aimed at covering business risks might be dealt with as business income . <p> Conclusions <p> Capital investment will continue to aim at investment funds , especially those not attracted by the proposed Savings Directive . Spanish investment vehicles regulated by Law 46 and European collective investment institutions within the scope of Directive 85/611/CEE will benefit from an advantageous tax regime in Spain and in other EU Member States . Certainly , a uniform tax treatment of the funds within the EU will help to avoid capital investment flow due to tax motives . However , uniformity will not occur in the near future . 
@@8538389 @1738389/ <h> Futej &amp; Partners <h> Address <h> Telephone <h> Fax <p> An amendment to the act on public procurement came into force on November 1 2015 . One of its goals is to make public procurement transparent through the creation of a register ( the Register ) of beneficial owners " those who take part in public procurement . Public procurement is particularly understood to mean the procurement of goods and services by governmental agencies , municipalities and other authorities that are publicly financed . The Register should allow identification of the real owners ( beneficial owners ) , and not just the ostensible ( paper ) owners , of entities that participate directly or indirectly in the public procurement process . The Register does not apply to other forms of governmental expenditure , such as state subsidies , transfers of state property , contributions from European funds , or claims made against the government . <p> The gist of the new legislation is to ensure that all public procurement contracts are entered into only by entities that have listed their beneficial owners in the Register . The Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is available to the public online on the Authority 's website . Participants in public procurement submit applications for registration in the Register . <p> If the tenderer and its subcontractors have not listed their beneficial owners in the Register , neither the contracting authority nor any procurer will be able to contract with them . These contracts likewise can not be entered into if the beneficial owners of the parties through whom the tenderer demonstrated its financial and economic position , or parties that the tenderer used for their technical and professional qualifications to demonstrate its own technical or professional qualifications , are not listed in the Register . If these requirements for demonstrating beneficial ownership are not satisfied , the law now allows the procurer to contract with the second or even third placed tenderer . <p> The legislation defines the criteria for proving who the beneficial owner is , and this must always be a natural person , that is , an individual . For legal entities , the beneficial owner is a person with direct or indirect participation of at least 25% in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . Furthermore , a person qualifies as a beneficial owner if he/she has the right to appoint and remove members of the corporate bodies ( statutory , supervisory ) of the company or is entitled to at least 25% of the profits from the business or other activities of the company . <p> The requirement to list beneficial owners in the Register will also apply to the tenderer 's subcontractors if they supply at least 30% of the value of the tenderer 's bid for above threshold procurement where the estimated value is at least 10 million ( $10.6 million ) , or where the amount they supply exceeds 50% of the value of the tenderer 's bid for other procurement . This will be a mandatory requirement for the subcontractor for the entire term of the relevant contract . All members in a group of vendors will be required to list their beneficial owners in the Register . <p> The Authority will make entries in the Register on the application of an individual or legal entity , and the registration is for an indefinite time period . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes a declaration that the information regarding the beneficial owners as stated in the application is true and complete , and will state whether such persons are public officials . The presumption will be that the information about the beneficial owners being entered into the Register is true . <p> In order to verify the information about the beneficial owners , the Authority will have the right to request the cooperation of any public authority or party obligated to disclose information , such as banks , financial institutions and even lawyers , in addition to the cooperation of the entity whose beneficial owner is being registered . Persons obligated to disclose information can not appeal to the Authority on the basis of client confidentiality or tax secret . The Authority can carry out the verification either on its own initiative or on the qualified suggestion of any other person who can provide information raising doubts that the information about the beneficial owner in the Register is true and complete . <p> If a tenderer or its subcontractor violates the obligations regarding the Register and the registration of beneficial owners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a ban on participation in public procurement for a period of three years . <p> According to the legislation , the Authority will strike an individual or legal entity from the Register if for the purposes of registering a beneficial owner in the Register they submitted data , information or a declaration of honour that was false or incomplete . A fine would also be imposed on them . If the state where the legal entity or individual is domiciled refuses to cooperate with the Slovak authorities in respect of identifying the beneficial owner , and that person is unable to credibly demonstrate identification of the beneficial owner , the Authority will strike it from the Register . <p> The contracting authority and the procurer will be able to rescind a contract or an agreement with a participant who , at the time the contract was entered into , did not have its beneficial owner/owners registered in the Register ; or , if the participant is officially struck from the Register or banned from participating in public procurement .

The former , though not open to public solicitation , is far less cumbersome than the latter , which is subject to regulatory authority approval . <p> Private equity vehicles <p> Luxembourg corporate law provides ample flexibility to tailor structures that meet the needs and requirements of promoters and investors in private equity . These structures are implemented in a favourable tax environment with numerous attractive characteristics , such as having no withholding tax on interest and exemptions for dividends and capital gains on large equity stakes . <p> Corporate formsThe two main alternatives for private equity vehicles are the SociTtT Anonyme ( SA ) and the SociTtT en Commandite par Actions ( SCA ) . Both are commercial companies and benefit from the same favourable tax treatment . The choice of one of these corporate vehicles must therefore rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SociTtT AnonymeThe SA is a public limited liability company . Management is entrusted to a board of at least three directors who are not liable for the indebtedness of the company if corporate assets do not satisfy the claims of creditors . <p> The board of directors is appointed and removed by decision of the general meeting of the shareholders . The board of directors has no assurance against removal , which is possible without cause or indemnity . Maintaining control over management thereby requires the holding of the majority of the share capital . <p> The board of directors is the body responsible for the management of investments in target companies . It is , however , entitled to appoint an external investment manager ( generally related to the promoter ) to which it can then delegate day-to-day investment management . <p> SociTtT en Commandite par ActionsThe SCA is a corporate partnership limited by shares set up between one or more shareholders who are indefinitely , jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the company ( the unlimited shareholders ) and shareholders who contribute a specific amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the limited shareholders ) . Investors will naturally enjoy the position of limited shareholders , while the manager will be the unlimited shareholder . <p> In an SCA , the manager owns shares in the vehicle and manages the investments of the vehicle . <p> Shareholders ' powers are more restricted in this type of company , because the unlimited shareholder carries out the management of the company . To have any effect , most shareholder decisions also need the manager 's approval , and removal of the manager is possible only for legitimate cause . <p> The law imposes personal liability on the manager if the company becomes insolvent . In order to limit this potential liability , it is common to set up an SA or a private limited company ( a sociTtT a responsabilitT limitTe ) to be the manager and unlimited shareholder of the SCA . <p> Regulatory issues <p> The formation of a private equity vehicle is not subject to any regulatory requirement , approval or authorization as long as it does not extend its activities to banking , lending money on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies , however , only to entirely private structures .

The mandate given to Cesr by the European Commission follows the European Commission Recommendation 2004/383/EC on the use of derivatives and aims at a consistent implementation of the Ucits Directive as enlarged by the Product Directive . <p> Cesr , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 2004 . On March 18 2005 , Cesr published its first consultation paper and launched a consultation , during which Efama , among others , submitted its comments . <p> The European Commission originally asked Cesr to deliver its technical advice by the end of October 2005 . However , many consultation respondents asked for the possibility for a second consultation due to the difficult nature of the exercise and the interests involved . Therefore the European Commission , on request of Cesr , extended the deadline of the mandate from the end of October 2005 to mid-January 2006 . This change has made it possible for Cesr to issue its second consultation paper on eligible assets and consult stakeholders in the European Ucits industry for a second time . <p> Cesr published on January 26 2006 its final advice on eligible assets to the European Commission together with a feedback statement ( the Final Advice on Eligible Assets ) taking into account the comments of the respondents to the two consultations it organized after extensive discussions with the members of the Expert Group on Investment Management and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In brief , Cesr 's Final Advice on Eligible Assets proposes factors and criteria to be used to determine to what extent some instruments can be considered as eligible assets of Ucits . <p> Cesr 's Final Advice on Eligible Assets can not be considered a legal provision , even if it gives some precisions to facilitate the comprehension of the Ucits Directive . Indeed , it is the European Commission that should ultimately adopt ( in principle by April 2006 ) implementing legislation on eligible assets for investment of Ucits by setting out , on the basis of Cesr 's Final Advice on Eligible Assets , what is known under the Lamfalussy legislative process as Level 2 advice and Level 3 guidelines , recommendations or standards . <h> Cesr 's clarification of derivatives instruments <p> As part of clarifying the definition concerning eligible assets for investments of Ucits , the European Commission has asked Cesr to provide advice on the factors to be used to determine whether and under what conditions , in a given situation , a derivative instrument falls within the scope of the definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the Ucits Directive . <p> Cesr has analysed the wording of Article 19(1) ( g ) of the Ucits Directive that enables Ucits to invest in financial derivative instruments dealt on a regulated market ( as referred to in subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of Article 19(1) ) or dealt over the counter ( OTC ) , provided these financial derivative instruments comply with the general rules regarding their underlyings and the valuation and counterparties of their OTC derivative transactions . Consequently , Cesr estimates in its Final Advice on Eligible Assets that , to clarify the factors that need to be taken into account in determining whether and under what conditions , in a given situation , a derivative instrument falls within the scope of the definition of Article 19(1) ( g ) , it would better to identify the criteria to be used to assess the eligibility of a given derivative instrument , rather than provide a precise definition of these instruments . <p> In addition , Cesr has also considered that , as a general principle derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments can not be used to circumvent the principles and rules set out in the Ucits Directive . <p> Based on Recital 13 of the Product Directive and on the list of possible underlyings of derivative instruments given by the Ucits Directive in Article 19(1) ( g ) , Cesr is says that possible underlyings include a combination of eligible assets ( for example , a basket of eligible transferable securities ) as well as financial instruments that have one or several characteristics of eligible assets ( for example , interest rates , dividends or exchange rates ) . However , Cesr notes that the Ucits Directive does not allow direct investments in commodities and that non-financial indices are not considered possible underlyings for a derivative instrument as they are not eligible assets according to Article 19 of the Ucits Directive and are not included in the list of possible underlyings . <p> Taking the above elements into account , Cesr has decided in its Final Advice on Eligible Assets to adopt Level 2 advice with regard to the general definition of financial derivative instruments . This Level 2 advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of eligible assets ( for example , dividends ) . <p> 2 . Eligible assets exclude non-financial indices and commodities . <p> 3 . Regarding investments giving an exposure to commodities , reference is made to Chapter 2 of the advice concerning financial derivative instruments ( ' The eligibility of derivative instruments on financial indices ' ) . " <p> Derivative instruments on financial indices <p> In its Final Advice on Eligible Assets , Cesr also considers the eligibility of derivative instruments on financial indices . <p> Cesr 's first approach to derivative instruments on financial indices was that they should only be eligible if the index complies with the requirements set by Article 22a(1) of the Ucits Directive , that is be sufficiently diversified , represent an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers and be published in an appropriate manner . <p> However , the asset management industry , through the comments formulated to the first consultation , expressed a strong interest in allowing derivative instruments on financial indices whatever their underlying assets ( that is , derivative instruments on financial indices based on eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities or hedge funds ) . According to the comments received , there is a strong client demand in favour of such products because they allow for better risk diversification . <p> Cesr welcomed these comments and announced that it will consider the following options with regard to the definition of derivative instruments on financial indices : <p> either only financial indices based on eligible assets should be considered eligible underlyings for derivative instruments ; or <p> financial indices based both on eligible and non-eligible assets should be considered eligible underlyings for derivative instruments ( to the extent that the wording of Article 19(1) ( g ) of the Ucits Directive does not require Ucits to apply a look-through approach when concluding derivatives on financial indices ) . <p> In its Final Advice on Eligible Assets , Cesr decided that financial indices based on non-eligible assets may be eligible underlyings of derivative instruments on financial indices provided certain conditions are met . In that respect , Cesr adopted Level 2 advice providing the following rules . <p> For the purpose of applying Article 1(2) of the Ucits Directive in conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derivative instruments on a financial index mean those derivative instruments that are based on a financial index that complies with the criteria set by Article 22a(1) of the Ucits Directive , which means that the index must be sufficiently diversified , must represent an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers , and must be published in an appropriate manner . <p> Regarding the diversification rules , Cesr 's position is that : <p> An index is sufficiently diversified if it is composed in a way that price movements or trading activities regarding one component do not unduly influence the performance of the whole index . <p> If the index is composed of eligible assets , it should be at least as diversified as set out under the diversification ratios of Article 22a(2) of the Ucits Directive ; otherwise its underlying assets have to be combined with the other assets of the Ucits according to Article 21(3) and Article 22 of the Ucits Directive to avoid undue concentration . <p> If the index is composed of non-eligible assets , it should be at least as diversified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ucits Directive , in case the derivatives on indices are used to track such an index or to gain high-exposure in such an index , to avoid undue concentration . If derivatives on these indices are used for risk-diversification purposes , this diversification does not apply provided the exposure on the individual indices complies with the 5%/10%/40% ratios . <p> According to Cesr , an index representing an adequate benchmark for the market to which it refers implies that : <p> the index must measure the performance of a representative group of underlyings in a way that is meaningful and useful ; <p> the index should be revised or rebalanced periodically to ensure that it continues to reflect the markets to which it refers following criteria that are publicly available ; <p> the underlyings should be liquid enough to enable users replicate the index if necessary . <p> Lastly , Cesr 's position is that an index is published in an appropriate manner to the extent that : <p> its publication process relies on robust procedures to collect prices ( including procedures to price components if a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish the index value ; <p> the material information on matters such as index calculation and rebalancing methodologies , index change and information relating to any operational difficulties in providing timely or accurate information must be provided on as wide and timely a basis as possible . <p> Clarification concerning hedge fund indices <p> During the second consultation index , providers and asset managers provided Cesr with their analysis of the specific issues raised by Cesr regarding hedge fund indices ( that is , survivor bias and selection bias ) and took strong positions in favour of their eligibility . <p> Cesr notes these comments but does not recommend in its Final Advice on Eligible Assets that hedge fund indices be considered , at this stage , as financial indices due to the complexities of hedge fund indices and the fact that they are still developing . <p> In particular , Cesr argued that indices based on hedge funds raise many issues including : <p> survivor bias , that is , the fact that underperforming hedge funds tend to close down and so might not be included in the indices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the index avoid under- or over-reporting by unsuccessful or successful hedge funds ; <p> consistency of the sector of hedge funds of which the index is deemed to be representative ; <p> the policy regarding backfilling bias , that is , permitting newly included hedge funds to backfill their performances , potentially generating a bias in favour of the best performing hedge funds ; <p> But Cesr indicated that it is monitoring the issue and is willing to reconsider its position by October 2006 , after gaining more experience . However , Cesr stresses that the consensus reached on the eligibility of financial indices is fragile and it does not wish to jeopardize it by opening the discussion on hedge fund indices at this stage . Therefore , Cesr members agree in Cesr 's Final Advice on Eligible Assets not to authorize setting up new Ucits with such investment policies before October 2006 . <p> Commodities indices <p> According to Cesr , indices based on commodities may be eligible provided they comply with the criteria developed above . This is formulated as Level 2 advice in Cesr 's Final Advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view is that the eligibility of any financial indices should be assessed using the criteria developed above . <p> Regarding the specific case of property indices , Cesr notes that it would be highly unlikely that a property index based on private transactions would meet all the criteria developed in above . However , Cesr 's position is that this does not rule out the eligibility of other property indices , such as property indices based on the share price of companies investing in property . As a consequence , property indices have been included in the indicative list of paragraph 3 of its Level 2 advice on the clarification of the definition of derivative instruments on financial indices . <h> Luxembourg regulatory developments <p> The Luxembourg supervisory authority , the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier ( the CSSF ) published on April 5 2005 Circular 05/176 providing detailed guidelines in relation to the use of financial derivatives instruments by Luxembourg Ucits . <p> Circular 05/176 mirrors to a large extent Recommendation 2004/383/EC of the European Commission on the use of financial derivative instruments for Ucits . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the risk assessment system adapted to the risk-profile of the Ucits by making a distinction between sophisticated and non-sophisticated Ucits . <p> Regarding the eligibility of derivative instruments on financial indices for Luxembourg Ucits , the CSSF 's position is that Ucits can , under the conditions specified above , invest in derivative instruments on financial indices . As a consequence , it appears that indices based on commodities may be eligible assets . However , one may reasonably anticipate that the CSSF , on the basis of Cesr 's Final Advice on Eligible Assets , is unlikely to authorize setting up new Ucits the investment policy of which is to invest in derivative instruments on hedge fund indices before Cesr has reconsidered its position in this area , which is not to be anticipated before October 2006 . <p> Author biographies <h> Christian Kremer <h> Kremer AssociTs &amp; Clifford Chance <p> Christian Kremer is managing partner in the Luxembourg office of Clifford Chance and head of the global asset management group , and practises mainly in the area of investment funds , banking and financial law . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , major financial institutions ( commercial and investment banks ) and multinationals .

Among the reasons cited by the Turkish Parliament for the Law , which was enacted in June 2012 , was the desire to bring Turkish legislation in line with international practice , in particular : the EU Workplace Health and Safety Directive ( 89/391/EEC ) ; and Agreements No 155 ( Occupational Safety and Health Convention ) and No. 161 ( Occupational Health Services Convention ) of the International Labour Organization . <h> " By mid-2014 at the latest , all Turkish employers , with limited exceptions , will have to comply with the Law " <p> The main purposes of the Law are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; prevent work accidents and injuries ; decrease work-related risks to minimum levels ; monitor and record work accidents ; and notify the Turkish Social Security Institution ( SSI ) of such accidents . The effective date of the Law , and the applicability of certain of its and its regulations ' provisions , vary according to the size of the employer and its danger classification . Having said that , by mid-2014 at the latest , all Turkish employers ( including Turkish subsidiaries of foreign companies ) , with limited exceptions ( for example , for armed forces ) , will have to comply with the Law in general , regardless of the size of their workforce or the nature of their business . <p> Among other things , employers will have to assign or employ ( or , subject to certain conditions , contract for ) work safety specialists , employee representatives , doctors and other health personnel at their workplaces . Employers also must train , and obtain the opinions of , employees on work safety conditions . <p> The promulgated regulations set forth the principles applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at workplaces ; the engagement and duties of work safety experts ; the formation of workplace safety boards ; and the performance of mandatory workplace health and safety risk assessments . When all of the regulations under the Law have been issued and are in effect , workplaces in Turkey will be subject to a comprehensive and strict set of standards aimed at protecting employees . Such standards include , among others : health , safety and hygiene requirements ; physical space specifications ; measures for the prevention of accidents and occupational diseases ; and enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations . <h> Health and safety obligations in general <h> " The Law is a welcome change in the right direction " <p> According to the Law , employers are obliged to take certain measures to protect the health and ensure the safety of their employees . They must also : provide conditions required for the safe operation of the workplace ; make available all equipment needed to protect the health and safety of employees ; and inform and train employees with respect to health and safety matters . Employers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers arising from the use of machines in the workplace , and train employees on any applicable protective and preventive measures . In addition , employers are obliged report promptly to the authorities any accidents that occur in the workplace . <h> Employee representatives <p> In furtherance of the goals of the Law , each employer is obliged to designate employee representatives , based on a nomination through a vote of the employees or , if the vote does not yield nominees , by the employer 's own discretion , taking into consideration the total number of the employees and the risks of the workplace . One representative is required in workplaces employing between two and 50 employees . Two representatives are required for 51 to 100 employees , three for 101 to 500 employees , four for 501 to 1,000 employees , five for 1,001 to 2,000 employees , and six for 2,001 or more employees . <h> Work health and safety board <p> Employers are also obliged to establish a work health and safety board ( Board ) if they employ 50 or more employees ( including employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the work undertaken is such that it lasts longer than six months . The members of the Board comprise : the employer or its nominee ; a work safety expert ; a workplace doctor ; a human resources , social services , administrative or financial manager ; if available , a civil defence expert ; if available , a foreman ; and an employee representative . <h> " The new employer must request from the ex-employer the individual health record of the employee " <p> The main duties of the Board are , among other things : to draft an internal directive on workplace health and safety ; submit such draft to the employer 's approval ; monitor the implementation of the directive ; report on such implementation ; guide the employees regarding work health and safety issues ; assess the dangers relating to workplace health and safety and the measures related thereto ; report on all workplace accidents and other incidents which pose a risk in the workplace ; prepare and monitor the implementation of workplace health and safety training programmes ; monitor the emergency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual report on the state of health and safety matters in the workplace . <h> Workplace medical personnel <p> Employers are obliged to appoint from among their employees , or obtain the outsourced services of , one or more work safety experts , doctors , and , if no full-time doctor is employed by the employer , other medical personnel . Employers are also obliged to provide necessary space and equipment for the provision of these services , which must be provided at no cost to the workforce . <h> Workplace health and safety unit <p> Employers are obliged to establish a workplace health and safety unit in the workplace . At least one workplace doctor and at least one work safety expert must be appointed to such unit . Applicable regulations set forth the minimum physical and other requirements of such units . Employers may share a common and single health unit established outside their undertaking . At such units , at least one workplace doctor and one work safety expert and other medical personnel must be employed . <h> Analysing risks <p> Each employer is obliged to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and identify and implement necessary health and safety precautions to deal with such risks . In making the risk assessment , the employer must take into account , among other things , the particular characteristics of the workplace and its equipment , and the status of the employees ( for example , age , disability , pregnancy and breastfeeding ) . <p> The risk assessment process must be carried out by a team consisting of the employer or its nominee , workplace doctors and safety specialists , employee representatives , support staff , and employees representing every department of the workplace who are familiar with the risks at the workplace and the work being undertaken related to such risks . <p> The risk assessment and prevention processes involve , among other things : the identification and analysis of the potential risks ; devising and implementing measures for the prevention of such risks ; and documenting the foregoing . Employers must come up with measures to prevent risks , provide a suitable workplace for the employees , adopt technological developments , replace dangerous equipment with safe ones , and develop policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace . In doing so , employers are obliged to give priority to collective protective actions over individually-based ones and give appropriate instructions to enable employees to familiarise themselves and cope with the risks of the workplace . <h> Emergency matters <p> Employers are obliged to determine the potential emergency situations likely to affect the employees and the workplace , take measures to minimise such risks , and prepare relevant emergency plans . Employers must also assign or employ a suitable number of personnel for emergency prevention , evacuation , fire fighting , first aid and related matters . They must also provide necessary equipment for such purposes , and implement procedures for communicating with outside emergency services . Employers must implement necessary procedures for the evacuation of employees to a safe location outside the workplace in case of emergencies . In such a case , the employer must not require the employees to continue work , except for those employees designated for special assignments and in possession of necessary equipment . <h> Recording and reporting work accidents and illnesses <p> Employers must record , investigate and prepare reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also investigate and prepare reports on accidents which damage or may damage the work equipment , and report to the SSI all accidents and illnesses in the workplace within statutory time limits . <h> Health checks <p> Employers are obliged to ensure the monitoring of the health of employees , taking into consideration health and safety risks employees may be exposed to in the workplace . Employers must make sure that the employee goes through a medical check at the time of commencing employment , when changing jobs , as directed by the authorities during employment , and , upon request , after returning to work following an absence due to a work accident , work illness or health reasons . <h> Training of employees <p> Employers are obliged to organise the training of their employees regarding work health and safety , in particular at the time of their commencement of employment , return to work after an absence of more than six months , change of workplace or job description , and the use of new equipment or technology . In the event of the return of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer must organise a training session regarding the causes of the work accident and the prevention of accidents . <h> Receiving opinions of the employees <p> Employers are obliged to receive the opinions of their employees regarding , among other things : work health and safety ; the use of new technology , equipment to be used in the workplace ; and the effects of the workplace conditions on employee health and safety . They must also receive the opinions of the employee representatives regarding , among other things , work safety experts , workplace doctors and other health personnel , risk assessment , preventive measures , and the training of employees . <h> Health and safety records <h> " Effective enforcement will be the key in achieving the desired results under the Law " <p> Employers are obliged to keep work health and safety records of the workplace as well as individual health records of each employee for 15 years as from the day of separation . If the employee leaves the workplace and starts to work in another workplace , the new employer must request from the ex-employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the ex-employer must send a copy of the individual health record within one month . <p> Employers are obliged to keep a record book certified by the Directorate of Labour or a notary public regarding work health and safety procedures . The workplace doctor and the workplace safety expert shall spell out the necessary actions which should be taken by the employer in such book . The proposals written in this certified book shall be deemed as delivered to the employer . <h> Rights of employees <p> The Law also grants certain new rights to employees . In the event of a serious and present danger , employees may request the employer to take necessary corrective actions . If the employer fails to take necessary actions to prevent the danger , the employees may immediately quit working , and the employer can not make cutbacks on the employees ' entitlements or rights . At workplaces where the necessary measures are not taken , the employees may , subject to certain other conditions , terminate their employment contracts . <h> Enforcement mechanisms <p> Employment inspectors of the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements of Law have been implemented properly . In cases where inspectors detect a situation constituting a peril to employees ' lives , the work has to be stopped until such peril ceases to exist . Any objection by the employer to the court must be made within six business days but such objection can not result in the resumption of work until the peril has been eradicated . <p> If a workplace is closed down because of the reasons described above , the employer is obliged either to pay employees their full wages , or employ them in other jobs commensurate with their occupational skills or circumstances without reducing their wages . <p> The employer is subject to fines for actions such as : failure to take necessary actions to protect the health of its employees ; failure to provide the conditions required for the safe operation of the workplace ; failure to make available all the equipment needed to protect the health of the employees and to secure a safe operation ; opening a workplace without procuring an operation licence ; failure to inform the authorities of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fines are normally assessed for each violation . If the required measures are not taken , an additional fine is normally imposed for each successive month . <h> The future <p> In a country where workplace health and safety issues have long been a problem , the Law is a welcome change in the right direction . Two things must , however , be pointed out . First , certain blanket provisions of the Law are likely to be too burdensome ( risk assessment , for example ) for small businesses and possibly not sufficiently deterrent for bigger ones ( flat fines , for example ) . The Law could be made more effective if the authorities reviewed the promulgated regulations from this perspective and made relevant amendments .

Indian banks were hence protected against too much competition , resulting in a lack of impetus to enhance efficiency and growth . <p> Over the last two decades , the banking system in India has seen significant reforms . This includes partial deregulation of the financial sector , and measures for increasing competition such as more liberal licensing of private banks and freer expansion by foreign banks . With a growing foreign presence in the Indian financial sector resulting in increased competition , the Indian banking industry has seen significant improvement and sophistication and is gearing up to meet the challenges of increased globalisation . <p> Current regulations permit foreign entry in the Indian banking sector in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing banking entity ; or ( ii ) setting up a banking presence in India . <h> Foreign investment in existing banking entities <p> The total foreign investment permitted in an existing private sector bank is up to 74% of the bank ? s paid up capital . Once aggregate foreign investment in an existing private sector bank reaches a level of 49% , the infusion of any additional foreign direct investment requires prior regulatory approval . <p> Further , the FDI policy prescribes that , at all times , at least 26% of the paid up capital of a private sector bank be held by residents , except for a wholly owned subsidiary ( WOS ) of a foreign bank . The sub-caps for individual FII and NRI holdings is restricted to 10% , with the aggregate limit for all FIIs and NRIs capped at 24% and 10% respectively . There is the possibility of raising the cap , with approval from the board/general body , to 49% and 24% respectively . <p> The current ownership guidelines issued by the country ? s central bank and banking regulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are framed on the policy of diversified ownership . Investment by a single entity ( whether resident or non-resident ) is typically restricted to 10% , except in cases where a higher level of shareholding has been specifically permitted . The transfer or acquisition of a shareholding of 5% and above requires acknowledgement from the RBI , and such significant shareholders are required to meet rigorous ? fit and proper ? requirements . <p> In keeping with the principle of diversified ownership , the governing legislation for private sector banks , i.e. the Banking Regulation Act , 1969 , provides that the voting rights of all shareholders , whether resident or non-resident , are capped at 10% . This is regardless of the extent of the shareholding . <p> In its August 2010 discussion paper on the entry of new banks in the private sector , the RBI noted that aggregate non-resident investment in these banks , including FDI , NRI and FII , could be capped at a suitable level below 50% and locked at that level for an initial 10 years . Its reasoning is to create strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sector banks , domestically-owned private banks and foreign-owned banks . <h> Foreign presence in India <p> In 2005 , the RBI released its ? Roadmap for the presence of foreign banks in India ? , which proposed a twin-track gradualist approach to increasing efficiency and stability in the banking sector in India . The road map had two phases . From 2005 until 2009 , the first phase would focus on consolidation of the domestic banking system while the second phase ( post-2009 ) would focus on the gradual enhancement of foreign banks in India based on experience gained from the first phase . <p> In the first phase , foreign banks could establish a presence in India either through a branch , or establishment of a WOS , or conversion of an existing branch into a WOS . However , during this period , the presence of foreign banks was through branches only . The RBI ? s stance on this has been that no foreign bank actually applied to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary or to convert their branches into a wholly-owned subsidiary . But this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for review was due in April 2009 , the financial systems around the world were adversely affected by the global economic crisis . The RBI therefore opted to postpone the review until further notice . Accordingly , the RBI indicated its intent to continue with current policy and procedures governing the presence of foreign banks in India , and to review its roadmap after due consultation with stakeholders once there was greater clarity over prospects for recovery of the global financial system . Consequently , a discussion paper on the presence of foreign banks in India was released by the RBI in January 2011 ( Discussion Paper ) . <h> Key principles laid down in Discussion Paper <p> a ) There has been no significant deviation from existing policy on the presence of foreign banks ? reciprocity and single mode of presence shall continue to be underlying factors based on which the RBI will grant licences to foreign banks . <p> b ) The Discussion Paper brings out the RBI ? s clear preference on the WOS model as the form of presence , as opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of India ? s commitment to the WTO , the branch route is not being disabled and the RBI has not proposed a mandatory conversion of existing branches . <p> d ) The branch route is therefore still available ( remains relevant for applicants proposing to set up a limited banking presence in India ) , but the onus will be on the applicant to demonstrate that the conditions for obtaining a branch licence are met . <p> e ) Upon size of assets reaching a specified threshold ( 0.25% of all banking assets in India ) , it is the RBI ? s expectation that foreign banks will voluntarily switch over to the WOS model . The Discussion Paper does not set out a clear roadmap for how the transition will be operationalised . The Discussion Paper also contemplates safeguards to ensure that foreign banks do not become dominant . <p> f ) While clarity is yet to emerge on the exact incentives to be provided by the Government and the RBI to encourage a WOS structure , a few benefits proposed include a better chance of obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOS model <p> Foreign banks considering establishing a presence in India will need to satisfy the RBI that they are subject to ample prudential supervision ( having regard to Basel standards ) in their home country . Other factors that the RBI would look into include : economic and political relationships , financial stability of the foreign bank , its ownership pattern , its ratings by international rating agencies , and the international presence of the foreign bank . <p> The policy mandate for single mode of presence together with the threshold for systemically important foreign banks could lead to some of the existing foreign banks ( with a large presence in India ) being compelled ( when they seek approval for new branches ) to convert into a WOS model . <p> It is unlikely that existing branches will be allowed to maintain their status quo ( i.e. the branch model ) , and be permitted to open new branches , if a foreign bank hits the 0.25% threshold in terms of its asset size relative to that of the total asset size of all commercial banks in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition precedent for any additional branch approvals in such a situation . The RBI ? s policy to strictly comply with its WTO commitments ( in terms of permitting new branches under the branch model ) is also likely to influence existing foreign banks in India to reorganise their presence in India as a WOS . <p> For new entrants , banks falling in the following categories may be mandated entry only under the WOS model : <p> a ) Banks incorporated in jurisdictions that provide for home country protectionism ( inter alia , precedence in bankruptcy to local depositors vis-a-vis depositors of offshore branches ) ; <p> b ) Banks with unsatisfactory home country regulations , including disclosure requirements ; <p> c ) Banks with complex structures and which are not widely held ; <p> d ) The RBI ? s discretion ? if it is not satisfied with the supervisory arrangements and market discipline in the home country of the foreign bank . <p> Further , given that the RBI has specifically referred to home country protectionism for local creditors/depositors in jurisdictions such as the US , Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate the option of applying through the WOS route . <h> National treatment <p> The RBI ? s view appears to be that allowing full national treatment to foreign banks ( which are incorporated in India ) could lead to unintended consequences . It is therefore neither ? possible nor desirable ? to provide full national treatment to WOS ? s of foreign banks . <p> Having said the above , while a WOS would not be treated at par with domestic banks , the WOS would be placed in a much better position than branches of foreign banks . <h> The pros and cons <p> The WOS model comes with better chances of success in being able to establish a banking presence in India . In addition , a WOS will have the ability to obtain permission for additional branches ( since the Discussion Paper suggests that branch expansion will be granted to WOS over and above the WTO quota of 12 branches a year ) . The WOS model will also have access to local funds for raising non-equity capital . <p> On the flipside , the WOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% resident India board composition ) , and significantly higher capital adequacy and priority sector lending requirements . Further , exposure norms will apply on the basis of the WOS ? s balance sheet and not that of the parent entity and the WOS can not use its parent ? s credit ratings or avail of parent guarantees ( except issuance of letter of comfort by the parent to the RBI for meeting the WOS ? s liabilities ) . <p> Establishment of a WOS may , in the future , bring with it a requirement to dilute at least 26% of its ownership to Indian residents . In addition , a WOS will need to comply with the same requirements as domestic banks ( including under company law ) before it can distribute dividends to its parent . Further , a WOS would be categorised as a ? foreign-owned and controlled company ? in terms of the FDI Policy of India . As and when the subsidiary route is operationalised , downstream investments by foreign bank subsidiaries would clearly need to comply with the requirements of the FDI Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exchange control norms ( such as pricing , etc ) are also extended to their operations . Exchange control restrictions , if applied , will have an adverse impact on the operations of WOS and place it at a competitive disadvantage . <h> Others <p> The Discussion Paper indicates : ( i ) the RBI ? s discomfort in relation to the possibility of regulatory arbitrage between banks and their affiliate NBFCs , and that ( ii ) the presence of an NBFC in the group will be factored into the WOS ? bank application . However application of principles of consolidated supervision should address the RBI ? s concerns adequately , and it is unlikely that a bank and NBFC co-existing within the same group will be disallowed by the RBI . Banks would however need to be mindful of the existing restriction on holding over 10% of the paid up equity of a deposit taking NBFC . <p> Although the RBI has , on several occasions in the past , indicated that differential licensing goes against the more fundamental goal of financial inclusion , a reiteration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance for granting bank licences to applicants with a niche banking model .

@@8538401 @1738401/ <h> Japan 's securities regulations : following in US footsteps ? <h> Author : Published : 1 Jan 2007 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> In June 2006 , sweeping amendments to Japan 's Securities and Exchange Law ( Law 25 of 1948 , as amended ; the SEL ) , the Japanese counterpart to the US Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 combined , passed the Japanese diet , parts of which changed the definitions of securities and securities business and the name of the law itself . The SEL will be renamed the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law ( the FIEL ) . These amendments will be effective within 18 months of enactment , expected as early as the mid-2007 . The FIEL imposes an entirely new regulatory framework on investment funds , such as private equity funds , that take the form of a partnership . <h> FIEL on partnerships <p> General partnership <p> A general partnership ( nini kumiai ) is a partnership established under Japan 's Civil Code ( Law 89 of 1896 , as amended ) . In a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the members is appointed as an operating partner to operate the partnership 's business . The operating partner acts as the manager of the fund . <p> Japanese investment limited partnership <p> A Japanese investment limited partnership ( JLP ) is a Japanese domestic vehicle established under the Law concerning the Investment Limited Liability Partnership Agreement ( Law 90 of 1998 , as amended ; the JLP Law ) . A typical JLP consists of one general partner and one or more limited partners . The general partner acts as the manager of the fund . <p> Anonymous partnership <p> An anonymous partnership ( tokumei kumiai ; TK ) is an agreement between an operator and an anonymous partner , established under the Commercial Code of Japan ( Law 48 of 1899 ) . In a TK agreement , an investor , as the anonymous partner , agrees to contribute capital to the business that the non-investing partner will operate . Under a TK , the operator agrees to allocate and distribute profits of the TK business to the anonymous partner . Typically , the operator serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one anonymous partner , the operator executes a separate , bilateral TK agreement with each investor , each consisting of essentially identical terms and conditions . <p> Offshore limited partnership <p> Offshore limited partnerships established under non-Japanese law are often used as vehicles for investment funds . For example , a limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands is a popular vehicle used for funds investing in companies in Japan . <p> An offshore limited partnership provides as an example to discuss the amended definition of securities , as it offers a good illustration as to how the framework changes . The interests in an offshore limited partnership are recognized as securities if the partnership is regarded as similar to a JLP . Whether an offshore limited partnership is similar to a JLP depends on the business in which the partnership engages . To satisfy the similarity requirement , it is generally considered that an offshore limited partnership must be engaged in all or part of the categories of a JLP 's business listed under Items 1 through 11 of Article 3(1) of the JLP Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding of stocks issued by a domestic company upon its establishment ; <p> acquisition and holding of stocks or warrants issued by an already existing company ; <p> acquisition and holding of certain kinds of securities under the SEL that the Enforcement Order of the JLP Law designates as helpful to finance a business entity ; a business entity is defined to mean either an individual conducting business or a Japanese corporation ; <p> acquisition and holding of cash receivables from a business entity and acquisition and holding of cash receivables owned by a business entity ; <p> making new loans to a business entity ; <p> acquisition and holding of equity interests in a TK agreement or a trust agreement with a business entity ; <p> acquisition and holding of industrial property or copyrights owned by a business entity ; <p> provision of management-related advice or technical guidance to a business entity in which the relevant JLP itself has made investments using any of the foregoing methods ; <p> investment in another JLP or a domestic partnership conducting investment business , or in a foreign organization similar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in the preceding items as prescribed by the Enforcement Order of the JLP Law ( which includes acquisition and holding of promissory notes issued or held by a business entity , acquisition and holding of CDs , and trading of property provided as collateral to secure promissory notes and certain other types of debt ) ; and <p> acquisition and holding of stocks , warrants or securities prescribed in item ( 3 ) above issued by a foreign corporation , or equity interests in a foreign company , or interests similar to the foregoing , provided that the acquisition is made using an aggregate amount less than 50% of the total capital contribution of all partners . The Financial Services Agency of Japan 's position is that , in the case of an offshore limited partnership , this 50% restriction on foreign companies does not apply . <p> Although the scope of the foregoing business categories is quite broad , the current definition of securities requires a business purpose . The FIEL , on the other hand , abandons the business purpose limitation and adopts a comprehensive definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By broadly encompassing partnership and other vehicles ( Article 2(2) , item 5 covering rights under partnership agreements under Japanese law , and item 6 covering those under non-Japanese law ) , this definition deems interests in such vehicles to be securities . Such securities are generally called deemed securities , as opposed to traditional securities typically used for frequent trades . A partnership agreement is generally encompassed by the new definition if it entitles an investor to distributions of profits generated from , or distributions of properties in relation to , the business to which an investor has contributed money or certain other types of assets . An exception to this definition applies where , among other things : ( i ) all the investors are involved in the business in the manner to be provided in the relevant Cabinet Order ; or ( ii ) there are no distributions of profits or properties to investors over the originally invested amount . This means that any passive investment agreement ( other than covered by any other item of the securities definition ) would generally be captured by the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vehicle , and the rights under the agreement would be deemed securities under the FIEL . <p> This expansion of the securities definition can be viewed as an introduction of the Howey test under the US securities law . The traditional structure of the SEL in relation to the definition of securities is an enumeration method in which the rights or instruments that fall under the definition constitute an exhaustive list . The addition of the definition of collective investment schemes is open-ended and , like the Howey test , would enhance investor protection . <h> Definition of security under US Federal law <p> Section 2(a) ( 1 ) of the Securities Act of 1933 , and the judicial interpretation of this Section , constitute the primary sources of law for what constitutes a security . Section 2(a) ( 1 ) of the Securities Act reads as follows : <p> " ( a ) When used in this title , unless the context otherwise requires , <p> ( 1 ) The term " security " means any ... investment contract , ... or any certificate of interest or participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guarantee of , or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase , any of the foregoing . " <p> ( Because , according to the Supreme Court in Tcherepnin v Knight ( 1967 ) , the definition of a security in Section 3(a) ( 10 ) of the Securities Exchange Act is almost identical to that of the Securities Act , most questions relating to what constitutes a security under the Exchange Act could be answered by reference to the same language under the Securities Act . ) <p> Three issues arise from this definition . First , a security will exist if found to fall under any of the expressly enumerated bases of Section 2(a) ( 1 ) of the Securities Act . Second , the term investment contract is not clearly defined . The courts , in determining whether or not a partnership structure gives rise to a security as defined under the Securities Act , have generally relied upon the basis of an investment contract , and not on other bases enumerated under Section 2(a) ( 1 ) . ( See , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shreveport Wireless Cable TV Pshp ( 1998 ) , SEC v Telecom Mktg ( 1995 ) and Deckebach v La Vida Charters ( 1987 ) ) . Third , the definition above makes a distinction between a specific instrument as a security and a " certificate of interest or participation in ... any of the foregoing . " So it is conceivable that , where a limited partnership would be involved with a particular investment ( non-performing loans , for example ) , the underlying investment might not fall under the definition of a security , but the seller ( or offeror , as the case may be ) of the participation in the limited partnership might be found to be issuing a security . This article focuses on a security that would be created by virtue of the sale of the participation in the relevant Japanese partnership ( on the assumption that the Securities Act would be triggered at all by virtue of a legitimate offer an sale having been made ) . <p> In SEC v Howey Co ( 1946 ) the US Federal Supreme Court poured content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others . " Accordingly , to constitute a security within the meaning of the Securities Act , all of the following are required : ( a ) an investment of money ; ( b ) a common enterprise ; ( c ) profits ; and ( d ) the profits derived solely from the efforts of others . <p> Howey test : an investment of money <p> The courts have generally held that an investment for something other than profit or financial gain is not a security . See , for example , United Hous Found Inc v Forman ( 1975 ) , wherein the court held , on the facts in issue , that an investment by certain investors in a certain cooperative housing project was an investment in acquiring a place to live , and not in financial returns . Also , notwithstanding that the Howey test requires an investment in money , courts have not limited the consideration to money . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securities , regardless of the form of consideration to be exchanged in the bargain . " <p> Howey test : a common enterprise <p> Depending upon which circuit the issue of the determination of a common enterprise is tried under , the court will adopt one of the following three approaches : the horizontal approach , the narrow vertical approach or the broad vertical approach . ( See Borneman , Ryan , Why the Common Enterprise Test Lacks a Common Definition ( 2005 ) . ) Under the horizontal approach , a common enterprise will be found if the court finds on the facts a pooling of investors ' monies in a business enterprise , resulting in the investors sharing all the risks and benefits of the enterprise . Conversely , under the narrow vertical approach , a common enterprise will be found if " the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment . " Under the broad vertical approach , a common enterprise will be found if the investor depends upon the expertise and efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v ETS Payphones Inc ( 2002 ) ) . <p> Howey test : profits <p> To be caught under the Securities Act as a security , there must be an investment for profit or financial gain . The facts in SEC v Edwards ( 2004 ) were that investors invested in a scheme with a fixed annual return ( at a specified percentage ) . The 11th Circuit held that an offer requires either capital appreciation or a participation in the earnings enterprise to satisfy the profits prong of the Howey test . The Supreme Court , however , overruled the 11th Circuit and stated that : <p> " There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns for purposes of the test , so understood . In both cases , the investing public is attracted by representations of investment income . Moreover , investments pitched as low risk ( such as those offering a ' guaranteed ' fixed return ) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud , including older and less sophisticated investors . " <p> Howey Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all above thresholds have been met , a security will be found to exist if profits are derived solely from the efforts of others . The difficulty that arises is that if the profits are derived solely ( or exclusively ) from others , a serious loophole would exist in the Securities Act , and allow persons to escape the fraud provisions merely by requiring a minimal effort on the part of investors ( SEC v Glenn W Turner Enters ) . As a result , courts have either read out or explained away the solely qualification , and have determined this prong of the Howey test to be satisfied if the investment was based upon the efforts of others . <p> Efforts of others , however , has been interpreted in many ways over the years , and some confusion still exists over its precise meaning . Generally , regardless of the form of the partnership ( that is , any of the Japan investment vehicles discussed above ) , the rule is that courts will find this prong of the Howey test met if the partner is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ways in which the partnership interests are marketed to investors . If it is contemplated that the partners will play a passive role while the business is managed by someone else , then the securities laws are likely to be implicated . Even where a partner has enough of an ownership interest to have an input in the day to day business operations , a decision by that partner to remain passive will not negate the inference that the partnership interest is a security " ( Hazen , Thomas Lee , The Law of Securities Regulation ( 2005 ) ) . <p> In another seminal case , the court in Hawaii v Hawaii Market Centre Inc ( 1971 ) developed a risk capital test to determine whether or not a security exists . A security under this test will be found to exist if : " ( a ) the investor provides initial value to the enterprise , ( b ) the initial value is subject to the risk of the enterprise , ( c ) the initial value is induced by representations leading to a reasonable understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial value , and ( d ) the investor does not exercise managerial control over the enterprise . " The risk capital test effectively broadens the definition of security because , among other things , it does not include a common enterprise requirement , as does the Howey test . <p> The Howey test is used in the federal courts and in most state courts , and the risk capital test is used in only a minority of state courts . ( See further , Pease , Gregory J , Bluer Skies in Tennessee ? The Recent Broadening of the Definition of Investment Contract as a Security and an Argument for a Unified Federal-State Definition of Investment Contract ( 2004 ) . ) <h> Financial instruments business registration <p> Another challenge for investment funds under the FIEL is the registration requirement as a financial instruments business firm . Under the old regime , general partners ( or other operating entities ) of partnerships mentioned above were generally not required to register as a securities company under the SEL despite the fact that they solicited investors to purchase their interests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuer 's solicitation of its own securities was not a securities business . Nor were general partners required to register as investment advisers under Japan 's Law Concerning Regulations of Investment Advisory Business Related to Securities ( Law 74 of 1986 , as amended ; the Investment Advisory Law ) on the theory that general partners only manage their own assets jointly with others , notwithstanding that they essentially do manage assets on behalf of limited partners . <p> The FIEL has merged the Investment Advisory Law , which will be abolished when the FIEL takes effect . Under the new law , securities companies and investment advisers under the current regime will be referred to as financial instruments business firms and are required to registered as such . If a general partner : ( i ) solicits interests in its own fund ; and ( ii ) invests in securities or derivatives , investment management of the assets of its own fund would fall under the definition of financial instruments business , and so would generally require the general partner to register as a financial instruments business firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIEL ) . There are four categories of financial instruments business : ( i ) first financial instruments business ; ( ii ) investment management business ; ( iii ) second financial instruments business ; and ( iv ) investment advisory and agency business . A general partner 's solicitation of its own fund interests falls within category ( iii ) and investment management of the assets of its own fund falls within category ( ii ) . Category ( i ) is meant to cover , among other things , traditional securities broker-dealer business . So-called non-discretionary investment advisory business is included in category ( iv ) . This can be viewed as equivalent to : ( i ) broker-dealer registration under Section 15 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ; and ( ii ) investment adviser registration under Section 203 of the US Investment Advisers Act of 1940 , as covered by a single registration . <p> This onerous registration requirement is eased to a notice filing requirement if the partnership falls under an exemption . An exemption is generally available where , with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the offering is made on a private basis only to qualified institutional investors plus a certain limited number of investors , and where , with respect to investment management of the fund assets as mentioned in ( ii ) above , the fund is held only by qualified institutional investors plus a certain limited number of investors . This certain limited number of investors will be designated by cabinet order . The number is expected to be 49 or less . <h> Comparing the two approaches <p> The four prongs of the Howey test ( ( a ) an investment of money ; ( b ) a common enterprise ; ( c ) profits ; and ( d ) profits being solely from the efforts of others ) , the test that US courts would employ in determining whether a security within the definition an investment contract under Section 2(a) ( 1 ) of the Securities Act has been created , are generally contained in the elements of a collective investment scheme under the FIEL . In relation to item ( a ) , the FIEL requires a contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item ( b ) is not clear in the context of the FIEL , a collective investment scheme does require the existence of a business to which at least one investor makes a contribution . Items ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the exceptions mentioned above ; interests in a partnership will not be deemed securities if : ( i ) all the investors are involved in the business in the manner to be provided in the relevant cabinet order ; or ( ii ) there are no distributions of profits or properties to investors in excess of the originally invested amount . On the other hand , Japan 's approach regarding the financial instruments business registration indicates that Japan 's new securities regulations might , in some respects , be taking an approach different from US securities law . <p> Author biographies <h> Adam I Wiseberg <h> Nishimura &amp; Partners <p> Adam I Wiseberg has been a foreign counsel at Nishimura &amp; Partners since 2004 , where his main areas of legal practice include finance , banking , and general corporate law .

MIGA has master contracts with several private equity funds that invest in sub-Saharan Africa . <h> " We foresee an increased pool of resources available to improve lives in developing countries around the world " <p> MIGA can also provide coverage for capital market transactions by insuring bond holders . MIGA has supported several such capital market transactions to raise financing for much-needed infrastructure projects . In some cases , MIGA 's support enhanced the rating of the country or the entity making the offering , attracting additional investors . <p> For example , in Senegal , MIGA provided NHFO coverage for a dollar-euro cross-currency swap arrangement between Standard Bank ( SB ) and the government .

This transaction marked the first time MIGA issued a guarantee for a hedging arrangement without covering the related financing . <h> What role should international finance bodies such as yourselves be playing ? Are there ways they are adapting to meet modern global economic challenges ? <p> Multilateral organisations and development finance institutions play a significant role in helping countries attract private sector financing , particularly at a time when local and governmental resources are low or shrinking , by offering new instruments and innovative applications of existing instruments . We note that traditional donor countries are increasingly emphasising the private sector 's role in their development assistance policies . Fortunately , both investors and lenders see the potential and returns in emerging markets , which have recently posted relatively stable growth .

The same happened with Kommunalkredit and the split into KA Finanz as a ' bad bank ' . <p> As a result of the 2014 stress test , all Austrian banks have met the required 8% of CET1 after the asset quality review . Under the adverse scenario , only five banks reached the required CET1 ratio of 5.5% . <p> The Austrian Federal Banking Act does not use the term ' stress test ' in connection with the FMA 's supervisory duties .

It needs to be assessed according to general principles of tax law , whether the criteria for debt or equity prevail in a qualitative perspective . The fact that the instrument does not provide for a participation in any value increases at redemption or liquidation of the issuer is considered a very negative aspect of an equity instrument for tax purposes , although balance sheet equity will be given in many cases ( in case of a full loss participation ) . According to literature and an informal statement of the Austrian Ministry of Finance , coupon payments for AT1s based on article 51 of Regulation 575/2013 of June 26 2013 should be tax deductible in Austria . However , it is recommended to take advice on a case-by-case basis . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax resident corporate investors are not subject to withholding tax on interest payments received from an Austrian issuing bank . For Austrian tax resident investors , withholding tax applies . This tax will be deducted by the Austrian custodian or paying agent of the bank where relevant AT1s are deposited in a custody account . In the case of non-Austrian tax resident individuals as investors , ordinary withholding tax ( relief according to double taxation conventions available ) or EU withholding tax needs to be considered . <p> In the case of a write-down of AT1s qualifying as debt instruments for tax purposes due to the realisation of a trigger event , the amount by which the repayment capital is reduced should lead to a taxable gain at the level of the issuing bank . Correspondingly , a subsequent increase of the capital to be repaid should lead to tax-effective expenses . <h> 16 .

The FMA intends to publish a list of national O-SIIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 131 section 1 2013/36/EU , each member state has to designate a national authority in charge of identifying G-SIIs and O-SIIs . In Austria , according to section 23b ( 1 ) BWG , which will come into force on January 1 2016 , the FMA is responsible for identifying G-SIIs . <p> According to section 8 BaSAG , all Sifis are obliged to prepare a recovery plan imposing measures for financial stability . <p> Rules on the ring-fencing of risks will enter into force in July 2015 , subject to transitional rules . Even though these rules do not explicitly require a bank to be systematically important in order to fall within the scope of the ring-fencing regime , factually only systematically important banks are likely to be caught by the provisions . <p> Tibor Fabian has been a partner at Binder Grsswang since 1996 .

Because of attractive legal and tax rules , Switzerland often serves as an operational base for foreign joint venture partners who also benefit from the established legal and political environment , the stable economy , and the quality of financial services and qualified labour force that the country provides . This article gives an overview of the legal structures available for joint ventures in Switzerland . <p> The term ' joint venture ' is generally understood as a short-term or long-term cooperative relationship between two or more parties with regard to a specific purpose . The purposes of joint ventures are manifold and include research and development , manufacture , distribution and sale , marketing , specific construction projects , pooling of capital for investment or other financial purposes , as well as the spin-off of business segments . <p> Generally , Swiss law does not provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a joint venture under Swiss law is , therefore , governed by the general rules concerning contracts and companies which are contained in the Swiss Code of Obligations . Furthermore , there are no rules which would prohibit foreign participation in a Swiss joint venture . Swiss tax law provides for favourable taxation of joint ventures which are mainly active abroad . However , certain businesses if conducted in Switzerland ( including banking , certain financial services , insurance business , real estate business , certain businesses in the health sector and trading with specific goods ) are subject to licences or approval by regulatory authorities . <p> In principle , two different forms of joint ventures are known in Switzerland : <p> Corporate joint ventures ( also called equity joint ventures ) which occur if the joint venture enterprise is an independent legal entity which is owned by the members of the joint venture ( partners ) . Joint venture companies are generally organized as stock corporations ( Aktiengesellschaft , AG ) . In this case , the basis of the joint venture and the respective rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement ( also referred to as a joint venture agreement ( JVA ) ) . <p> Contractual joint ventures , which are solely based on a cooperation agreement between the partners ( JVA ) . <p> Contractual joint ventures <p> When to choose <p> A joint venture may be organized on a purely contractual basis , if it relates to a short-term project or to a project which is limited in scope and time and which does not require a permanent structure ( for example , a consortium formed between two or more entrepreneurs to carry out a particular project ) . However , a contractual joint venture is usually not suitable for a long-term cooperation concerning a specific business operation , which is independent from the partners ' main operations . <p> Advantages and disadvantages <p> In comparison to corporate joint ventures , a contractual joint venture has certain advantages with regard to the following : <p> Formation : no specific formalities are required . Nevertheless , the partners will usually enter into a written JVA . <p> Flexibility : the parties may amend or modify their agreement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : contrary to corporate joint ventures , a contractual joint venture may be terminated by mutual consent of the partners at any point of time . <p> Tax : contractual joint ventures do not constitute a taxable entity in Switzerland , as the profits and losses of the joint venture accrue directly to the partners . <p> Confidentiality : the contractual joint venture provides complete secrecy . The partners may structure the joint venture in a form so that only one or certain partners deal with third parties and the other partners remain undisclosed . <p> Certain disadvantages of contractual joint ventures relate to the following : <p> Liability : no limitation of liability of the partners applies towards third parties . The partners may be held directly liable for the debts incurred by the joint venture , even if they were incurred by another partner . <p> No legal entity : because a contractual joint venture does not constitute a legal entity , it may not enter into contracts or liabilities or own assets in its own name . <p> Financing : if external financing of the joint venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally prefer to deal with legal entities as debtors . <p> Limited ability to transfer the contractual interest : under Swiss law , no partner may transfer his or her interest in a simple partnership to another party without the consent of all other partners . Even if such consent is given , the transferring partner will remain liable for the debts of the joint venture for a period of two years from the date of the transfer . <p> Contents of the Joint Venture Agreement <p> Unless the partners agree otherwise , the statutory provisions concerning the so-called ' simple partnership ' ( Die Einfache Gesellschaft ) apply to contractual joint ventures . However , because these statutory rules may not meet the particular intentions and requirements of the joint venture partners the following should be specifically regulated in the JVA : <p> the purpose and scope of the joint venture ; <p> funding and contributions by each partner ; <p> internal management and decision-making of the joint venture ; <p> power to represent the joint venture to third parties ; <p> profit and loss allocation ; <p> non-competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> governing law ( if national and foreign partners are parties to the JVA ) ; <p> Joint ventures often relate to long-term cooperation arrangements between two or more parties . A frequent example is that two enterprises decide to cooperate with regard to research , development and exploitation of a new technology , possibly also the manufacture of products , which are based on such technology . The joint venture may choose to market and distribute the products or , alternatively , manufacturing , marketing and distribution may be carried out by the partners . Other recent examples include joint projects of banks regarding internet-based businesses such as financial portals or online banking platforms . <p> In such cases , if the joint venture concerns a separate business operation for which an organizational long-term structure is needed , the partners will often set up a company ( a joint venture company ( JVCo ) ) , in which the partners hold a participation and make available staff , certain assets , IPR , know-how and other resources to the JVCo . <p> In Switzerland , joint venture companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provide the most flexibility and allow tailor-made structuring pursuant to the particular needs of the joint venture partners . Other company forms are generally not taken into consideration due to less flexibility in structuring . <p> Advantages and disadvantages <p> The JVCo constitutes a separate legal entity which may last for an indefinite period of time and which has an organizational structure . The main advantages of a corporate joint venture relate to the following : <p> It is a separate legal entity : as a legal entity , a JVCo has the legal capacity to enter into contracts or liabilities ( including financing agreements with third parties ) and to own assets in its own name , which a mere contractual joint venture can not . <p> There are limitations to liability : the liability of the partners is basically limited to the payment of the amount subscribed in the share capital of the JVCo . <p> Shares in a JVCo are easily transferable : unless the articles of association provide that the transfer of shares may be refused by the board of directors for important reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formalities . <p> Disadvantages that should be considered include the following : <p> Formalities and costs in connection with the formation of a JVCo : the formation of a JVCo has to follow statutory provisions regarding the formation of a Swiss company and generates higher formation and running costs than a contractual joint venture . As explained in more detail below , the formation and professional structuring of a corporate joint venture requires a variety of documents . <p> Formalities in connection with the administration of a JVCo : A Swiss company must prepare annual financial statements which must be audited by independent auditors . In addition , the board must issue a business report . The audited accounts and the business report have to be approved by an annual meeting of the shareholders . However , and unless a company qualifies as a public company , the annual accounts and the business report must not be published or registered . <p> Limited secrecy : unless the JVCo is a public ( listed ) company , the disclosure requirements with regard to Swiss companies are less stringent compared to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Trade Register and are accessible to the public : <p> the company name and domicile ; <p> the foundation date ; <p> the purpose of the company ; <p> the share capital and denomination of the shares and type of shares ( registered or bearer shares ) as well as possible restrictions on the transfer of shares ; <p> the board members ( name , nationality , domicile and signing authority ) ; <p> the same data regarding other signatories ( managers , representatives , etc ) ; <p> the name and domicile of auditors . <p> The shareholders are not registered in the Trade Register . <p> Liquidation and winding-up : the liquidation of the JVCo has to follow a formal procedure pursuant to statutory provisions . <p> Taxation : the JVCo is subject to taxation ( see below ) . <p> Documentation and structure <p> For the formation and structuring of a corporate joint venture , several documents are necessary , the purpose and interdependence of which are outlined hereafter . <p> Shareholders agreementThe shareholders agreement between the joint venture partners ( the JVA ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the partners with respect to the JVCo and the terms and conditions which will govern the joint venture . <p> The JVA constitutes only a contractual relationship between the partners . In particular , it has no corporate effects and , as a general rule , does not bind the JVCo itself . For this reason , it is often recommended that the JVCo should also be a party to the JVA . However , it is disputed and , in the view of the author , questionable , whether this is legally possible under Swiss law . The corporate relationship between the partners ( shareholders ) and the JVCo is governed by the articles of association of the JVCo which have absolute binding effect . Therefore , specific corporate relations between the partners should also be regulated in the articles of association , to the extent that Swiss law permits this . However , as certain issues to be regulated between the partners may not be provided for in the articles of association , the conclusion of a JVA between the partners which sets out the detailed terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The principle terms of a JVA are outlined below . <p> Set-up agreementAlthough the JVA often provides for the setting-up of the JVCo , the formation process should be regulated in a separate agreement , the set-up agreement ( Zusammenschlussvertrag ) . The setting-up of the JVCo is completed on incorporation , while the JVA regulates the future , long-term relationship between the partners , which follows , in various respects , different legal principles than the transactions to be performed in connection with the formation of the JVCo . <p> The set-up agreement should regulate the following aspects : <p> the mechanics for the formation of the JVCo , including contributions by the partners to the initial capital of the JVCo ( cash contributions or transfer of assets as contribution in kind ) ; <p> any loans to be granted to the JVCo ; <p> any assets to be transferred by each of the partners to JVCo ; <p> the valuation of assets ; <p> due diligence ( if not conducted beforehand ) ; <p> the usual representations and warranties of the partners regarding the assets transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personnel to JVCo ; <p> the remedies in case of breach or inaccuracy of representations and warranties ; <p> the usual miscellaneous provisions , governing law and dispute resolution ( jurisdiction or arbitration ) clauses . <p> Articles of association of the JVCoAs a rule , standardized articles of association may be used . However , since the articles of association have a stronger ( corporate ) binding effect than the JVA , certain aspects ( for instance , special voting thresholds or limitations regarding the transfer of shares in the JVCo ) should be regulated also in the articles of association . <p> Business organisation regulation of the JVCoSwiss law provides that the board of directors of a Swiss company must , in principle , manage the company , unless the management authority is assigned ( delegated ) to one or more managers . Such delegation by the board is permitted only on the basis of a written organization regulation which must be implemented by the board . The organization regulation will provide for the management functions , their powers , responsibility and limitation of authority , reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , mandatory law provides that certain duties are reserved to the board of directors and may not be delegated . <p> Additional agreements between the JVCo and the joint venture partners A joint venture often requires that the partners will provide financing , or will transfer , supply or make otherwise available assets , IPR or products to the JVCo or that products developed and manufactured by the JVCo are being distributed through the distribution channels of one or more of the partners . For this purpose , and because the JVCo is a separate legal entity which should not be a party to the JVA , it is indispensable that separate agreements between the JVCo and the respective partner(s) are entered into ( often referred to as satellite agreements ) . Such satellite agreements may include the following : <p> a loan agreements ; <p> purchase agreements regarding the sale and transfer of specific assets by a partner to JVCo ; <p> license agreements ; <p> leasing agreements ; <p> supply agreements ; <p> distribution agreements . <p> Contents of shareholders agreement <p> It is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only between the partners , and does not bind the members of the board of directors of JVCo . Regardless of the contents of the JVA , the directors have to comply with statutory duties , in particular the duty to act primarily in the interest of the company ( which interest may not necessarily coincide with that of the partners ) . <p> Furthermore , the JVA needs to be tailored to the specific purposes of the joint venture and the particular requirements of the partners . As an overview checklist , the following lists certain basic matters which the JVA should usually address : <p> The purpose : this should include a general description of the business purpose and functions of the joint venture and general understandings of the partners with regard to the joint venture . <p> Participation ratio : this should outline the respective participation of the partners in the initial share capital of the JVCo . <p> Financing : if the operations of the JVCo require financing in addition to the initial share capital , the JVA should regulate how such additional financing is provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operations : this should include the rights and obligations of the partners with respect to the operations of the JVCo ( for example , provision of staff , know-how , assets or other obligations ) and entering of respective satellite agreements between the JVCo and the respective partner(s) . The partners should also agree on a business plan which should be an exhibit to the JVA . <p> Shareholders meeting and decision making between the partners : the shareholders meeting is the supreme body of a Swiss stock company and has specific powers provided by law . In order to protect the interests of the partners in JVCo , the JVA should provide that <p> the shareholders meeting is duly constituted only if all or a specific minimum of the partners is present or represented in the meeting ; and/or <p> certain important decisions ( for example , changes to the capital structure of the JVCo , merger and/or liquidation of the JVCo and so on ) shall be possible only with the consent of all or a qualified majority of the partners . <p> Board of directors : usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board . In this connection the partners have to consider that a majority of the board must consist of persons who are Swiss citizens domiciled in Switzerland . <p> The JVA should also provide for important decisions which require majority votes . Such majority requirements should be reflected also in the Business Organization Regulation . <p> Management : this should include the organization of the operative management of the JVCo and the appointment of the initial management and respective rights/veto rights of the parties regarding the appointment or dismissal of key executives . <p> There should be a dividend policy . <p> Transfer of shares in the JVCo : as a general rule , the shares in a Swiss stock company are freely transferable . To a limited extent , it is possible , to implement certain transfer limitations in the articles of association ( so-called Vinkulierung , that is the power of the board of directors to refuse a transfer of shares for specific important reasons provided for in the articles of association ) . In the JVA specific restrictions regarding the transfer of shares in the JVCo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following : <p> mutual pre-emptive rights or first right of refusal of the partners ; <p> purchase options in exceptional cases ; <p> co-sale ( tag-along ) rights and co-sale obligations ( drag-along ) if the other party sells its shares in the JVCo under specific conditions ; <p> as security of transfer limitations , the JVA often provides that the partners will deposit their shares into escrow with an independent escrow agent . <p> The mechanism for the admission of new partners . <p> The exit mechanism ( for example , in the case of an IPO or trade sale ) . <p> Anti-competition and confidentiality covenants . <p> Penalties in case of breach of the JVA . <p> Duration and termination of the JVA : the JVA may be entered into for a specific or an indefinite period of time . In the latter case , the JVA must provide for an appropriate termination period . Furthermore , the JVA should provide for immediate termination for cause ( for example , in the case of a change of control with regard to a partner ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution ( jurisdiction or arbitration ) clauses . <p> Certain tax aspects of corporate joint ventures <p> When considering corporate joint ventures it is necessary to bear the following tax aspects in mind : <p> The incorporation of a JVCo is subject to Swiss stamp duty at a rate of 1% of the share capital or other equity contributions exceeding SFr250,000 ( $150,000 ) . Contributions in kind are valued at fair market value . Contributions in kind to the JVCo from a partner ( for example , patents ) might be subject to a profit or capital gains tax in the country of residence of that partner . <p> The JVCo is subject to profit taxation on the federal and cantonal level . The cantonal tax rate depends on the canton and the community within the canton where the JVCo is domiciled . Ordinary profit tax rates ( before tax ) vary between approximately 15% and 30% . In addition , a low cantonal capital tax is imposed on the JVCo . <p> The JVCo may enjoy privileged cantonal taxation . The JVCo is taxed as : <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade activities and at least 80% of its revenues are derived from sources outside Switzerland and at least 80% of its expenses are effected outside Switzerland ; or <p> ' administrative company ' ( Verwaltungsgesellschaft ) if its main purpose is to grant licences and loans to foreign persons . <p> Nevertheless , the JVCo may employ personnel and lease premises to a limited extent , without loosing the above tax privileges . In such cases the federal and cantonal tax rates applying to profits derived from foreign sources ( before tax ) vary between approximately 9% and 12% . Income derived from Swiss sources is subject to the ordinary profit tax rates . The so-called controlled foreign companies ( CFC ) tax legislation of the country of residence of the respective partner frequently does not apply to a 50%-50% JVCo . <p> If the JVCo is economically of importance in the Canton of location ( for example , by creating new jobs ) and is not subject to privileged cantonal taxation , it may , under certain conditions , enjoy tax holidays of up to 10 years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner or any other foreign person are not subject to Swiss withholding taxes . Profit distributions by the JVCo to a partner or a closely-affiliated person are subject to Swiss withholding taxes at a rate of 35% . Swiss withholding taxes may be fully reclaimed by Swiss partners and are partially or fully refundable by foreign shareholders , if the recipient is domiciled in a country with which Switzerland maintains a double tax treaty . <p> Swiss competition law aspects <p> Based on the Swiss Cartels Act a planned concentration of enterprises by joint venture , provided it qualifies under the act , will be notified to the Swiss Competition Commission , if the following thresholds are met : <p> worldwide joint turnover of the enterprises concerned of at least SFr2 billion ; <p> or <p> joint turnover in Switzerland of the enterprises concerned of at least SFr500 million ; <p> and ( cumulative ) <p> if at least two of the enterprises concerned achieve an annual turnover in Switzerland of at least SFr100 million each . <p> Moreover " and generally speaking " a joint venture may not result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolistic control thereof or an abuse of the market position , respectively .

In contrast , 2016 proved to be a challenging year for the resources sectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 . <p> Despite a subdued level of M&amp;A activity , 2016 saw a significant increase in the number of rival bids in public M&amp;A , in contrast to 2015 . Seven public M&amp;A targets attracted multiple bidders , and shareholders of those entities ultimately received , on average , a 97% premium to the original bid price . <h> 1.2 What M&amp;A deal flow has your market experienced and how does this compare to previous years ? <p> While the volume of inbound M&amp;A transactions in 2016 H1 was down only slightly , the overall inbound deal value was down 22.7% . Both inbound deal volume and value improved in 2016 H2 . But for 2016 as a whole , whilst inbound deal volume was marginally higher in 2016 , aggregate inbound deal value was substantially down , from A$45.92 billion in 2015 to A$39.1 billion in 2016 ( -14.9% ) . <p> These figures for cross-border transactions were also representative of the Australian M&amp;A market as a whole ( including domestic only transactions ) in 2016 , for which the number of reported transactions was broadly steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market driven by private or public M&amp;A transactions , or both ? What are the dynamics between the two ? <p> By value , the Australian market is driven by public M&amp;A , with reported inbound public M&amp;A representing A$24.9 billion in 2016 , as compared to A$6.5 billion for reported private M&amp;A ( down from A$15.8 billion in 2015 ) . <p> Cross-border public M&amp;A volume has declined over the past five years from the 172 deals in 2012 to 110 and 111 deals in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . The aggregate value of cross-border public M&amp;A deals , however , has shown positive signs , reaching a three-year high of A$28.59 billion in 2016 and representing 69% of the aggregate value of Australian cross-border M&amp;A in 2016 . <p> By volume , however , private M&amp;A continued to make up almost 80% of all cross-border Australian M&amp;A transactions in 2016 . Small and medium-sized enterprises were the predominant acquisition targets , reflecting the Australian business landscape . <p> Overall , by volume , cross-border Australian M&amp;A activity remains based in ( predominantly private ) deals valued up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions in 2016 were for deals valued at up to A$8 million . Deals valued between A$8 million and A$200 million accounted for another 38% of cross-border transactions . However , the value of cross-border M&amp;A deals within the Australian market is still overwhelmingly obtained from larger value deals , with deals valued above A$200 million accounting for just 11% of all cross-border deals by number but 82% of total value . <h> SECTION 2 : M&amp;A structures <h> 2.1 Please review some recent notable M&amp;A transactions in your market and outline any interesting aspects in their structures and what they mean for the market . <p> Australian regulators had a significant effect on some key transactions in Australia in 2016 . A bid from Chinese listed company Dakang to acquire S Kidman &amp; Co , Australia 's largest holder of private agricultural land , was blocked by the Australian government for a second time on national interest grounds . A rival consortium proposal emerged between Hancock Prospecting and Shanghai CRED to acquire S Kidman &amp; Co for A$386.5 million . The greater involvement of an Australian partner assuaged national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign investment from China was also blocked by the Australian government in August 2016 when each of the Chinese government-owned State Grid Corp and Hong Kong-listed Cheung Kong Infrastructure were banned from acquiring a 99-year lease over 50.4% of the New South Wales government 's electricity distribution network ( Ausgrid ) despite both already holding substantial power infrastructure assets in Australia . <p> The sale and ultimate break-up of the Asciano various port , logistics and railway businesses required intensive negotiation with Australia 's competition regulator ( and resulting transaction restructuring ) , before a three-way break-up amongst three consortia was ultimately approved . <h> 2.2 What have been the most significant trends or factors impacting deal structures ? <p> The availability of cheap debt continues to underpin transaction activity and the use of cash consideration for acquisitions . <p> The recent strength of equity markets , however , allowed a number of bidders to raise equity capital to fund acquisitions , including Vocus Communications ( A$652 million ) , and Mayne Pharma ( A$888 million ) . Both capital raisings were well received in the Australian mrket and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Corporations Act which regulates mergers conducted by way of court-approved schemes of arrangement . <p> The listing rules of the Australian Securities Exchange ( ASX ) , will also often be applicable . <p> The principal regulator for mergers and acquisitions is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) . The primary arbiter of disputes in relation to takeovers is the Takeovers Panel , a specialist administrative tribunal with wide statutory powers . <p> In addition , M&amp;A activity must commonly take into account Australian competition/anti-trust legislation , as administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) ; legislation regulating foreign investment , as administered by the Australian Treasury ( which receives advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board ( FIRB ) ) ; and taxation legislation . <h> 3.2 Have there been any recent changes to regulations or regulators that may impact M&amp;A transactions or activity and what impact do you expect them to have ? <p> Substantial reforms of Australia 's foreign investment approval regime came into effect in December 2015 and March 2016 , increasing the scope of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing new standard conditions required to be attached to foreign investment applications , directed at ensuring full compliance with taxation obligations ( including annual reporting obligations ) . <p> We expect these changes to have a minor impact upon aggregate inbound M&amp;A , but will likely make certain larger transactions that require approval more difficult to navigate . The changes have resulted in an increased interaction between the regulators including the Treasury and its foreign investment adviser FIRB , the Australian Taxation Office and the ACCC . Transaction parties must therefore adopt strategies to proactively engage with regulators. <h> 3.3 Are there any rules , legislation or policy frameworks under discussion that may impact M&amp;A in your jurisdiction in the near future ? <p> Long-running proposed reforms to Australia 's media ownership laws remain on the legislative agenda , but are uncertain . If they ultimately occur , significant consolidation in the media industry may result , from the abolition of the prohibitions on commercial television broadcasting to more than 75% of the population of Australia ; and controlling more than two out of three of regulated television , radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> SECTION 4 : Market idiosyncrasies <h> 4.1 Please describe any common mistakes or misconceptions that exist about the M&amp;A market in your jurisdiction . <p> Australia has an open economy , with wide-ranging free trade agreements in place with the US ( 2005 ) , ASEAN countries and New Zealand ( 2010 ) , South Korea ( 2014 ) , China ( 2015 ) and Japan ( 2015 ) . Whilst famed for its resources and agriculture sectors , the Australian services sector actually represents around 70% of GDP and 75% of employment . <p> Since 1983 , employer funded ( but essentially diverted employee income ) pension savings schemes ( called superannuation ) have been compulsory , with the minimum rate of contributions now being 9.5% of income . A$2 trillion is now held by superannuation funds or their managers , which have in consequence become strong forces in Australian capital markets and can sometimes become critical to the outcome of public M&amp;A proposals . <h> 4.2 Are there frequently asked questions or often overlooked areas from parties involved in an M&amp;A transaction ? <p> The potential need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors and can sometimes add to the transaction timetable if not given early attention . This is particularly the case in relation to transactions involving private equity sponsors , which the law may treat as foreign government investors because of the characterisation of their limited partners ( for example state teachers , public/civil servant pension funds ) . <p> Although market sounding conversations by prospective acquirers and their advisers are not prohibited , where the target is a company regulated by Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act ( mainly listed entities ) those discussions must avoid reaching done deals with shareholders/controllers holding the 20% acquisition threshold which triggers the need for a full public bid . Advice on the scope and content of such discussions should be obtained at an early stage . <h> 4.3 What measures should be taken to best prepare for your market 's idiosyncrasies ? <p> While mergers and acquisitions are not necessarily difficult to accomplish in Australia , care and specialist advice is required to ensure that the process is timely and successful . <h> SECTION 5(a) : Public M&amp;A <h> 5.1 What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your jurisdiction ? <p> The recommendation of the target 's board of directors ( or the target 's independent directors ) will strongly promote the success of the bid . Culturally , the boards of listed Australian companies tend to be receptive to takeover offers and maintain good lines of communication with major shareholders . <p> A supportive board also permits a transaction to be completed by way of shareholder and court approved scheme of arrangement , which , if approved by a majority of the shareholders ( holding 75% of the shares ) entitled to vote and who vote , provides 100% ownership of the target company and can also afford greater flexibility regarding transaction structuring than is the case under contractual takeover bids ( the latter requiring the bidder to ultimately have at least 90% of the target shares , and have acquired at least 75% of the target shares bid for , in order to exercise rights to compulsorily acquire minority holder shares ) . <p> That said , Australia maintains a legal regime that is relatively favourable for making hostile takeover offers , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a public takeover offer ? <p> Off-market takeover bids may be subject to a wide range of conditions . These typically include : <p> negative control conditions ; <p> material adverse change conditions ; <p> conditions regarding regulatory approvals ; <p> conditions requiring a minimum level of acceptances . <p> There is no requirement to have a minimum acceptance condition ( assuming foreign investment , competition law and other key requirements are satisfied ) . Wholly unconditional takeover offers are permissible . <p> Certain types of conditions are prohibited , however , such as maximum acceptance thresholds and conditions which turn on the opinion or belief of the bidder or an event which is within the bidder 's control . <h> 5.3 What are the current trends/market standards for break fees in public M&amp;A in your jurisdiction ? <p> Break fees are routinely used in Australian public M&amp;A deals and are relatively standardised , Takeovers Panel guidance requiring that fees not ordinarily exceed one percent of the equity value of the target company . There have been developments in recent years that suggest some shift toward more target-friendly deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fiduciary duties during a control transaction . <p> Reverse break-fees have lately become more common , particularly in leveraged deals or where a private equity buyer is involved . There is flexibility in pricing reverse break fees , but in practice these also tend to be at around one percent . <h> SECTION 5(b) : Private M&amp;A <h> 5.4 What are the current trends with regards to consideration mechanisms including the use of locked box mechanisms , completion accounts , earn-outs and escrow ? <p> The market for sellers remains positive , with many private sales being run as a competitive process , leading to reduced buyer protections such as earn-outs and escrow arrangements . Where a competitive sale process is taking place , some sellers are now able to obtain deposits ahead of transactions closing , and will typically require buyers to seek warranty and indemnity insurance in lieu of vendor covenants/warranties. <h> 5.5 What conditions are usually attached to a private takeover offer ? <p> Conditions are naturally highly tailored to the transaction but deals usually include regulatory ( for example foreign investment approval , and competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets in recent years has also led to material adverse change ( MAC ) conditions receiving more attention than they perhaps did in the past , which has led to the vast majority of MAC conditions being measured against very specific financial metrics ( as opposed to generalised MAC clauses which often result in later dispute ) . <h> 5.6 Is it common practice to provide for a foreign governing law and/or jurisdiction in private M&amp;A share purchase agreements ? <p> No . This would be extremely rare unless some particular cross-border element of the transaction required the application of foreign law , and even in such event this would usually be only to the minimum extent required . <h> 5.7 How common is warranty and indemnity insurance on private M&amp;A transactions ? <p> Take up of warranty and indemnity insurance has grown in Australian private M&amp;A over the last five years , with some estimates suggesting it is used in 40% of reported private M&amp;A deals , especially where the transaction arose from a competitive sale processes or transactions involving private equity sponsors . <h> SECTION 6 : Outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months in the M&amp;A market and how do you expect legal practice to respond ? <p> Some cooling on inbound M&amp;A may be expected with the Australian dollar having largely found a new level and practical restrictions on investment from China to Australia increasing , as well as growing protectionist sentiment generally . That said , we think certain sectors will attract increasing amounts of capital and M&amp;A activity , in particular the resources sector , assuming global economic growth improves and minerals and energy prices continue to hold up or even advance . <p> Jon Skene practises in public and private mergers and acquisitions in both the Australia and UK , business sale and purchase , joint-ventures , capital markets and securities ( including advice on the listing rules of the ASX , LSE and AIM ) , private equity , corporate governance , general corporate advisory matters , and competition and antitrust law generally ( including relating to the foregoing ) . <p> He has acted on numerous M&amp;A transactions including : acting for WIN Corporation on its sale of Channel 9 Adelaide to the Nine Network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of Channel 9 in Perth , and the renegotiation of WIN 's programme supply arrangements with the Nine Network ; acting in the UK for Asia Resource Minerals in relation to the $210 million takeover bid by Asia Coal Energy Ventures ; acting for Glencore International on its takeover bid for Minara Resources , valuing Minara at in excess of A$1 billion ; advising Glencore on its merger by way of scheme of arrangement with Xstrata , valued at $90 billion ( including the UK takeover code , corporate and contract law issues and Australian competition law aspects ) . <p> John Atanaskovic practises both English law in London and Australian law in Sydney , focusing on mergers and acquisitions , corporate governance , capital markets , competition law , and litigation .

The PPP Law became effective on November 5 2008 and the Concessions Law will became effective on January 1 2009 . <h> Concessions law <p> Concessions ( the rights conferred by a public body to a private person to engage in economic activities of common interest ) were until recently regulated by a general law adopted in 1992 , as well as by more than 40 other laws and bylaws regulating specific industry concessions ( telecoms , roads , agricultural land , hunting , maritime , free zones and public roads , among others ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numerous problems , which the new Concessions Law aims to resolve . The new law outlines the general principles of Croatian concessions , types of concessions , general procedures and phases related to the granting of concessions and the protection of associated rights . <p> In addition to a concession in the sense of a contractual relationship for the economic exploitation of common goods or goods of interest for the Republic of Croatia , the Concessions Law specifies two new types of concessions : concessions for the performance of public works and the provision of services in common interest , where the concessioner pays a consideration for the economic exploitation of the works done or services provided . By introducing a clear definition of concessions for public works and public services , Croatian law now recognises the same concession types as EU law . <p> The prior scattered legislative framework resulted in legal vagueness and non-transparency , and enabled a grey economy and corruption in the process of granting concessions . Furthermore , the protection of rights related to concessions and general concession politics have not been satisfactorily regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now applies to all industry concessions as the general practice for granting concessions for the exploitation of common goods and public services . Granting concessions for the performance of public works is subject to the tender procedure prescribed by the Public Procurement Law . All industry concession laws must be aligned with the Concessions Law by June 1 2009 . <p> Moreover , the Concessions Law regulates in much greater detail the entire granting process , from the preparatory steps through to the concession-granting procedure and the criteria for selection of the best bid and the signing of a concession agreement ( including its content and termination ) . <p> The Public Procurement Law applies not only to granting concessions for public works but also protects the rights granted in the concession-granting procedure . The Croatian State Commission for Supervision of Public Procurement Procedure is designated as an appellate body for the entire concession-granting process . The protection of rights during the concession-granting procedure is further assured due to the fact that an appeal now suspends process . This was not the case under prior law . <p> The parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession agreement . <h> Concessions politics <p> According to the law , the Ministry of Finance has full oversight of the concessions-granting process . The concession grantors are obliged to report to the Ministry of Finance on planned concessions , income derived from the concessions granted and any breach of a concession contract by a concessioner . Moreover , the Ministry of Finance supervises the fulfilment of the concessioners ' obligations and is authorised to initiate administrative and inspection proceedings against breaching concessioners . The Ministry of Finance also manages the publicly available Concessions Registry . By granting these powers to the Ministry of Finance , the control over concessions and the income it generates has been centralised . <h> PPP law <p> Until recently , PPPs in Croatia were only regulated by the 2006 Government Guidelines . It became obvious that more elaborate regulation of the matter was necessary . Generally , PPPs are encouraged in Croatia as a desirable model of cooperation between public and private partners in the provision of services that are traditionally in the public domain . <p> The PPP Law defines PPP as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private partner undertakes the obligation to design , construct and/or repair public infrastructure or to provide public service to final users , and a public partner grants to the private partner certain real estate rights and/or concessions and/or pays a consideration for the provided services . <p> For the first time , the PPP Law provides for both contractual and incorporated PPPs instead of just regulating contractual PPPs . As the 2006 Government Guidelines regulated only contractual PPPs , this is the first time incorporation PPP is defined and regulated by Croatian law . <p> For both contractual and incorporated PPP projects , the private partner is brought in either through a public procurement or concession-granting procedure ( in those cases when a PPP project includes the grant of concession ) . The applicable procedure is covered by the Public Procurement Law in the first case and the Concessions Law in the second . <p> The PPP Law provides strict rules on the approval of PPP projects with a view towards harmonising the specific PPP goals , the development strategies of the particular industry and the control the project 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the project 's attractiveness to a private partner . <p> The assessment and approval of PPP projects are , according to the PPP Law , to be conducted by a to-be-established Agency for PPP . The Agency for PPP will issue its opinion on a PPP project proposal , after approval by the Ministry of Finance ( which assess the budget and fiscal risks of a PPP project ) . Once the PPP project is granted approval , the particular public authority will start preparing bidding documentation , which will also have to be approved by the Agency for PPP . The Agency for PPP must also approve the draft contract on the PPP , once the private partner has been chosen in the public procurement or concession-granting procedure . At this stage , the Agency for PPP will assess the harmonisation of the draft contract with the bidding documentation , as well as the balance of risks between the public partner and the private partner . <h> PPP politics <p> The Agency for PPP , as well as the assessment and approval of PPP projects , has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all PPP contracts ( together with their amendments ) . The Agency for PPP will supervise the fulfilment of PPP projects and propose legislative improvements of PPP-related laws and regulations . It will also actively work on the successful implementation of the PPP model in the Republic of Croatia , as well as on the future development of the legislative and institutional PPP framework . <p> The main goal of the adoption of the new Concessions Law and PPP Law is to stimulate high quality concession and PPP projects , which should work for the benefit of both public bodies and private partners . By the adoption of these laws , the granting of concessions and the establishment of PPP projects will become more transparent and coherent . Transparency should then facilitate fair competition among interested parties , which will hopefully make more and more potential private partners interested in cooperation with the public sector .

The details of Government Authority decisions are not provided ; only the most significant aspects of the decisions are discussed . <p> AGREEMENTS RESTRICTING COMPETITION AND CONCERTED PRACTICES <p> ETI AAMS - Philip Morris <p> In 2001 , the Government Authority began an investigation into an alleged agreement between big cigarette producers restricting competition . The Authority investigated the behaviour of these producers which , over a period of approximately 10 years , increased the price of cigarettes by the same amount at the same time ( normally every year ) . The Authority concentrated on the policy of AAMS . AAMS is a governmental body entrusted with market regulation powers . Until 1999 , it was the second-largest competitor in cigarette sales and a monopolist in the cigarette distribution industry in Italy . In 1999 , it split up and the activity of production , sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investigation showed that AAMS had , de facto , imposed increases and had systematically limited the access of new brands to the Italian cigarette market . The Authority 's final decision ( in March 2003 ) also ascertained a strong influence by Philip Morris on AAMS . Rather than an agreement among all producers , the investigation showed an abuse of dominant position by AAMS and an influence over a governmental body by Philip Morris . For this reason , the Authority finally ruled on the existence of an agreement between AAMS and Philip Morris and imposed on these two companies a fine for an aggregate amount of 70 million ( $76 million ) . The Authority discharged the other cigarette producers . <p> CartaSI - American Express <p> A voluntary notification was made to the Authority by American Express ( AMEX ) and by Servizi Interbancari ( SI ) , a company controlled jointly by big Italian banks which manages on their behalf the credit card brand CartaSI . CartaSI represents approximately 42% of the credit card Italian market . The Authority started , in July 2003 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a joint venture which would issue credit cards recognized both by the circuit CartaSI and by AMEX for business clients and companies . The Authority is concerned about the fact that a joint venture between the two large operators in the Italian market might facilitate anti-competitive collusive behaviour . The investigation will end on April 30 2004 . <p> AGREEMENTS AND CONCERTED PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED BY ASSOCIATIONS <p> Some investigations are characterized by the fact that anti-competitive behaviour is actually facilitated by associations of undertakings . <p> Real estate agents <p> In May 2003 , the Authority began an in-depth investigation against various associations of real estate agents . The investigation was opened because the by-laws and codes of legal ethics of the associations impose the obligation to comply with exclusivity clauses and with minimum and maximum tariffs set out by local chambers of commerce . <p> Another investigation where two associations of undertakings are directly involved regards an agreement notified jointly to the Authority by the Italian Federation of Newspaper Publishers and the National Association of Press Distributors . The purpose of this agreement was to simplify the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern regards certain clauses of the agreement ( that is , the clauses providing for a unified system of compensation for distributors between the associations ) and the exchange of information provided with the agreement which could be considered sensitive by the Authority . The investigation will be concluded by January 2004 . <p> EXCHANGE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION <p> Philip Morris - tobacconists <p> The Authority is very concerned with the exchange of sensitive information as a tool which favors collusion in the market . For example , an investigation started in June 2003 following a notification by Philip Morris of a standard agreement between Philip Morris and tobacconists . On the basis of this agreement , the tobacconists undertook to provide PM with information concerning not only PM sales , but also the sales of other competing producers . The basic issue is whether the data on sales is considered sensitive information , considering that this data may be collected and published by any statistic company . <p> AGREEMENTS IN AIR TRANSPORT <p> Airline companies - fuel charge <p> The Authority also investigated the air transport industry . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline companies which had agreed a contemporary application of the same tariff surcharges to all national routes ( the so-called fuel surcharge ) . Although the Authority had ascertained that the policy of price increases had been agreed among all the companies and therefore had seriously infringed the law , it imposed low fines in consideration of the crisis in the air transport business after the events of September 11 2001 . The decision not to apply high fines does not seem to be reasonable as it may encourage undertakings operating in a market affected by economic crisis to behave in an anti-competitive way . <p> Alitalia - Volare <p> Another investigation in the air transport industry regarded an agreement between two companies ( Alitalia and Volare ) , concerning the so-called code sharing on 14 national and 8 international routes . More specifically , the agreement provided for a so-called free flow/segment availability code sharing , which allowed each of the airlines to sell places on the other airline 's aircraft without a strict delineation of the number of places offered and only limited by the remaining availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of routes and flights by improving their respective capacities on single routes . The Authority authorized the agreement only in relation to some routes and only for a limited period . For each route , the Authority balanced the actual benefit to the consumers with the risks of a possible collusion between the airlines . <p> VERTICAL AGREEMENTS <p> Sagit - ice-cream sale and distribution agreements <p> The Sagit case relates to a voluntary notification to the Authority of a standard agreement used by a company ( Sagit ) operating in the distribution and sale of ice-cream to retailers ( bars , restaurants , shops ) . The agreement contained an exclusivity purchase clause binding the retailers in favour of the ice-cream producer . The primary risk to competition does not derive from the agreement itself but from the fact that similar agreements are used by other significant industrial ice-cream producers in Italy ( NestlT Italiana , Sammontana , Gelati Sanson ) . The Authority assessed , therefore , the combined effect of similar agreements and opened the investigation not only against Sagit , but also against NestlT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions for a possible revocation of the block exemption granted pursuant to Regulation 2790/99/CE to companies with a market share lower than 30% in relation to vertical agreements . Ultimately , the Authority ascertained that the exclusivity , even though widespread , affected not more than 57% of the retailers , and therefore it decided not to prohibit the agreement , and not to revoke the block exemption in Regulation 2790/99/CE . It also evaluated positively the intention of Sagit not to spread the exclusivity obligation to more than 50% of its retailers . <p> COLLUSION IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES <p> The Authority began several investigations concerning collusion in public bids ; in particular , an investigation concerned the supply of meal tickets to the public administration ( Pellegrini - CONSIP ) ; another investigation concerned the supply of fuel for vehicles that were used by local public transportation agencies ( Local Public Transportation Agencies - Petrolieri ) . Ultimately , in May 2003 , the Authority imposed fines on large pharmaceutical companies for collusion in public bids organized by Public Health Agencies for the purchase of pharmaceutical products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the scope of decisions concerning the abuse of dominant position , the Authority concentrated mainly on refusals to deal or obstructionist behaviour of essential facilities-holders or of monopoly-holders in certain service markets ( for example , the postal service by Poste ) . <p> ENEL - eligible clients <p> As part of an on-going investigation , the Authority intends to ascertain whether ENEL , a former monopolist operating in the field of the supply of electrical energy , used contractual practices aimed at developing customer loyalty . Enel provided joint offers of basic , peak and modular energy to the so-called eligible clients ( that is , the clients with an electricity consumption higher than certain legal thresholds who are entitled to choose their electricity supplier ) . Also under scrutiny by the Authority is an English clause allowing ENEL to be informed of more convenient offers made to its customers by competitors . <p> REFUSAL TO DEAL <p> International Mail Express - Poste Italiane <p> In May 2002 , the Authority disclosed an abuse of dominant position by Poste Italiane Spa in the field of foreign mail distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under international law , public mail companies are obliged to transmit and distribute international correspondence delivered to them by other postal services and addressed to persons domiciled in their national territory , using the quickest method applicable to internal mail . In derogation of this principle , article 25 , paragraph 1 , of the Universal Postal Convention provides that no Member State is obliged to transmit or distribute correspondence sent from abroad on behalf of persons domiciled in its national territory , when the only purpose is to benefit from lower postal tariffs . The Authority ascertained that Poste Italiane had conducted a systematic policy of interception and blocking of huge quantities of correspondence from abroad , without distinguishing between the cases of re-setting and ordinary transmission of international mail . Re-setting is the practice of sending a letter or an invoice on behalf of an Italian person to Italian addressees through a foreign country ; in such case the refusal to provide the service would have been justified . <p> PREDATORY PRICING <p> In April 2002 , the Authority closed an investigation conducted against companies transporting vehicles over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caronte Shipping , Navigazione Generale Italiana ) . The investigation showed that these companies sold tickets for the route between Reggio Calabria and Messina at a price lower than the cost , with the specific intention of preventing new competitors from entering the market . This practice was supported with cross subsidies from the income achieved from the more profitable route between Villa S Giovanni and Messina . <p> In another investigation , begun recently against Telecom , the Authority intends to determine whether Telecom offered its business customers rates for telecommunication services which would be unsustainable for the competitors , because of access and interconnection costs charged by Telecom to the competitors . <p> ESSENTIAL FACILITY <p> In November 2002 , the Authority closed an investigation under article 82 of the EU Treaty which related to the anti-competitive behaviour of Eni Divisione Gas Power ( EDGP ) , a company of the SNAM Group , which holds dominant positions in the markets of both sale and transportation of natural gas . <p> The Authority stated that EDGP abused its dominant position in the market of sale of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing companies , by preventing the importers of natural gas , that do not depend on EDGP at the supply level , from introducing natural gas to the Italian sale market for the thermal year 2001-2002 . <p> The Authority imposed on EDGP a symbolic fine of 1,000 and obliged EDGP to submit , within 90 days , a report stating the measures it intended to take to eliminate the effects resulting from its abusive behaviour . In particular , EDGP had to expand foreign transportation pipelines in order to facilitate the entrance into the Italian market of new independent companies . It is worth noting that the Authority obligated a company holding an essential facility to widen its capacity in order to increase the access of competitors . <p> Aviapartner - Societa Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna <p> In June 2002 , the Authority condemned Societa Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna Spa ( SAB ) , the exclusive manager of Bologna Airport , for an abuse of dominant position in the market of airport handling services . The Authority ascertained that SAB 's behaviour obstructed competitors ' access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Italian and European precedents , pursuant to which airport facilities , under certain conditions , may be considered essential facilities . <p> ITALIAN MERGER CASES <p> Autogrill - Ristop <p> At its meeting of July 24 2002 , after completing an investigation that began in June 2002 following notification by the parties , the Authority prohibited Autogrill from acquiring a 100% equity interest in Ristop . Autogrill and Ristop are the two main Italian motorway rest-stop companies . The Authority upheld that the acquisition would be likely to strengthen Autogrill 's dominant position in the relevant market . <p> In the notification , the parties declared that if the transaction was prohibited by the Authority , Autogrill would acquire a 45% equity interest in Ristop , with a later option to acquire the remaining stake . The Authority believed , however , that this second Autogrill/Ristop acquisition could also strengthen the dominant position of Autogrill . Following an in-depth investigation , the Authority ruled that the strategy pursued by Autogrill constituted an abuse of dominant position and , therefore , it prohibited Autogrill from acquiring any stake in Ristop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same transaction under two different profiles : in relation to merger regulation , as a concentration able to strengthen a dominant position , and in relation to the rules governing the abuse of dominant position , as a specific strategy aimed at preventing competitors from entering the market . <p> Sita - Viaggi e Turismo Marozzi <p> In July 2002 , the Authority closed an investigation related to the concentration concerning the acquisition , by a company belonging to Group Ferrovie dello Stato ( FFSS ) of Viaggi e Turismo Marozzi , a company operating mainly in the field of public interregional bus transport services . The Authority , assuming that each route defines a market , observed that for several routes the only alternative to bus transport is the train , a service controlled by FFSS . In consideration of the access barriers deriving from the Italian transport regulation , the Authority prohibited the concentration . <p> Canal Plus - Stream <p> In May 2002 , the Authority authorized , subject to some conditions , the concentration concerning the acquisition by Group Canal+ of the entire stake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates through the controlled company Telepil Spa , which has been active since 1991 as a pay-TV provider . Stream Spa operates in the same field . <p> Stream and Telepil together represent 100% of the market share in the field of pay-TV in Italy . For this reason , the transaction was authorized only subject to several commitments . These were . <p> recognition of the unilateral right of the seller of sport events to withdraw without any penalty from agreements concerning the purchase of sport programmes ; <p> unilateral waiver of exclusivity and of equivalent rights related to the exploitation of encrypted transmission rights in a transmission platform different from those used by Stream and Telepil , included in existing agreements and the commitment not to acquire any such rights in future agreements ; and <p> the prohibition against executing agreements for exploitation of the transmission rights for periods exceeding two years , with the right of the parties which sell TV contents to withdraw unilaterally every year . <p> COLLECTIVE DOMINANCE AND MERGER REGULATION <p> SECI-CORROB - Finbieticola Eridania <p> In August 2002 , the Authority authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main competitor in the market of production and distribution of sugar from sugar beet ( Eridania 20%-30% ) by the second , third and fourth competitor in market shares ( SECI 10%-20% , Coprob Scrl and Finbieticola approximately 10% each ) . <p> In particular , the transaction was structured in two parts : initially Sacofin , a joint venture between Coprob and Finbieticola , would have acquired the entire stake in Eridania . Afterwards , within a maximum period of 18-24 months , Sacofin Spa would have been split between two newly incorporated companies : Newco C , controlled by SECI and Newco D , jointly controlled by Coprob and Finbieticola . <p> The undertakings affected by the transaction are vertically integrated because they operate both in the supply and the distribution of sugar beet . The acquiring companies would have reached ( at the completion of the transaction ) market shares ranging between 35% and 39% of the vertically integrated markets of distribution and supply of sugar beet . The transaction implied a clear risk of the creation of a collective dominant position of SECI and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized by a high level of concentration , homogeneity of products and production costs , a substantially steady demand and a significant transparency of the competitors ' commercial dynamics . <p> The parties offered to do several things to prevent the risk of creating a collective dominant position - to reduce to six months the period of joint management of the joint venture Sacofin Spa , to modify some relations between the acquiring companies in the vertically integrated markets and to introduce appropriate mechanisms aimed at preventing distortions in the modalities of sugar beet supply in favour of the two acquiring companies . <p> In this decision , which will represent an important precedent , the Authority very softly applied EU principles related to collective dominance . In particular , even if the commitments of the parties eliminate the possibility of some market foreclosure related to the vertical integration of the acquiring undertakings , they do not seem to prevent an easy coordination of the business decisions of the two main competitors in the Italian sugar market . Following the authorization of the transaction by the Authority , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration Court ( TAR ) . Surprisingly , TAR rejected the challenge , ruling that a decision by which the Authority authorized a concentration can not be challenged by a competitor . On the basis of other recent precedents , the same exclusion exists for the Authority 's clearance decisions concerning agreements voluntary notified to the Authority by the parties and for the decisions not to commence an investigation . These particular Authority 's decisions are , therefore , practically unchallengeable . The TAR 's position is in clear contrast to the Court of Justice precedents concerning similar cases ( related to the decisions of the Commission ) . <p> CONCLUSIONS <p> The Authority , headed by its chairman , Giuseppe Tesauro , has increased over the years the number and importance of its interventions . However , its decisions have been subject to several revisions by TAR and by Consiglio di Stato . These revisions induced the Authority to assume a more cautious attitude ( which has also been favoured by a recent legislative reform eliminating the minimum amount of fines for agreements and abuses of dominant position ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apply any fines at all , even if charging the company with serious infringements of antitrust law . This cautious attitude in the application of fines , which appears to be in contrast to the strict attitude of previous years , does not seem to follow a general rule , but instead seems to be a result of circumstances related to the peculiarity of each investigation . In fact , some serious infringements have not been sanctioned while others have been fined very heavily ( for example , Philip Morris 50 million ) . <p> Over the past few months , the attention of the Authority has been concentrated mainly on the markets where former legal and natural monopolists operate ( telecommunications , railways , gas and electricity distribution , air transport , postal services , local and inter-regional transportation services , waste disposal ) . The Authority is now giving attention to the pharmaceutical industry where it has discovered several collusive practices over the past few years . It is also interested in the print media industry and will probably scrutinize with more attention the press and television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being observed . The markets for credit cards and financial services have been also subject to investigation this year . <h> About the author <h> Luciano Vasques <p> Luciano Vasques concentrates on antitrust and other regulatory matters in Italy and the EU .

In addition , the competition investigation procedure was amended by the Executive Order ( ordonnance ) dated November 13 2008 . Finally , the LME modified the thresholds and time periods applicable to mergers , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economy as provided by the Executive Order . <p> The new Competition Authority centralises most of the powers that used to be shared between the Competition Council and the Ministry of Economy . It became effective upon the Government 's adoption of an Executive Order on November 13 2008 . <p> The Competition Authority benefits from wider powers in the merger-control field than the Competition Council . In this respect , the Competition Authority , rather than the French Ministry of Economy 's services , receives notifications of concentrations and investigates proposed mergers , both in Stage I ( initial investigation ) and in Stage II ( in-depth investigation ) . <p> The Ministry of Economy will only retain a subsidiary role regarding : ( i ) in depth merger investigations : within five business days following a Stage I clearance decision by the Competition Authority , the Ministry of Economy may request that the Competition Authority opens a Stage II and undertakes an in-depth investigation on the concentration ; and ( ii ) reviews , on the grounds of public interest , of a transaction that has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Competition Authority , within twenty-five business days of the notification to the Ministry of the Authority 's Stage II decision . <p> According to the LME , the Ministry of the Economy may exercise this right of contestation " for general interest purposes other than the protection of competition and which may , if applicable , compensate the harm to competition resulting from the transaction " . As examples of general interest purposes , the LME mentions industrial development , international competitiveness and the creation or preservation of employment . <p> A last point of reform of the LME is the creation of an investigation service within the Competition Authority , which will act in collaboration with the investigation service of the Minister of Economy . <h> Competition investigation <p> Prior to the Executive Order , the Competition Authority had been criticised for failing to distinguish its investigation activities from its decision-making role . The Executive Order has responded to this criticism by separating these two aspects of its work . <p> As a result , the Chief Case Handler ( Rapporteur GTnTral ) , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the duties formerly granted to the head of the Competition Authority . <p> It is up to the Chief Case Handler to decide whether the simplified procedure should be followed or not . In addition , contrary to the situation existing prior to the Executive Order , the Competition Authority may no longer undertake investigations on its own initiative : this power is now vested in the Chief Case Handler who may recommend that the Competition Authority undertake an investigation into anti-competitive practices ( Article L462-5 of the Commercial Code ) . <p> Finally , the Chief Case Handler 's duties include management of requests for procedural time extensions as well as requests for application of the provisions regarding business secrets and of access to the case file . <h> Decision-making powers <p> Article L464-8 of the French Commercial Code provides for the possibility , for the President of the Competition Authority , to appeal to the Supreme Court ( Cour de cassation ) a Court of Appeal decision that has cancelled or reformed a decision of the Competition Authority .

More caution will thus be required from company officers . <p> In addition , when an undertaking or an organism does not reply at all , or replies after the requested delay , to summons or to a request of information or communication of documents from the investigators , the Competition Authority is entitled , at the request of the Chief Case Handler , to deliver an injunction with a penalty payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's delay . <p> Article L464-2 V paragraph two provides that the undertaking that obstructed the investigations by providing incorrect or incomplete information or by communicating incomplete or misleading documents may be ordered by the Competition Authority at the request of the Chief Case Handler to pay a fine of up to 1% of the worldwide turnover without tax . <p> Regarding the rights of the entity under investigation , these have been increased both at the stage of investigation and with regard to any subsequent proceedings . <p> Concerning the investigations , the new Article L450-4 of the Commercial Code provides , first , that the judicial authorisation to conduct inspections and seize documents given by the freedoms and custody judge ( Juge des libertTs et de la dTtention ) to the European Commission , the Minister of Economy or the Chief Case Handler 's requests to initiate inspections must " mention the ability , for the occupant of the premises or its representatives , to be assisted by the counsel of their choice " . <p> This represents an improvement in the rights of enterprises that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassation , which did not wish to hinder the speed of investigations and used to justify its position by the presence of a police agent on the premises supposed to ensure the validity of the operations . <p> However , Article L450-4 provides that " the exercise of the possibility does not entail the suspension of the search and the seizure " . It results from this provision that such hearings may be held outside the presence of the company 's counsel if the latter is unable to go immediately to the premises . <p> Secondly , Article L450-4 paragraph six states that the judicial authorisation to conduct inspections and seize documents given by the freedoms and custody judge is now subject to appeal before the chief justice ( premier president ) of the competent Court of Appeal on a non-suspensive basis within a period of 10 days from the notification of this authorisation and not only to a review by the French Supreme Court ( Cour de cassation ) , as used to be the case . This solution complies with the Ravon case , decided by the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that the possibility to subject the judicial authorisation only to a review by the French Supreme Court did not comply with Article 61 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which provides a right to a fair trial , since this appeal does not allow any review of the factual elements on which the authorisation relies but only the elements of law . The Law of May 12 2009 specifies that only the public prosecutor and the person subject to the inspections and seizures are entitled to lodge this appeal . <p> Article L450-4 paragraph 12 also allows the undertaking to contest the conduct of the inspections and seizures before the chief justice of the Court of Appeal , on a non-suspensive basis , within a period of 10 days from the delivery or reception of the minutes and inventory or , where the defendant is not the object of the inspections and seizures , from the date of the reception by the defendant of the notification of the minutes and inventory . The Law of May 12 2009 specifies that not only the public prosecutor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge this type of appeal but also any person summoned on the basis of documents seized during these operations . The judicial decision of the chief justice can be appealed before the Supreme Court . <p> Concerning the proceedings , new guarantees for entities under investigation lie in the prescription period and in the creation of a hearing officer position . <p> The Executive Order of November 13 2008 states , as already was the case under ex-Article L462-7 that " facts dating back more than five years may not be referred to the Competition Authority if no attempt has been made to investigate , establish or punish them " . Please note that a new paragraph two provides that the actions interruptive of the prescription of the public prosecution mentioned in Article L420-6 are also interruptive of the prescription before the Competition Authority . However , a new paragraph three states that an action shall not be brought before the Competition Authority if a period of 10 years has expired since the end of the anticompetitive practices regardless of any interruption of the prescription periods . This limitation brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally , the LME , created , in Article L461-4 , the position of a hearing officer within the Competition Authority , whose task will be to collect , " as the case may be , the comments of the challenged and filing parties concerning the manner in which the procedures affecting them are carried out once the statement of objections is sent " and to transmit " a report to the chairman evaluating these comments and proposing , if necessary , any measure that will enhance the ability of the parties to exercise their rights " . <p> However , unfortunately , the hearing officer is not expected to participate in the Authority 's hearings , unlike officers in the European Commission . <h> Modifying merger thresholds <p> The time period for mergers are now expressed in business days ( instead of calendar days ) and equal 25 working days for phase I and 65 working days for phase II . <p> However , these time periods may be suspended at the request of the parties " on an ad hoc basis , such as in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of a delay in the provision of certain information . <p> In addition , specific turnover thresholds ( ? 75 million and ? 15 million instead of ? 150 million and ? 50 million for the general thresholds ) , may apply when the parties to the merger are active in the area of retail or in overseas territories . <h> Micro-anticompetitive practices <p> The Executive Order of November 13 2008 ( Article L464-9 of the Commercial Code ) provides for the right of the Minister of Economy to settle or order measures regarding micro-anticompetitive practices . Such practices will be subject to the control of the Minister where : ( i ) the combined turnover in France of all the undertakings involved does not exceed ? 100 million ; ( ii ) the turnover of each of the undertakings in France does not exceed ? 50 million ; and ( iii ) the practices do not fall within the scope of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty . <p> If the parties agree to a settlement , the amount of any fine imposed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' latest turnover achieved in France , if this amount is lower . <p> Timely compliance with the obligations resulting from the injunction or the acceptance of a settlement puts an end to any actions brought before the Competition Authority regarding the same facts . The Minister of Economy can not suggest a settlement nor order an injunction when the same facts have previously been the object of a referral to the Competition Authority by an entity mentioned in Article L462-1 . <p> If the parties refuse to settle or do not comply with the injunction orders or with the obligations resulting from the acceptance of the settlement , the Minister may refer the case to the Competition Authority . <h> Distribution law <p> The most notable changes brought by the LME in distribution law are the reduction of payment periods in order to support small and medium companies , the abolition of the prohibition of discrimination between distributors and the reduction of the back margins . <p> The LME ( Article L441-6 paragraph nine of the Commercial Code ) provides that the payment period shall not extend beyond 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the invoice date , this being applicable to agreements entered into after January 1 2009 . This reform is intended to bring payment terms in France in line with the European average and to support small and medium companies . <p> Such maximum time limit may be increased by means of inter-professional agreements which must have been entered into before March 1 2009 but this possibility is very strictly regulated and such agreements must end at the latest on January 1 2012 . Around 40 of them were concluded in different sectors such as toys industry , paper industry , edition of books , jewellery and so on . <p> Pursuant to Article L442-6 I 7 of the Commercial Code , imposing payment terms that do not comply with the new ceiling for contractual payment terms or which are obviously abusive or requesting the creditor , without any objective reason , to defer the date of issue of the invoice , may be sanctioned by a civil fine which shall not exceed ? 2 million but which may " be raised to three times the amount of the sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered by the DGCCRF ( French government agency responsible for Competition Policy , Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control ) to be a matter of international public order which implies that it will apply to international agreements whatever the law contractually chosen by the parties . <p> Finally , the interest rate for late payment penalties is also amended . These penalties may not be contractually fixed at less than three times the legal interest rate and , in the absence of a specific contractual provision , their rate shall be equal to the European Central Bank refinancing rate increased by 10 points . <h> Discrimination between distributors <p> One of the LME 's main contributions was to introduce the principle of freely negotiable prices between suppliers and distributors . Previously , discrimination with respect to prices and terms and conditions was prohibited unless economically justified by effective consideration . <p> If a seller offers different terms of sale , in particular different prices , to various purchasers in the same position , this will no longer give rise to any claim for damages or any civil fine . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prices and terms and conditions . <p> First , the LME added new prohibited restrictive behaviours to those already contained in Article L442-6 of the Commercial Code . It is now forbidden to impose , or attempt to impose , obligations creating a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties . In addition , obtaining or attempting to obtain conditions that are manifestly abusive with respect to prices , payment terms , conditions of sale or services , by threatening to totally or partially terminate commercial relations is prohibited . Finally , English clauses providing that a party will automatically benefit from the most favourable terms granted to its competitors by the other party are now null and void . <p> Second , the LME increased the level of civil sanctions applicable to restrictive behaviours listed in Article L442-6 of the Commercial Code , which may not exceed ? 2 million , to " be raised to three times the amount of the sums unduly paid " . <h> Reduction of the back margins <p> The principle stated by Article L441-7 of the Commercial Code , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be entered into before 1st March of each year , remains . <p> However , article L.441-7 , paragraph five now specifies that " obligations aimed at promoting business relations between a supplier and a distributor or service provider ... contribute to the determination of the agreed price " , which implies , according to the DGCCRF , that such obligations will now be deducted from the supplier 's invoice and will no longer be the subject of an invoice issued by the distributor . This implies a reduction of the back margins for services rendered and is part of the general policy of the Government aimed at reducing prices for the benefit of the consumers . <p> As part of this policy , one must note that the Chatel Act , of January 3 2008 , stated that the resale at a loss threshold below which a distributor may not sell without committing an offence is now at the triple net which is defined as " the net unit price listed on the purchase invoice , less the amount of all other financial benefits granted by the vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product , plus turnover taxes , specific taxes pertaining to the resale and the cost of transport " ( Article L.442-2 of the Commercial Code ) . <p> About the author <p> Jean-Christophe Grall is the founding and managing partner of MG Avocats ?

Judicial debt negotiation proceedings can be either voluntary or compulsory , subject to slightly different legislation . <p> It is only the debtor itself whom may petition for debt negotiation proceedings . Winding-up proceedings may be petitioned either by the debtor or by a creditor . The court decides whether the relevant conditions to open proceedings are fulfilled or not . <p> It is a requirement to file for statutory debt negotiation proceedings that the company is illiquid ( in a position where it can not meet its financial obligations as they fall due ) . It is , however , not a requirement that the company is insolvent ( both illiquid and with negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of winding-up proceedings that the company is insolvent . <p> In Norway , the court appointed administrator or liquidator is in practice always a lawyer . In judicial debt negotiation proceedings , the administrator has a supervisory function , while the board of directors maintains their duties and the company retains legal powers over its assets . <p> In winding-up proceedings , the bankruptcy estate is established as a separate legal entity with automatic seizure of all the debtor 's assets . The administrator controls and has legal powers over the bankruptcy estate and over the debtor 's assets and rights . <p> A creditor committee may be appointed with one or a few representatives for the creditors , with a function comparable to a board of directors with the administrator or liquidator as chairman . <h> 1.2 Is a stay on creditor enforcement action available ? <p> Upon the opening of judicial debt negotiation proceedings , there is an automatic stay of any bankruptcy petitions based on debt already incurred at that time . The stay lasts for three months from the opening of the proceedings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon request from the debtor . If compulsory composition proceedings are opened , the automatic stay lasts throughout the proceedings . <p> The stay is not effective against a bankruptcy petition filed by at least three creditors who together represent at least two-fifths of all claims entitled to dividend payment . <p> Further , execution liens may not be attached to the debtor 's assets after the opening of judicial debt negotiation proceedings or compulsory composition proceedings . <p> Finally , there is an automatic stay against enforcement of any collateral or security rights during the first six months after judicial debt negotiation proceedings are opened or winding-up proceedings are filed , unless the debt negotiations committee agrees to such enforcement . <p> The above provisions of automatic stay are binding on all parties , except for financial institutions who are allowed to agree on alternative enforcement procedures with respect to financial collateral if the customer or lender is a professional party and the agreement is made in writing . <h> 1.3 What are the key features of a reorganisation plan and how is it approved ? <p> While under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an exclusive right for a period of time to propose a reorganisation plan , though subject to approval of the administrator or creditor committee . The debtor has no right to propose a reorganisation plan while under winding-up proceedings , but may request the administrator to propose a compulsory composition . <p> In voluntary judicial debt negotiation proceedings , the reorganisation plan must be accepted by all the creditors . <p> However , a compulsory composition is only legally binding to all creditors if the following requirements are met ( the numbers referring to creditors and claims that are granted voting rights , i.e. excluding certain secured claims , conditional claims and claims from certain closely related parties ) : <p> If the dividend payment is a minimum of 50% , the plan must be accepted by at least three-fifths of the creditors with a total of at least three-fifths of the total debt ; <p> If the dividend payment is less than 50% but a minimum of 25% , the plan must be accepted by at least three-quarters of the creditors with a total of at least three-quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a class of creditors be ' crammed-down ' ? <p> In voluntary debt negotiation proceedings , an objecting creditor or class of creditors can not be crammed down . In a successful compulsory composition , the minority voters are crammed down by the majority voters ( see 1.3 ) . However , claims ranking in priority and claims that are fully secured may not be crammed down as they are entitled to full payment . <h> 1.5 Is there a process for facilitating the sale of a distressed debtor 's assets or business ? <p> While under judicial debt negotiation proceedings , the debtor may initiate a sale of assets through a going-concern reorganisation plan , subject to the approval of the administrator and the creditor committee as well as from any security holder . <p> In winding-up proceedings , the administrator has the sole power to sell assets that are not encumbered . With a minor exception for certain going-concern sales , the administrator and the buyer must respect any security right in the asset . The administrator may , upon acceptance from a security holder , transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reducing the security holder 's claim in the estate with the estimated or actual market value of the transferred asset . <p> The bidding process upon the sale of assets during a bankruptcy proceeding is not specifically regulated . <h> 1.6 What are the duties of directors of a company in financial difficulty ? <p> The directors of an insolvent company must ensure that all creditors within each class are treated equally and that the company must not incur debt it is unable to pay . Further , the directors should take immediate action if the company 's equity is deemed insufficient considering the size and risk of the business operations , or if the equity capital is lower than half of the share capital . Such actions include , within a reasonable time , to call for a shareholders ' meeting to inform of and suggest solutions to better the company 's economic situation . If the board of directors finds that there are no grounds for improvement actions or such actions are not feasible and it is unlikely that the economic problems may be solved , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or file for bankruptcy proceedings . <p> After judicial debt negotiation proceedings are opened , the directors maintain their roles and duties , but they have to comply with the administrator or creditors ' committee and the legal framework regulating the proceedings . <p> After winding-up proceedings are opened , the directors are stripped of their powers , and their duties are no longer to manage the company . Instead the directors have a duty to assist the court and the administrator with providing information , such as information regarding the debtor 's assets and debts , and documentation , such as relevant correspondence , financial statements and agreements . <h> 1.7 What priority claims are there and is protection available for post-petition credit ? <p> In Norway , claims entitled to dividend payment from the estate are generally ranked in the following classes : preferential claims ( such as costs incurred by the estate ) ; claims ranking first in priority ( mainly employees ' claims for wages ) ; claims ranking second in priority ( mainly recent tax and VAT claims ) ; regular claims ( dividend claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking last in priority ( such as interest accrued after proceedings were opened ) . The remaining claims from security holders that are not covered by the proceeds of the secured assets will fall into the relevant above-mentioned categories . <p> While under judicial debt negotiation proceedings , a debtor may not incur new debt , establish new securities in or sell assets of a significant value , without the acceptance of the debt negotiations committee . <h> 1.8 Is there a different regime for banks and other financial institutions ? <p> Under Norwegian law , banks , insurance companies and certain other financial institutions as well as parent companies of such entities are subject to separate rules on insolvency proceedings , found in the Act on guarantee schemes for banks and public administration , of financial institutions ( the Guarantee Schemes Act 75 ) of December 6 1996 . <p> Subject to the Guarantee Schemes Act , the government has the authority to place such above-mentioned financial institutions under public administration either if they can not fulfil their obligations as they fall due and they do not have sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not capable of fulfilling capital adequacy requirements . The board of directors will be heard before such actions are taken , if possible . If public administration proceedings are opened in a financial institution that is a parent company in a financial group , the other companies in that financial group may also be included in the proceedings . <h> Section 2 : INTERNATIONAL/CROSS BORDER ISSUES <h> 2.1 Can bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings be opened in respect of a foreign debtor ? <p> Bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings may only be opened in Norway for a foreign debtor if that debtor has its main office of business in Norway " similar to the centre of main interests ( Comi ) principle in the EC Insolvency Regulation 1346/2000 . Note , however , that Norway is not a member of the EU and has not ratified the EC Insolvency Regulation . <p> On July 8 2014 , the High Court of Norway passed a ruling in a case where a petition for winding-up proceedings against a Polish company was delivered to a Norwegian court . The creditor was the Norwegian Tax Authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sales made by the company 's Norwegian branch . The court applied the Comi principle , and stated that bankruptcy proceedings may only be opened in Norway when the business 's Comi is located in Norway . The bankruptcy petition was declined because the company in this case was deemed to have its Comi in Poland . <p> It is quite common for a Norwegian entrepreneur to establish an empty foreign holding company without any other business than owning a Norwegian branch ; a Norwegian-registered foreign business enterprise ( NUF ) . Upon insolvency in such businesses the foreign holding company may be taken under judicial insolvency proceedings in Norway , since the actual operations of the company is based in Norway . The proceedings will include the Norwegian branch , and the notification of the opening of the proceedings will be registered in the Norwegian Company Register on the company number of the Norwegian branch . <h> 2.2 Can recognition and assistance be given to foreign bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings ? <p> Norway has not ratified the EC Insolvency Regulation , but has since 1933 been part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finland , Iceland and Sweden . This convention provides regulation on cross-border insolvencies within these member states , including rules on recognition , enforcement and choice of law in various situations . <p> The question of whether assistance in the form of ancillary bankruptcy proceedings to foreign main proceedings may be opened in Norway has no clear answer under Norwegian law . There have been very few cases before Norwegian courts relating to foreign bankruptcy proceedings . Old case law from the late 19th century implies that ancillary bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in Norway on request from a foreign bankruptcy estate , but these court decisions have somewhat limited legal effect today , being relatively old and passed by lower courts . <p> In 1994 a Norwegian district court opened sub-bankruptcy ( ancillary ) proceedings in Norway in a foreign entity with reference to Norwegian non-statutory bankruptcy law . The court pointed out that no matter where a debtor 's assets are located , these should be sold in the interest of all creditors , domestic and international . Ancillary proceedings are a useful instrument in that regard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Norway addressed the question of whether an established execution lien in a Spanish debtor 's assets in Norway could be clawed back due to a clawback claim from the debtor 's Spanish bankruptcy estate , or whether the debtor 's assets in Norway were protected by a stay on creditor enforcement actions due to the debtor being under Spanish insolvency proceedings . The court decided that the insolvency proceedings in Spain did not prevent separate debt recovery proceedings against the debtor 's assets in Norway ( stating that a clawback claim from the Spanish bankruptcy estate would not be recognised ) and allowing creditors to enforce execution liens established in the debtor 's assets in Norway while the debtor was under insolvency proceedings in Spain . The court stated that acknowledgement of insolvency proceedings in another state must primarily be based on international mutual agreements or legislation , and there was no such mutual agreement or legislation with Spain . <h> Section 3 : OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What other major stakeholders ( such as governmental or regulatory institutions ) could have a material impact on the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings , the debtor and the administrator or creditor committee must respect the interest of the secured creditors and ensure that the continuing operations of the company does not significantly deteriorate their position . <p> A compulsory composition must involve full payment to claims ranking in priority ( mainly wages and recent tax and VAT claims ) . <p> The tax authorities ' internal guidelines as to what dividend they may accept and the timeframe for payment for their claims that are not ranking in priority are often stricter than the minimum requirements for a compulsory composition under the Bankruptcy Act . <p> Most of the employees ' claims for wages rank first in priority . The same applies for certain pension liabilities , especially pension premiums . <p> With regard to termination and workforce cuts , the same rules are applicable for companies under debt negotiation proceedings and compulsory composition proceedings as for companies which are not under any insolvency proceedings . <h> Section 4 : CURRENT TRENDS <p> Due to a drastic drop in the oil prices during the fall of 2014 , and continuing low oil prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area have enforced cost reduction measures and executed large workforce cuts . This in turn has negative implications on the oil services industry , with a decreasing demand and lower prices of goods and services related to the oil industry . So far there has been an increase of non-judicial reorganisation and refinancing in this sector , as well as in the shipping sector , and if the situation continues we expect to see an increase in the number of winding-up proceedings within the oil services industry in the next few years . <p> There is an interesting development with regard to the judicial restructuring scheme in Norway . The Department of Justice has authorised a review of the provisions in the Bankruptcy Act on voluntary and compulsory judicial debt negotiation proceedings . The mandate is to evaluate whether the rules should be amended to facilitate a more flexible restructuring scheme , aimed at saving more businesses and preserving more jobs . The mandate has been given to Judge Leif Villars-Dahl at the Oslo court of probate and enforcement , supported by attorneys Knut Ro , Stine Snertingdalen and Stsle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von der Fehr .

A tender offer for the securities of a foreign private issuer that meets the requirements of the Tier I exemption is exempt from : <p> Rules 13e-3702 and 13e-4703 ( in the case of a " going-private " transaction or an issuer tender offer ) . <p> In addition , a Tier I tender offer that meet certain additional requirements is exempted from Rule 14e-5 ( former Rule 10b-13 ) , which generally prohibits a bidder in a tender or exchange offer from purchasing the targeted security outside the offer. 704 <p> Tier I transactions remain subject to the applicable rules of the target 's home jurisdiction , 705 which is defined to include both the target 's jurisdiction of incorporation as well as the principal trading market for its securities. 706 They also remain subject to the various antifraud provision of the US federal securities laws , including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act ( applicable to tender and exchange offers ) . 707 Both US and non-US bidders may rely on the Tier I exemption. 708 <h> ( ii ) Requirements <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are met : 709 <h> ( a ) Foreign private issuer <h> ( b ) Limited US ownership <p> Ten percent limit : 711 US securities holders must hold 10% or less of the class of securities sought in the tender offer . However , the 10% limitation does not apply in the case of a tender offer commenced during the pendency of a prior Tier I tender offer . <p> Calculation of ten percent limit : A US securities holder is a person resident in the US. 712 In determining whether or not a holder is a US resident , a bidder must look through the record ownership of securities held by brokers , dealers , banks and other nominees located in the US , the target company 's jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction that is the primary trading market of the target securities. 713 The calculation is made 30 days before the date of commencement of the tender offer. 714 However , the calculation excludes securities held by persons owning more than 10% of the class of securities sought in the tender offer , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Equal treatment of US securities holders <p> The bidder must permit US securities holders to participate in the offer on terms at least as favourable as those offered to other holders. 716 Notwithstanding this requirement , certain exceptions are available in the case of exchange offers : <p> Blue Sky exemption : If the bidder offers securities registered under the Securities Act , the bidder need not extend the offer to holders in those US states that prohibit the offer ( after the bidder has a made a " good faith effort " to register or qualify the offer in that state ) , except that the bidder must offer the same cash alternative to holders in that state that it has offered to holders in any other state. 717 In addition , if the bidder offers securities exempt from registration under Securities Act Rule 802 ( discussed above ) , it need not extend the offer to holders in those US states that require registration , except that the bidder must offer the same cash alternative to holders in that state that it has offered to holders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US securities holders may be offered only cash as consideration for the tender offer , even if non-US securities holders are offered consideration consisting in whole or in part of securities of the bidder .

A non-US offeror also must file a consent to service of process on Form F-X. <h> ( e ) Limitation on investment companies <p> The issuer of the securities that is the subject of a Tier I tender offer may not be an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act that is registered or required to be registered under that Act ( other than a registered closed-end investment company ) . 724 <h> The Tier II exemption <h> ( i ) Relief granted <p> Tier II relief is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular : <p> All-holders rule ? loan notes and separate US and non-US offers : Tier II tender offers are exempt from the all-holders rule of 1934 Act Rule 14d-10 ( and the related 1934 Act Rule 13e-4(f) ( 8 ) for issuer self-tender offers ) in two ways . First , if a bidder offers loan notes solely to give sellers tax advantages not available in the US , and these notes are neither listed on an organized securities market nor registered under the Securities Act , the loan notes need not be offered to US securities holders. 725 Second , a bidder may split its offer into two separate offers , one made to US securities holders and one made to non-US securities holders. 726 The offer to US securities holders must be on terms at least as favourable as those offered to any other holders of the target securities. 727 <p> Notice of extensions : 728 Notice of extensions of the length of a tender offer made in accordance with home jurisdiction law or practice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 14e-1(d) ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given ) . <p> Prompt payment : 729 Payments made in accordance with home jurisdiction law or practice will be deemed to satisfy the prompt payment requirements of Rule 14e-1(c) ( which specifies the manner in which notice of extensions must be given ) . <p> Subsequent offering period ; withdrawal rights : 730 A bidder will be deemed to satisfy the announcement and prompt payment requirements of Rule 14d-11(d) , if the bidder announces the results of the tender offer and pays for the tendered securities in accordance with the requirements of home jurisdiction law or practice and the subsequent offering period commences immediately following that announcement . Notwithstanding Section 14(d) ( 5 ) , the bidder need not extend withdrawal rights following the close of the offer and before the commencement of the subsequent offering period . <p> In addition , the SEC has announced an interpretation regarding waivers or reductions of the minimum conditions for Tier II tender offers ( although this is not codified within the Tier II exemption itself ) .

See , for example , Schreiber v Burlington Northern Inc , 472 US 1 , 9-10 ( 1985 ) ( Section 14(e) was modelled on Rule 10b-5 ) . <p> Rule 14d-1(d) ( 1 ) ( i ) ; Rule 13e-4(i) ( 1 ) ( i ) . Although the Rules and the Cross-Border Adopting Release do not state this explicitly , it appears that US and non-US bidders may rely on Tier II . See , for example , Rule 14d-1(d) ( any person meeting Tier II conditions is entitled to Tier II relief ) .

@@8538435 @1738435/ <h> How binding is a binding commitment ? <h> Author : Published : 7 Jan 2003 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> This article will deal with an emerging legal issue associated with private equity funds such as venture capital and leveraged buyout funds . The issue relates to what extent an investor is bound to its commitment to invest in such funds under various conditions . Both current agreement practice as well as general principles of contract law will be reviewed . <p> In this article , the investor 's position will at times be compared to that of a lender . This does not mean that the authors feel that the investment agreement should necessarily emulate loan agreements on the right of commitment cancellation . However , the general principles developed in loan agreements might be useful when comparing investment agreements and their relative lack of cancellation clauses . The observations are limited to Finnish law , but certain issues and solutions herein may have applications elsewhere . <p> The basic structure in a lender 's commitment to the borrower and in an investor 's commitment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used for agreed purposes in the future . In both cases , it is possible that once the commitment is made grounds may arise on which the committed entity is obligated or would prefer to withdraw from its commitment . One alternative is the ability to sell the partnership interest . This would only be possible with the manager 's consent and would perhaps not release the investor from its commitment to make further capital contributions . <p> Investor 's investment commitments to private equity funds are normally unconditional and irrevocable . The partnership agreements generally do not include terms or conditions that would allow the investor to cancel or reduce his commitment during the term of the fund . <p> On the other hand , committed loan facilities include numerous covenants and other conditions , which may trigger the lender 's right to cancel his commitment . Material adverse change clauses , in their broadest of terms , protect lenders from any unexpected event impacting on a borrower 's business . <p> Loan agreements have evolved over a long time period to their current comprehensive state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have had strong bargaining power in dictating terms and conditions to prospective borrowers . Taken together , both conditions have resulted in a variety of terms and conditions in loan agreements that allow lenders to withdraw from future disbursements under various sets of circumstances . <p> The private equity industry is much younger , and the evolution of similarly complex and more exacting agreement language has at least not yet occurred . Few disputes have been adjudicated in court , and as a result , case law is rather limited . Furthermore , potential investors have evaluated their possible participation in funds more on the basis of fund manager evaluation and performance than on the terms and conditions of the agreements . <p> Another reason for the lack of language dealing with the termination of commitment is the assumed alignment of interests of the parties . All hope to realize and benefit from future investment gains . This alignment of interest is a fundamental feature of private equity funds . However , due to the large management fees in big funds and possible fee income from the portfolio companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compelling in some cases . <p> Furthermore , it is often in the interest of the individual investors that other investors be compelled to fulfill their obligations to make further capital contributions . Therefore , current partnership agreements often include very severe sanctions , the enforceability of which may even be questionable , against defaulting limited partners . ( The agreements do , however , allow investors not to participate in individual investments , when changed legislation or regulations prevent the investor from investing . In this case the other investors have to cover any resulting shortfall . ) <p> During any long investment period , the manager 's and investors ' interests and opinions may come into conflict . The reasons can be caused for a variety of reasons such as fundamental changes in the market situation , different opinions with respect to future expectations or simply lack of confidence in the investment skills of the manager . In some cases , agreement language may address some of these changes in conditions . <p> The private equity investor 's choice of a certain fund is usually based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , Key Man Clauses have been developed so that an essential manager is committed to use his primary working capacity in the fund in question or in other permitted prior or future funds . This commitment can be made for the commitment period or for the term of the fund and if violated , the investors may suspend additional investments or even change the general partner or terminate the fund . <p> Considering the strong emphasis on track record and skills of certain managers at the time when the commitment is made , it may seem somewhat peculiar that there are no consequences from the loss of confidence in the manager during the term of the fund addressed in a typical current investment agreement . Clauses enabling the removal of the general partner require cause : breach of the agreement , negligence or criminal act . A mere loss of confidence or a failure to display adequate investment skills is not sufficient for the applicability of these clauses . <p> In sharp contrast to the unconditional always-binding commitment is the so-called no fault divorce clause , which has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gives the qualified majority of investors the right , at its discretion , to suspend investments , change the general partner or even terminate the fund . The voting thresholds , however , are high and calculated on the basis of a number of limited partners or the amount of their commitments . <p> Despite its apparent sweeping language , it has sometimes been argued that the exercise of the no fault divorce-clause nevertheless requires cause . It has been argued by some that the inclusion of the clause would only be helpful when there is not total certainty whether the requirements in with-cause-clauses are met and whether the evidence is sufficient . <p> In the opinion of the authors , this argument is flawed . We believe that a qualified majority has the ability to exercise this right if it so wishes . The right is exercisable - if the language is so written - " for any reason whatsoever or without any reason " , as one columnist noted when making fun of the Anglo-Saxon way of drafting agreements . Even change of mind is adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-fault divorce clause has resulted in a debate for and against unconditional and in all circumstances binding commitments to invest . <p> It is argued by some that the general partner must be able to plan its resources for the long term and to attract skillful personnel . This might not be possible if the continuation of the arrangement would be constantly at risk . The possible premature termination of the fund would affect the investor appeal of future funds , which also would have an impact on the motivation and commitment of key personnel . Furthermore , the decrease in the amount of total commitment would directly affect the management fee , but without a corresponding decrease in fixed expenses . <p> The service role of the fund managers may not , however , be considered that different from other service providers and so the arguments for exceptionally long and unconditional investor commitment may not be completely convincing . <p> When compared to a lender-borrower relationship , the investor-fund manager relationship is somewhat different . In a lending situation , full financing as originally planned is often a requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to capital contribution commitments , investments are usually self-contained and mutually exclusive and do not depend on the outcome of one another . <p> When entering into an agreement , the parties have expectations that certain preconditions will remain valid or be fulfilled during the term of the agreement . These preconditions are not specific terms or conditions set out explicitly in the agreement but are more essential circumstances which one party has deemed to be necessary to be able to enter into the agreement . <p> For example , when an investor makes his investment decision , he has certain expectations about the future development of the industry or market relating to the investment strategy of the fund . If materially adverse market conditions then occur , then the investor may deem that his precondition for the investment has failed or has ceased to exist . According to Finnish law , under certain circumstances a material failure of a precondition may give a party the right to request a subsequent adjustment of his obligation under the agreement . Such a right is always subject to the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a precondition already at the time when the agreement was executed <p> Under certain provisions of Finnish Contract Act , it could also be argued that materially-altered market changes might enable the investor to have the right to request adjustment of the extent of his commitment . However , in the kind of multi-party arrangement among professional entities such as between investors and fund managers , it is very unlikely that unconditional clauses could be set aside based on these provisions . The controlling idea is always that the investor , being a sophisticated entity , should have anticipated the possibility of unexpected downturns in the market and must accept the risk that results from such downturns , unless specifically otherwise agreed . <p> Considering the long term nature of many funds , the importance of investors ' trust in the managers and need for a stable partnership arrangement to fulfill investment goals , it is surprising that wider variations in practice have not occurred between the two basic alternatives : the unconditionally binding commitment on the one hand ; and the availability of the termination clause without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in reducing their commitments in private equity funds due to shared interests with fund managers to do so when fund performance is poor or prerequisites for successful investments do not exist . This occurs as a result of the parties shared commercial interest , and not as a result of any legal argument , which in and by itself does not support investors ' wish to reduce their commitments . <p> The past practices and experiences of the parties have , however , raised the question whether their agreements should be amended so that they would better address the investors ' often justified need to reconsider the size of their commitment and thus the size of the whole fund under certain conditions . As discussed briefly above , some inference and possible partial remedies to this issue might be derived from conditions found in typical loan agreements that protect lenders ' interests under committed facilities .

The proposed changes were that for the listed company disposing of all or substantially all of its assets resulting in a privatisation , approval must be obtained by the following : <p> ( i ) at least 75% of shareholders present and voting in terms of value ( 75% value threshold ) ; <p> ( ii ) more than 50% in number of shareholders present and voting ( 50% number threshold ) ; and <p> ( iii ) not more than 10% of the shareholders present and voting in terms of value objecting to the asset disposal ( 10% dissenting threshold ) . <p> A listed company in Malaysia may be privatised in several ways . Privatisation under the Malaysian Code on Take-Overs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of the voting shares of the company ( excluding shares already owned by the offeror or persons connected with the offeror ) before the buyer can enforce minority squeeze-out rights and privatise the company . <p> A scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 1965 requires the approval of a majority in number and at least 75% in value of the company 's shareholders present and voting at general meeting . Privatisation through an asset disposal , however , requires only a simple majority of those shareholders present and voting at a company 's general meeting . <p> The issue which prompted the proposed changes to the exchange 's listing requirement lies with the disparity in the level of shareholder approvals required to implement these different methods of privatisations , in particular , the asset disposal route . Malaysian minority shareholder activist groups believed that by allowing a lower shareholder approval threshold for asset disposals , minority shareholders are being disenfranchised , as major shareholders of listed companies can effectively vote through a disposal of all or substantially all of the listed company 's assets . <p> These proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that the 75% value threshold may stifle M&amp;A activity in Malaysia . There has been much of this kind of activity since 2005 , with most large transactions being completed by way of asset disposal .

This kind of value creation would have been stifled if not for the ability of these transactions to proceed under the asset disposal route . <p> For each of the privatisation routes , such as a takeover pursuant to the Code or a scheme of arrangement or asset disposal , there are already legal provisions in place to ensure protection of both majority and minority shareholders .

There are many different modes of taking a listed company private , each with its own check and balance for the protection of all shareholders including minorities . It is inappropriate to apply the threshold from one mode , such as that for schemes of arrangement , to all other modes , in the interest of standardisation . <p> Furthermore , there is no oppression to the minority by allowing an asset disposal through a simple majority . Both majority and minority shareholders may gain from an asset disposal . If directors ( acting in their fiduciary capacities ) believe that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to dispose of its assets , both the majority and minority shareholders will vote for the disposal if they believe that the assets are being sold at the best possible price . Similarly , if a company simultaneously undergoes a capital reduction and repayment exercise allowing the shareholders to take cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no oppression of the minority interest . <p> On January 28 2011 , the Securities Commission and the exchange issued a public response paper stating that it was necessary to implement the 75% value threshold to ensure parity in the level of investor protection . The regulators decided not to implement the 50% number threshold and the 10% dissenting threshold on the basis that the objectives of the proposals could be adequately achieved with the 75% value threshold alone . These changes have recently been implemented , and whether or not such changes will have an adverse impact on M&amp;A activity in Malaysia remains to be seen .

An insolvency trustee that has been appointed in one member state can collect and sell assets in all the other member states , conduct proceedings and so on . <p> The revision of the 2001 Insolvency Regulation is almost agreed , but I do n't think that will have a significant impact on restructuring and insolvency throughout Europe . <p> While the new Insolvency Regulation applies across Europe , it does n't bring very significant changes and it does n't really repair the flaws of the present Insolvency Regulation . Furthermore , although the revised Insolvency Regulation introduces a regime for insolvent groups of companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they will be very effective . <h> What are your thoughts on increasing forum-shopping in restructurings , especially as the UK 's scheme of arrangement becomes more popular ? Has this forced jurisdictions to revise their own restructuring laws ? <p> Main insolvency proceedings must be opened at the centre of main interests ( Comi ) of the company . As far as forum shopping is concerned , two issues can be distinguished . There are some cases in which it is not very clear where the Comi is . It would be helpful if there were some rules that could give us some guidance here . The revision of the Insolvency Regulation tries to achieve that , but does n't do so very effectively . <h> " It is important that we learn to respect each other 's systems " <p> The other issue is the real Comi shift . This is when a company is domiciled in one country first and then moves to another country with the purpose of opening proceedings there . It can be doubted whether that is a desirable procedure . It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed at the last moment because the change of Comi entails that the insolvency laws of the new jurisdiction apply to the insolvency proceedings . Those who advocate Comi shifts say that by allowing them , the company will move to the member state with the best insolvency laws . However what is good for one stakeholder may not be good for another stakeholder . One can say at least that the possibility of Comi shifts will enable the stakeholders in charge ( for example those that have personal guarantees from the managing directors ) to move the Comi to the jurisdiction that is most favourable to them . The assertion that that jurisdiction is also best for the other creditors lacks convincing reasoning . <p> Furthermore an English court has determined that an English court determined that it had jurisdiction over a scheme of arrangement with respect to a company located in another member state . The crucial question is whether , under the Brussels Regulation , an English judgment sanctioning such a scheme of arrangement can be recognised in other European jurisdictions . That is to be decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this forced jurisdictions to revise their own restructuring laws ? <p> Many member states are improving their insolvency laws , but I am not certain that this is due to fears for Comi shifts to other jurisdictions . My own government does n't seem to care at all about that . <p> Rather it seems that improvements are being made because of reception of the American outlook on insolvency proceedings , which has a much stronger emphasis on rescue procedures than the traditional European proceedings . <h> What are some of the challenges remaining in completing European cross-border restructurings ? <p> The main challenge is that we do not have a good regime for trans-European rescue plans . It would be attractive if a plan involving a group of companies could be voted on in one set of proceedings and could be imposed on all creditors of the group by one court . There are several ways of doing that : one is to group all insolvency proceedings together under one court , and the other is to have a somewhat complicated scheme which is then to be dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grouping these companies together under one rescue plan . We need to introduce something similar in the European Union in order to remain competitive . <h> What are your priorities as president of Insol Europe in 2015 ? <p> It is important that we learn to respect each other 's systems . All systems have their strong points and flaws , and it is not productive to try to advertise one system as being the best . We have to look at what this diversity has to offer us . We should then try to find out where these laws can be made to converge so that unnecessary differences can be reduced . <h> How does Insol Europe work with Insol globally as well as restructuring and turnaround organisations in Europe ? <p> We do work with Insol International , although they have a different focus . <p> We are interested in both having good connections with the insolvency practitioners and lawyers on the national level , as well as getting those lawyers involved in our projects and conferences .

@@8538440 @1738440/ <h> South Korea : Lessons from Kumho <h> Author : Published : 14 Jun 2010 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> At the end of December 2009 , Kumho Asiana Group , South Korea 's eighth largest conglomerate finally announced that it agreed to put two of its main companies , Kumho Industrial and Kumho Tire , under creditor-led debt restructuring ( or workout program ) . The group owed a total of KRW15.7 trillion ( $14 billion ) to financial institutions . <p> It was expected that , for each of Kumho Industrial and Kumho Tire , there would be a debt-to-equity swap . Further , restructuring plans of two other companies of the group , Kumho Petrochemical and Asiana Airlines , were also discussed among the creditors . Kumho Petrochemical was hoping to raise about KRW265.3 billion by disposing of power plant equipment and treasury shares and Asiana Airlines planned to sell its software developer , Asiana IDT , and its other assets . Although the group tried to sell two of its companies , Daewoo Engineering and Construction ( Daewoo E&amp;C ) and Kumho Life Insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its major creditor , Korea Development Bank ( KDB ) , would purchase the two companies . <p> The major companies of the group are Kumho Petrochemical , Kumho Tire , Kumho Industrial , Asiana Airlines , Daewoo E&amp;C and Korea Express and their equity structure is as follows can be seen below . <p> Kumho Asiana Group , which was founded in 1946 with tires and petrochemicals as its main products , is owned by main shareholder Park Sam Gu and his family . Park , who is the third son of the group 's founder , stepped down in July 2009 to take responsibility for the group 's trouble but is believed to be still active in management behind the scenes . <p> At the request of creditor financial institutions , he and his family members have put up their personal wealth as collateral , including a 47% stake in Kumho Petrochemical and their 8% stake in Kumho Industrial , for the restructuring of the group . Those companies which will be subject to the workout program are Kumho Industrial , Kumho Tire , Kumho Petrochemical and Asiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consent from the labour union of each applicable debtor company as a condition for providing financial assistance . <p> In return for such provision of collateral , Park and his family members were able to retain their management of Kumho Petrochemical and Kumho Tire whilst the creditors would have control over Kumho Industrial which controls Asiana Airlines and Korea Express . It was agreed that 12.7% of Kumho Petrochemical 's shareholding ( out of the existing 26.8% shareholding ) in Asiana Airlines will be transferred to Kumho Industrial . Thus , it is possible that both Asiana Airlines and Korea Express may be sold in the market later . <p> On the other hand , it was confirmed that Kumho Life Insurance would be sold to a private equity fund set up by KDB and Consus Asset Management for KRW90 billion . However , it was further agreed that Kumho Asiana Group would re-invest KRW60 billion ( out of the sales proceeds of KRW90 billion ) into such a private equity fund . Therefore , in substance , only KRW30 billion will become available for use by the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was initially facing a major stumbling block , which involved a challenge raised by a disgruntled financial investor ( with a put back option ) , it was reported that such issue is now amicably resolved and the sale process is moving along . <h> Long journey ahead <p> The current arrangement merely reflects various discussions and following consensus on the basic principles to be adopted for the restructuring of Kumho Asiana Group , which are still subject to many conditions ( including a positive outcome of the due diligence on Kumho Industrial , Kumho Tire , Kumho Petrochemical and Asiana Airlines ) . <p> There are many challenges ahead before the current arrangement can be actually implemented . For instance , it would be necessary to wait for the result of the evaluation of Daewoo E&amp;C , which must be sufficient to cover the proposed sale price . While the strong opposition from the labour union of Kumho Tire and discord among its temporary workers appeared to be another stumbling block to the implementation of the current management , such labour-related issues have recently come under control . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial stabilisation of the other main companies , Kumho Industrial , Kumho Tire , Kumho Petrochemical and Asiana Airlines , the recent settlement of labour-related issues of Kumho Tire is a welcome development in terms of the sale process and outcome . <p> While support of those creditors who are not participating in the workout program is sought by KDB and other participating financial institutions , it is very difficult to obtain such support from those ' non-participating ' creditors because there is no legal obligation for them to do so . <p> Thus , despite all plans being laid out , it will be a long journey ahead for Kumho Asiana Group , its creditors and other related parties . <h> What went wrong ? <p> Kumho Asiana Group is the latest example of a Korean group experiencing difficulties due to over-ambitious acquisitions . Problems emerged after the acquisition of Daewoo E&amp;C for KRW6.6 trillion in 2006 and of Korea Express , the logistics group , in 2008 for KRW4.1 trillion . Through a series of high-profile acquisitions , Kumho became the country 's eighth biggest conglomerate ( from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finance to construction and airlines . <p> Kumho Asiana Group 's highly-leveraged buying spree started to look increasingly over-ambitious as the global economic slowdown hit the South Korean economy . The group 's troubles have deepened in 2009 and the group was faced with a possible KRW4.2 trillion Won cash call by creditors related to the Daewoo E&amp;C acquisition . <p> Kumho Asiana Group borrowed about KRW3.5 trillion from financial investors to finance the original Daewoo E&amp;C deal . It also signed an option contract with financial investors to buy back their holdings in Daewoo E&amp;C in 2009 at a pre-agreed share price ( if the share price of Daewoo E&amp;C does not exceed a certain threshold price by a certain date ) , which is approximately 20% more than the price the group originally paid . Daewoo E&amp;C 's share price has plunged since the acquisition and financial investors were entitled to exercise their put option , increasing the financial burden , in particular , for Kumho Industrial to approximately KRW4.2 trillion exposure . <p> In February 2009 , Korea Express undertook a capital reduction that gave each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . This measure was obviously for the purpose of resuscitating those financially troubled group companies ( who are shareholders of Korea Express ) . <p> Daewoo E&amp;C was up for sale in June 2009 but the sale finally failed . In December 2009 , Kumho Asiana Group reached an agreement with KDB-led private equity fund to sell its stake in Daewoo E&amp;C as a part of overall restructuring of the group . <h> Judicial insolvency proceedings <p> In Korea the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act ( DRBA ) provides for two types of insolvency proceedings administered by the court : the rehabilitation proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding . The rehabilitation proceeding under the DRBA is basically similar to US Chapter 11 proceeding . <p> A rehabilitation proceeding with respect to a company under the DRBA may be initiated either voluntarily by the debtor company or involuntarily by certain creditors and shareholders . If the conditions for rehabilitation under the DRBA are satisfied , the court will formally approve the commencement of the proceeding . Then , the court will appoint a receiver , who has the power to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the debtor 's assets , subject to court supervision . The DRBA provides that in principle , the representative of the debtor company , not a third party , will be elected as a receiver in the absence of certain negative factors . <p> The receiver should submit a list containing creditors and their claim and shareholders and their shares . Creditors and shareholders may raise objections to the list and file their claims with the court . Any disputes with respect to the claims of creditors and shareholders will be finally settled by the court . <p> Also , upon commencement of the proceeding , the court will appoint an inspection commissioner to evaluate the viability of the debtor company ( whether the debtor company 's going concern value is higher than its liquidation value ) . <p> In most cases , the receiver prepares and presents the plan of rehabilitation to the court . The rehabilitation plan may alter or modify the rights of creditors or shareholders . Upon confirmation of the rehabilitation plan , the debtor will be generally discharged from all liability in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than those provided in the rehabilitation plan . <p> The shareholders are not entitled to vote unless the debtor company 's total assets exceed its total liabilities when the Proceeding commences . In most cases , the shareholders have no voting rights and their rights are significantly diluted . <p> The rehabilitation plan is implemented by the receiver under the supervision of the court . Only after the court is satisfied that the rehabilitation plan can be implemented without difficulty , the rehabilitation procedure may be terminated . Recently , however , the court is active in promoting M&amp;As of the debtor companies as early as possible . <h> Workout programme <p> During the financial crisis started in 1997 , Korean financial institutions entered into an accord for voluntary workouts of financially troubled companies . The Workout Accord was later codified in the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act ( CRPA ) . The CPRA was originally enacted in 2001 and effective until 2005 ) and was re-introduced in 2007 to be effective until 2010 . <p> The CRPA is only applicable to a company where credit extension has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . For companies that are not covered by the CRPA , financial institutions have prepared various workout agreements which are similar to the CRPA . Non-CRPA companies may join a workout program under such workout agreements . <p> In the event that a debtor company applies for a workout program under the CRPA , in most cases , the financial institutions that are subject to the CRPA and have extended credit to the debtor company , constitute a Commission . The workout program for the debtor company is decided and administered by the Commission . The Commission may appoint a cash manager for the debtor company and request that the debtor company should obtain the cash manager 's approval for all of its major business activities . <p> Upon application for a workout program under the CRPA , the financial institutions are required to stop exercising their rights against the debtor company . Then , the Commission enters into a restructuring agreement with the debtor company . The restructuring agreement will provide how the debtor company will recover its financial difficulties ( the restructuring plan ) and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit restructuring ) . The credit restructuring may include debt-equity swap . The restructuring agreement may provide for infusion of new credit . The newly infused fund will be given a status of priority which ranks immediately below the security interest held by the secured creditors ( but ranks higher than the claims of the unsecured creditors ) . <p> The Commission may decide on many issues ( including whether to commence the workout program or whether to approve the restructuring plan and/or the credit restructuring ) by an affirmative vote of at least 75% of the aggregate amount of the credit extension made by the creditor financial institutions to such debtor company . <p> For any credit restructuring , in addition , an additional affirmative vote of 75% of the secured creditors is required . <p> In the case of a workout program under the CRPA or the workout agreement , the existing shareholding ratio may be changed if the company agrees to do so at the request of creditors ( debt-to-equity swap is an example ) . <h> Kumho Asiana Group 's path <p> Kumho Industrial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to workout programs . Although it was possible for all of these companies to be subject to CRPA , the creditors of Kumho Asiana Group have decided to put only Kumho Industrial and Kumho Tire into a workout program to be governed by the CRPA . <p> For Kumho Industrial , it is subject to a workout program under the CRPA which involved : ( i ) a debt-to-equity swap of KRW2.5 trillion by the end of March 2010 ( which substantially reduced the existing shareholders ' control ) and ( ii ) a standstill of the remaining debt until December 2014 . Further , Kumho Industrial 's existing shareholders were not given the opportunity to buy back those shares of the creditors at a later date . <p> For Kumho Tire , it is also subject to a workout program under the CRPA and a debt-to-equity swap is planned by its creditors . However , unlike Kumho Industrial , the group was given the opportunity to buy back those shares of the creditors at a later date . With most of the labour-related issues now settled , a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumho Petrochemical , its restructuring is based on a workout program pursuant to the workout agreement and it was agreed that rigorous self-rescue efforts ( including disposal of various assets ) will be implemented . Thus , in the event the restructuring becomes successful , it would be possible for the existing shareholders of Kumho Petrochemical to maintain control . <p> For Asiana Airlines and Korea Express , they are effectively under the control of the creditors ( through a debt-to-equity swap at Kumho Industrial 's level ) . Like Kumho Petrochemical , Asiana Airlines will be placed in a workout program under the workout agreement while its equity structure is not likely to change . On the other hand , Korea Express will not be subject to a workout program . Creditor financial institutions will later decide the fate of these two companies . <p> For Daewoo E&amp;C , it is scheduled to be sold to a KDB-led private equity fund . <h> Kumho Asiana Group 's perspective <p> Kumho Asiana Group has put a great deal of effort to ensure that it stays out of rehabilitation proceedings under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debtor company and , to the extent possible , maintain control over its companies through continuous and elongated discussions and negotiations with the creditors for workout programs . <p> Further , in the case of a workout program , it is possible for existing guarantee obligations to become extinguished if all underlying loans and other debts are paid off pursuant to a workout program . On the other hand , the guarantee obligations continue to remain unchanged in a rehabilitation proceeding pursuant to the DRBA . Thus , if there are many intercompany guarantees within Kumho Asiana Group , it would be more advantageous to go through a workout program . <h> Creditors ' perspective <p> There are certain advantages and disadvantages for the creditors to implement a workout program . <p> It was better for the creditors to adopt a workout program pursuant to the CRPA or the workout agreement to avoid any formal bankruptcy proceeding so that the going concern value of Kumho Asiana Group 's companies would be maintained and preserved . <p> The restructuring can be implemented more swiftly in a shorter period time under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while the creditors would be able to monitor the debtor companies . From a practical perspective , it takes a long time for the creditors to be paid out of a rehabilitation proceeding . <p> Since there is no obligation to file a report or disclose the information on the nature of the debt restructuring by the creditors in the case of a workout program , the creditors would be able to deal with matters more flexibly and proactively . <p> However , if there is a dispute which eventually leads to a deadlock situation among the creditors , it is more difficult to come to a reasonable and amicable solution and bind such parties in dispute . It is difficult to implement a conflict resolution mechanism in a workout program ( pursuant to the CRPA or the workout agreement ) that would be binding on all parties because such workout program is basically a private contractual arrangement for the purpose of restructuring ( as opposed to a rehabilitation proceeding under the DRBA which is administered by the court ) . <p> For these reasons , before agreeing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain : ( i ) a pledge over those shares held by the majority shareholders and ( ii ) the prior consent of the labour union(s) . <p> Lastly , the risks and costs to be borne by the creditors participating in a workout program would certainly higher in comparison with those who are not participating . It would be possible to ask them to ultimately participate in a workout program by highlighting the fact that both participating and non-participating creditors would have much to lose ( in terms of recovery of debts ) if a workout program fails and later the case becomes subject to a rehabilitation proceeding . <h> Moving forward <p> In practice , it is very difficult to resolve outstanding issues when there are a great number of creditors with different exposure against different debtor companies within a big business group . For example , after the creditors of Kumho Industrial became its controlling shareholders through a debt-to-equity swap , they were also able to control each of Daewoo E&amp;C , Asiana Airlines and Korea Express simultaneously whereas those creditors of Asiana Airlines would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repayment of debt ) against the assets of Asiana Airlines only . <p> Therefore , it is critical to achieve a balance of interest among the creditors ( or at least among major creditors ) after the result of the valuations , through proper due diligence , of debtor companies become available . However , it appears to be premature to predict the outcome of such balance at the current stage of Kumho Asiana Group 's restructuring . <p> In any case , as long as the situation clearly indicates that it would be more advantageous to go through a workout program , the creditors would continue to adopt and implement the workout program for Kumho Asiana Group . <p> About the author <p> Eunjai Lee joined Lee &amp; Ko in 1995 .

@@8538443 @1738443/ <h> United States : Reverse break-up fees are n't working <h> Author : Published : 1 Jul 2008 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> It has become increasingly common for purchasers of companies to insist that acquisition agreements include so-called reverse break-up provisions , particularly if the purchasers are private equity groups . The provisions in theory give the purchaser the right to walk away from an acquisition agreement by paying the seller a specified sum , and until recently they went relatively unnoticed . <p> As the credit crisis hit the US and purchasers began to have difficulty obtaining the financing to complete transactions , or began to view the prices to which they had agreed as being too high , reverse break-up provisions became a critical part of their efforts to terminate transactions . But the reverse break-up provisions did not work as had been contemplated . Instead , they led to several highly-publicised and hotly-contested litigations . The explanation lies both in the concept of reverse break-up provisions and in the way they were drafted . <p> Break-up fees <p> In many respects , the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee provisions , which for years have been inserted in US agreements on the sale of publicly-traded corporations . <p> Fiduciary out/break-up fee provisions were a response to Delaware court decisions that said if a company is put up for sale , its board of directors must obtain the terms most favourable to the corporation 's stockholders . This doctrine is not a problem if the sale agreement is the product of an actively-conducted auction process , but it is if the sale follows an approach by a single potential purchaser ? the board of directors of the company being sold can not be sure when it approves the sale that somebody else would not pay a higher price . <p> The problem becomes acute if another potential buyer does offer a higher price . If that occurs , it indicates that the board of the company being sold probably did not fulfil its fiduciary obligation to obtain the terms most favourable to stockholders . Further , in most instances , the stockholders have to approve a sale of a publicly-traded corporation , and they are not likely to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The solution if a higher bidder comes along after a sale contract has been signed was to include in the contract a provision giving the board of the company being sold the right to terminate the sale contract and to accept the better proposal but to do that the company must make a payment ( the break-up fee ) to the original purchaser . The Delaware courts accepted this concept , but made it clear that the break-up fee could not be so high that it would make it too difficult for there to be a superior bid ? a higher bid will be superior only if it is greater than the amount the original purchaser agreed to pay plus the amount that must be paid to terminate the original contract . Courts have usually accepted break-up fees of between 2% and 3% . They have sometimes permitted fees and expense reimbursement totalling as much as 5% of the sale price . <p> No funding <p> As sellers ' termination right and break-up fee provisions became standard in US agreements for sales of publicly-traded companies , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by investment professionals , would want a similar ability to terminate acquisition agreements on the payment of reasonable sums . But reverse break-up fees did not emerge to enable purchasers to terminate contracts . Instead , what are now referred to as reverse break-up fees arose when sellers began to insist that private equity firms ensure the ability of the acquiring companies they form to respond in damages if they breach their contracts . <p> In a typical private equity purchase , the equity portion of the purchase price comes from a fund managed by the private equity firm . The private equity firm forms an acquisition company that enters into the acquisition agreement . When the acquisition takes place , the fund provides the acquisition company with the money it needs to complete the purchase . However , until an acquisition company is funded , which usually does n't happen until the day the transaction is completed , it has no assets . So if it breaches the acquisition agreement by refusing to complete the transaction , the seller may be awarded a judgment against the acquisition company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum awarded . <p> Walking away <p> Sellers became increasingly conscious that they had no effective remedy here . They began to insist that the private equity firm , or one or more of its funds , guarantee to provide the money that the acquisition company would need to satisfy a judgment for breach of the acquisition agreement . <p> A number of private equity firms were willing to agree to provide money with which acquisition companies could satisfy breach-of-contract judgments , but insisted that the amounts to which they were exposed be limited . That seemed to give the acquisition company the option to walk away from the acquisition agreement if its private equity firm sponsor was willing to pay the specified maximum damages for breach of contract . In other words , it was viewed as making the maximum damage amount into a buyer 's break-up fee ( that is , a reverse break-up fee ) . <p> Not surprisingly , private equity buyers insisted that the maximum damages be similar to the amount the sellers would have to pay if the board of the company being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agreements including seller termination rights and limitations on the damages the acquisition company and its sponsors could be required to pay seemed to give both the seller and the purchaser the option to walk away from the transaction on payment of a fee . <p> But a provision limiting damages is not the same as an option to terminate a contract . The difference became critically apparent in three recent situations in which private equity firms walked away from agreements to make major acquisitions . <p> The first involved the failure of JC Flowers to complete a $26 billion acquisition of SLM Corporation , better known as Sallie Mae . The acquisition agreement limited Flowers ' damages for failure to complete to $900 million . But instead of paying the $900 million when it terminated the agreement , Flowers argued that an event had had a material adverse effect on Sallie Mae , so Flowers was not obliged to complete the deal . Flowers said it was not breaching the contract and was not obliged to pay the $900 million or any other sum as damages . <p> Flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bargained-for exception that limited the definition of what constituted a material adverse effect . Flowers had nothing to lose by arguing that it was not required to complete the deal . If it won , it would not have to pay anything . If it lost , its damages would be limited to the $900 million originally agreed . Eventually , Flowers paid a lesser amount and litigation over the failure to complete the transaction was settled . <p> The second situation involved the decision of a company formed by Cerberus Capital Management to terminate its agreement to purchase United Rentals for $7 billion . Section 8.2e of that agreement said that the right to terminate the agreement and to receive a $100 million parent termination fee was " the sole and exclusive remedy " of the company against the purchaser or any parties related to it . Section 8.2e went on : " In no event , whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any provision hereof , shall the purchaser or any persons related to it , either individually or in the aggregate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Termination Fee " . Finally : " In no event shall the Company seek equitable relief or seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from the purchaser or any persons related to it " . <p> The problem arose because another provision , Section 9.10 , said : " In addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity , " United Rentals " shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement ... or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Guarantee to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those covenants of the purchaser and its parent that require the purchaser or its parent ... to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement " . But Section 9.10 also said : " The provisions of this Section 9.10 shall be subject in all respects to Section 8.2e hereof the provision making the right to a $100 million Parent Termination Fee United Rentals ' sole and exclusive remedy , which Section shall govern the rights and obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> The Delaware Chancery Court thought the juxtaposition of Sections 8.2e and 9.10 was ambiguous about whether United Rentals could specifically enforce the contract ( that is , get a court order requiring Cerberus to complete the transaction ) . The Court resolved the issue in favour of the purchaser ( Cerberus ) , not because of the express words of the agreement , but because of a finding that during the negotiations the purchaser 's lawyer had made it clear that the purchaser thought the right to specific performance would be eliminated by paying $100 million and United Rentals did not disagree . <p> The drop-dead date <p> The third situation involved an agreement by a company formed by Blackstone Group to acquire Alliance Data Systems for $7.8 billion . The purchaser agreed to pay a $170 million business interruption fee if it breached the agreement . One of the investment funds Blackstone manages guaranteed the obligation to pay that fee and to provide the $1.8 billion of the purchase price that was expected to be an equity investment . Allegedly because of pressure from its banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide $6.6 billion of debt financing , Blackstone refused to agree to a requirement imposed by a governmental agency as a condition for necessary approval of the deal , even though Alliance suggested several ways by which its shareholders would bear what Alliance claimed was the full cost of complying . <p> Blackstone did not have the right to end the agreement because the governmental approval was not obtained , but either party could terminate it if the transaction was not completed by a specified date , referred to in the US as the drop-dead date . Because the transaction could not be completed without governmental approval , and that approval was not forthcoming without Blackstone 's agreement , the transaction was not completed by the drop-dead date . Blackstone terminated the agreement the next day . Alliance sued , claiming Blackstone had breached the agreement by not fulfilling its contractual obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transaction and " to obtain any requisite approvals , " including the approval that was not obtained . <p> Simplest is best <p> The striking thing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse break-up arrangement had given the purchaser the option to terminate the acquisition agreement on payment of an option-exercise fee . <p> In the Sallie Mae situation , Flowers could have argued it was not required to complete the transaction or could have exercised the termination option . But it could not have had its cake and eaten it . Flowers would either have had to pay the option-exercise fee , or rely on its argument that a condition to its obligation had not been fulfilled ? and be faced with unlimited potential damages . <p> In the Cerberus case , United Rentals could not have argued that it could obtain specific enforcement of the contract . If Cerberus had exercised a termination option and paid a $100 million fee , the contract would have been over . Nothing would have been available to be specifically enforced . <p> In the Blackstone situation , as in the Flowers situation , Blackstone would have had to choose between exercising the termination option and paying the $170 million fee , or arguing that it had the right to terminate the agreement after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obtained , but it would have faced unlimited damages if it lost . <p> The business logic of a buyer , and particularly a private equity firm buyer wishing to limit its exposure if it does not complete an acquisition is not unreasonable . However , if a buyer wants an option to terminate an agreement on paying a specified amount , it should insert that termination option in the agreement . The three situations described above show that using a limitation-on-damages for breaching a contract as a termination option does not work . <p> Sometimes the direct and simple way of doing business is the best way . <p> By David Bernstein of Clifford Chance <p> To download a full copy of IFLR 's Private equity and venture capital review , please click here

@@8538446 @1738446/ <h> Using declarations of trust <h> Author : Published : 1 Dec 2008 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> Since the enactment of the amended Trust Law ( New Trust Law ) in September 2007 , the use of a business trust ( meaning a whole property that is organised for certain business purposes and functions as an organic unity , which could include both assets and liabilities arising from the business , notwithstanding that the trust law generally prohibits the entrustment of negative property ) has drawn attention and references have been made in articles concerning the New Trust Law . A business trust would be quite useful if used in conjunction with declaration of trust ( as a trust declaration as a declaration of trust , even if done repeatedly , can not be said to be undertaken as a business , it is considered that a declaration of trust does not fall under the definition of trust business , and registration will not be required , except when more than 50 persons can obtain beneficial interest ) . Previously , if an operating company ( a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise funds by securitising the profitability of a specific business division , it needed to undertake measures such as a corporate split or business transfer . However , by using a business trust and declaration of trust , a company can raise funds by creating a declaration of trust with its relevant business division and selling beneficial interests to investors while continuing direct management of the business division , thus avoiding employee issues , concerns over disclosure of confidential information and the costs of a spin-off or business transfer . <p> The declaration of trust system commenced on September 30 2008 , enabling the use of a scheme that combines a business trust with declaration of trust . However , because the system is new , it is not entirely clear what kind of scheme will actually be possible . It is expected that if a model that sufficiently covers matters such as protection of creditors , safety of transactions and protection of beneficiaries can be developed upon further discussion in working groups we will see such a business trust/declaration of trust structure in the near future . <h> Matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( use as a vehicle to raise funds ) . <p> Use in place of tracking stock ( a stock the value of which is linked only to the achievements of specified wholly-owned subsidiaries or business operation sections , among others , owned by the company ) . <p> Use in business collaboration . <p> Use in limited period M&amp;A for the restructuring of an existing business . <p> Use in commencing a new business ( especially high-risk business ) . <p> Use as the means for a hostile takeover , going private or management buyout . <p> Avoidance of servicer risk . <p> Use for succession of a business in the civil trust field . <h> Advantages <p> Transfer of business contracts and creditor-debtor relationships are not required . <p> Succession of employment relationship is not required . <p> Decline in business value due from separation of the business from a company will be small ( the credit of the company can be used and confidentiality of know-how maintained ) . <p> There is a restriction on the amount that can be distributed when issuing class shares for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan distribution of dividends for beneficial interests more flexibly , provided ( in the case of a trust with limited liability ) the distributable amount is limited to protect creditors ( Article 225 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Protection of the interests of investors can be achieved through the rights of beneficiaries to supervise the trustee ( rights to inspect accounting books , demand indemnification of losses from an illegal act or rescind any act exceeding trustee authority , for example ) . <p> A trust business licence is not required because declaration of trust does not fall under the definition of trust business . <p> New approval or licence is not required . <h> Disadvantages <p> If 50 or more beneficiaries are envisioned , even in the case of a declaration of trust the trustor-cum-trustee must be registered every three years pursuant to the Trust Business Law and , in principle , regulations similar to those applicable to trust companies will be applied . Depending on whether the financial condition is sound , restrictions on dual business could apply ( Article 50-2 of the Trust Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Trust Business Law ) . <p> Provisions on business transfer under the Company Law , among others , will apply to the creation of declaration of trust ( Article 266.2 of the Trust Law ) . Therefore , if a declaration of trust is created on all or any material part of a business , a special resolution of the general meeting of shareholders will be required , as in the case for a transfer of business to a third person . <p> Another beneficiary is necessary . <p> Article 163(2) of the Trust Law provides that a trust will terminate when a trustee has held all the beneficial interests in its account continuously for one year . Therefore , another beneficiary holding at least part of the beneficial interest is required . <h> Whether to use limited liability trusts <p> A limited liability trust means " a trust in which the trustee shall be liable for the performance of obligations only to the extent of the trust property " ( Article 2.12 of the Trust Law ) , allowing a limited liability trust to remove unlimited responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indicated in the case of a high-risk venture , in other cases the credibility of the company itself may be needed to ensure favourable pricing on beneficial interest sales . <p> From the perspective of protecting creditors , it will become necessary to stipulate certain matters at the time of creation of a limited liability trust ( Article 216 of the Trust Law ) and also to register the fact that it is a limited liability trust ( Articles 216 and 232 of the Trust Law ) . In addition , from the perspective of protecting creditors , the following provisions also apply . <p> Limitation on naming ( Article 218 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Obligation to express the fact that it is a limited liability trust ( Article 219 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Obligation to prepare and keep accounting books , among others , creditor right to demand inspection and copying of accounting books , among others ( Articles 222 and 223 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Trustee responsibility to third persons in the case of wilful misconduct and gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Restriction on distribution to beneficiaries ( Article 225 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Special exceptions in the case of liquidation ( Articles 229 to 231 of the Trust Law ) . <p> In administering the above obligations , the procedures connected with them ( including a possible limitation on the amount available for distribution ) may impose burdens that could have the effect of reducing the value of the limited liability trust vehicle . <h> Protection of trustor shareholders and general creditors <h> Protection of creditors <p> When using a declaration of trust , the trustor ( and the trustee ) would usually acquire the beneficial interest , sell it to a third person and receive the sale consideration into the trustor property . Therefore , the aggregate property of the trustor will not decrease and , in general , the trustor creditors will not be harmed by the creation of a declaration of trust . <p> Note that in the case of right of avoidance of fraudulent acts or under the Bankruptcy Law , though there is some argument regarding replacement of property with money ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a reasonable amount of consideration is obtained , the creditor will not be found to be harmed and the creation of a declaration of trust will not be subject to avoidance . <p> Alternatively , if no consideration is obtained through the declaration of trust , the protection of creditors ' provisions in the Trust Law could apply . <h> Provisions for prevention of abuse <p> In order to verify the function and effect of relevant provisions and harmonise the interests of trust creditors and beneficiaries with the protection of trustor shareholders and general creditors , it will be preferable to establish a new system , including the enactment of appropriate regulations , for matters not dealt with under the Trust Law , the Trust Business Law or other current laws . <h> Special regulations <p> Declaration of trust must be created by notarised deed or electronic record , in which the purpose of the trust , matters necessary to identifying trust property and certain other matters are described ( Article 3.3 of the Trust Law ) . A notarised deed will confirm the date of creation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document and prevent the trustor ( and the trustee ) from using a backdated declaration of trust to avoid being subject to execution by creditors . Which provisions to stipulate in the notarised deed must be considered . Because notarised deeds are not open to public view , a registration or record system for the declaration of trust to which third persons would have access may be a useful system to enhance the security of transactions . <h> Creation of a trust registration or record system <p> In order to assert against a third person that a property that needs to be registered or recorded to assert gaining/losing/changing a right to assert that such property belongs to trust property , the fact must be registered or recorded ( Article 14 of the Trust Law ) . In the case of declaration of trust , for properties for which a registration or record system exists ( real property , vehicles and vessels , among others ) , the fact that the property is trust property may not be asserted against third parties without a registration or record that the property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyrights also require registration ) . For movables and claims , the trust registration or record system under the Special Exception Law on Movables and Transfer of Claims has not been developed , and a registration under Article 14 of the Trust Law is not yet possible . <p> In order to use declaration of trust and a business trust as a means of raising funds , it is desirable to have a way of clarifying that the relevant property is trust property . For the protection of creditors , registration of trust for property where such method is available and , in a case where no registration is available , a degree of specificity must be ensured through separate management ( what constitutes separate management will need to be considered ) . <h> Restrictions on compulsory execution against trust property <p> If a trustor creates a trust knowing that it will harm a creditor who has a pre-existing claim , the creditor may immediately commence compulsory execution of the trust property in accordance with the title of obligation of its claim without filing an action for cancellation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , this may not apply in a case where beneficiaries , in whole or in part , did not know that a creditor would be harmed , and the trustor and/or beneficiaries who have an objection must file an action for third party objection in accordance with Article 23.5 of the Trust Law . The trustor , when making such an objection , will need to assert and prove that the assets are trust property , against which the creditor will need to prove fraud in the establishment of the trust and the trustor intent of fraud , and the trustee will need to prove the good faith of beneficiaries . <h> Protecting interests of employees and/or shareholders <p> A company that is trustor and trustee will be subject to the relevant provisions of the Company Law and other laws regarding a business transfer of a legal entity , so a declaration of trust structure will not be less protective of shareholders and employees . If a declaration of trust is established for all or a material part of a business , a special resolution by a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of trust registration system <p> In a case where 50 or more people may acquire a beneficiary interest in a declaration of trust , registration is required ( Article 50-2 of the Trust Business Law ) and restrictions under the Trust Business Law will apply ( Article 50-2.12 of the Trust Business Law ) . Matters such as specification of trust property by a qualified third person , an investigation of trust property prices and others will be required ( Article 50-2.10 of the Trust Business Law and Article 51-7 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Trust Business Law ) , although the details are not yet fixed . <h> Securing the independence of trust property upon bankruptcy of a trustee <p> Bankruptcy-remoteness of trust property will be desirable in a scheme that separates a specific business of a company from the other property of that company and implements fundraising and other activities focused on the specific business . For the use of declaration of trust and a business trust , it is essential to clarify the rules to specify trust property . <h> Specification of trust property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust upon creation of the trust ( Article 16 , Introductory Clause of the Trust Law ) . Therefore , it is necessary to examine the following matters upon establishment of a trust by a declaration of trust . <h> What should be indicated in a notarised deed <p> Whether inclusion in the declaration of trust of a claim that prohibits transfer is possible ( whether consent of the obligor is necessary for a declaration of trust ) . <p> In order to perfect against third persons , what specificity is needed for property without a registration or record system ( movables , money and claims ) . <h> Change of trust property by business activities <p> In the case of a business trust , the trust property may change daily from the initial trust property and increase or decrease as a result of the business activities of the trustee . It is necessary to consider the degree to which such property will become trust property . <h> Scope of trust property provisions <p> What degree of specificity is needed to assert against a third person that the property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record system ? <p> Which method is appropriate as a method of segregation of trust property ? Note that segregation under the Trust Law is a duty of a trustee and is different from requirements to perfect against a third person that a property is a trust property , but in order to assert against a third party ( a creditor or a bankruptcy administrator ) that the property is trust property , segregation or a specificity of trust property will be required . <p> Article 34 of the Trust Law deals with the duty of segregation as follows . Except for trust property that may be registered or recorded , it is possible to stipulate a different segregation method in creating the trust ( Article 34.1 , Proviso and Article 34.2 of the Trust Law ) . <p> Property of the trust that may be registered or recorded ( Article 34.1(1) of the Trust Law ) . <p> Registration and record of a trust . <p> Movable property other than money ( Article 34.1(2) ( a ) ) . <p> Maintaining objective segregation . <p> Money and property ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifying calculation . <p> Property for which indication and recordation of trust property is a requirement for assertion against a third party ( Article 34.1(3) of the Trust Law , Article 4 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Trust Law ) . <p> Method of clarification and a record or indication that the property belongs to a trust . <h> Succession of employment relationship <p> The dominant view is that succession of the employment relationship is possible without obtaining individual consent from employees as a general rule , which is an advantage of using declaration of trust . This is because the company establishing a declaration of trust for a specific business will continue to carry out that business as is and no impact on individual employment contracts will occur . That is , provided that employee consent may become necessary in certain situations where terms of employment may become disadvantageous for an employee ( such as a limited liability declaration of trust ) , where the stability of the position of the employee might arguably be reduced . This issue necessitates a case-by-case consideration . <p> The Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as a general rule ( Article 31.1 and Article 32.1 of the Trust Law ) . Adjustments of interests can be made by the application of general provisions , such as a duty of due care of a trustee under the Trust Law ( Article 29.2 of the Trust Law and Articles 50-2.12 and 28.2 of the Trust Business Law ) , a duty of loyalty ( Article 30 of the Trust Law and Articles 50-2.12 and 28.1 of the Trust Business Law ) , supervision by a beneficiary , such as filing for dismissal of a trustee ( Article 58.4 of the Trust Law ) , filing for the appointment of an inspector ( Article 46 of the Trust Law ) , a request for the inspection of books , balance sheets and income statements ( Article 38 of the Trust Law ) , directors ' duty of due care under the Company Law ( Article 330 of the Company Law and Article 644 of the Civil Code ) , a duty of loyalty ( Article 355 of the Company Law ) and a resolution of the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important assets ( Article 362.4(1) of the Company Law ) . For a declaration of trust , stipulation with respect to a certain range of matters that are envisaged to occur ( for example , matters pertaining to composition of officers , borrowing policies , management policies and a management plan for important assets ) at the time of creation of the trust ( the Trust Law stipulates this in some detail ) will be necessary . <h> Securing the continuity of a business upon insolvency of a trustee <p> For a spin-off , a switching of specific business by a company into a declaration of trust , it is necessary that the deterioration of other business activities of that company , and even its insolvency , does not affect the continuity of the spun-off declaration of trust business . <h> Task of a trustee upon bankruptcy <p> The task of the trustee will terminate ( Article 56.1(4) of the Trust Law ) and a bankruptcy trustee will retain the trust property until the appointment of a new trustee and perform the actions necessary for a handover of the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new trustee will be appointed in accordance with the stipulations for the act of creating the trust ( if any ) and if there is no stipulation regarding the act of creating the trust , or if a person designated in accordance with the stipulation of the act of creating the trust does not assume the trust , the trustor and a beneficiary will make the appointment upon mutual agreement ( Article 62.1 of the Trust Law ) . In a case where a new trustee is not appointed , a court may order a disposition of management by a trust property administrator , upon filing by an interested person , and appoint a trust property administrator ( Articles 63.1 and 64.1 of the Trust Law ) . <p> To cover this situation , stipulations should be made for the appointment of a new trustee in the act of creating the trust . First , a new trustee ( such as a back-up operator ) can be stipulated . In addition , in a case where continuation of the business by terminating the trust and transferring the trust property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more realistic , it will be necessary to consider including a provision for such a situation in the act of creating the trust . <h> Task of a trustee upon civil rehabilitation and corporate reorganisation proceedings <p> Unless provided in the act of creating the trust , the task of a trustee will not terminate ( Articles 56.5 and 56.7 of the Trust Law ) . An administrator or provisional administrator has the right to perform a trustee 's business duties and to manage and dispose of property that is trust property ( Articles 56.6 and 56.7 of the Trust Law ) . However , if there is any provision in the act of creating the trust that the tasks of a trustee will terminate , a new trustee will be appointed in accordance with that provision ( Article 56.5 , Proviso and Article 56.7 of the Trust Law ) . <h> Possible cancellation of the act of creating the trust <p> Even where a trustor-cum-trustee becomes subject to commencement of insolvency procedures , a trust will not naturally terminate in principle . However , if there is a provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trust will terminate ( Article 163.1(9) of the Trust Law ) . <h> To be included in a business trust Instrument <h> To be included under the law <p> Purpose of the trust . <p> Matters necessary for specifying property of the trust . <p> Name and address of the person who will create a declaration of trust . <p> When setting conditions or a deadline for the act of creating the trust , a provision regarding the conditions and the deadline . <p> Events under Article 163.1(9) of the new law ( events of termination for a trust stipulated in the act of creating the trust ) . <p> Other terms of a trust . <h> Matters generally indicated in a trust <p> Purpose of trust . <p> Establishment of trust ( establishment of trust , trust property , name of the trust and any additional trust ) . <p> Trust period . <p> Public notice of trust and requirements for perfection . <p> Representations and warranties . <p> Beneficiary and beneficiary interest . <p> Transfer , succession and pledge of beneficiary interest . <p> Management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust operations . <p> Duty of care of a prudent manager and trustee 's duty of loyalty . <p> Self-transactions and competitive transactions , among others . <p> Trust expenses . <p> Remuneration for trust . <p> Calculation of trust ( principal , trust profits , trust expenditures , calculation of a trust and delivery of profits ) . <p> Report on trust . <p> Change of trustee . <p> Termination and liquidation of trust . <p> Change , consolidation and division of trust . <p> Provisions regarding the bankruptcy of trust property . <p> General provisions . <p> As outlined above , the declaration of trust and business trust combination that has become possible under the New Trust Law promises to be a useful and efficient vehicle for companies .

This is the case for the issue of securities , the principal or interest of which is adjusted according to a general price index or to the price of a good or service , since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary stability to the extent that it may contribute to the indexing of the Spanish economy . Aside from this , all other securities issues , including those made by non-residents and those expressed in foreign exchange and made on the domestic market , are free and are not subject to any administrative procedure for their prior clearance . <p> First , the notion of the negotiable security must be defined , as this is the keystone of the Securities Market Act . Spanish legislation classifies as a negotiable security any right with economic content , whatever the name it bears , that , because of its legal form and the system for its transfer , is apt for generalized and impersonal trading on a financial market . <p> Despite the principle of freedom of issue and the absence of prior approvals , securities issues in Spain are subject to the requirement of filing and registering specific documentation with the Comisi=n Nacional del Mercado de Valores ( CNMV ) , the Spanish public agency responsible for the securities markets , in the following circumstances : <p> in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features as others of the same issuer , admitted for trading on securities markets established on Spanish territory ; and <p> where the issuer or the party acting on its behalf offers the securities with the performance of advertising activities on Spanish territory .

Nevertheless , the homogenous nature of a set of securities will not be affected by the possible existence of differences in secondary aspects . <p> Nevertheless , certain cases of issues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the abovementioned requirements . Among partial exceptions that should be noted are those that exempt the issuer from filing the documentation described in sections c ) and d ) above .

Where the issuer is legally obliged to file consolidated accounts , it must also file auditors ' reports on the consolidated accounts . The auditors ' reports will be considered public information . <p> The prospectus <p> The prospectus is the basic document for all securities issues . It provides full and reasoned information on the issuer and the securities offered . Its purpose is to ensure that potential subscribers have a true picture of the issuer and are able to reach a sound opinion on the investment proposed to them . For this purpose , the prospectus must contain obligatory information that does not omit relevant data and does not include information that may be misleading to investors . It must be drafted in clear and precise language . <p> Preparation of the prospectus is the responsibility of the issuer or offeror .

It is worth noting at this stage that only a BVI-licenced insolvency practitioner can act as an administrative receiver and that an individual that is not resident in the BVI can not act as an administrative receiver unless he or she does so jointly with a BVI-resident and licenced insolvency practitioner , and only if he or she is an " overseas insolvency practitioner " : an individual that has sufficient qualification and experience to act as an administrative receiver and that fulfils other conditions listed in the BVI Insolvency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivership in the BVI is to allow the holder of a floating charge to appoint a person , an administrative receiver , over the whole of the company 's business and assets in order to realise them for the benefit of that secured creditor . Any remaining surplus is accounted for to the company after realising the company 's assets under the security . Preferential creditors must be paid as to capital and interest out of the assets before the floating charge holder that appointed the administrative receiver and any other floating charge holder ( provided the company is not in liquidation ) . <p> The administrative receiver will enjoy very wide powers in the enforcement of the security , and the charge holder will have the ability to block the appointment of an administrator ( if the administration provisions set out in the Insolvency Act are brought into force in the future ) . The Insolvency Act confirms that only one administrative receiver can be appointed at any one time ( which clarifies the uncertain position on this point that remains today in England ) . <p> As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holder of a floating charge can commence it at any time the contract with the company allows . An administrative receiver owes a duty of care to his or her appointer , but only limited statutory legal obligations to others . <p> That does not mean that the administrative receiver can ignore the interests of the company or the unsecured creditors . The Insolvency Act provides specific instances when the administrative receiver owes a duty to them , and is required to notify the company and the creditors of its report , and also to call a meeting of creditors . These are , however , ancillary to the primary duty to ensure that the secured debt is repaid . <p> A creditor that wishes to take advantage of an administrative receivership must ensure that the charging document contains a valid floating charge under BVI law . The scope of appointment is a matter of contract between the company and the secured creditor and the administrative receiver must be appointed over " the whole , or substantially the whole " of the business , undertaking and assets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative receiver . <p> The floating charge holder 's strong position in an administrative receivership procedure is reinforced by the unique relationship of the agency with the BVI company . While the receiver is deemed to be an agent of the company , which traditionally connotes a relationship of singular loyalty , its primary duty is to the floating charge holder whose interests will be given priority , in some cases to the detriment of the company . The nature of the statutory relationship of agency between the receiver and the company renders the company liable for certain wrongful acts committed by the receiver while it is pursuing the interests of the floating charge holder . <p> The BVI court has only a limited role to play in administrative receiverships . The court can , however : appoint an administrative receiver ; permit it to dispose of property over which there is a security interest taking priority over that of the person who appointed it ; and only the court can remove the receiver from office . It also has the power to review and fix an administrative receiver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wide power to give directions , on application , on any matters arising in connection with the performance of the functions of the administrative receiver .

The first transaction was reported as recent as the 1990s , and involved Mesbla , a major retail store company , as the originator ( sponsor ) of the transaction . <p> In the past decade , securitization structures in Brazil have been used mainly by , but not limited to , entities facing financial difficulties , newly formed companies whose assets consist substantially of future cash flow , and recently privatized public service concessionaires which do not own assets to back their financing . ( Several privatized concessionaires only acquired the right to use the assets for the exploitation of their respective concessions from the Brazilian government ; full ownership of such assets remains under government control . ) <p> One of the reasons that may have contributed to this limited use of securitization as a means of financing in Brazil is the still relatively undeveloped legal and regulatory environment applicable to the transaction . <p> The first rule relating to securitization in Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Monetary Board ) " Resolution 2026/93 . <p> Although not expressly referring to the word " securitization " , Resolution 2026/93 established the basic structure of securitization in Brazil . It expressly provided for the creation of Special Purpose Companies ( SPCs ) , whose exclusive purpose would consist of acquiring securities deriving from commercial , industrial and service rendering activities promoted by a single company or by affiliated companies . <p> According to Resolution 2026 , the SPC should be incorporated as a Companhia Aberta ( publicly held corporation ) and should be registered with the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios ( CVM ) , the independent federal regulatory agency in charge of regulation and monitoring of the securities market in Brazil . <p> Resolution 2026 also set up a group of rules concerning the issuance of securities in connection with a securitization transaction , blocking rights granted to the securities holders represented by the agente fiduciario ( Bondholders Trustee ) , and securities over the receivables , among others . <p> There are two basic debt securities in Brazil that could be used in the context of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not considered an adequate device for a securitization transaction since , under CVM 's rules , its maturity is limited to 360 days . On the other hand , there are no rules limiting the final maturity term for bonds . Additionally , corporate law in Brazil provides for some special conditions in connection with the issuance of bonds that are useful in a securitization transaction . For instance , according to the Brazilian Corporate Law , bonds holders shall be represented by a trustee . Additionally , the bonds regulation provides for special ratios between assets given as collateral of the issuance and the issuance 's total amount . In other terms , overcollateralization is legally provided for bond issuances . Therefore , most , if not all the securitization transactions in Brazil are structured with the use of bond issuances . <p> Between 1993 and 1998 , however , the unpredictability of the regulation which dealt with the assignment of receivables and also the discussions relating to the concordata ( a procedure similar to the US Chapter 11 procedure ) of Mesbla caused a high level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool for financing by companies , although it continued to be used by companies in financial straits , privatized companies , and newly formed entities , as mentioned above . <p> In 1998 , the National Monetary Board enacted Resolution n. 2493 , revoking Resolution 2026 . Resolution 2493 's main purpose was to authorize financial institutions to act as the originators in a securitization structure . Resolution 2493 expressly provides for the possibility of the use of international financing tools , as well as domestic bonds and other securities issuances . According to Resolution n. 2493 , the SPC shall bear the name Companhia Securitizadora de Creditos Financeiros ( Financial Credits Securitization Company or Companhias Securitizadoras ) in its denomination . <p> According to Resolution 2493 , special restrictions should be included in the Companhias Securitizadoras ' by-laws referring to transfer of control , capital reductions , mergers , spin-offs and dissolution , among others , which intend to provide checks and balances similar to a golden share . <p> The transaction must also provide for the possibility of the receivables to be delivered as consideration in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Companhia Securitizadora is not able to pay its debt in connection with the bonds on the agreed maturity . <p> The enacting of Resolution 2493 was followed by Instruction CVM n. 281/98 ( as modified by Resolution CVM n. 307/99 ) , which established the rules for the issuance of bonds by the Companhias Securitizadora , s and by Instruction CVM n. 284/98 , which set up rules about Companhias Securitizadoras de CrTditos Imobilirios and issuance of bonds in connection with real estate-backed securitization transactions . <p> Resolution 2493/98 has been replaced by Resolution 2696 , dated January 2000 , which maintained the basic rules of Resolution 2493 . <p> The 1998 rules not only created a path for a better regulation environment , but also indicated a clear intention of the regulatory agencies in creating incentives and an adequate environment for the development of a Brazilian market for securities backed by receivables . <p> Basic features <p> Notwithstanding the 1998 rules , some obstacles still exist when setting up securitization structures in Brazil . <p> Those restrictions can be summarized into four main categories : the effectiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of future receivables ; limited concept of trust under Brazilian law ; bankruptcy rules . <p> Transfer of Assets <p> Pursuant to the Brazilian Civil Code , an assignment of receivables to an SPC is subject to a number of restrictions , especially in relation to the required notification of the original debtor by the originator of the transaction . Such restriction may constitute a real burden especially when the collateral of the transaction consists of thousands of receivables or contracts , as is usual in securitization structures . <p> Such a burden , however , is being overcome by the widespread use by commercial and services providers , of contracts in which the debtor previously agrees and authorizes any future assignment of the credit rights deriving from the contract . <p> Transfer of Future Receivables <p> Although the Brazilian Civil Code expressly provides for the marketability of future receivables , and , as a consequence , the legality of the future receivables offered as collateral in a securitization transaction , the CVM has already rejected approval on issuances of debt where the respective collateral consisted of future receivables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum level of market surveillance and safety . <p> This is especially true when we consider that the procedure of rating either a company , a transaction , or a debt issuance is not widely adopted in Brazil and so information relating to the risks associated with a certain structure is not usually available to all participants in the market . <p> Additionally , the level of disclosure of information required in connection with the issuance of securities in Brazil does not compare with the US , for example . Only recently did Anbid ( the Investment Bank 's National Association ) issue the C=digo de Auto-Regulatpo ( Self-Regulation Code ) , requiring deeper and more detailed information in connection with public securities ' issuances coordinated or syndicated by its members . Although the Code is not legally binding , it has been successful in educating the market with regard to disclosure of information . <p> As the transparency and adequacy of information , associated with a more consistent use of ratings in transactions involving publicly traded securities , grows we believe that securitization backed on future receivables will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trust in Brazil <p> A trust is typically a common law institution , based upon a duality of ownership ( legal ownership and equitable ownership ) . <p> However , civil law countries ( such as Brazil ) adopt an absolute concept of the unity of ownership . Fiduciary duties granted to third parties are accepted in limited circumstances but never to hinder such unity . Management functions relating to assets are allowed to be assigned to third parties only on a contractual basis . The segregation of a portion of assets in another entity can only be achieved through a true sale of the full ownership of assets to third parties , typically , a corporation . <p> Although not expressly admitted by Brazilian law , the basic purpose of establishing a trust in the context of a securitization structure , is achieved through the cumulative use of two devices : ( a ) the true sale of the receivables to a third party company ( the SPC ) ; and ( b ) the granting of fiduciary duties to the trustee of the bonds to be issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to those attributed to the trustee in a trust structure ) . <p> However , unlike a trust structure , such a corporate structure is not free from risks , especially with respect to a possible consolidation of the assets of the originator with those of the SPC , in case bankruptcy rules are to be applied . <p> Bankruptcy Rules <p> Under Brazilian Bankruptcy Rules , a sale of assets to a newly formed company ( the SPC ) a few months before the originator has gone bankrupt could be regarded as fraudulent conveyance and may lead to a possible disregard of such transfer . <p> Additionally , there exists the danger of consolidation between the assets of the originator and those of the SPC ( that is , the receivables ) . This danger has once been tested , in the context of the concordata asked by Mesbla , when the securitization transaction was still ongoing . <p> Basically , Mesbla had assigned the credit card receivables deriving from its commercial activities to an SPC . The SPC then issued bonds using the credit card receivables as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all respective financial flows were conducted and administered by a third-party administrator and supervised by a trustee . The SPC was audited by an internationally recognized independent auditing firm . Sinking Funds and additional collateral were also provided . <p> After the beginning of the concordata procedure , consolidation of Mesbla 's assets and those of the SPC was requested by Mesbla 's creditors . However , such consolidation was not accepted by the Court . <p> Mesbla was a leading case but there are few precedents in which can be relied on . <p> Although not exempt from risks , the most effective way of avoiding this danger is to ensure that the SPC is controlled and managed by shareholders and officers not subordinated or formally linked to the originator . <p> Conclusion <p> Over the last five years , regulation and experience in Brazil has evolved towards a more significant use of securitization transactions , both in terms of the number of transactions and of the amounts involved . In spite of some regulatory limitations and the lack of judicial precedents , Brazil already provides a relatively safe environment for the structuring of securitization transactions .

Although an Indonesian debtor may enter into a private workout with some or all of its creditors without the supervision of a court , the focus here is on court-supervised mechanisms . <h> Bankruptcy proceedings <h> Bankruptcy and requirements for an actionable claim <p> Bankruptcy is the general statutory attachment of all of a debtor 's assets ( the bankruptcy estate ) established by a declaration of bankruptcy by the court , whereby such assets are placed under the management of a curator ( roughly equivalent to a receiver in common law jurisdictions ) , as supervised by a supervisory judge , for the benefit of the debtor 's creditors . The requirements for a declaration of bankruptcy are prima facie evidence that the subject debtor has two or more creditors and has failed to pay at least one debt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a final and binding judgment on bankruptcy has been entered , the debtor 's assets may be liquidated and distributed to creditors based upon their respective priorities , unless a proposed composition plan is approved by the creditors and ratified by the court . <p> Generally , the debtor , or one or more of its creditors , can submit a bankruptcy petition . A public prosecutor can also file a bankruptcy petition if in the public interest . In order for a corporate debtor to file , it must also comply with ( 1 ) the corporate governance procedures provided in Indonesia 's Company Law , for example , approval of three-quarters of shareholders with voting rights that vote at a general meeting of shareholders ( GMS ) at which the necessary quorum is present , and ( 2 ) any additional requirements set forth in the debtor 's articles of association ( which may include quorum requirements and/or requirements for passing a resolution that exceed those provided in the Company Law ) . The minimum quorum requirements under the Company Law in respect of a GMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) three-quarters of shareholders with voting rights at the first such GMS , and ( b ) if no such quorum is present at such first GMS , two-thirds of shareholders with voting rights at a second GMS , and ( c ) if no such quorum is present at such second GMS , a quorum stipulated by a district court on the request of the company at a third GMS . If the debtor is a bank , insurance company or one of the other specified financial services institutions , however , the petition can only be filed by the relevant regulatory authority ( Bank Indonesia , Ministry of Finance or the Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Board , also known as BAPEPAM-LK , respectively ) . The same rules apply to an application for suspension of payments . <p> The BRL sets forth a timetable for reaching a decision on a bankruptcy petition : however , in practice the time periods may be much longer . Proceedings are initiated by court registration of a filed petition . Within three days of the petition 's registration , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing ) , which must be within 20 days of the petition 's registration ( subject to postponement , based on the debtor 's showing of sufficient cause , for up to five additional days ) . In the case of a creditor-submitted petition , the court must summon the debtor for such hearing , at least seven days earlier , by registered mail . In the case of a debtor-submitted petition where there is doubt that the conditions for bankruptcy have been met , the court also may summon creditors . Ultimately , the court must render a decision on the petition within 60 days of its registration . <p> Pending the court 's decision , a creditor may apply to the court to : ( i ) issue a conservatory attachment on part or all of the assets of the debtor ; or ( ii ) appoint an interim curator to oversee the management of the debtor 's business , the payment of creditors and/or the transfer or use of the debtor 's assets . Such application may be granted if considered necessary to protect the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its creditors can file an intervening application for suspension of payments ( SoP ) any time before the declaration of bankruptcy ( whether or not a bankruptcy petition has been filed ) , in which case a temporary SoP ( TSoP ) is automatically granted . If the SoP application has been filed by the date of the first bankruptcy hearing , the SoP proceedings supersede any pending bankruptcy petition proceeding . <h> Cassation and civil review <p> The debtor , or any creditor party to the bankruptcy case , may seek review of a declaration of bankruptcy by filing a petition for cassation directly to the Supreme Court . Only legal issues may be reviewed and considered in review by cassation ; by comparison , in Indonesian practice , appeals may be based on review and consideration of factual and/or legal issues . A cassation petition may also be filed by a creditor that was not a party to the case but is dissatisfied with the declaration of bankruptcy . A cassation petition must be filed with the clerk of the court that heard the underlying bankruptcy petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . The Supreme Court must render its decision within 60 days from registration of the cassation petition . <p> The cassation decision of a Supreme Court panel may be subject to further civil review by the Supreme Court if : ( i ) important new written evidence is discovered , which , had it been known during prior proceedings , would have resulted in a different outcome ; or ( ii ) such decision contained a serious error in the application of the law . <h> Consequences <h> Administration of bankruptcy estate <p> Upon declaration of bankruptcy , the court designates a curator and a supervisory judge , and the debtor loses the power to manage and/or dispose of its assets . Generally , only the curator has such authority , subject in some circumstances to approval of the supervisory judge . The curator is obligated to report to the supervisory judge on the condition of the bankruptcy estate and performance of its duties every three months . A creditor may propose appointment of a particular curator when filing its petition , but the court is not bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more curators . <p> The curator has a general duty to preserve the assets of the bankruptcy estate and the authority to terminate agreements , to nullify preferential transfers and/or to enter into new agreements on behalf of the debtor 's estate . Additionally , the curator is responsible for the administration of the debtor 's estate , liquidation of its assets and distribution of the resulting proceeds based on the creditors ' respective priorities . The curator is entitled to exercise its powers in administration of the bankruptcy estate and , provided it has the prior approval of the supervisory judge or , as the case may be , a creditors committee ( if one was appointed in the declaration of bankruptcy decision ) , to continue to operate the debtor 's business , notwithstanding any review by cassation of the declaration of bankruptcy or civil review . The court may replace a curator on the request of such curator , another curator ( if any ) , the supervisory judge or the debtor . The court must replace a curator if requested to do so by more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors ' meeting , representing more than half of the total unsecured debt claims present or represented at the meeting . However , a request for replacement of a curator by unsecured creditors can only be done after the verification meeting ( as defined below ) has occurred . <p> No later than 14 days from the declaration of bankruptcy , the supervisory judge must determine : ( i ) the deadline for filing claims ; ( ii ) the deadline for tax verification ; and ( iii ) the date and venue of the creditors meeting for verification of claims ( verification meeting ) . The curator is charged with verifying the claims submitted by the creditors and consulting with them if any objections are made to the submitted claims . <p> The court may , either upon or after a declaration of bankruptcy , establish a temporary creditors committee ( TCC ) comprised of three members appointed from acknowledged creditors for the purpose of advising the curator . Although the curator is not bound by the TCC 's advice , he is obligated to provide all information requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lawsuit , handling ones in-process , continuing any pending ones , or defending himself against any lawsuit .

Upon request of creditors based on a resolution approved by a simple majority vote of the unsecured creditors present or represented at a creditors ' meeting , the supervisory judge must : ( i ) replace any TCC with the PCC ; or ( ii ) if no TCC was established in the decision on declaration of bankruptcy , establish a PCC and appoint its members . <h> Stay on enforcement of security and rights of third parties to claim assets <p> The declaration of bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay on the enforcement of security and the rights of third parties to claim assets under the possession or control of the debtor or curator until the earlier of : ( i ) 90 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ii ) termination of the bankruptcy ; or ( iii ) commencement of a state of insolvency . Such stay is applicable to enforcement actions initiated before the declaration of bankruptcy , as well as those initiated afterwards . During the stay , however , the debtor must pay adequate protection to compensate creditors or such third parties for any diminution of the value of assets . Additionally , notwithstanding the stay , a creditor may set off any cash deposits of the debtor in accounts held with the creditor against outstanding debt owed by the debtor to the creditor , so long as both the claim and the debt existed , or resulted from transactions entered into , before the declaration of bankruptcy . Note that creditors ' debt owed to the bankrupt debtor need not be due and payable in order for the creditor to validly exercise its set-off rights . Third parties or secured creditors that are affected by the stay may request that it be lifted or modified by petition , first to the curator , then to the supervisory judge and finally to the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights no later than two months following the commencement of a state of insolvency . The elucidation to this provision of the NBRL states that secured creditors must have at least started to exercise their security rights within such period . If the secured creditor fails to do so , the curator is obligated to demand delivery of the secured assets for enforcement sale by public auction . Under such circumstances the secured creditor is liable to share in the bankruptcy administration costs . Notwithstanding such appropriation by the curator of the encumbered assets , the secured creditor remains entitled to receive the proceeds of sale of such assets up to the amount of its secured claim . <h> Limited rights of secured creditors to claim and vote in bankruptcy <p> Generally , in bankruptcy proceedings , secured creditors are not entitled to submit claims against the bankruptcy estate and do not have voting rights on the theory that secured creditors retain their security rights . However , a secured creditor that can prove that the proceeds resulting from enforcement of its security will probably be insufficient to fully discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of such anticipated shortfall without jeopardising its priority rights as a secured creditor over the encumbered assets . If the proceeds from enforcing the security are insufficient to cover the entire amount of the secured creditor 's claim , such creditor is entitled : ( i ) to make a claim for the deficiency as an unsecured creditor , provided such creditor files a request for verification of such unsecured claim ; and ( ii ) to vote on matters in bankruptcy , but only to the extent of its capacity as an unsecured creditor under the aforementioned circumstances . <h> Formal restructuring proceedings <p> There are two formal restructuring options , namely : ( i ) SoP ; and ( ii ) composition in bankruptcy ( CIB ) . The purpose underlying restructuring is the same for SoP and CIB , that is to give the debtor who is , or expects to be , unable to pay its due and payable debts a chance to present a composition plan that includes an offer to pay all or part of its debts to unsecured creditors . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured and unsecured creditors under SoP , but only unsecured creditors under CIB ) , permits the debtor to reorganise and carry on its business pursuant to terms and conditions agreed to by its creditors . <p> For SoP , the debtor may submit a composition plan any time before the declaration of bankruptcy , regardless of whether there is any pending bankruptcy petition . For CIB , the debtor may submit a composition plan only after a declaration of bankruptcy has been issued but before it becomes a final and binding judgment . However , CIB is not available to the debtor where bankruptcy has been declared because of a prior failed SoP . The underlying policy is to deny the debtor more than one chance to enter into a settlement with its creditors . <h> SoP : composition before declaration of bankruptcy <p> SoP provides the debtor with relief from creditors by means of a moratorium during which a debtor and its creditors attempt to agree upon a composition plan to restructure the debtor 's outstanding debts . The debtor or any of its creditors ( provided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time before the declaration of bankruptcy ( except if the debtor is a bank , insurance company or one of other specified financial services institutions , in which case only the relevant regulatory authority may so apply ) . Often , in practice , a debtor will file an SoP application to prevent declaration of bankruptcy under a previously filed bankruptcy petition and to provide additional time to consider and/or attempt restructuring . <p> The debtor may attach a composition plan to the SoP application at the time of filing or propose one after filing . The filing of an SoP application automatically defers consideration of any pre-existing bankruptcy petition relating to the same debtor if the SoP application has been submitted by the first bankruptcy hearing date . In case the SoP application has been filed in the absence of any bankruptcy petition , any subsequent bankruptcy petition filing will be barred until the SoP process has been completed . <p> After an SoP application is filed , the court will : ( i ) grant a TSoP ; ( ii ) appoint a supervisory judge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creditors ' meeting regarding the SoP ( first SoP creditors meeting , which must occur within 45 days of the filing ) ; and ( iv ) through the administrator , summon the debtor and publicly announce the court 's granting of the TSoP and invite its known creditors to appear for the first SoP creditors meeting . The administrator and the debtor are jointly responsible for managing , and disposing of , the debtor 's assets : during SoP proceedings , the debtor can not take any action in this regard without the administrator 's approval . <p> The court must also appoint a creditors ' committee if : ( i ) the case involves debts of a complex nature or numerous creditors ; or ( ii ) the court is so requested by unsecured creditors representing at least half of all acknowledged claims . In the course of performing its tasks , the administrator is required to ask for , and consider , the advice of the creditors ' committee . <p> The TSoP continues until the date of the first SoP creditors ' meeting . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' meeting , the debtor is declared bankrupt . At the first SoP creditors ' meeting , if a composition plan has already been proposed , the creditors may vote on whether to approve it . If a composition plan has not yet been proposed , the creditors may vote on whether to grant the debtor a definitive SoP ( DSoP ) for up to 270 days from the date of the granting of the TSoP , with the intent that at a later hearing the creditors will vote on whether to approve a composition plan . If neither a composition plan nor a DSoP is approved by an SoP required majority ( as defined below ) , the debtor will be declared bankrupt . Such declaration of bankruptcy decision arising from an unsuccessful SoP is a final and binding decision and will not be subject to review by cassation or civil review . <p> The SoP required majority for approving a composition plan or instituting a DSoP is as follows . <p> For unsecured creditors : approval of more than half of those unsecured creditors whose claims are acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less than two-thirds of all acknowledged or provisionally acknowledged claims of unsecured creditors present or represented at the hearing . <p> For secured creditors : approval of more than half of those secured creditors present or represented at the hearing representing not less than two-thirds of all secured claims of secured creditors present or represented at the hearing . <p> Separate approval from both unsecured and secured creditors is required . One big difference between the current BRL and the former law , Law 4 of 1998 regarding bankruptcy , is that the BRL entitles both secured and unsecured creditors to vote on whether to approve the composition plan and otherwise participate in SoP proceedings , whereas under the 1998 law only unsecured creditors were entitled to so vote and participate . <p> There is a stay on enforcement of security and the rights of third parties to claim assets under the possession or control of the debtor or curator throughout the duration of any TSoP and/or DSoP . However , if the outcome of SoP proceedings is declaration of bankruptcy , then the state of insolvency immediately ensues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under such circumstances . Secured creditors will be required to start to enforce their security within two months of the declaration of bankruptcy . <p> A duly approved composition plan is still subject to court ratification . If the court refuses to ratify the approved composition plan , then the debtor will be declared bankrupt . If the approved composition plan is duly ratified , it is binding on all creditors except those secured creditors that refused to approve it , and the SoP ( whether TSoP or DSoP ) is terminated . Such termination ends the stay on enforcement of security and enables secured creditors to freely enforce their security rights , provided that secured creditors who approved the composition plan are subject to any of its terms that may relate to enforcement of security . Disapproving secured creditors are entitled to compensation , the amount of which is the lower of their security 's value and their secured claim amount . <p> The BRL also contains provisions for terminating the SoP process at the initiative of the court , supervisory judge or one or more creditors under certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debtor being declared bankrupt with no further right to review by cassation or civil review . <h> CIB : composition after declaration of bankruptcy <p> Under CIB proceedings , the debtor may submit a composition plan to unsecured creditors only after a declaration of bankruptcy has been issued . This option is not available to the debtor where bankruptcy has been declared because of a prior failed SoP in respect of the same debtor . <p> A debtor that intends to pursue a CIB must , no later than eight days before the verification meeting , present a draft composition plan to its creditors ( secured and unsecured ) and to each member of the TCC , and make such draft composition plan available for public inspection . The curator and the TCC must give a written opinion regarding the draft composition plan at the verification meeting . <p> Secured creditors are not eligible to vote on approval of the composition plan submitted in CIB proceedings unless they first surrender their security rights . In that case , they will be deemed as unsecured creditors regardless of whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition plan in bankruptcy requires the approval of more than half of the unsecured creditors ( whose claims have been acknowledged or provisionally acknowledged ) present or represented at a creditors ' meeting ( first meeting ) representing at least two-thirds of the total claims acknowledged or provisionally acknowledged of unsecured creditors present or represented at such meeting ( CIB 1 required majority ) . If the composition plan is not approved at the first meeting but is approved by more than half of the unsecured creditors present or represented there representing at least half of the total claims of unsecured creditors present or represented there ( CIB 2 required majority ) , then a second vote at a subsequent creditors ' meeting ( second meeting , separate notice of which is not required ) must be held within eight days of the first meeting . <p> If approved by the CIB 1 required majority at the first meeting or the CIB 2 required majority at the second meeting , the composition plan is still subject to ratification by the court . The court must reject ratification if : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement amount stipulated in the composition plan ; ( ii ) implementation of the composition plan is not guaranteed ; or ( iii ) the composition plan is based on fraud or conspiracy involving one or more creditors , the use of unfair means , whether or not with the complicity of the bankrupt debtor . If the court refuses to ratify the composition plan , the debtor can not propose any other composition plan . <p> If the court refuses to ratify the composition plan , the debtor and the unsecured creditors who approved the composition plan are each entitled to file an application for cassation . <p> If the court ratifies the composition plan , the following parties may request review by cassation : <p> unsecured creditors that either rejected the composition plan or were absent from the meeting where voting to approve the composition plan occurred ; and <p> unsecured creditors that approved the composition plan later discovered to have been based on fraud or conspiracy . <p> In any case , filing for cassation must be done within eight days of the court 's decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ratification has become final and binding , the composition plan becomes binding on all unsecured creditors ( but is not binding on secured creditors ) and bankruptcy proceedings are terminated , thereby ending the stay on enforcement of security and enabling secured creditors to freely enforce their security rights . <p> If the bankrupt debtor fails to proffer a composition plan to the unsecured creditors by or before the verification meeting , the state of insolvency is deemed to have commenced . Similarly , if the composition plan is so proffered but is either rejected or approved but not ratified by the court , subject to the debtor 's and/or approving unsecured creditors ' rights to review by cassation against the court 's refusal to ratify the composition plan , the state of insolvency is deemed to have commenced . <p> The significance of the commencement of the state of insolvency is that it ends the stay on enforcement of security , enabling the secured creditors to freely enforce their security rights , and triggers the creditors ' entitlement to effect a forced liquidation of the bankruptcy estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also significant because the two-month period within which the secured creditor is required to start enforcement of its security rights begins to run as of such date .

@@8538453 @1738453/ <h> The reform of the Works Council Constitution Act in Germany and its effects on the co-determination rights of the works council <h> Author : Published : 10 Oct 2001 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> The amended co-determination rights of labour , issued by the German Federal Parliament ( Bundestag ) in the form of the Works Council Constitution Act ( **25;787;TOOLONG or BetrVG ) , introduce far-reaching changes in the works constitution . On the one hand the new regulations strengthen works councils , and increase the number of works councils members to be released , as well as raising the number of youth and trainee representatives . On the other hand , the regulations give a concrete definition of operations , revise the definition of an employee and regulate the fate of the works council in the event of split-up , closure or merger of an operation . Further , the voting process for works councils is newly regulated . The reform of the Works Council Constitution Act also expands the co-determination rights and hides additional costs for the employer . <p> This article describes the modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Section 1 BetrVG expressly states that in joint operations of several enterprises with , as a rule , at least five employees who have permanent voting rights , works councils may be elected . This corresponds with the ( now consolidated ) adjudication of the ( German ) Federal Labour Court . What is new is that section 1 , subsection 2 BetrVG incorporates a statutory presumption when several enterprises form a joint operation . This statutory assumption applies if <p> the operational equipment as well as the employees of several enterprises are jointly deployed to carry out work for technical purposes ; or <p> the consequence of the split-up of an enterprise is that one or several sectors of operations of one enterprise are allocated to another enterprise participating in the split-up without this event significantly changing the organization of the operation or enterprise concerned . <p> In addition , the employees of another employer are then entitled to elect a works council if they have been loaned to the operation for a certain period of time to perform work , and are deployed in the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 4 BetrVG contains a new regulation , according to which the employees of an operating division that has no separate works council may decide , with a majority of votes , to participate in the election of the works council of the main operation . <p> The definition of the term " employee " , set out in section 5 , subsection 1 BetrVG , is broadened to include employees engaged in tele-working and home-working . Furthermore , the distinction between white- and blue-collar employees no longer applies . <p> Section 9 BetrVG is revised to increase the number of members permitted on the works councils of enterprises that have more than 101 employees who are entitled to vote . For an overview , see Box 1 , which compares the old and new regulations . <p> The cancellation of the distinction between white- and blue-collar employees also leads to a change in the regulation of the voting provisions of the works council . Furthermore , section 14a BetrVG introduces a simplified voting process for small enterprises . According to this , operations that have , as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect the works council in two steps . At the first election meeting , the electoral committee is appointed , at the second meeting the works council is voted in , in a secret and immediate election . This election meeting takes place one week after the first election meeting . <p> The newly inserted section 21a BetrVG regulates the transitional mandate of a works council in the event of a split-up in operations . Under this provision , the works council stays in office and continues to manage the business for the operational sectors allocated to it , insofar as it meets the preconditions of section 1 , subsection 1 BetrVG and is not integrated into an enterprise . <p> The new section 21b BetrVG regulates the remaining mandate of the works council in the event of closure , split-up or merger of operations causing one operation to be extinguished . According to this regulation , the works council stays in office as long as this is required to represent the employees ' participation and co-determination rights connected with the change in operations . <p> Furthermore , in section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises in which members of the works council must be released . A comparison between the new and the old regulations in this regard appears in Box 1 . Releases may also take the form of part releases . These may not , in total , exceed the number of releases listed in section 38 , sentences 1 and 2 BetrVG . The voting process regulated in section 38 , subsection 2 BetrVG concerning the works council members to be released is also simplified . <p> By cancelling the distinction between white- and blue-collar employees , the regulation covering the dispatch of works council members to the central works council contained in section 47 BetrVG was revised . According to this , each works council with up to three members must send one of its members to the central works council . Each works council with more than three members sends two of its members . Both sexes shall be given reasonable consideration in this process . <p> The formation of a central works council for a group of companies has also been changed . The formation of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council of the group of companies in which a total of more than 50% of the employees of the group of companies are employed . Under the old regulation , the level was 75% of employees . In addition , pursuant to the revision in section 55 BetrVG , the central works council must send two of its members to the central works council of the group of companies , even if it only represents white- or blue-collar employees . <p> Section 62 BetrVG increases the number of representatives for youths and trainees in enterprises . According to this , under section 60 , subsection 1 , the representation of youths and trainees in enterprises with , as a rule : <p> 5 to 20 employees , will be one member ; <p> 21 to 50 employees , will be three members ; <p> 51 to 150 employees , will be five members ; <p> 151 to 300 employees , will be seven members ; <p> 301 to 500 employees , will be nine members ; <p> 501 to 700 employees , will be 11 members ; <p> 701 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 1000 employees , will be 15 members . <p> In addition , sections 73 ( a ) and ( b ) BetrVG introduce the representation of youths and trainees in a group of companies . <p> The responsibilities of the works council contained in section 80 BetrVG is extended as follows : <p> the promotion of compatibility between family and occupation ; <p> the application of measures to fight racism and hostility to foreigners in the enterprise ; <p> the promotion and safeguarding of employment in the enterprise ; and <p> the promotion of measures for employment protection and environmental protection in the enterprise . <p> The participation and co-determination rights of employees are supplemented by section 86a BetrVG by a proposal right for employees . According to this , each employee has the right to propose topics to the works council for consultation . If the proposal is supported by 5% of the enterprise 's employees , the works council must put the proposal on the agenda of a works council meeting within two months . <p> The co-determination catalogue of the works council contained in section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the works council must co-determine principles concerning the execution of group work ; " group work " as defined in this provision prevails if , under the structure of the operational works process , a group of employees carries out a collective task assigned to it mainly under its own responsibility . <p> The new regulation of the BetrVG provides that voluntary works agreements may , pursuant to section 88 BetrVG , also be regulated ( decided ) with respect to measures for works environmental protection and measures for the integration of foreign employees , as well as for fighting racism and hostility to foreigners . <p> In section 97 BetrVG , a new co-determination right of the works council is introduced by inserting a second subsection . According to this , the works council has a co-determination right when introducing measures of in-plant ( industrial ) , professional training if the employer has plans for technical plants , work processes and work flows , or workplaces that will cause the activities of the employees concerned to change , and lead to a situation in which their professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfil their tasks . If no agreement is reached , the conciliation committee makes a binding decision . The award of the conciliation committee substitutes the agreement between the employer and the works council . <p> The co-determination right of the works council with respect to individual personnel measures is broadened by the fact that in section 99 , subsection 1 , sentence 1 , the word " operations " is replaced by the word " enterprises " . According to this , the works council must now be informed with respect to enterprises that have , as a rule , more than 20 employees with voting rights prior to each employment , classification , reclassification and transfer . <p> The regulation in section 103 BetrVG is also new . The works council must now give its consent in the event of a transfer of members of the works council and other specially protected persons . <p> Just as in section 99 BetrVG , the word " operations " is replaced by the word " enterprises " in section 111 BetrVG . <p> Further , should changes in an enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Plan to be concluded ( section 111 , subsection 1 BetrVG ) , the works council in enterprises with more than 300 employees may call in an adviser for support . <p> The new regulations came into force on August 1 2001 .

@@8538456 @1738456/ <h> The revolver springing leverage test unpicked <h> Author : IFLR Correspondent Published : 11 Jul 2016 <p> As the term loan B model ( TLB ) has continued to dominate global sponsor acquisition financing , the concept of traditional financial maintenance covenants has largely disappeared from senior credit documentation . <p> While the middle market and Asia so far have held on to a leverage test , for top deals in the US and Europe the only term resembling a leverage covenant is the revolver springing leverage test . This covenant , which only benefits revolving lenders and not the term loan investors , appears on its face to cap leverage , but is it really the last leverage test or something else entirely ? <p> A leverage ratio is used to measure a company 's overall indebtedness relative to its financial performance , and is constructed as the ratio of the company 's consolidated net debt ( or senior debt ) to its consolidated Earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation ( Ebitda ) .

The FST also contributes to the preparation of financial regulation , including implementation of EU directives and regulations ; it also collects and disseminates knowledge about the financial sector . <p> The remits of the FST are , among other things , to execute supervisory reactions towards financial institutions . <h> 2 . Capital structure <h> 2.1 Are instruments other than common shares eligible to qualify as CET1 for banks and mutuals ? <p> For Danish banks ( pengeinstitutter ) only capital instruments that qualify as CET1 under regulation ( EU ) no. 575/2013 of June 26 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms ( CRR ) are eligible to qualify as CET1 capital .

Under sections 83a and 87a of the Financial Business Act , equity instruments issued by either cooperative societies or savings institutions can , even though they include a cap or restriction on the maximum level of distribution , qualify as CET1 capital . <h> 2.2 What instruments qualify as AT1 capital ? <p> The question on which instruments qualify as AT1 capital is governed by the CRR and EBA 's guidelines on own funds . Neither the Danish FST nor the Danish parliament has issued other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT1 capital . <h> 3 . Capital requirements ( capital triggers and buffer requirements ) <h> 3.1 How does your jurisdiction implement combined buffer requirements laid out in CRD IV and what is the relevant legislation/ regulation ? <p> The combined buffer requirements are implemented in the Financial Business Act section 125 a-h , which will enter into force on January 1 2015 . <p> The combined buffer requirement will be fulfilled with CET1 capital according to section 125a , subsection 7 of the Financial Business Act . <p> The capital conservation buffer will be gradually phased in , reaching full effect on January 1 2019 . In the period January 1 2015 to December 31 2015 , the capital conservation buffer will be 0% of the amount of the credit institution 's risk exposure . The capital conservation buffer will increase to 0.625% in the period January 1 2016 to December 31 2016 . The required capital conservation buffer will increase by 0.625 percentage points per year until it reaches a maximum of 2.5% of the credit institution 's risk exposure amount as from January 1 2019 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution-specific counter-cyclical capital buffer , will also be gradually phased in during a period of five years . The counter-cyclical buffer rate for credit exposures in Denmark is to be determined quarterly by the Danish ministry of business and growth and published on their website , www.evm.dk . The counter-cyclical buffer rate will start at a maximum of 0.5% in 2015 . This maximum limit will then increase by 0.5 percentage points every year to a maximum limit of 2.5% in 2019 . <p> As regards the systemic risk buffer and the G-SII-buffer , please see our response to question 10 below . <h> 3.2 What capital triggers are expected/ are in place for AT1 securities in your jurisdiction and what is the relevant legislation/ regulation ? <p> The Financial Business Act refers directly to the CRR when determining the requirement for capital instruments qualifying as AT1 capital . Thus capital instruments with a trigger of 5.125% CET1 capital ratio will qualify as AT1 capital . <p> As a general rule , only CET1 capital can be used to fulfil a credit institution 's individual solvency requirement . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complies with the guidelines published by the Danish FST in September 2013 , they , too , can be used to fulfil the individual solvency requirement . The guideline makes it thereby possible for Danish credit institutions to issue contingent convertible bonds known as ' CoCos ' . If either the AT1 capital or tier 2 capital is used to fulfil the individual solvency requirement , the instrument will include a loss absorption mechanism . This mechanism can be either conversion into ordinary shares , permanent write-down or temporary write-down with a subsequent write-up . The loss absorption mechanism will be triggered when the credit institution breaches a trigger of 7.0% CET1 capital ratio . <p> Therefore , the relevant CET1 capital ratio trigger for AT1 instruments by Danish credit institutions will depend on whether the AT1 instrument will be used only as an instrument to the credit institution 's total capital , or whether it will be used as an alternative to CET1 capital to fulfil the individual solvency requirement . <h> 3.3 How is the PONV defined in your jurisdiction ? <p> The definition of the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014/59/EU on establishing a framework for the resolution and recovery of credit institutions and investment firms ( the ' BRRD ' ) ; and as the BRRD has not yet been implemented in Denmark , ' PONV ' has not yet been defined in Danish legislation . Regarding the implementation of the BRRD in Denmark please see our response to question 15.1 below . <h> 3.4 What are the grandfathering provisions and how are they implemented ? <p> The grandfathering provisions for CET1 , AT1 and tier 2 capital instruments are implemented in executive order no. 294 of March 27 2014 on grandfathering provisions under the CRR . <p> Under section 8 of the executive order , the limit for including CET1 , AT1 and tier 2 capital instruments covered by article 484 of the CRR is : 80% in 2014 , 70% in 2015 , and so on , decreasing by 10 percentage points every year until it reaches 10% in 2021 . The Danish FST has therefore decided to set the highest possible limit available under the CRR . From January 1 2022 it will no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier 2 capital instruments covered by article 484 in the CRR. <h> 4 . Stress testing <h> 4.1 What is the status of your jurisdiction 's treatment of stress tests ? Have plans for upcoming tests been announced , and/ or are results of previous stress tests outstanding ? <p> Banks that use the internal IRB approach when calculating their credit exposure amount are required to carry out a stress test once a year . The requirements for those tests are explained in guideline no. 9048 of February 7 2013 . As a general rule , the stress test will be submitted to the FST no later than 45 bank days after the commencement of a new year . <p> Under section 354f of the Financial Business Act the FST can disclose the result of a stress test to the public . However , so far these annual stress tests have not been disclosed . <p> The national stress test for 2014 is based on macroeconomic criteria which are updated by the FST every year . These consist of a basis point scenario and a stress scenario . The national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures of the annual report for the previous year , for example , the stress test for 2014 will be based on the figures from the annual report of 2013 . Changes to the bank 's total capital can be taken into account if the changes are certain at the time the bank submits its results for the stress test . <h> 4.2 Which national body is conducting the tests ? <p> The Danish FST conducts the stress tests . <h> 4.3 Which banks are subject to stress tests and what are the criteria for inclusion ? <p> In 2011 , Danske Bank , Jyske Bank , Sydbank and Nykredit , which are the four largest Danish banks ( excluding Nordea Bank Danmark ) were elected to participate in the EBA stress test . <p> The same banks tested in 2011 participated in the 2014 EU-wide stress test carried out by the EBA. <h> 5 . Bank Supervision <h> 5.1 How will your jurisdiction 's supervisory authority change in the next 12 months , if at all ? <p> When the BRRD is implemented , a resolution authority will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which authority will be appointed for this purpose . The Danish FST will also have increased tasks in relation to the BRRD . <p> Please see below regarding Denmark 's participation in the Banking Union . <h> 5.2 How will the JST ( joint supervisory teams comprising national and ECB teams ) work in practice ? <p> The JSTs are a part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism ( SSM ) . It is unclear if and how the JST will work in Denmark as the Danish government is yet to decide whether or not Denmark should become part of the Banking Union . <h> 5.3 How will they impact the implementation of revised capital plans following stress tests ? <p> Usually , no withholding tax is deducted by the credit institution from any payment made under an AT1 or tier 2 CoCo instrument , except in certain cases of payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the credit institution . <p> Instruments included in section 6B of the Danish Tax Assessment Act are considered debt/receivables . <p> Capital gains on debt are taxable in accordance with the Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised upon a full or partial release from or cancellation of debt will be deemed taxable income . <h> 6.3 To what extent have local rules been changed or are expected to change to enhance tax efficiency of AT1 and T2 securities in your jurisdiction ? <p> When CRD IV/CRR were implemented in Danish legislation , section 6B of the Danish Tax Assessment Act was changed for the purpose of making AT1 instruments tax deductible . <h> 7 . Loss absorption features <h> 7.1 What type of loss absorbency features are/ will be required for AT1 and for T2 securities in your jurisdiction and what is the relevant legislation/regulation ? <p> The loss absorbency features required for AT1 and T2 securities to be treated as AT1 and T2 capital are the applicable provisions in the CRR . <p> Tier 2 capital is defined as ' gone concern capital ' , according to the CRR , and as no Danish legislation applies stricter rules to tier 2 instruments , it is not necessary that tier 2 capital is loss absorbing . <p> According to the rules in the BRRD tier 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would lead to an increase in the loss absorbency of tier 2 capital . Furthermore , if a tier 2 capital instrument is used to fulfil the credit institution 's individual solvency requirement , the tier 2 capital instrument will include a special loss absorption mechanism as described in our response to question 3.2 above . <h> 8 . Coupon payment <h> 8.1 Are there any additional local rules that would affect an issuer 's ability or its discretion to pay a coupon ? <p> There are no additional local rules that go further than the CRD IV/CRR as regards an issuer 's discretion to make a coupon payment . <h> 8.2 How are MDAs calculated , and what happens in case of a breach ? <p> Subject to section 125b , subsection 8 , the Danish FST will issue an executive order specifying the calculation of the maximum distributable amount . The FST has not yet issued such an executive order , therefore , it is not yet clear how the calculation of the MDA or breach of the MDA will be implemented under Danish law . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leverage ratio will be implemented sooner than Basel III/ CRD IV requires ? What are the relevant ratios and dates ? <p> According to the FST 's March 21 2014 announcement , Danish banks are required to submit their relevant leverage ratios every quarter . This requirement will be in force for the rest of 2014 , but the FST has not yet published the relevant ratios or dates for submissions in 2015 . <p> The FST 's view is that all qualifying AT1 capital under the CRR can count towards a credit institution 's leverage ratio . <h> 10 . Mutuals/ Sifis <h> 10.1 Have local authorities specified how mutuals can comply with regulatory requirements ? <p> As described in our response to question 2.1 above , mutuals can not obtain a banking licence under Danish law . <h> 10.2 Have additional rules and regulations been issued in relation to Sifis ? <p> Under section 308 of the Danish Financial Business Act , the FST will decide every year which Danish banks and other financial institutions will qualify as Sifis based on a number of parameters , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions can also be appointed as Sifis through a specific assessment . On June 19 2014 the FST announced that the following Danish banks and mortgage-credit banks had been appointed as Sifis : Danske Bank , Nykredit Realkredit , Nordea Bank Danmark , Jyske Bank , Sydbank and DLR Kredit . <p> None of the Danish Sifis have been appointed as either global systemically important institutions ( G-SIIs ) or other systemically important institutions ( O-SIIs ) . <p> A number of stricter rules will apply to the Danish Sifis . Under section 313 of the Danish Financial Business Act , a member of the board of directors in an Sifi can only have a limited number of other directorships . If a director is the managing director in another company , the director can only have two other directorships . If a director is not a managing director in another company , the director can have up to four other directorships . <p> The appointed Danish Sifis will also have to fulfil a systemic risk buffer , which is determined by the ministry of business and growth and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry has not yet disclosed final information on the level of the systemic risk buffer . <p> The grounds for regulation of the Sifis were compromised under a political agreement between the Danish government and a major part of the opposition . According to the political agreement , the systemic risk buffer will be between 1% and 3% of the amount of the Sifi 's total risk exposure . The systemic risk buffer will be determined individually for each Sifi and will be gradually phased in . The gradual phase-in means that a requirement of a systemic risk buffer of 1% in 2015 is converted into a requirement of 0.2% . In 2019 the systemic risk buffer will be completely phased in , and at that point a requirement of 1% will mean a requirement of 1% . <p> The systemic risk buffer will also have to be fulfilled with CET1 capital , cf. section 125a , subsection 7 of the Danish Financial Business Act . <p> It is yet uncertain whether the Sifis also will have to fulfil stricter liquidity requirements . <p> The Danish Sifis will also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Regulatory intervention <h> 11.1 What , if any , examples are there of regulatory intervention ( e.g. cases of nationalisation or restructuring ) of failing institutions ? <p> If a Danish credit institution does not fulfil the individual solvency requirement it may be met with certain restrictions from the FST . Among other things , those restrictions might mean that the credit institution is prohibited from making coupon payments on its CET1 , AT1 and tier 2 instruments and that it has to refrain from taking on any further substantial credit risk exposure until it is able to fulfil its individual solvency requirement . The FST will also require that the credit institution submits a recovery plan . <p> In 2014 four credit institutions have failed to fulfil their individual solvency requirement and have therefore been met with the above mentioned restrictions from the Danish FST . Those four credit institutions are : Vestjysk Bank , +stjydsk Bank , Vistoft Sparekasse and K++benhavns Andelskasse . Vestjysk Bank and K++benhavns Andelskasse have resumed the fulfilment of their individual solvency requirement . Vistoft Sparekasse was earlier this year merged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit institution occurred at the beginning of 2013 . The Danish bank Sparekassen Lolland was unable fulfil its individual solvency requirement and the 8% total capital ratio . Jyske Bank ( a major Danish bank ) took over all of its banking activities including clients , employees and branches of Sparekassen Lolland , but did not take over the obligations of Sparekassen Lolland 's subordinated debt and equity . The transaction was carried out as a private solution under market conditions without activating the Danish resolution regime . <p> As a result of the financial crisis a total of 62 banks in Denmark ceased operating during the period 2008 to August 2013 . Some credit institutions became distressed and have since been wound up under the auspices of the government winding-up company , Finansiel Stabilitet , while other challenged credit institutions found a private solution . Many of these credit institutions were small , and some did not cease as a direct consequence of the financial crisis . <h> 12 . Disclosure <h> 12.1 Does local regulation specify pillar 2 requirements , and what are those ? <p> The pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvency requirement and the individual solvency need . The board of directors of any credit institution in Denmark is required to calculate its individual solvency need . The solvency need is expressed as the adequate total capital as a percentage of the credit institution 's total risk exposure . <p> The FST may lay down a higher individual solvency requirement than the solvency need laid down by the board of directors . <p> As a general rule , the individual solvency requirement will be fulfilled with CET1 capital . However , if certain capital triggers are included , AT1 and tier 2 capital can also be used to fulfil the individual solvency requirement . Please see our response to question 3.2 above regarding the requirements in relation to the AT1 and tier 2 capital . <h> 12.2 If so , what are the disclosure requirements around pillar 2 , if any ? <p> Under section 4 , cf. annex 2 of executive order no. 295 of March 27 2014 on the calculation of risk exposure , total capital and solvency needs , Danish credit institutions are required to disclose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , credit institutions that are listed , or have net capital plus deposits ( arbejdende kapital ) of at least DKK 12 billion ( $2 billion ) must disclose their individual solvency needs quarterly . Other credit institutions are required to disclose their individual solvency needs twice a year . <p> Under section 354a , subsection 1 of the Financial Business Act , a Danish credit institution is required to disclose a decision from the FST regarding an individual solvency requirement . This disclosure must be made on the credit institution 's website as soon as possible , and no later than three days after the decision is made . Disclosure of the decision can be postponed if it would lead to excessive damage to the credit institution . The explanatory notes to section 354a state that if the disclosure could lead to a run on the bank , the disclosure can be postponed . However , even if the disclosure of a decision would lead to a decrease in the credit institution 's share price , loss of clients or similar , this would not justify postponement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are banks required to disclose buffer/ trigger information and what are the consequences for coupon payment if they disclose a breach ? <p> There are no specific disclosure rules regarding the breach of a contractual CET1 capital ratio trigger by a Danish credit institution . Breach of the contractual CET1 capital ratio trigger , depending on the agreed loss absorption mechanism , will have consequences for the credit institution 's ability to make coupon payments . As mentioned earlier in the questionnaire , the Danish implementation of the combined buffer requirements will first enter into force in 2015 . If a credit institution does not fulfil the combined buffer requirement , among other things , it will be required to calculate its MDA and submit this and a capital conservation plan to the FST . If the credit institution breaches the combined buffer requirement and is unable to calculate and provide the MDA and the capital conservation plan to the FST , this could lead to the credit institution being unable to satisfy its coupon payments .

CDS contracts <h> 14.1 Do local rules specify the use of credit default swaps or other tools to hedge against default or other credit events in order to lower regulatory capital requirements ? <p> As far as we are aware , neither the FST nor parliament has issued rules , guidelines or statements on the use of credit default swaps or other tools to hedge against default or other credit instruments to lower regulatory capital requirements . <h> 15 .

Most Canadian banks have now expanded , and the largest can be distinguished not by their Canadian business , but by their respective strategies abroad . <p> Canadian banks now have an exciting opportunity to further intermediate trade between emerging economies , and continue to fill a gap that we believe will be caused by global banks retrenching in a period when consistent support is needed most . <p> BMO Financial Group ( " BMO " ) , which has over 1,200 correspondent banking relationships " with 400 of those focused in Asia " emerged from the crisis as a fully North American bank after a key acquisition that expanded its U.S. footprint , with a sustained commitment to banks that serve emerging markets . <h> Canada is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and has made tremendous progress in setting the stage for increased growth .

Of note , the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Canadian-EU Comprehensive Economic &amp; Trade Agreement have the potential to increase Canadian 's access to markets and products dramatically . If both are ratified , Canada will have comprehensive trade agreements with the U.S. and E.U. " the world 's two most affluent developed markets " while increasing access to the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region . <p> In addition to trade agreements , it is becoming easier to do business through Canada . For example , in March 2015 , BMO initiated the first-ever RMB trade with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RMB ) Hub for the Americas .

The world 's largest banks have historically provided a quarter to a third of funds to support trade . However , many are evaluating their participation as the short term economics are challenged . <p> Costs of financial intermediation have risen dramatically amid new industry regulations , and the risk of non-compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation has been heightened when brokering transactions in emerging economies .

Safe , stable and highly-rated counterparties like Canadian banks can make ideal partners in the new global trade paradigm . <h> Canada and BMO Doing Their Part . <p> There is , however , still a place for those able to navigate the emerging trade landscape . <p> Intermediation through strong and stable financial institutions provides a number of benefits , including reducing risks of non-payment , providing secure cross-border payments and financing to exporters , importers and other banks , and enabling information flow . <p> Today , the same approach to regulation that helped Canadian financial institutions weather the global financial crisis has made them early adopters of conservative practises .

It is predicted that by 2030 , 25% of all electricity in Germany will be produced by wind farms , and of the total energy produced by wind farms , it is envisaged that offshore wind farms will contribute 15% . <p> At the time of writing , 21 proposed offshore wind farms in Germany have been given approvals to proceed . To date , only the first turbines of the Alpha Ventus wind farm project in the North Sea consisting of 12 turbines have been put into operation in August 2009 . The volume of offshore wind farm energy is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms currently under construction . By 2025 the overall investment in the offshore wind farm sector is expected to be between ? 32 and ? 75 billion . <p> Recent changes to the energy regulatory framework in Germany will promote the future development and growth of offshore wind farm projects . However , in light of the current global financial market conditions and the uncertainty in relation to some of the inherent project risks associated with offshore wind farms , the financing of such investments is still likely to face a number of challenges . So it is expected that the first offshore wind farm projects will be developed and financed by the major utility companies on a corporate funding basis . The market also expects that in the years to come a large amount of investments will be funded on a limited-recourse project financing basis , which will attract national and international financiers . <h> Guaranteed feed-in tariff <p> The off-take risk associated with offshore wind farm projects is addressed by the EEG , which provides a guaranteed feed-in tariff . The operator of an offshore wind farm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest public grid and to sell the electricity to the grid operator at the fixed guaranteed feed-in tariff . <p> The guaranteed feed-in tariff is payable for a period of 20 years . During the first 12 years of operation the tariff is set at 13.0 cents per kilowatt per hour ( ct/kWh ) . For offshore wind farms commissioned prior to January 1 2016 , a higher tariff of 15.0 ct/kWh is applicable . For wind farms located at a distance of more than 12 sea miles offshore and at a water depth of more than 20 metres , the period of the guaranteed feed-in tariff will also be extended by 0.5 months per full sea mile of distance extending beyond 12 sea miles and by 1.7 months for each additional full metre of water depth . For the remainder of the operation period , the base remuneration is set at 3.5 ct/kWh . <p> For offshore wind farms commissioned after December 31 2009 , the guaranteed feed-in tariff ( and the upsides mentioned above ) decreases , as from the year 2015 , annually by 5% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entitled to sell electricity outside the regulatory framework of the EEG , for example via the European Energy Exchange or the over-the-counter market . Should an offshore wind farm operator decide to sell the generated electricity into the market , it is obliged to notify the relevant grid operator with a one-month notice period and then to do so for at least a period of one month . During this time , the operator is not entitled to receive the guaranteed feed-in tariff provided for under the EEG . <h> Environmental impact <p> In order to construct and operate an offshore wind farm in Germany , a developer must obtain a licence from the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency ( or any other competent local authority if the wind farm is located in territorial waters ) . In the case of several applications for a particular licence , the licence will be granted to the first applicant to provide all of the necessary documentation , in order to prevent the blocking of all available offshore wind farm slots . <p> Before a licence is granted , developers must conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , focusing on the physical , biological and human impacts of the offshore wind farm . Offshore wind farms may not only affect the fauna beneath the surface of the water , but can also have severe consequences above sea level . Mapping of the flight of birds will have to be carried out in order to be certain that typical flight patterns do not cross the path of proposed turbine locations . Depending on the location , consideration also needs to be given to humans in the area , most specifically to visual and noise pollution . <p> The licence to construct and operate an offshore wind farm is granted in respect of a specific offshore wind farm project and does not attach to a specific person or entity , which means that the licence can be transferred by the original licence holder to third parties . This may also enable the operator to grant step-in rights to financiers of an offshore wind farm project . <h> Construction risk <p> The market considers construction risk ( including the risks associated with delays in completion and cost increases ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore wind farm projects . The risks associated with construction of offshore wind farms on time and within the budget are high . The technology risk relating to the foundation and the turbines is considered substantial , particularly as the market is demanding larger turbines that are not currently proven on completed projects . <p> Such construction and technological risks are even more applicable to offshore wind farm projects in Germany , as the proposed offshore wind farms are often located in areas where the water depth is greater than at similar sites in Europe . Furthermore , access to the site for maintenance and service is often limited due to adverse weather conditions . <p> As expected , the weather is an important risk factor associated with the success of offshore wind farm projects . The weather will be the subject of wind distribution studies that form the basis for forecasting the potential cash flows to be derived from the offshore wind farm during commercial operations . In addition , the weather will affect the performance of the construction ( including testing and commissioning ) of the offshore wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the completion timetable , delays resulting from adverse weather conditions have to be taken into account . Delays are likely to occur and need to be dealt with by adequately sizing the required cash reserves and building in sufficient buffers into the construction schedule . The parties will also have to decide on a case-by-case basis which party bears the weather risk and whether this is subject to change during the various phases of the construction of the project . <p> Another issue is the interface risk associated with construction , the extent of which will largely depend on the underlying contractual framework for construction . <p> Large infrastructure projects of a similar scale often deal with interface risks by engaging one construction contractor to engineer , procure and construct ( EPC ) on a lump-sum , turn-key , date-certain basis.But such construction arrangements for complete offshore wind farms are still rarely seen . It is still common for larger offshore wind farm projects to have a number of construction contractors rather than an EPC contractor taking single point responsibility . The contracts are typically disaggregated as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind turbine generators and the supervisory control and data acquisition system ; <p> a contract for the construction of the foundation for the wind turbine generators and other miscellaneous civil works for the development ( such a contract being similar to a typical EPC contract ) ; <p> a contract for the cables from the wind turbine generators to the sub-station including relevant work for the construction of the offshore sub-station ( such a contract being combined with the foundation contract in some projects ) ; and <p> a contract for the installation vessel . <p> As a consequence of sub-contracting the construction work to a number of contractors , the developer is left with the interface risk , including the risk of delay and disruption between the various contractors . To manage this risk , a detailed interface schedule needs to be set up regulating the main points of interface between the various contractors , laying out the responsibilities of the parties and introducing consolidation provisions for the resolution of related disputes between the contractors . Financiers of the project are also likely to request the involvement of specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction phase , active interface management under the close supervision of a technical adviser appointed by the financiers will need to be implemented . <p> In the current market environment , the construction and operation of an offshore wind farm also heavily depends on the availability of the necessary installation vessel . Ideally , the wind turbine contractor assumes this risk . But wind turbine contractors may be reluctant to assume this risk given the growing demand for offshore wind farms and the limited supply of installation vessels appropriate for installation of offshore wind farms and the risk of extended procurement due to weather and interface delays . <p> So it is worthwhile considering whether the construction of an installation vessel should also form part of an offshore wind farm project , with the option to market the installation vessel for other neighbouring offshore wind farm projects . If the installation vessel was to form part of the offshore wind farm project , the financiers are likely to require that the installation vessel is owned and operated by a separate special purpose vehicle . This vehicle then assumes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the installation vessel . <h> Grid connection risk <p> For any offshore wind farm that commences construction prior to 31 December 2015 , the grid operator is required by law to provide grid connection at its own cost and at the time when the offshore wind farm becomes operational . If the grid operator fails to do so , it can be held liable for damages incurred by the developer for not being able to connect the offshore wind farm to the grid . By implementing this requirement , the German Federal Government has taken a significant step in making offshore wind farms in Germany bankable and so minimised the risk associated with the availability of , and the investment costs relating to , the grid connection . <p> This requirement , however , challenges both the grid operator and the developer of an offshore wind farm . The investments necessary for the connection are large , leaving the grid operator to make a reliable assumption about whether and when the offshore wind farm will be operational . The German Federal Network Agency issued a position paper in April 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grid access at the time and in the required capacity when the offshore wind farm is operational . In particular , the grid operator must undertake to provide the necessary grid access once the developer is able to demonstrate that : <p> it has obtained the required permits for the offshore wind farm ; <p> it has carried out the necessary subsoil investigations for all facilities ; <p> it has set up a feasible construction schedule and has entered into preliminary purchase orders for the main components ; and <p> it has obtained a financing commitment . <p> In practice , the timely availability of the grid connection can only be achieved by a constant flow of information between the developer and the grid operator in relation to progress of the project . Milestones and a road map should also be established to ensure a timely connection to the grid . While not necessary under German law , the parties are likely to enter into a grid connection or a grid usage agreement setting out the details of the grid connection and associated liabilities . <p> Once the grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the EEG to off-take the electricity generated by the offshore wind farm . In cases of defects or any other failure of the grid connection , the grid operator is liable for any damages which arise as a consequence , unless the failure is caused by a third party or force majeure . Such risks would then need to be covered by adequate insurances . It must also be noted that the grid connection agreements typically used by the grid operators often provide for a cap of the liability of the grid operator . However , it should be considered whether such liability limits or caps are enforceable under applicable laws in Germany . <h> Security over offshore assets <p> Financiers are likely to require security in respect of any debt financing provided for the construction of offshore wind farm projects . While this is undoubtedly possible by way of granting security over the receivables in relation to the guaranteed feed-in tariff , taking security poses a challenge in relation to ( i ) the offshore components of the offshore wind farm located in the Exclusive Economic Zone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licence to construct and operate the offshore wind farm . <p> In relation to the components of the offshore wind farm located in the EEZ , the question arises whether the German statutory provisions applicable to the transfer of ownership of moveable assets are applicable in the EEZ and allow for the granting of asset security ( or the retransfer of asset security ) once the wind farm components are offshore and outside the coastal waters . Whereas the German provisions in relation to the transfer of ownership are applicable within the perimeters of the coastal waters ( reaching 12 sea miles from the coastal base line ) , the EEZ , extending beyond the 12 sea mile line and reaching 200 sea miles from the base line into the ocean , is not part of the sovereign state . <p> The EEZ is governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) , which grants the neighbouring states specific sovereign rights in relation to the EEZ . With regard to wind farms , article 56 of UNCLOS allows the generation of wind energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal state the exclusive right to construct , authorise and regulate the construction , operation and use of offshore wind farms in the EEZ . However , the convention does not explicitly grant the right to extend the civil law jurisdiction into the EEZ and it is debated in German legal literature , if and to what extent the German Civil Code is applicable in the EEZ , in particular since to date there has been no court ruling in relation to this issue and the legislator has not specifically stated that the German Civil Code should also be applicable in the EEZ . The majority of authors support the view that the German Civil Code is also applicable in the EEZ . If , however , the German Civil Law does not apply in the EEZ , a transfer of ownership by way of security or any other encumbrance would not be possible once the wind farm components are offshore . <p> Financiers may therefore require that they be granted security over the components before they are shipped into the EEZ . While in practice this may be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the components are assembled before they are brought offshore ) , this would impose the risk on the developer of a valid retransfer of the collateral upon the discharge of the debt facilities . This risk could be mitigated by introducing an additional special purpose vehicle ( AssetCo ) into the project structure that is set up to only hold title to the offshore components . This AssetCo could either be incorporated by the project company ( and security can be granted to the financiers by way of a share pledge ) or , alternatively , could be incorporated by the financier directly ( combined with the obligation to transfer the shares in the AssetCo to the developer upon the repayment of the debt facilities ) . <p> The parties could also consider setting up a trust structure , whereby the AssetCo is held by an independent trustee being obliged to transfer the shares either to the bank ( upon the occurrence of defined enforcement triggers ) or to the developer ( upon the repayment of the debt ) . <h> Multilateral institutions <p> In order to further promote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks are supporting the financing of renewable energy facilities . <p> In line with the Action Plan for EU energy policy 2007-2009 adopted in March 2007 , the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) has reinforced its commitment to foster the development of renewable energy . Its new annual target is a minimum of ? 800 million in lending facilities to renewable energy projects . It also raised its financing share of total costs for renewable energy projects from 50% up to 75% . In 2008 alone the EIB agreed to make available loan facilities in a total amount of ? 2.2 billion for renewable energy projects , a figure that has quadrupled between 2006 and 2008 . <p> In order to absorb some of the impacts of the financial crisis the German government has also launched two economic stimulus packages . Kreditanstalt fnr Wiederaufbau is making available loans of up to ? 200 million to renewable energy projects that are developed in Germany . Such loans can either be granted directly to the developer or can be made available through commercial banks .

It obtained its ( unanimous ) approval by legislators in January 2015 , and the particular details will be discussed soon by Macao Special Administrative Region ( MSAR ) legislators . <p> The reasoning underlying such changes follows the recommendations made by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes , whose report on MSAR ( Global Forum Report ) was published on November 22 2013 . The Global Forum , of which Macau is a party , was created in 2000 under the OECD and , in its own words , ' is charged with in-depth monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes ' . One of the aims of the Global Forum Report is to ascertain whether the jurisdiction parties to the Global Forum ensure that ownership and identity information for all relevant entities and arrangements is made available to their competent authorities . Under their analysis of the MSAR legal framework , they ascertained that it was open to commercial companies to issue bearer shares . They further concluded that , even though only a limited number of such shares are known to be in circulation , there are insufficient mechanisms in place to ensure the availability of ownership information under all circumstances . This situation is obviously not in line either with the MSAR commitment to implement international standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes , or with the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing ( for which this region been a keen activist ) . Therefore , the Global Forum Report recommendation was that the MSAR should ' ensure that robust mechanisms are in place to identify the owners of bearer shares or should abolish bearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve its legal framework in order to fight against tax evasion and combat money laundering " <p> A follow-up report on the steps taken by the MSAR to answer the recommendations made in the Global Forum Report should be provided soon . The MSAR deems that success in the third stage of the Global Forum evaluation is of indisputable importance for its own image and position abroad . This is particularly because failure to fulfill the requisites to succeed in such evaluation may have a negative impact on the region 's economy , scaring foreign investment " which is of paramount importance given the fact that its economy is driven by the gaming industry which guarantees the presence of world players from the industry . As a result , a decision to fully comply with the recommendations was taken . <p> However , the path chosen by the MSAR authorities to abide by the Global Forum Report Recommendations was not without criticisms : it was seen as a unilateral decision to abolish bearer shares without considering relevant alternatives . <h> Today versus tomorrow <p> Today <p> Under the existing Commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sociedade an=nima ' and partnerships limited by shares ' sociedade em comandita por act ) es ' ( public companies ) , including public companies licensed as offshore institutions , may issue bearer shares unless the Law or the articles of association provide otherwise . Under MSAR Law , instruments representing shares can be nominative or to bearer . The instruments are nominative if the shares are not fully paid , if they can not be transferred by reason of a legal provision , or if the shareholders are granted a preemption right to their transfer . <p> Bearer shares are a kind of freely transferable negotiable instrument ' tftulos de crTdito ' owned by whoever holds the physical share certificate . The holders of the bearer shares can exercise all the rights incorporated in the shares . Under section 1093 CC the transfer of a bearer instrument should be made by an agreement between the transferor and the acquirer , together with the delivery of the instrument to the transferee ; delivery is unnecessary if the transferee has already detained the instrument ( acquisition of its ownership ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded by a valid agreement or any other cause for transfer ) and the exercise of the rights inherent to them depends on their possession . On the contrary , nominative shares are transferred inter vivos , preceded by a valid agreement plus an endorsement written on the instrument itself , and entry in the book of registration of shares ( as a condition to guarantee effectiveness towards the company ) . <p> Both kinds of shares can be ordinary or preferential , meaning that ordinary shares grant the right to vote and to dividends from the distributable profits ; preferential shares do not grant the right to vote but confer the right to a priority dividend and to priority reimbursement in the distribution of the balance of liquidation . <p> Newly incorporated companies that intend to issue bearer shares should state this intention in the articles of association , which have to be submitted to the Commercial Register Bureau ( and filed with the notary ) . Further , the articles of incorporation of a public company should mention the identity of the shareholders ( or their representatives ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first holder of a bearer share may be identified . Under section 472 CC , a shareholder who ( by any form of subscription or acquisition of bearer shares ) becomes a dominant shareholder of the company , should communicate this to the company . That being said , we agree with the Global Forum Report conclusion that ' there are no clear mechanisms for public companies which have issued bearer shares to identify dominant shareholders , in cases where such shareholders do not approach the company and identify themselves ' and that : <p> Macao 's legal framework allows for the issuance of bearer shares by public companies and there are limited mechanisms that would ensure information on the holder of such shares is available . Furthermore , it is not certain whether these limited mechanisms can , in practice , enable the identification of bearer shareholders in all instances where they do not choose to disclose their identity . <p> In fact , the MSAR bearer shares legal framework allows holders to maintain total anonymity towards the company , the remaining shareholders and the general community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book identifies the holder of such shares , and this does not have to be disclosed to any entity . <p> Tomorrow <p> In order to cope with the issues addressed in the Global Forum Report , the MSAR authorities , through the Law Reform , the International Bureau and the Finances Services Bureau , prepared in October 2014 , a draft Law along with a consultation document and a justification note for public consultation . This was followed in December 2014 , by a final report with the results of such consultation . The draft Law , which general framework was already approved by legislators on January 2015 , basically abolishes the possibility of public companies issuing bearer shares , therefore amending the MSAR CC in everything that relates to this possibility , and setting a transitional arrangement for those still in possession of such shares . <p> The proposed solutions are as follows . As of the entry into force of the proposed Law , public companies ( and their shareholders ) may not : ( i ) issue bearer shares ; ( ii ) convert nominative shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inter vivos , bearer shares , except for transfers arising from an award or judicial sale . <p> The Commercial Register Bureau will ex officio , and for all public companies allowing the possibility of issuing bearer shares , endorse into the commercial registration of the incorporation of the company , the entry into force of the existing Law and the prohibition of issuing bearer shares . <p> All the holders of bearer shares should request the issuing company , within six months of the entry in force of the Law , for its conversion into nominative ( registered ) shares . The request should only be accepted if the shareholder delivers the originals of the share scripts or presents a judicial decision for the annulment of the destroyed , lost or stolen share scripts . If judicial proceedings for the annulment of the shares is started or pending during the six months conversion period , the conversion period will only start after those proceedings are res judicata . <h> " A demonstrative analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of all solutions should have been made " <p> Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares who does not request for its conversion will have all its rights as shareholder of the company suspended , being therefore temporarily precluded from exercising such rights . This means that the shareholder will not receive dividends that the company may distribute , neither will they be able to participate and vote in the general meetings that may be called . This does not mean those shareholders will stop being considered as such , neither will their share value be affected ( or the company 's share value reduced ) , nor will there be a mandatory transfer of non-converted bearer shares to the issuer company . According to the final report with the results of the public consultation prepared by MSAR authorities , the reasoning for the delay in the suspension of the shareholder 's rights ( which will only be enacted six months after the entry into force of the Law and of the immediate prohibition to transfer bearer shares ) is to grant enough time for the shareholders to create awareness of the modifications to the legal regime and to proceed with the necessary conversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the non-converted bearer share scripts are to be considered destroyed . However , the holder of such shares , or whoever may have a legitimate interest ( creditors ) may start judicial proceedings for the annulment of the destroyed shares , under the general terms set out in the Commercial and Civil Code . There were no changes to the regime on the destruction of bearer instruments or to the proceedings for annulment of the destroyed , lost or stolen share scripts . However , this might mean that potential litigation may arise from the ' automatic destruction of non-converted bearer shares solution ' set out in the Law . <p> Following the six months conversion period , if there are still shareholders who have not converted their bearer shares , the company has the duty to communicate to the Finances Bureau the number of shares in the share scripts not converted . The nonfulfillment of this duty is to be considered an administrative offence , and will be subject to the payment of a fine . <p> Further , all provisions in the Commercial Code that relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the general principles and ideas explained above . All special legislation which requires or allows the issuance of bearer shares ( registered or not ) ought to be amended to only admit the possibility of issuance of nominative shares . <h> Critical overview of the solution <p> The first criticism of the solution is that the MSAR authorities left no option other than to abolish public companies ' ability to issue bearer shares , in order to cope with the Global Forum Report recommendations . Obviously , the MSAR is expected to improve its legal framework in order to fight against tax evasion and combat money laundering and other associated crimes . Such effort is to be praised by international institutions . However , other solutions ( including those listed in the consultation document prepared by MSAR authorities ) should have been considered and a further technical and comparative analysis on other possibilities should have been made , in order to finally decide on the best path to cope with the referred recommendations . In fact , other solutions that may or may not imply custody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of all solutions should have been made . <p> Solutions that do not imply custody of share scripts ( for instance , in which the bearer assumes the obligation to communicate to the company and competent authorities on respective ownership ) or solutions of share scripts custody ( for instance , dematerialisation of securities in which the physical scripts are replaced by a book-entry system , or mere deposit of the physical scripts within a financial institution with the encumbrance of registering any change of ownership reported ) were not considered by MSAR authorities . <h> " The new legal regime also neglects to establish the rights of creditors holding bearer shares as security " <p> The disadvantages listed in the consultation document regarding the alternative solutions of non-custody of share scripts ( in which the bearer would assume the obligation to communicate to the company and competent authorities on respective ownership ) are no different to the risks that , within the existing legal framework , are associated with nominative shares . In fact , both the obligation of the shareholder to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and the risk of non-fulfilment of such duty , occur with bearer and nominative shares . Therefore , it was not demonstrated , as it should have been , that the obligations or risks associated with bearer shares subject to a registration ( and also to a custody arrangement ) are less bearable than the risks normally associated with nominative shares . In any event , a possible solution could consist of the first emission of the shares being officially registered by the issuer company ( never forgetting that under the Law , the articles of incorporation should always mention the identity of the shareholders and the capital subscribed by each shareholder ) . In this way , the breach of the duty to report future transfers would necessarily preclude the transferee from exercising its shareholding rights , whilst the company registration would still list the transferor as the holder of the shares . <p> The reasons sustained under the consultation document for not choosing alternative solutions other than abolishing bearer shares are clearly insufficient . However , MSAR authorities decided this would be the way forward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one can only focus on the solution proposed , which is not flawless . <p> As detailed above , as of the entry into force of the proposed Law , it is void to transfer inter vivos bearer shares . Differently , only after a six months period , the holder of non-converted bearer shares , will have all its rights , as shareholder , suspended ( being therefore temporarily precluded from exercising such rights ) . In practical terms , this means that even though the shareholding rights are not suspended as of the entry into force of the Law , one of the distinctive rights in a negotiable instrument " the circulation rights of the share script " are immediately precluded . <p> This problem might have been surpassed if , from the entry into force of the new Law , the exercise of the shareholding rights by anyone other than the individual whose identity is ascertained under section 418 <p> CC ( which is also about to be deleted ) , would be subject to previous and nominative registration of any transfers made from that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not applicable when judicial proceedings for the annulment of the destroyed , lost or stolen share scripts are started . In fact , the preclusion of the circulation rights of the share script means that , from that moment onwards , the share scripts lose , in absolute terms , their nature as negotiable instruments per se . Therefore , conflicts may arise until the final destruction ( section 6 of the draft Law ) of the non-converted bearer share scripts . <p> The new legal regime also neglects to establish the rights of creditors holding bearer shares as security . <p> It should also be stressed that endorsing ( within the commercial registration of the incorporation of the company ) the entry into force of the existing Law and of the prohibition of issuance of bearer shares is , even though a first for the MSAR , completely useless . <h> Final notes <p> The MSAR is expected to improve its legal framework in order to fight against tax evasion and combat money laundering and other associated crimes . Following the Global Forum Report recommendations may be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust mechanisms are in place to identify the owners of bearer shares ' or that bearer shares are abolished are , without doubt , an important step in the fight . However , the solution proposed by the MSAR legislator lacks a more profound analysis , in particular regarding its alternatives , which have been neglected in the proposed Law and public discussion . In fact , the solution to absolutely abolish bearer shares : ( i ) does not comprise any relevant advantage and suffers from the same drawbacks as alternative solutions under a comparative law perspective ; ( ii ) provides in some of its features solutions that are inconsistent with other provisions of the Law ; and , lastly , ( iii ) is not expected to offer a significant contribution towards the final aim . <p> Jopo Nuno Riquito is the founder and managing partner of Riquito Advogados .

The right to repurchase can only be given for a maximum of five years . <p> The above provision and other related provisions in the Indonesian Civil Code deal with tangible goods , but they also apply to transactions on intangibles when possible ( that is , as long as the context of the provision is relevant ) . <h> Recharacterization <p> The Indonesian court of justice may , by itself , or on claim of and burden of proof borne by the seller , recharacterize the transaction as a lending vehicle , that is , as a loan with security over the sold claims , if : <p> the purchase price of the goods is much lower than the actual value/market price ; <p> the seller continues to possess the goods as a lessee or otherwise ; <p> after the five-year limit ( for repurchase ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) agreement ; or <p> the seller undertakes to bear taxes imposed on the sold goods . <p> If , for example , the seller retains the right to the income generated under the underlying assets of the transaction , the possibility of recharacterization increases . <p> If the transaction is recharacterized , the transfer of the securities could be regarded as a fiduciary transfer/assignment of receivable/claims for security purposes . A consequence of this finding would be that the buyer , unless permitted by court to gain ownership of the encumbered assets at a price determined by court , may not become the true owner of the securities , but instead must sell the encumbered assets through auction ( unless the court permits otherwise ) . This restriction protects the debtor against unfair pricing of the encumbered assets . <p> However , if the encumbered assets comprise of goods or securities tradable in certain ready markets or on the stock exchange , the sale may be carried out in these places provided that it is carried out by two brokers with expertise in the trading of those types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount must be returned to the seller . <p> However , a court decision has been made in the past in relation to a transaction between a lender and an unsophisticated debtor ( who was in an emergency situation ) and in that case the court 's approach was to protect the interest of the borrower . <p> If the transaction is recharacterized , there will be new exposure , that is , the tax on the price differential , which would be treated as taxable interest . <p> The possibility of the transaction being recharacterized as a loan secured by fiduciary security is remote , due to the promulgation of Law 42 of 1999 , which determines strict requirements for a creation of a fiduciary security . <h> Formality <p> In dealing with Indonesian counterparts , one would also need to observe the rules relating to the capacity and authority of the counterparty . In general it can be said that the rules can be verified from two sides : ( a ) in the counterparty 's articles of association ; and ( b ) the law , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain transactions due to its type of undertaking . <p> In general there is no limitation on the capacity ( that is , legal or corporate power ) of an Indonesian party to enter into such transactions ( assuming it is a limited liability company , or a PT ( Perseroan Terbatas ) , which under Indonesian law is the only business entity to have separate legal entity status ) . It is always advisable to check a PT 's articles of association to ensure this is the case . <p> A limitation , if any , in the articles of association might be in the provisions on the objectives and purposes of the PT , because these provisions would have restrictive character and limit the PT 's capacity to act . Because a PT is established solely to realize its objectives , its power ( and personality ) extends only this far . Therefore , acts by a PT that fall outside its express or implied objectives ( ultra vires ) are , in principle , void . However , an act that would be ultra vires under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's express or implied objects ( intra vires ) if the third party dealing with the PT acts in good faith and with reasonable care . Reasonable care means the provisions of the PT 's articles of association must be reviewed and followed carefully . <p> When dealing with a PT , it is always advisable to have copy of : ( i ) its deed of establishment/articles of association ( as amended ) ; ( ii ) a statement about its shareholdings and the names of its shareholders ( with a copy of the shareholders register book , if any ) , and a certificate of incumbency ( with a copy of the shareholders ' resolution appointing each member of its board of directors and board of commissioners ) ; ( iii ) corporate approval ; ( iv ) if the signatory is not a member of the board of directors with the power to represent the PT under its articles of association , the power of attorney granted to the signatory by the person who has such power ; and ( v ) a specimen of the signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commissioners ( in particular those who sign the agreement , the corporate approval , and the power of attorney ) and the authorized person under the power of attorney . <p> As regards corporate approval , under the standard articles of association of a PT , corporate approval would be required for the PT to borrow or lend money , transfer , assign , encumber its substantial assets , or issue a corporate guarantee . However , it is now suggested that , in cases where the PT 's risk in the transaction is high ( such as in derivative transactions ) , corporate approval should be requested because absence of approval could give the Indonesian parties an opportunity to escape from their obligations in a derivative transaction by claiming a lack of authority on the part of the signatories . The relevant provision in the standard articles of association has been interpreted to cover all actions creating liabilities to the PT ( this is incorrect because it can go beyond that ) . Corporate approval is required from the requisite member(s) of the board of commissioners . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its board of commissioners or its general meeting of shareholders that prohibit it from entering into any of the subject transactions . <p> In general , to determine if whether an Indonesian counterparty is restricted from entering into the transaction , its type of business and the type of securities being transacted would need to observed . In general the difference in treatment is based on whether the counterparty is : ( a ) a commercial bank ; ( b ) a finance company ; ( c ) a securities company ; ( d ) a mutual fund ; ( e ) a pension fund ; ( f ) an insurance company ; and ( g ) a state-owned company . Special note should be taken when the Indonesian counterparty is a state-owned company ? certain particular limitations on the capability , or requirement of consent or approval , might be imposed . <h> Restriction on Indonesian counterparties <p> In general , whether or not there is any restriction on an Indonesian counterparty 's ability to enter into the transaction will depend on the counterparty 's type of business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia ( that is , commerical banks established under Indonesian law and foreign bank branches operating in Indonesia ) are not allowed to engage in equity investment other than : 1 ) in other financial institutions such as banks , finance companies , pension funds ; or ( 2 ) investment in the equity of its debtor for the sole purpose of rescuing it and as part of its restructuring in the event of credit failure . Banks may , however , purchase liquid marketable securities ( such as listed shares , bonds , and commercial papers ) as their secondary reserve ( their primary reserve being cash or cash equivalent ) . <p> The liquidity of the securities is measured/determined by : <p> tenor of the securities ( the shorter the tenor , the more liquid they are ) ; <p> whether or not the securities are listed ( if listed , they are regarded as more liquid . Equity securities must be listed ) ; and <p> rating of the securities ( the higher the rating , the more liquid they are ) . <p> Ratings made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Moody 's , should refer to provisions regarding the rating of marketable securities and bonds ( surat berharga komersial dan obligasi ) stipulated by Bank Indonesia as a comparison . <p> There is no restriction or prohibition on banks purchasing securities denominated in foreign currency and/or issued by non-Indonesians . However , banks can not grant credit facilities ( a bank 's primary activity ) to non-Indonesians . <p> So Indonesian commercial banks are , subject to the Indonesian central bank 's regulations on repos between such banks and the central bank , allowed to enter into repo transactions . <h> Finance companies <p> Finance companies ( that is , companies undertaking leasing , factoring , credit card issuance , consumer financing and , for this purpose , venture capital ) are subject to the supervision of the Minister of Finance and Bank Indonesia . Similar to banks , finance companies are allowed to invest in liquid marketable securities . They may also purchase securities denominated in foreign currency ( including US dollars ) issued by non-Indonesians . The rules on the **25;875;TOOLONG of liquidity of securities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now subject to the supervision of Bank Indonesia ) in general . <h> Securities companies <p> There is no regulation in Indonesia that restricts or prohibits securities companies ( that is , companies that undertake securities underwriting , securities brokerage and investment management ) purchasing or investing in securities denominated in foreign currency , whether issued by Indonesian residents or not . However , because they are all subject to the requirement to maintain ( daily ) certain adjusted net working capital ( which affects the adjusted fair market value of all securities in their portfolio ) , the purchase/investment should not breach that requirement . Also , the securities they purchase/invest in should have a fair market value , which implicitly means their fair market value is determinable on a daily basis . <p> Depending on the type of the underlying securities , securities companies in Indonesia may in general enter into repo transactions . <h> Mutual funds <p> There are two types of mutual funds in Indonesia : corporate mutual funds and collective investment contract funds ( CIC funds ) . <p> In relation to securities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are defined as " Securities issued outside Indonesia , whether listed or not listed , whether issued by an Indonesian issuer or a non-Indonesian issuer " ) ; <p> purchase securities ( other than Bank Indonesia certificates ) worth more than 10% of the net asset value of the mutual funds at the time of purchase ; <p> purchase securities that are not publicly offered , except money market securities ; and <p> issue bonds or debt securities . <p> The meaning of foreign securities has in practice been altered a little due to lobbying by fund managers . It now does not include listed securities issued by an Indonesian issuer outside Indonesia . <p> It is the spirit of the capital market laws and regulations that an Indonesian mutual fund should not raise its capital for re-investment through borrowing ( except short-term borrowing in connection with the settlement of transactions if it does not exceed 10% of the portfolio value of the fund at the time of purchase ) . So mutual funds can not enter into repo transactions . <h> Insurance companies <p> The admitted assets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of invested assets and non-investment assets . The invested assets may be in the following form ( the allowable investments ) : <p> term-deposit and/or certificate of deposit , which in each bank can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; <p> certificates of Bank Indonesia ; <p> shares listed in : ( i ) Indonesian stock exchanges , which for each issuer can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; and ( ii ) foreign stock exchanges , which for each issuer can not exceed 10% of the total investment ; <p> bonds listed in : ( i ) Indonesian stock exchanges , which for each issuer can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; and ( ii ) foreign stock exchanges , which for each issuer can not exceed 10% of the total investment ; <p> certificate deposit and marketable securities issued by or guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia ; <p> investment fund units , the aggregate of which can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; <p> direct investment , which in total can not exceed 10% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , the aggregate of which can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; <p> loans secured by security rights on land ( mortgage loans ) , the aggregate of which can not exceed 20% of the total investment ; <p> ( insurance ) policy loans , the aggregate of which can not exceed 80% of the ( cash ) value of the relevant ( insurance ) policy . <p> The allowable investments in one party should not exceed 25% of the total investment , except in marketable securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia , or Bank Indonesia certificates . <p> Insurance companies ( and reinsurance companies ) are now allowed to invest their assets offshore but only within the limits set out in Article 12 of the Decree mentioned above , that is , direct investment in an insurance company , listed equity securities and listed bond ( debt securities ) that have a rating of at least A. The aggregate offshore investment must not exceed 20% of its total investment . <p> Insurance companies ( and reinsurance companies ) are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedging , as stipulated in Article 20 of the Decree , that is , only with a bank that has a rating of at least A and not before first notifying the proposed transaction to the Director-General of Financial Institutions .

The transaction can only be entered into if there is no response/comment from the Director-General within 14 days of notification . <p> Based on the above , an Indonesian insurance company may enter into a repo transaction without prejudice to the limitation on investment . <p> money market securities ( SBPU ) issued by an Indonesian legal entity ( that is not founder or co-founder , and not an affiliated party , of the pension fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bank ; <p> direct equity investment in an Indonesian company ; <p> acknowledgement of indebtedness issued by an Indonesian legal entity ; <p> land and buildings in Indonesia . <p> Total investment in any one party may not exceed 10% of the total aggregate investment of the relevant pension fund ( this is the only limit on the amount of investment in ( b ) above ) . <p> Pension funds may not purchase foreign securities . <p> However , in accordance with Article 31 of the Pension Fund Law ( which says that a pension fund is not allowed to borrow or encumber its assets as security for indebtedness ) , and in relation to the transaction 's risk of recharacterization risk , it is not likely that an Indonesian pension fund could enter into a repo transaction . <h> State-owned companies <p> State-owned companies are established for specific objectives and purposes , and are public-welfare oriented .

But certain specific restrictions do apply under particular sector legislation , such as broadcasting and banking . <p> Trading of shares in listed companies is normally effected through licensed Indonesian brokers on a stock exchange ( but off market transactions in listed shares may be done off market ) . Increasingly , trading in Indonesian listed securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Structuring the acquisition <p> Subject to the above principles , purchasers of Indonesian shares may acquire either existing shares or invest in newly issued shares . <p> In general , acquisitions of Indonesian shares by foreign venture capital companies are subject to the ordinary investment rules described above . <p> Existing sharesIt is not uncommon for the AoA of unlisted companies to contain pre-emptive rights in favour of existing shareholders on the sale and transfer of existing shares . Shareholders ' agreements often also provide for , or elaborate on , such pre-emptive rights . In the absence of such express pre-emptive rights , existing shares may be transferred ( subject to obtaining prior BKPM approval in the case of PMA companies ) . <p> In other cases , the AoA may require approval of a general meeting of shareholders before effecting the share transfer . <p> The transfer of shares in public listed companies is not subject to pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders . <p> New sharesThe Company Law requires that increasing equity by issuing new shares must be by way of rights issue to existing shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to take up new shares . In theory , if a shareholder does not exercise its rights to take up new shares , these should be offered to employees before they are made available to third party investors . In practice , this requirement is commonly not followed . <p> The rights issue requirement for new share issues applies to both private and public companies . Rights offerings by public companies are further regulated in detail by specific regulation issued by Bapepam . <p> Debt to equity swaps/conversionsAs a consequence of the economic crisis in Indonesia , and as an exception to the general rights issue requirement described above , it has become more common for creditors of Indonesian companies to agree to accept equity in satisfaction of the debt owing to them . A debt to equity conversion is allowed where : the underlying agreement under which the indebtedness arises expressly contemplates the conversion ; and the company 's shareholders approve it . The new shares issued in these circumstances need not be first offered to the other shareholders of the company . The issuance of new shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may require approval of the MoJ . <p> To help overcome the strict rights issue requirement for new share issues by public companies , Bapepam has issued a regulation permitting debt to equity conversions in certain other circumstances . <p> Due diligenceIt is common in Indonesian M&amp;A transactions for potential purchasers to undertake pre-acquisition due diligence on the Indonesian target company . This is strongly recommended because of the dearth of public information regarding Indonesian companies , particularly private companies . It is not possible to conduct a company search of the kind international investors are accustomed to and the national Register of Companies is often incomplete . <p> In practice , conducting legal searches at courts , arbitration bodies , manpower dispute committees and land title offices requires the cooperation of the target company . Often , the relevant company must grant powers of attorney to the potential purchaser ( or its advisers ) to enable these searches to be conducted . <p> Management and corporate governance <p> Indonesian companies must have three corporate organs : <p> the general meeting of shareholders ; <p> the board of directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BoC ) . <p> The general meeting of shareholders is the highest authority in an Indonesian company and holds all powers that are not delegated to the BoD or the BoC by the AoA or the Company Law . <p> The BoD is the corporate organ that is fully responsible for the executive management of the company in the best interests of the company and in accordance with the company 's objects and purposes . The BoD represents the company subject to the AoA . <p> The president director acts , in effect , as chief executive officer of the company and normally has power to represent and bind the BoD ( and therefore the company ) , subject to the AoA and any mandatory provisions of the Company Law . But all of the directors are responsible for the management of the company and its assets . There is no concept of a non-executive director . <p> The BoC is the corporate organ that has the task of supervising , and providing advice to , the BoD in managing the company . <p> Besides its supervisory role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BoD for misconduct . Otherwise , the extent of the BoC 's authority in any specific company is derived from the AoA . The BoC does not have any general right to represent and bind the company in dealings with third parties . <p> Under the Company Law , both the BoD and BoC have a general fiduciary duty vis-a-vis the company : all their actions must be carried out " in good faith and with full responsibility in the interests of the company and its business " , even if the company 's interest would conflict with the specific interests of directors or commissioners or any shareholders . There is therefore no legally recognized concept of a nominee director representing the interests of one particular shareholder . A director and a commissioner can be personally liable for losses suffered by the company due to his failure to perform his fiduciary duties in the interests of the company . <p> Obtaining management controlAs noted above , Indonesian companies are formally managed by the BoD subject to supervision by the BoC . <p> It is possible to provide in the AoA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign shareholders ) has the right to make a binding nomination of a majority of members of the BoD ( and/or of the BoC ) . Removing this nomination would involve amendment to the AoA , which requires at least two-thirds majority shareholder approval . <p> In managing an Indonesian company , the president director is normally the pivotal position . The president director is normally given extensive powers to represent and bind the company . The AoA could provide that the president director is appointed upon the binding nomination of a particular group of shareholders . The AoA may , however , place restrictions on the president director 's authority . <p> Often BoC approval is required for certain stated actions by the company ( such as borrowing funds and encumbering assets as security ) . Therefore , depending on the terms of the relevant company 's AoA , the BoC can control certain decisions by the company . <p> As in the case of the BoD , the AoA may require that most members of the BoC can be appointed by the general meeting of shareholders upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shareholder group to have some indirect control over certain decisions by the company by controlling the BoC . <p> In addition to control of the formal management structure , it would also be possible for a shareholder to enter into a management services agreement with the company . This would assist to provide a level of de facto influence over many management and administrative functions in the company . But this can not amount to a delegation by the BoD of their formal management responsibilities . <p> Minority shareholder protection <p> Mandatory protectionsThe Company Law provides certain protections for minority shareholders . It is not permitted to contract out of these protections . They include : <p> The right to bring an action against the company for losses suffered through acts that are inequitable , unreasonable or unfair <p> The right to request the company to buy back the minority shareholder 's shares at a reasonable price if it disapproves of certain actions of the company which has caused loss to the shareholder or to the company . <p> Minority shareholder(s) controlling not less than 10% of the shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company as a result of any misconduct/negligence by the director or commissioner . <p> Shareholder approval of at least three-quarters of the voting shares if the company intends to transfer or pledge all or a substantial part of the company 's assets . <p> Minority shareholder(s) controlling not less than 10% of the voting shares may submit a petition to the court to dissolve the company . <p> Shareholder approval of at least two-thirds of voting shares for amendment of the AoA . <p> Shareholder approval of at least three-quarters of voting shares for consolidation , merger , takeover , bankruptcy and dissolution . <p> Contractual protectionsOther protections for minority shareholders may be agreed between the shareholders and in some cases can be introduced into the AoA ( with the approval of the MoJ ) . In other cases , agreed minority protections would be contained in a shareholders agreement . Often a combination of these approaches is adopted . <p> Subject to the mandatory Company Law requirements , it is normally possible , subject to MoJ approval , for the AoA to give certain rights to the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence over the company ( in some cases negative control ) , particularly where one shareholder ( or a group of shareholders acting together ) has a significant minority position . For example , the AoA might set the quorum and/or voting requirements a higher level that would , in effect , require the approval of all or some of the minority and also to restrict the powers of the BoD by listing certain matters requiring a higher level of approval ( or unanimity ) of shareholders . Also , the AoA could require that the quorum for the meetings of the BoD or the BoC must include the attendance of at least one director or commissioner appointed by the minority shareholders . <p> Takeover issues <p> Company lawCertain requirements and procedures must be complied with if an acquisition of shares falls within the meaning of takeover ( pengambilalihan ) in article 103 of the Company Law . Article 103 prescribes a procedure for acquisitions of all or a large part of the shares in an Indonesian company resulting in a change of control of the company that is initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to a direct sale by the shareholder to the purchaser . In such a situation , as the target company itself is involved in the acquisition , the BoD of the company is required to work closely with the purchaser(s) in preparing a proposal and plan for the takeover for approval by the general meeting of shareholders . Such consensual takeovers must follow the procedure set out in article 103 . Similar procedures apply in the case of merger and consolidation of Indonesian companies . <p> On the other hand , in the normal share sale and purchase situation where the acquisition is initiated by , and conducted with , the current shareholder(s) directly and involves a direct agreement between the shareholders and the purchaser , then the procedure in article 103 is expressly not applicable . <p> Tender offer for public companiesRegulation of public company takeovers is more complicated . Acquisition of a controlling interest in Indonesian public company shares may trigger the tender offer provisions under the Indonesian capital market laws . <p> The tender offer requirement applies where a party acquires 25% or more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly , the ability to control the public company by way of appointing directors and commissioners and amending its AoA . Such party will be considered a controlling party for the purpose of the takeover regulations . <p> Where there is a new controlling party of a public company , such controlling party must make a tender offer for all the issued shares of the public company other than the shares owned by any substantial ( 20% or more ) shareholders , or other controlling shareholders and certain other excepted shareholders . <p> The tender offer regulation prescribes a detailed public procedure for conducting the general offer under the supervision of Bapepam . There are a number of specific exceptions to the tender offer requirements . <p> In the event of a breach of the takeover regulations , Bapepam has the authority to cancel the transaction and require the controlling party to pay fines , return the shares to the sellers and pay compensation , or to conduct a tender offer . The new controlling party might also be liable for general criminal penalties under the Capital Markets Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale proceedsIn general Indonesian withholding tax is payable on the transfer of shares by a foreign shareholder in an unlisted Indonesian company . The tax works out to be , effectively , 5% of the gross proceeds on the sale . Where the purchaser is also a foreign entity , the local company itself would be obliged to collect the tax before the transfer can be registered . <p> This tax obligation may in many cases be rendered inapplicable by the double tax treaty relating to the tax domicile of the selling shareholder . <p> Financial assistanceIndonesia does not have specific rules prohibiting the provision by a company of financial assistance in the acquisition of its shares . But general directors ' duty issues need to be considered in this context . Also , under applicable Bapepam regulation a public company is prohibited from entering into any conflict of interest transaction with or involving certain related parties without first obtaining independent shareholder approval . <p> Employee rights on change of ownership <p> One increasingly common and sensitive issue in Indonesian M&amp;A transactions relates to the rights of employees . Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesian employment laws regarding termination and severance payments are complex and require careful consideration in the circumstances of each particular transaction . These are not described in detail here . But , as relevant to share acquisitions , if there is a change of ownership in a company , each employee is entitled to elect whether or not he wishes to continue employment with the company under the new owner . If he decides not to continue with the employment , then the company must provide a severance package in an amount not less than the statutory prescribed package . If the employee decides to stay , then legally he is not entitled to receive the severance package . <p> If upon a change of ownership the employer decides to terminate employees , a larger prescribed severance package is payable . <p> The concept of change of ownership in the regulations is imprecise , and could be interpreted broadly . At the simplest level , a change in direct registered shareholder would trigger the employee 's right of election above .

Regulatory framework <h> 1.1 What is the applicable legislation and who enforces it ? <p> The government agency in charge of merger control in Indonesia is the Business Competition Supervisory Commission , commonly known as the KPPU . <p> Merger control in Indonesia is governed under Law number 5 of 1999 on the prohibition of monopolistic and unfair competition practices ( Antitrust Law ) , as further implemented by government regulation number 57 of 2010 ( GR No 57 ) . To further implement GR No 57 , the KPPU issued guideline number 2 of 2013 ( guideline no 2 ) . In these guidance notes , we refer to the above three pieces of legislation combined as the merger rules . <p> It is important to note that , unlike the practice in many other countries , the merger rules apply to post-merger notification . <h> 1.2 What types of mergers and joint ventures ( JVs ) are caught ? <p> Mergers , consolidations and/or acquisitions of non-affiliate parties that result in an asset and/or sale value exceeding certain thresholds all fall within the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share acquisitions , GR No 57 applies only to transactions resulting in a change of control .

In this regard , guideline no 2 provides that if assets/sales of a party previously exceeded the threshold but then fell below the threshold once the transaction completed , that party would not be required to file the mandatory notification . However , it would not automatically be immune from the general provisions of the merger rules . <h> 2.2 Are there circumstances in which a foreign-to-foreign merger may require notification , and is a local effect required to give the authority jurisdiction ? <p> Yes , guideline no 2 stretches the term ' merger ' to also include offshore mergers , consolidations or share acquisitions conducted between non-affiliated parties that both meet the threshold and have a direct impact on the Indonesian market . <h> 2.3 Is filing mandatory or voluntary and must closing be suspended pending clearance ?

Moreover , if a transaction is determined by the KPPU to have resulted in monopolistic or unfair competition practice , the KPPU is authorised to impose sanctions . These range from administrative sanctions to the cancellation of the transaction . <p> As the merger rules adopt the post-merger notification regime , the filing process should not hold off the closing of the transaction . <p> While the regulatory requirement is for post notification , guideline no 2 allows parties to conduct a voluntary pre-merger consultation with the KPPU .

Please comment on the authority 's approach to acceptance and implementation of remedies . <p> If during the notification assessment process the KPPU foresees a potential for monopolistic or unfair competition practices resulting from the transaction being assessed , the KPPU may offer the parties the opportunity to submit a proposal for remedies . Types of remedies that may be acceptable to the KPPU include : structural remedies , such as divestment of assets/shares , or behavioural remedies , such as granting intellectual property licences or creating competition by eliminating barriers .

@@8538481 @1738481/ <h> The Netherlands <h> Author : Published : 23 May 2005 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> Dutch special purpose vehicles are commonly used in both cross-border financing transactions as well as in Dutch domestic financing transactions . <p> As regards cross-border transactions , ( synthetic and cash ) securitizations , repackagings , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) and leasing transactions , MTN and other note issuance programmes are among the most popular transactions involving a Dutch special purpose vehicle . <p> Notable examples of structured finance transactions involving a Dutch SPV include the two Eurotunnel securitizations ( Fixed-Link Finance 1 BV and 2 BV ) , which , according to Euroweek , " are among the most complex structured financings in Europe , " and the Jazz CDO I transaction , which was awarded Collateralized Debt Obligation of the Year in 2002 by Structured Finance International . <p> Why a Dutch SPV ? <p> There are a number of reasons why The Netherlands is an attractive jurisdiction in which to set up the SPV in structured financing transactions . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ) . <p> Investor considerations also often drive the SPV location . The Netherlands is a member state of the EU , which makes a Dutch SPV attractive to European investors . Based on domestic regulations in their home country , many European investors are precluded from or restricted in investing in debt instruments issued by vehicles established outside the EU ( such as the Cayman Islands and Jersey ) . The Netherlands is also a member of the OECD . The jurisdiction of residence of the SPV has become an increasingly important issue that may seriously affect the sale of securities to regulated EU investors . <p> Also , from a reputational perspective certain investors are less comfortable with investing in a tax haven SPV than in an SPV incorporated in the EU . <p> Structure <p> A Dutch SPV typically takes the form of a BV ( besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid ) , which is a private limited liability company . A BV can be incorporated within a matter of days . The minimum share capital of a BV is 18,000 ( $22,000 ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of Dutch corporate service providers are willing to contribute this share capital out of their own pocket , provided they are appointed to provide local management and administration services to the SPV . Since March 1 2004 all Dutch corporate services providers are required to be licensed by the Dutch Central Bank and are fully subject to integrity and customer due diligence requirements , giving international investors a further layer of comfort . <p> To make the SPV an orphan company its shares are typically held by a Dutch foundation ( stichting ) . A foundation can be set up within a day and has the power and capacity to hold the issued and paid-up share capital of the SPV . A foundation does not have any members or shareholders . <p> Tax <p> Withholding taxDepending on the nature of the underlying assets and jurisdiction of residence of the underlying obligors , payments under underlying assets may be subject to withholding tax . The transfer of underlying assets to an SPV may have an effect on the withholding tax position of these payments . Depending on the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligors of these assets , payments under the underlying assets could become subject to ( increased ) withholding tax if transferred to an SPV in a tax haven jurisdiction . The transfer of the assets to a Dutch SPV may avoid such negative effect or indeed may have a positive effect on the withholding tax position of payments under the underlying assets . Under Dutch double tax treaties withholding taxes are usually substantially reduced or eliminated . The Netherlands has concluded comprehensive double tax treaties with about 80 countries and the availability of this treaty network is usually a factor in determining the location of the SPV ( for example where the SPV 's assets include Italian or Spanish asset backed securities ) . <p> As The Netherlands does generally not levy withholding tax on interest payments , payments of interest by a Dutch SPV to investors can be made gross . Interest paid on profit sharing debt , however , may be subject to Dutch withholding tax if the legal maturity of the debt exceeds 10 years . In our experience it is usually possible to structure a transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( even in respect of subordinated notes in a CDO transaction that are entitled to residual interest on an available funds basis only ) can be made without withholding . Advance confirmation from the Dutch tax authorities as to the absence of withholding is available . <p> Tax position of SPVsIncome received by the SPV is included in its corporate tax basis . However , the SPV will have a corresponding tax deduction for its expenses ( such as interest on the notes issued , fees , hedging costs and so on ) , which results in a zero taxable profit for the SPV . <p> Typically , a structured finance transaction will be structured so that the SPV earns a minimal taxable profit ( equal to the fee of the corporate services provider to the SPV ) . This does not increase the transaction cost , but does give the SPV substance , which is attractive from a cross-border tax perspective where double tax treaties offer protection . <p> VAT and other taxesIn an asset-backed transaction there is often a third party appointed as servicer or collateral manager in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If structured properly , it is virtually always possible to ensure that servicing/collateral management fees payable by the SPV are not subject to Dutch VAT . Particularly in CDO transactions it is important to avoid VAT in respect of collateral management fees not only in the issuer jurisdiction but also in the jurisdiction where the collateral manager is located . Practice has proven that a Dutch SPV is ideally placed to avoid VAT in respect of collateral management fees in both jurisdictions . <p> The Netherlands does not levy any relevant stamp duty or other documentary taxes . <p> Double tax treatiesAs mentioned above , The Netherlands is party to about 80 comprehensive double tax treaties . A Dutch structured finance SPV is entitled to the benefits of this Dutch double tax treaty network . <p> The applicability of a double tax treaty ensures that the income in respect of the underlying assets acquired by the SPV can be paid to it without any ( or at reduced ) withholding . <p> Tax treaties also reduce the risk of a collateral manager/servicer being deemed to be a permanent establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being regarded as tax resident in the jurisdiction of the collateral manager/servicer . This benefit is of particular importance in managed CDO transactions . <p> Banking laws <p> A Dutch SPV is not required to obtain a banking licence nor any consent or authorization from the Dutch banking regulatory authority for the issue of the SPV notes , provided they are exclusively offered and sold to Professional Market Parties ( PMPs ) anywhere in the world . The SPV notes can be in registered form or in bearer form without jeopardizing any tax or regulatory benefits . This is material in the context of 144A issues because a conversion of bearer notes into US depositary receipts is unnecessary for a Dutch SPV . Also , if the notes are in registered form there is no need to have the register maintained in The Netherlands . <p> The wide range of PMP categories ( including banks , insurance companies , securities firms , collective investment institutions and pension funds established and supervised or licensed in a EU member state , the USA , Japan , Australia , Canada , Switzerland or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a credit rating ) allow a Dutch SPV to tap national and international debt capital markets . A Dutch SPV can not be used to make a public offer of notes anywhere and locating the SPV in another EU member state where this restriction does not apply would still not allow its notes to be offered into The Netherlands to anyone other than PMPs . <p> If its notes have a minimum denomination of 500,000 ( or the equivalent in any other currency ) and are held at the time of issue through a reputable clearing system ( such as Euroclear , Clearstream of DTC ) ( safe harbour notes ) , all that a Dutch SPV need do is verify the PMP status of the initial purchasers or investors known to it ( typically the managers or dealers ) on the basis of information obtained from certain permitted sources . The initial purchasers are free to sell safe harbour notes to anyone . <p> If the notes ( or certain classes of notes ) have a denomination below 500,000 , the transaction documentation and the notes should include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only offered and sold to PMPs . Therefore , it is wrong to say that an SPV based in The Netherlands can only issue notes with denominations of 500,000 or more . Denominations can be as low as needed ( even as low as 1,000 ) provided some simple steps are followed in the issue documentation . Many structured finance deals and CDOs have been closed after the new rules on SPVs took effect in July 2002 with low denominations ( or at least one class of such notes ) without any difficulty . <p> Regardless of whether the notes are safe harbour notes or not , the SPV will not be subject to reporting requirements to the Dutch banking regulator ( except for any changes to its management and some minor foreign exchange reporting for statistical purposes ) . <p> A Dutch SPV 's regular debt funding under loan facilities ( for example , during the warehouse phase or under liquidity facilities ) , is subject to the general requirement that lenders should qualify as PMPs and be verified as such by the Dutch SPV . <p> Underlying assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing any asset anywhere in the world and such assets do not have to be held or located in The Netherlands upon acquisition . It can purchase ( participations in ) existing loans , grant new loans , acquire debt or equity securities ( including asset-backed or CDO securities ) . The only restriction in this regard is that an SPV ( whether Dutch or foreign ) , generally , can not acquire ( participations in ) loans to Dutch corporate borrowers before it qualifies as a PMP . The easiest category of PMP available to an SPV is the rated entity PMP , where the SPV has issued rated instruments or has itself obtained a rating . There is no minimum level of rating and not all notes it issues need to be rated . <p> The SPV 's assets may further be managed by a servicer or manager located either in or outside of The Netherlands ( subject to the licensing requirement mentioned below ) . <p> Because the SPV normally issues rated notes only at closing , loans to Dutch borrowers should be kept on another party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the Dutch SPV can also not be the economic owner prior to closing ( that is , the SPV should not bear the risk on any price fluctuation prior the closing date ) . The same restriction applies : ( a ) to any foreign SPV and ( b ) to investments in notes issued by another Dutch SPV , unless these are safe harbour notes . <p> Securities laws <p> A Dutch SPV is not required to obtain a licence nor any consent or approval from the Dutch securities regulatory authorities for the distribution of offering documentation nor for the offering and sale of the notes anywhere in the world if the notes have a minimum denomination of 50,000 or ( for lower denominations ) if they are offered to professional investors ( that is , PMPs that also trade or invest in securities in the conduct of a business or profession ) . In either case , a Dutch SPV will also be exempt from all prospectus and continuous reporting requirements under Dutch securities laws . <p> In structuring a transaction , care should be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch SPV is authorized to conduct business in The Netherlands , either by having a local Dutch licence or - for EU entities - by having their domestic licence for the relevant services passported under the Investment Services Directive or under the Banking Directive , as applicable , or by relying on exemptive relief . This typically applies to a collateral manager , any securities lending agents , all hedge and swap counterparties , synthetic security counterparties and credit default swap counterparties . For transactions that have a financial guarantee provider and the guarantee is drafted as an insurance product , such entity should also be licensed or - if it is an EU insurer - have permission to carry out its activities in The Netherlands . Normally , the time frame of a transaction is enough to arrange for passporting for EU entities if these have not done so for The Netherlands . Exemptive relief is available in certain circumstances for unlicensed securities service providers , based for example in non-EU jurisdictions , to provide services to the Dutch SPV without violating Dutch securities laws . <p> Dutch SPVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any interim financial statements as a matter of Dutch law . By limiting the offering of their notes to PMPs or ( for non-safe harbour notes with denominations below 50,000 ) to professional investors qualifying as PMPs they are exempt from such financial reporting duties . This represents a significant cost saving compared to other jurisdictions where such reporting duties are imposed on local SPVs . <p> The regulatory requirements outlined above are likely to be liberalized in the near future as the banking regulatory authority has announced that it will amend its PMP rules before the summer of 2004 to take into account market experience over the past two years . One of the proposed amendments may well be a reduction of the safe harbour threshold to 100,000 . Further amendments may be discussed during the consultation process of the next three to four months . Once this is achieved the pre-eminent position of The Netherlands as an SPV location will be further enhanced . <h> About the authors <h> Frank Graaf <h> Clifford Chance <p> Frank Graaf has been a partner since 1990 and is head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@8538482 @1738482/ <h> Regulatory framework for private equity investing in Indonesia <h> Author : Published : 1 Nov 2012 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> In recent years , private equity firms ( PEFs ) have played a significant role in the global economy including in Indonesia . <p> Certain jurisdictions , such as the US , the UK , India and China , differentiate the regulations or rules applicable to sophisticated ( qualified ) investors and non-sophisticated investors . Indonesian laws and regulations , however , do not make such a distinction . All investors will be deemed as investors in general , notwithstanding the fact that they could be sophisticated investors , strategic investors or financial investors . In other words , there are no specific regulations or rules that specifically govern the rights and obligations of sophisticated or qualified investors . All investors are deemed the same and will need to be protected equally . <p> Due to the lack of regulation , PEFs do not have to form any entity in Indonesia in order to conduct their activities . In any event , the types of entity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hold sufficient appeal . The types of entity under Indonesian law that perhaps can be used to conduct private equity activity are the investment manager securities company and the venture capital company . The investment manager company must be in the form of an Indonesian limited liability company licensed by the Capital Market and Financial Institution Supervisory Board/Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal &amp; Lembaga Keuangan ( Bapepam-LK ) , and are subject to stringent regulations . <p> Venture capital companies , on the other hand , are a type of financing institution whose main activity is to provide financing or conduct shares participation in an investee company for a maximum of 10 years for the purpose of developing the investee company . This company is also under the auspices of Bapepam LK . It must take the form of a limited liability company or cooperative and must be licensed by Bapepam-LK on behalf of the Minister of Finance . A foreign business entity may own up to 85% shares of the total issued capital of the venture capital company . There are currently less than 20 venture capital companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity , none of which are well-known local or global PEFs . <p> In addition , tax considerations constitute an important reason for using a company as a shareholding entity in an Indonesian company that holds assets that interest a PEF . In this case , PEFs usually hold their Indonesian investments through companies set up in a tax treaty or haven country ( such as Singapore , the Netherlands , or the Cayman Islands or BVI ) , thus allowing the payment of any dividend , interest or fee at the most attractive tax rates . The decision to include such jurisdiction may also be due to the availability of companies that are easily manageable through professional directors or nominees . Setting up in a tax haven country may also allow for a certain level of anonymity that the PEF may want to have , especially if the Indonesian assets are publicly listed companies . <p> A lack of regulations applicable for the establishment and nature of PEF in Indonesia has resulted in a number of global PEFs entering the Indonesian market by establishing cooperation arrangements with Indonesian local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds established outside of Indonesia . Notwithstanding the above , within the last few years , PEFs have been actively involved in investments in Indonesia . The investments made by PEFs are largely in M&amp;A in the fields of retail , pharmaceutical , energy , mining , infrastructure and communications . Foreign PEFs that have a presence in Indonesia include Texas Pacific Group , Avenue and CVC , and there is a long line of foreign PEFs that are chasing opportunities to enter the Indonesian market . <p> We set forth below several applicable regulations that should be considered by PEFs in pursuing investments in Indonesia . Some of these can be deemed as barriers to entry , while others may be seen as incentives to conduct investment in Indonesia . <h> Foreign shareholding limitation <p> The basic concept is that all business fields are open for foreign investment , except for certain fields that are stated by the relevant laws as being closed or open with requirements . In this regard , the Government has issued President Regulation No. 39 of 2010 on the ' List of Business fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditionally Open for Investments ' , also known as the ' Investment Negative List ' ( this can be accessed at www.bkpm.go.id ) . The Investment Negative List provides a list of certain business fields that are open with certain requirements , such as maximum foreign shareholding percentages . <p> The Investment Negative List does not apply to non-direct investment or portfolio investment transacted through the stock exchange . The Capital Investment Coordinating Board/Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal ( BKPM ) and Bapepam-LK have different views on what should be considered as ' non-direct investment ' . Notwithstanding , this has been interpreted in the market that foreign shareholding restrictions are not applicable for investments made by foreign parties in publicly listed entities in Indonesia . We note that there are several publicly listed entities whose foreign shareholding exceeds the threshold as determined by the Investment Negative List , but who so far have never been questioned by BKPM . <p> Foreign shareholding in financial sectors ' entities is regulated by laws and regulations other than the Investment Negative List . Foreign parties may currently own up to 99% shares in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% in an insurance company and 85%-99% in a securities company . <h> Regulatory approval <p> Except for financial institutions that are governed by specific laws and regulations , under the Investment Law , a foreign party may own a non publicly listed Indonesian limited liability company in the form of a foreign investment company or PT Penanaman Modal Asing . Any investment made into a foreign investment company is subject to BKPM approval . <p> Investments in certain other specific areas are governed by government authorities other than BKPM . For example , foreign investment in banks is regulated by Bank Indonesia ( the Indonesian central bank ) ; foreign investment in securities companies , multifinance companies and insurance companies is regulated by Bapepam-LK and the Minister of Finance ; while foreign investment in the upstream oil and gas sector is regulated by BP Migas/Pertamina . Any investment made in these types of entities will be subject to the approval of the relevant regulator . The process could be cumbersome in certain areas . For example , the regulatory approval process for bank acquisitions may take anywhere from three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several regulatory regimes , particularly in financial sector , only allow individuals or legal entities to hold shares in an Indonesian entity . As such , if the direct entity that will be used for the investment is in the form of a partnership , then this will lengthen the regulatory approval process as the regulator will need to understand the structure of the investor first . <p> In addition , regulations in the financial sector require the shareholders of a bank to have a net equity that is ( i ) 100% equivalent with its investment in a bank , and ( ii ) 200% equivalent with its investment in a multifinance company . That said , the Indonesian regulator will not entertain any SPV used by PEFs that does not meet such requirements . <h> Disclosure requirement <p> PEFs usually use a special purpose vehicle specifically set up for the purpose of a specific investment in a country . In the financial sector , the regulations require full disclosure all the way up to the ultimate controller of the acquiror . In the context of PEFs , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner who has control over the PEF , and also to disclosure of the limited partners participating in the investment . <p> In certain transactions , the tendency is not to disclose the ultimate controller or the general partner . This reluctancy will usually cause a prolonged regulatory approval process . <h> Mandatory tender offer <p> In acquiring more than 50% shares in a publicly listed entity , or a lower percentage of shares but control over a target , a PEF is required to conduct a mandatory tender offer for the shares held by the public shareholders . This is followed by a sell down requirement that will be discussed further below . <p> If a PEF owns 80% of the paid-up capital of a publicly listed entity as a result of a mandatory tender offer ( subsequent to a takeover ) , it is obligated to transfer the shares of that company to the public . This is so that shares owned by the public are at least 20% of the paid-up capital of the publicly listed entity and are owned by at least 300 parties . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of the implementation of a mandatory tender offer , except where the publicly listed entity in question has already undertaken the necessary corporate actions to ensure such conditions are fulfilled . If , however , 80% of the paid-up capital threshold is passed by the takeover alone ( which triggers the mandatory tender offer requirements in the process ) , then the sell down requirement will be limited to that portion of shares acquired during the mandatory tender offer " although the requirement for 300 parties will apply equally . <p> The two-year period abovementioned can be extended by Bapepam LK in certain circumstances , including when the share price at the time of the sell down is the same as or higher than the tender offer price , and/or the new controlling shareholder has made efforts to sell down the shares but fails to achieve the size required under the regulation . <p> This sell down requirement has in fact become the most considered issue by investors , including PEFs , when acquiring publicly listed entities in Indonesia . <h> Investment period <p> PEFs tend to make investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is generally not an issue for investment in many businesss sectors , since there is no law imposing a certain ' lock-up ' period for the investment . However , in the banking sector , the regulation allows Bank Indonesia to impose such a lock-up period and , in practice , this is usually for a minimum of five years for investment in Indonesian banks . <h> Insider trading <p> PEFs are usually structured like webs whereby one general partner manages different funds . As such , a fund used by a PEF when conducting investment in Indonesia usually has affiliates worldwide . When conducting investment , a PEF tends to become the substantial shareholder in a publicly listed entity that is privy to insider information of the entity . It is important to ensure that such insider information is not leaked to a PEF 's affiliates , or those affiliates may be subject to Indonesian insider trading restrictions . <h> Funding readiness <p> A PEF has committed funds and certain processes to conduct a capital call to its limited partnership . In the context of bank acquisitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to a bank in the event that it is facing difficulties in its operation . This may cause a problem to a PEF in the event that the committed funds have all been used or the limited partners do not approve the capital call . <h> Capital gain tax <p> There is a large difference in capital gain tax incurred by a seller when selling shares in a private company and a publicly listed company . A sale of shares in a private entity will cause a seller to be subject to a capital gain tax of between 25% and 30% . However , a sale of shares conducted at the stock exchange will cause a seller to be subject to a capital gain tax of 0.1% or 0.6% ( for founder shares ) . Given the large difference , an approach that is always considered by a PEF is to conduct an exit once the acquired entity has become listed at the stock exchange . <p> This particular issue also has an impact during the entry of investment whereby , in certain cases , a PEF may only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made listed " in which case a seller will obtain the much lower capital gain tax . <h> Summary <p> Some market players may view that the regulatory framework in Indonesia could form a barrier for foreign PEFs to invest in Indonesia . Others may see that the applicable rules are somewhat ' manageable ' , and there are various possible transaction structures that can be considered to help PEFs achieve their purpose when conducting investment in Indonesia . <p> Notwithstanding the above , Indonesia , with its vast natural resources and home of approximately 240 million people , is expected to be the fastest growing economy alongside China and India . Therefore , Indonesia is still considered as one of the key emerging markets that attracts PEFs from all over the world . <p> Kuntum Apriella Irdam became a junior partner of MDC in April 2010 and specialises in M&amp;A and corporate commercial matters . <p> First joining MDC in January 2003 , Irdam has in the last six years been actively involved in numerous bank acquisitions in Indonesia and also acquisitions of other types of financial institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory banking and corporate governance and commercial transactions generally . <p> Irdam holds a law degree from the University of Indonesia ( 1999 ) and a master of law degree from Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam , The Netherlands ( 2004 ) .

However , mortgages can be granted over Land Use Rights ; the mortgagor must deliver the certificate of Land Use Rights into the possession of the mortgagee which , by implication , does not equate to delivery of the underlying property . <p> Pledges , however , are often preferred to mortgages and regarded as a superior form of security interest when it comes to LLC ownership interests . This is because , under the Civil Code , a pledgee is expressly entitled to " exploit , and enjoy the benefits and income derived from , the pledged property , if so agreed " . <p> Therefore the parties may enter into pledge agreements , in respect of shares , pursuant to which the pledgee is entitled to : <p> ( i ) exercise the voting rights attaching to the pledged shares ; and <p> ( ii ) receive any dividends paid in connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil Code relating to mortgages , and accordingly , no express legislative basis for entry into mortgage agreements providing for the exercise by the mortgagee of voting and dividend rights . <p> Borrowers and lenders often wish to enter into security arrangements under which the lender , as the secured party , may exercise voting and dividend rights attaching to the secured property , if so agreed . The question is whether it is technically possible to do so in respect of LLC ownership interests . <p> In practice , LLC ownership interests are often pledged , including under pledge agreements affording the pledgee the right to exercise the voting and dividend rights attaching to the pledged interest . The National Agency for the Registration of Secured Transactions in Vietnam has also regularly evinced a readiness and willingness to register such pledges and pledge agreements . <p> Each proposed security arrangement in Vietnam must be carefully considered and analysed on the basis of its own particular circumstances .

The test is whether the company , in these situations , would still be able to fulfil all its obligations as regards the insured without resorting to any counter measures . <p> Some companies apparently failed the test . This is understood to be an early-warning system to prompt insurers to take timely measures avoiding this problem . This led to extensive - and exaggerated - coverage by the media , causing some incertitude among the insured .

The legislator thus decided not to change the substantive laws underlying supervision and the structure of BaFin takes account of the differences .

The QII exemption allows certain types of solicitation activities and fund management activities to be conducted without registration under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ) by satisfying certain requirements prescribed in the FIEA ( such as having at least one qualified institutional investor ( QII investor ) and a maximum of 49 non-QII investors in Japan ) . However , there have been reports of fraudulent fundraising activities that evaded the supervision of the authorities by utilising the QII exemption . As a result , the Japanese regulator moved to tighten the regulation of investment funds utilising the QII exemption . On March 24 2015 , a bill for the amendment of the rules regarding the QII exemption was submitted to the Japanese Diet , and the new rules are expected to be force in the near future . <p> The main changes to the QII exemption are as follows : ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using the QII exemption has been increased ; ( ii ) certain code of conduct rules and reporting rules applied to registered investment funds will also become applicable to the investment funds utilising the QII exemption ; ( iii ) certain qualification requirements will be introduced for non-QII investors making an investment into investment funds using the QII exemption ; and ( iv ) the authorities will have wider supervisory powers over the investment funds using the QII exemption , such as being able to issue business suspension orders . <p> It is common for investment funds outside Japan to use the QII exemption when the Japanese investor is solicited for investment and makes an investment .

This is supported by the fact that , to date , based on projections by Performance Management and Delivery Unit in the recent Investment Performance 2011 Report from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority , the country needs RM1.31 trillion in investments to become a high-income economy by 2020 . <p> Last year , RM148.6 billion of investments were approved by the Malaysian government " well above the annual target of RM115 billion set under its Tenth Malaysian Plan . Investment generated last year created around 150,000 job opportunities from almost 5,000 projects . <p> Malaysia 's investments continue to be externally oriented . Both primary and manufacturing sectors corresponded highly with Malaysian trade composition while contributions from foreign investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributors of foreign investment were Japan , South Korea , the United States and Singapore , with whom Malaysia had bilateral and regional free trade arrangements . <p> Part of this next level of investment also involves improving the stock of talents in Malaysia , deepening capital and improving productivity . To assist Malaysia in achieving the objectives of the Economic Transformation Programme , the government has announced a large number of incentives and liberalisation efforts to boost the economy . Several new guidelines have been introduced , new laws have been passed and rules and regulations have been relaxed or abolished altogether . <p> A significant revamp in the corporate regulatory framework is the Malaysian Code on Takeovers and Mergers 2010 introducing key changes to the old regime designed to provide for a more transparent and effective M&amp;A process . The introduction of the Competition Act 2010 , which came into effect on January 1 2012 , also sought to allow greater competitiveness in the Malaysian corporate landscape . Since the changes came into effect , several prominent transactions have been subjected to the new rules testing corporate Malaysia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Takeovers and mergers <p> With effect from December 15 2010 , the existing Malaysian Code on Take-Overs and Mergers 1998 was superseded by the new Malaysian Code on Take-Overs and Mergers 2010 . Key changes arising from the implementation of the new Code include : <p> ( i ) potential offerors or offerees are required to make an announcement on possible offers which might result in unusual share movements or increase in the volume of share turnover of the offerees . A potential offeror is not allowed to undertake a second takeover offer within six months of any announcement that the said offeror is not undertaking a potential takeover offer ; <p> ( ii ) the following two new categories of " persons acting in concert " have been added to the new Code : <p> ( a ) a company , the directors of the company , and shareholders of the company where there is an agreement , arrangement or understanding between the company or directors of the company , and shareholders of the company which restricts the director or the shareholder from offering or accepting a takeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( b ) a partner who is a partner of a partnership ; <p> ( iii ) the new Code explicitly allows companies to undertake voluntary offers with a higher acceptance threshold . Pursuant to the old Code , a voluntary offer would normally have been conditional upon the offeror having received acceptances which would result in the offeror holding more than 50% of the voting shares of the offeree . Under the new Code , offerors are entitled to make a voluntary offer conditional upon receiving acceptances which would result in the offeror holding in aggregate more than 90% of the voting shares of the offeree . This particular change in the new Code would appear to be significant as it erodes the justification used by parties who prefer to use the less onerous assets and liabilities takeover route on the basis that it offers additional certainty that the transaction can be completed ; <p> ( iv ) if material changes occur after the dispatch of documents , such as a circular to shareholders , the Securities Commission must be notified immediately . For instance , during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other negotiations pertaining to the asset that is to be privatised , they have to inform the Securities Commission . This is to ensure shareholders are well informed of any developments ; <p> ( v ) companies that are incorporated outside Malaysia but listed on Bursa Malaysia Securities , and listed real estate investment trusts , are now subject to the new Code ; <p> ( vi ) the new Code has reduced the payment period in a takeover offer from 21 days to 10 days for payment of cash consideration . In cases where the consideration involves only securities or a combination of cash and securities , the payment period has been reduced from 21 days to 14 days ; <p> ( vii ) the new Code would apply to any person who undertakes a takeover offer , howsoever effected , by way of a scheme of arrangement , compromise , amalgamation or selective capital reduction ; and <p> ( viii ) the conduct of all parties , namely offerors , advisers and the boards of offerees are codified . These parties , especially the independent directors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prohibited from undertaking actions that could frustrate an offer . This effectively means that independent directors are required to ensure that any offer for the company should be put before shareholders for them to decide on . <p> Where a takeover offer is effected by way of a scheme of arrangement , compromise , amalgamation or selective capital reduction , it is required that the scheme is approved by at least 50% in number of shareholders and 75% in value to the votes attached to the disinterested shares that are cast either in person or by proxy at a duly convened meeting of the holders of the disinterested shares . The value of votes cast against the resolution to approve the scheme at such meeting must not be more than 10% of the votes attaching to all disinterested shares of the total voting shares of the offeree . <p> An example of a takeover offer which was effected by way of a selective capital reduction and repayment was the major shareholders of Mamee-Double Decker ( M ) ( MDD ) privatising MDD by undergoing a capital reduction and repayment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the privatisation plan , the major shareholders of MDD who control the company would repay RM179.8 million ( RM4.39 for each share ) to minority shareholders . Hence , privatisation of a public listed company effected by way of a selective capital reduction and repayment would assist to resolve the valuation issue for the major shareholders and would permit minority shareholders to exit the company at a premium to the market price . <p> Where an offeror has been granted an exemption by the Securities Commission but is unable to implement the scheme of arrangement , compromise , amalgamation or selective capital reduction within 12 months from the date of the exemption , the offeror and all persons acting in concert with the offeror must not within 12 months from the date of the announcement that the offeror is unable to implement the scheme of arrangement , compromise , amalgamation or selective capital reduction : <p> ( i ) make a takeover offer for the voting shares or voting rights that had been the subject of the previous takeover offer ; <p> ( ii ) acquire any voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thereby become obliged to make a mandatory offer ; <p> ( iii ) acquire any voting shares or voting rights of the offeree if the offeror holds voting shares or voting rights carrying over 48% but not more than 50% of the class of voting shares or voting rights that had been the subject of the previous takeover offer ; or <p> ( iv ) acquire any interest in the voting shares or voting rights of the offeree on more favourable terms than those made available under its lapsed offer where the lapsed offer is one of two or more competing offers until each of the competing offers has been declared unconditional in all respect or has lapsed . <p> In light of the above changes , the new Code highlights the Securities Commission 's continuous efforts to enhance investor protection and transparency and to establish higher standards of governance in takeover and merger activities in Malaysia . <p> Another revamp to the regulatory framework , jointly announced by both the Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia Securities on January 28 2011 , is that the threshold for shareholder approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , of its assets resulting in it being no longer suitable for continued listing on Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ( Asset Disposal ) is raised to 75% and this threshold would apply to all new Asset Disposals announced on or after January 28 2011 . <p> This will ensure that shareholders of listed companies will receive the same degree of protection regardless of the route that is chosen to privatise the company . Previous asset disposal exercises only require a simple majority approval from shareholders of the listed company . In addition , companies undertaking an asset disposal are now required to provide their shareholders with independent advice and detailed disclosure on the utilisation of proceeds from the asset disposal . This will increase transparency and ensure shareholders are equipped with adequate information for decision making . <p> The Securities Commission has also proposed that the standard of " fair and reasonable " be interpreted as two distinct terms ( " fair " and " reasonable " ) as opposed to an interpretation as a composite term . This is to ensure that the independent advisers examine both quantitative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in providing their advice . The decoupling of the terms will ensure that the independent advice circular can be easily understood , is transparent and provides a clear basis to justify the independent advisers ' recommendation . Accordingly , the Securities Commission will also provide guidance on the interpretation of the standard of fair and reasonable that is applied by independent advisers in assessing takeover offers . <p> One of the landmark takeover transactions is the takeover of Plus Expressways by the joint efforts of a government-linked company , UEM , and Malaysia 's employment provident fund ( EPF ) . Plus is a toll operator which has several highway concessions with the government and controls the nation 's longest highway , the North-South Expressway , which spans the entire length of Peninsular Malaysia . It is also the largest toll operator in Southeast Asia . Under its concession contracts with the government , it is allowed to increase the toll rates every three years , failing which the government will compensate Plus according to a set formula . Plus is considered a cash-cow and is known to be consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus acquisition was announced just before the new Code was to be effective . The Plus acquisition was conducted by way of the disposal of the assets and liabilities route , hence , when the takeover announcement was made by UEM-EPF , the shareholders ' approval required to approve the acquisition of Plus was still 50% plus one vote . More interestingly , during the bidding stage , there were at least five parties who have publicly expressed interest in taking over Plus including public listed MMC Corporation and little known Asas Serba which is said to be linked to several corporate heavyweights . One of the terms of the offer was the imposition of a RM50 million deposit to ensure that the offerors would have sufficient funds and credibility to undertake the acquisition . The offer also allows for the Board of Plus to consider competing bids if any . The transaction was eventually won by UEM-EPF and has since been completed . <p> Another issue arising under the new Code was the purchase of 30% equity interest of Eastern &amp; Oriental ( E&amp;O ) by Sime Darby from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at a 59% premium from E&amp;O 's share price at that time . Since the stake acquired was only 30% , it did not trigger the mandatory takeover offer . However , certain parties have argued that since the three substantial shareholders still remain in E&amp;O with reduced shareholdings , and a hefty premium was attached to the purchase price , the substantial shareholders should be considered to be " parties acting in concert " with Sime Darby and thus triggering the mandatory takeover offer to be made by Sime Darby and the three substantial shareholders . Additionally , the premium paid by Sime Darby is deemed to be the price paid for assuming control of E&amp;O . <p> The Securities Commission established a task force and conducted an investigation into the E&amp;O deal to determine whether Sime Darby had triggered the takeover rules under the new Code after a series of public debates . Six weeks after the E&amp;O acquisition , the Commission decided that Sime Darby did not trigger the takeover rules under the new Code prompting a minority shareholder of E&amp;O to file a claim against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general offer on the rest of E&amp;O 's shares . The case is still ongoing in the Malaysia courts . It will be interesting to see the decision of the court in this case and whether the court could determine with certainty the definition of " parties acting in concert " under the new Code . <h> Competition law <p> With the recent promulgation of the Competition Act 2010 on January 1 2012 , Malaysia became the latest country to implement anti-monopoly or antitrust legislation . The Act should result in significant changes to commercial activities in Malaysia as it is aimed at restricting monopolies and cartel activities in the Malaysian economy . <p> The changes brought about by the Act would impact any commercial entity carrying out commercial activities involving goods and/or services in Malaysia , and even extends to foreign entities operating in Malaysia . However , the Act also provides for exceptions where certain entities such as local government bodies and certain practices would not fall within the scope of its ambit . <p> The Act focuses on two main areas : anti-competitive agreements and abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting horizontal or vertical agreements between enterprises that would prevent , restrict or distort competition in any market for goods and services . In addition , the Act prohibits enterprises from engaging either independently or collectively in any abuse of a dominant position in the market . Therefore , an enterprise is prohibited from entering into agreements or arrangements that restrict competition or engaging in practices that exerts its influence in a dominant manner to the detriment of the minority market players . <p> A Competition Commission will be set up pursuant to the Competition Commission Act 2010 to regulate enforcement of the Act . The main functions of the Commission are to investigate where the Commission believes or suspects there has been an infringement , and give directions in relation to any infringements under the Act . <p> In the event the Competition Commission finds that there has indeed been an infringement within the scope of the Act , it is empowered to take various actions such as requiring that the infringement be ceased immediately , specify steps which are to be taken by the infringing enterprise , impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may deem appropriate in the circumstances . Nevertheless , enterprises may apply for exemptions and avoid potential liability if they are able to establish that the benefits of their actions outweigh any anti-competitive conduct . The Commission is also empowered to grant conditioned or unconditioned exemptions . <p> It appears that the Act will apply to most commercial activities in Malaysia regardless of the industry or business activities . Therefore , businesses should take immediate steps to examine their existing structure , operations and practices to ensure there are no anti-competitive or abusive elements and to take positive steps to ensure compliance under the Act . <p> Recently , the Commission requested information from both Malaysia Airlines ( MAS ) and AirAsia to determine whether their share swap deal and collaborative agreement would put travellers at a disadvantage and breach some provisions under the Act . Under the share-swap deal , AirAsia 's major shareholder Tune Air now holds a 20.5% stake in MAS , while MAS ' major shareholder Khazanah Nasional holds a 10% stake in AirAsia . Under the collaborative agreement , both parties would cooperate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .

Security can be created over shares of a Malaysian company or debt securities , and in the form of : ( i ) a legal charge effected by transferring the ownership in the secured securities to the chargee ; or ( ii ) an equitable charge effected by transferring the beneficial interest in the secured securities to the chargee with legal title to the secured securities remaining with the chargor . An equitable charge is created and perfected by the chargor depositing the original share certificates and executed transfer instruments with the chargee . <p> In the case of a charge over scripless securities , the secured securities will typically be credited into the securities account maintained by an authorised depository agent for the benefit of the chargee . <p> Other general perfection requirements with respect to the creation and perfection of a legal share charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those specified in paragraph 1.7 . <p> b ) Bank accounts <p> Yes . Security over bank accounts can be created by way of a legal assignment or charge over the bank accounts and all credit balances in the bank accounts . <p> Under the Malaysian Civil Law Act 1956 , a legal assignment must be an absolute assignment of all rights made in writing and an express notice of the assignment must be served on the counterparty from whom the assignor would have been entitled to enforce a right , or receive or claim a debt . In the case of an assignment over bank accounts , the contractual counterparty is the account bank . No separate acknowledgement by the contractual counterparty is required , but it is commonly procured in Malaysia to ensure that the contractual counterparty has full knowledge of such assignment and charge . <p> The other general perfection requirements discussed in paragraph 1.7 will apply . <p> c ) Contractual rights , receivables and insurance policies <p> Yes . Security over contractual rights , receivables and insurance policies can be created by way of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph 1.1(b) and paragraph 1.7 will apply . <p> d ) Real property <p> Yes . Security over real property can be created by way of a legal charge or a deed of assignment . <p> In the case of a real property with individual or separate issue document of title , security over such real property must be created by way of a legal land charge under the Malaysian National Land Code ( for property situated in West Malaysia ) , or the Sarawak Land Code ( for property situated in Sarawak ) or the Sabah Land Ordinance ( for property situated in Sabah ) . Note that second and subsequent charges over the same piece of real property are possible with the prior consent of the existing chargees . <p> In the case of a real property without individual or separate issue document of title , security over such real property may be created by way of a legal assignment over the relevant instrument of title ( typically the sale and purchase agreement in respect of such real property ) under the Civil Law Act . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in paragraph 1.1(b) and paragraph 1.7 will apply . <p> e ) Plant and machinery <p> Yes . Security over plant and machinery can be taken by way of a fixed charge . Please note that the general perfection requirements discussed in paragraph 1.7 will apply . <p> f ) Intellectual property <p> Yes . Security over intellectual property can be taken by a charge ( typically a fixed charge ) . There is no statutory requirement to record or register the security interest created over any intellectual property with any public registry for intellectual property rights in Malaysia . However , the general perfection requirements discussed in paragraph 1.7 will apply . <p> g ) Future/after acquired property <p> Yes . Security over future assets can be effected by way of a fixed or floating charge . <p> h ) Floating charges over all assets <p> Yes . A floating charge can be taken over all assets of a company , including future assets . A company is , during the existence of the floating charge , generally free to deal with its assets in its ordinary course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chargee . Upon the occurrence of a crystallisation event , the floating charge will crystallise and attach as a fixed security to all the assets then in the pool of assets specifically described as acquired by the company . Please note that the general perfection requirements discussed in paragraph 1.7 will also apply . <h> 1.2 Highlight any issues with securing obligations that may arise in the future . <p> Generally speaking , security may be created to secure future liabilities and obligations , provided that the relevant security documents adequately and clearly provide for such arrangement . <h> 1.3 Can a universal security agreement be used to grant security over all assets in this jurisdiction ? <p> Yes . A general debenture is commonly used as a security agreement , creating a fixed and floating charge over all present and future assets of the company and a legal assignment over any asset of the company which is not charged under the fixed or floating charge . <h> 1.4 Can security be granted for the benefit of different classes of creditors under the same security agreement and if so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adopting this approach ? <p> Yes . This is typically done by way of a single security agreement created in favour of a security agent holding the security on behalf of and for the benefit of the different classes of creditors . <h> 1.5 Can security trustee or security agent structures be used in this jurisdiction to secure obligations that are owed to fluctuating creditor classes ? <p> Yes . <h> 1.6 Can security be granted by third parties ? Are there any rights of contribution , subrogation or similar that might arise as a result of granting/enforcing third party security that ought to be/can be waived ? <p> Generally speaking , security to secure a loan can be granted by a third party , provided that the third party is empowered by its constitutional documents to do so and there is no contravention of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965 ( MCA ) , particularly , section 133A . Right of subrogation may arise , which is commonly waived in the third party security document . <h> 1.7 Briefly outline the registration requirements , if any , applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations such as the timing , expense and the consequences of non-registration ? <p> The most common and general registration requirements applicable to security interest created under Malaysian law are set out below . <p> ( i ) If a security is created by a company incorporated under the MCA , and if the security is a registrable charge under the MCA , that charge must be registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia ( CCM ) . This is done by filing Form 34 ( Statement of Particulars to be lodged with Charge ) as prescribed by the MCA with the CCM within 30 days of its creation . <p> A failure to register a registrable charge with the CCM within the prescribed timeframe will result in the charge being void against the liquidator and any other creditors of that company . In this case , during the liquidation of that company , the liquidator can deal with the charged property in total disregard of any interest that the charge purports to give to the chargee . In addition , non-registration of a registrable charge may affect the priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a director or the company secretary . It must be duly completed , signed and physically presented at the CCM . A filing fee of RM300 ( $94 ) is payable to the CCM . <p> A similar requirement applies to a company incorporated under the Malaysian Labuan Companies Act 1990 ( MLCA ) , whereby a Form 21 ( Statement of Particulars in respect of Charge ) as prescribed by the MLCA must be lodged with the Labuan Financial Services Authority ( LFST ) within 30 days of creation of the security . The lodgment of a Form 21 is done online at the LFST official website and a filing fee of RM50 is payable to the LFST . <p> ( ii ) If a power of attorney clause is included in the security document , a stamp duty of RM10 should be paid on such power of attorney clause . Under the Power of Attorney Act 1949 ( PoAA ) , the powers of attorney contained in any security document are required to be lodged at the High Court of Malaya for the powers granted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such lodgment . A filing fee of RM35 plus RM2 for each page of the security document in question is payable to the High Court of Malaya . <p> The PoAA also requires the execution of the document containing a power of attorney clause to be witnessed and attested by the approved category of persons , which include advocates and solicitors practicing at the High Court of Malaya , and a notary public and commissioner for oath officiating in the jurisdiction in which the document is signed . <p> ( iii ) In the case of a legal land charge created under the relevant land codes , the legal land charge must be registered with the relevant land registries . Registration of the land charge is done by presenting the original completed , signed , dated and stamped statutory instrument of charge as prescribed under the relevant land codes ( charge forms ) . In practice , parties also attach an annexure to the charge forms setting out the terms and conditions governing the security . The registration fees payable to the land registries vary from one state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped appropriately before it can be accepted for registration at the relevant land registries . The land charge must be presented for registration at the relevant land registry within three months from the date of the land charge document , failing which a penalty will be imposed . <h> 1.8 Briefly outline any regulatory or similar consents that are required to create security ( other than board/shareholder approvals ) ? <p> Common regulatory or governmental approvals which may need to be considered are state authority approval and approval of the Central Bank of Malaysia ( BNM ) . <p> Prior approval from the relevant state authority is required for real property that is subject to certain restrictions in interest against the creation of charges over that real property . <p> Under the Malaysian Financial Services Act 2013 , prior approval from the BNM or registration with the BNM may be required in some circumstances for the creation of security and giving of a guarantee . <p> The general rule governing the priority of competing security interests is essentially the time of creation of the security interests . Any security interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset ranks below the existing security interest in point of priority and security . <p> However , it is open to the creditors to agree amongst themselves on the question of priority , in which case , the creditors will typically agree the priority and security arrangement in a priority and security sharing agreement . In the case of land charges , any reshuffling of priority can only be effected by lodging a relevant prescribed form with the relevant land registries . <h> Section 2 " Guarantees <h> 2.1 Briefly explain the downstream , upstream and cross-stream guarantees available , with reference to any particular restrictions or limitations . Are there any techniques typically used to enhance credit support/guarantees that might otherwise be limited ? <p> Under Malaysia law , companies are free to give any downstream , upstream or cross-stream guarantee as long as : ( i ) the giving of such guarantee has been approved by the shareholders or directors of the guarantor company , the giving of such guarantee is not inconsistent with the guarantor company 's constitutional documents and the guarantor company is clearly empowered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the guarantor company is able to satisfy itself and establish that there is commercial and corporate benefit in giving such guarantee ( the question of corporate and commercial benefit is a matter of fact to be considered and determined by the directors of the guarantor company ) ; ( iii ) there is no contravention of the MCA ( in particular , section 133A or section 67 of the MCA ) or in the case of a public listed company , any provision of the listing requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities ; and , ( iv ) the relevant foreign exchange control rules in Malaysia are complied with . <p> Section 133A(1) ( b ) of the MCA prohibits a company ( guarantor company ) from giving a guarantee for the benefit of another company ( second company ) if the second company is connected to a director of the guarantor company , unless the guarantor company and the second company have a parent-subsidiary relationship . <h> Section 3 " Enforcement <p> Generally , yes . Malaysian courts generally uphold and enforce the express choice of law decided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain qualifications and conditions ( for instance , that the choice of law is a bona fide choice ) . <h> 3.2 Will the local courts generally recognise and enforce a foreign judgment that is given against a domestic company in foreign courts ( particularly the New York or English courts ) without re-examining the merits of the decision ? <p> A judgment obtained from the courts of certain jurisdictions ( permitted jurisdictions ) listed in the Malaysian Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1958 ( REJA ) , subject to certain qualifications , may be enforced in Malaysia once it has been registered under the REJA and no separate action needs to be commenced for the enforcement of such foreign judgment . A Malaysian court may , subject to certain conditions being fulfilled ( for instance , the judgment is not obtained by fraud ) , register a judgment obtained from those courts of the permitted jurisdictions . <p> A judgment obtained from a court of a jurisdiction which is not a permitted jurisdiction ( for instance , New York courts ) will not be recognised by the Malaysian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Malaysian courts for an amount due under a judgment given by the court of foreign jurisdiction . Note that certain conditions and qualifications do apply in this circumstance . <h> 3.3 Will the local courts recognise and enforce an arbitral award given against the company without re-examining the merits of the decision ? <p> Yes . Malaysian courts generally do recognise and enforce an arbitral award given against a company under section 38 of the Arbitration Act 2005 , unless it falls under certain grounds for refusing the recognition or enforcement under and as listed in section 39 of the Arbitration Act . <h> Section 4 " Other matters <h> Financial assistance <h> 4.1 Are there any restrictions in place on locally incorporated companies in assisting the acquisition of shares in itself , its sister companies or in its holding companies ? Do these prohibitions apply to all forms of company , to companies being acquired which are incorporated outside this jurisdiction and indirect holding companies ? <p> Yes , section 67(1) of the MCA prohibits the giving of financial assistance by a company in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding company , subject to certain limited exceptions . Note that the prohibition only applies to companies incorporated under the MCA . There are three exceptions under section 67 of the MCA , but note that there is no concept of a whitewash procedure . <p> Esther Chik is a partner in the finance and projects practice group of Wong &amp; Partners , the Malaysian member firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie International .

@@8538493 @1738493/ <h> Disclosure reforms <h> Author : Published : 5 Jan 2004 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> How can Japan develop a disclosure system that will make its capital markets more credible to investors ? Every country seeks an answer to this question , particularly after the accounting system crisis that occurred in America , evidenced by the Enron bankruptcy . Japan is no exception . <p> Recent disclosure reforms in Japan consist of two trends - increasing informative disclosure in public capital markets and enlarging private capital markets that do not require a disclosure obligation . It is necessary to require disclosure contents to be more substantive and credible for the general investors in the public capital markets , to facilitate participation . But there is a trade-off between more informative disclosure and lower cost finance . <p> In the private capital markets where participants are limited to mainly professional investors , an issuer 's disclosure obligation is not necessarily required because professional investors are usually able to obtain useful investment information and make decisions at their own risk regardless . Therefore , it is also necessary to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance . <p> More informative disclosure in the public capital markets <p> The Japanese disclosure system has been criticized because the contents of both the initial and the continuing disclosure were too form-oriented and did not necessarily include substantive information . In addition , for continuing disclosure , only annual and semi-annual disclosures had been required ; quarterly disclosures had not . Recent reforms have changed this . <p> Substantive disclosureThe changes to the corporate disclosure system require a company to additionally disclose in its securities registration statement and annual securities report the following three substantive items : business risk factors ; management 's discussion and analysis of the company 's financial condition and operation results ; and corporate governance conditions . The guidance notes for the recent disclosure forms provide examples of the above three items . <p> For business risk factors , a company is required to disclose : unusual changes in financial condition , operation results and cash flow ; dependence on certain transaction parties , products and technologies ; any unusual legal restriction , trade practice and management policy ; significant litigation ; significant items relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other item that could materially affect the judgment of investors . <p> For management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and operation results , a company is required to disclose its representative 's view of the financial condition and operation results , including factors that could materially affect operation results , source of its capital , and fluidity of its funds . <p> For corporate governance conditions , a company is required to disclose : its organization ; the arrangement of its internal regulatory system ; the arrangement of its risk management system ; its directors ' remuneration divided between inside directors and outside directors ; its certified public accountants ' remuneration divided between the remuneration related to auditing based on audit contracts ; and remuneration related to any service other than auditing . <p> Generally , the substantive requirements are applicable to the annual securities reports for the business year ending on or after March 31 2004 and to the securities registration statements filed on or after the date on which the annual securities reports satisfying such substantive requirements are filed . But any company may file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after April 1 2003 . As for the annual securities reports for the business year ending on March 31 2003 , 17 companies have filed their annual securities reports satisfying the substantive requirements noted above . <p> In addition , a representative of the company 's directors may voluntarily attach to its securities registration statement , annual securities report and semi-annual securities report , a paper in which the representative confirms the suitability of the statements made in such securities registration statement , annual securities report and semi-annual securities report . As for the annual securities reports for the business year ending on March 31 2003 , 21 companies have filed their annual securities reports with such confirmation paper attached . <p> Quarterly disclosureThe Securities and Exchange Law of Japan does not generally require a company to report quarterly business results and its financial condition . Although certain listed companies voluntarily disclose financial results on a quarterly basis , only companies that have their securities listed on certain markets for emerging companies , such as Mothers on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ( TSE ) , had been required to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges . <p> Most capital markets around the world are increasingly recognizing that publicly listed companies should be required to report their business results and financial condition more frequently and in a clear uniform manner . This enables general investors to assess profitability and financial health more regularly . To compete with foreign markets , many of which require listed companies to disclose such information , each Japanese stock exchange , as well as the Japan Securities Dealers Association , requires companies listed on any Japanese stock market to file quarterly disclosure statements . <p> For example , the TSE requirements for domestic companies are divided into two stages . First , each listed company is required to file a management summary of business results on a quarterly basis from April 2003 . The information contained in the management summary may only provide a general overview . Secondly , from April 2004 , each listed company will be required to file quarterly financial statements that basically consist of a summary balance sheet and a summary profit and loss statement , in addition to a management summary . However , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TSE recently announced that the requirement for filing quarterly financial statements would not actually come into effect until about three years after April 2004 . <p> According to the TSE , 40% of listed companies , whose business year ends on March 31 , voluntarily filed their first quarterly disclosure with their financial statements . If a quarterly disclosure system is set up through quarterly disclosure requirements being imposed by each stock exchange and by the Japan Securities Dealers Association , these requirements may soon be included in the Securities and Exchange Law . <p> Electronic filingFrom June 1 2004 , all issuers ( including foreign companies ) that are required to file certain statutory disclosure documents ( including securities registration statements , annual and semi-annual securities reports and extraordinary reports ) in Japan under the Securities and Exchange Law , will be required to file such documents electronically through the Electronic Disclosure for Investors ' NETwork ( EDINET ) , instead of using paper documents . Filing companies will no longer be permitted to file paper documents , unless an extraordinary event such as a power failure occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission . All electronic documents filed through EDINET may be accessed by anyone through the internet . Therefore , general investors will be able to easily obtain investment information . <p> Enlarging the private capital markets <p> Raising finance in the public capital markets enables an issuer to acquire a large volume of funds from general investors , but this costs the issuer a lot of money at the time of issue and on a continuous basis as long as the securities are outstanding . It is thus necessary to provide cost-effective financing measures other than finance in public capital markets . <p> If participants in the private capital markets are limited to professional investors , or the number of such participants is limited , the general investor 's exposure to risks from investment in these markets can be reduced . <p> Before the recent disclosure reforms , both the concept of private capital markets and the participants in these markets were unnecessarily limited . This has changed . <p> Concept of private capital marketsThe Securities and Exchange Law provides for two types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to file a securities registration statement as an initial offering disclosure obligation - private placement to a small number of investors , and private placement to qualified institutional investors . <p> Private placements to a small number of investors may solicit no more than 49 investors . Before the reforms , however , every solicitation to a qualified institutional investor was included in the calculation of the 49 investors . Now , solicitations to qualified institutional investors are not included in the calculation if the total number of qualified institutional investors is not more than 250 and certain transfer restriction requirements are satisfied . <p> Also , before the reforms , shares or other equity-linked securities could not be offered as securities for private placements to qualified institutional investors . Now , generally , if a class of shares is not publicly traded and certain transfer restriction requirements are satisfied , such class of shares or securities linked to such class of shares may be offered as securities in private placements to qualified institutional investors . <p> Increasing the number of participantsIssuers are now able to offer securities in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors who meet the criteria of qualified institutional investors under the Securities and Exchange Law of Japan . <p> Before the disclosure reforms , issuers had few means available to offer their securities in Japan to foreign entities by way of private placement . Since qualified institutional investors did not include foreign investors , issuers were limited to offering their securities in Japan to no more than 49 foreign investors . The definition of qualified institutional investor has been amended to include foreign investors . <p> To be a qualified institutional investor , a foreign investor must satisfy two requirements . First , it must be one of the following : ( a ) a foreign securities firm , investment asset management firm , bank , insurance company , or discretionary investment manager set up in accordance with foreign laws that meet certain capitalization requirements based on type of business ; ( b ) a foreign government , government authority , municipal government , central bank , or international institution to which Japan has acceded ; or ( c ) a foreign company that files securities reports in Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign investor must register with the Financial Services Agency in July each year . Registration is effective for one year from September 1 of that year to August 31 of the next year . <p> Foreign qualified institutional investors must also appoint a Japanese resident as an agent , which represents the investor in making necessary registration filings and receiving notices and documents pertaining to the securities it holds , which have been acquired by means of a private placement in Japan . <p> For Japanese investors , the recent disclosure reforms have permitted certain venture capital companies and venture capital limited partnerships that are set up or formed in Japan , to be included as qualified institutional investors . <p> More reform <p> Disclosure reforms in Japan are expected to continue . The government is considering improving disclosure contents to make them more user-friendly for general investors and allowing disclosure in English rather than in Japanese . Whether this will be allowed will be determined by considering the general investors ' benefits as well as the convenience and the cost . <p> If it were permitted , a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including in Japan , could provide the disclosure more cost effectively , and the Japanese markets could compete more easily with foreign markets where disclosures are made in English . <h> Author biography <h> Hiroyuki Ishizuka <h> Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu <p> Hiroyuki Ishizuka is a partner at Nagashima Ohno &amp; Tsunematsu .

However , the German Federal Supreme Court has reasoned ( obiter ) that this is because German law generally ( the exception being tax law ) does not distinguish per se between legal and beneficial interests . <p> German law clearly recognises the ability of one party ( the settlor ) to entrust another ( the trustee ) with certain rights on condition that the latter exercises these in its own name but for specified purposes and under certain conditions only . In doing so , the settlor ( Treugeber ) and the trustee ( TreuhSnder ) have clearly defined rights , obligations and protections vis a vis the other . <p> Treuhand Under German law , a trust ( Treuhand ) may be constituted under statute or by ...

@@8538497 @1738497/ <h> Taiwan : Taiwan 's changing face <h> Author : Published : 1 Oct 2010 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> Several recent developments in Taiwan have the potential to significantly affect and in some cases alter traditional private equity and venture capital activities in Taiwan . These recent developments may be summarised as follows : ( 1 ) limitations over the issuance of privately issued public equities ( Pipes ) at a significant discount to market price to non-strategic investors ; ( 2 ) the development of a strong regional market for listing medium sized foreign companies via the Taiwan Stock Exchange ( TWSE ) and the Taiwan Gretai Securities Market ( OTC ) and ; ( 3 ) the implementation of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement ( ECFA ) between Taiwan and China . <p> While it is too early to tell whether the combined effects of these developments would substantially increase or decrease the level of investments overall , our preliminary assessment is that the combined effect of these developments could lead to more growth capital activities by venture capital funds and middle market private equity funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private equity funds and hedge funds have not been active in making investments directly in Pipe offerings , largely on account of the three-year lock-up during which the Pipes would not be freely transferable . However , the availability of the ability of Pipes to be priced at a deep discount to market has sometimes served as a catalyst for investments , especially in the situation where the funds are purchasing a block of Pipes from existing shareholders rather than in the primary offering ( due to the fact that in most cases the applicable holding period does not re-start if Pipes are transferred to qualified institutional buyers ) . <p> Recently , the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , ROC ( FSC ) has further tightened regulations restricting the placement of Pipes in Taiwan . The FSC has taken the view that Pipes permitted under Articles 43-6 to 43-8 of the ROC Securities and Exchange Act have been abused to the detriment of shareholder rights . Following the amendments , Pipes other than securities issued to non-related parties by public companies operating at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All other Pipes must abide by further restrictions . <p> One of the major amendments altered the calculation of the average market price from which the maximum discount of 20% may be taken as the price for the Pipes . Where the average market price was previously either the price for the securities of the common stock at closing during the prior business day or the average of the price at closing for the prior three business days or five business days , the average market price now requires a comparison between the price determined using the pre-amendment method and the average price at closing over the prior 30 business days . The higher price is to be used when determining the maximum discount . <p> A second major amendment altered the rules for Pipes issued by companies operating at a profit . As the FSC believes that companies operating at a profit should generally make public offerings as its method for raising more funds , it has adopted amendments to curb usage of Pipes . Public companies operating at a profit are prohibited from issuing Pipes unless the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strategic investor , or the public company is in financial difficulties and its plan to raise money through Pipes is approved by the competent authority . A strategic investor is defined to mean an investor that will increase the profitability of the issuer because of its experience , technologies , know-how , product brand or distribution channels , etc. , which will allow for horizontal , vertical or collaborative efficiencies that will be beneficial to the issuing company . Public companies operating at a profit are also prohibited from issuing Pipes to related parties . <p> We expect most private equity funds and hedge funds will not be considered to be strategic investors , absent special circumstances . <p> A third major amendment also altered the rules for Pipes issued by companies operating at a loss , if such securities are issued to related parties . The issuance of such securities must be discussed and approved by the board of directors with specificity , and full disclosure must be made to shareholders . <p> Failure to comply with these new Pipes rules may result in authorities disapproving any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ( this step is required after the expiration of the relevant lock up period in order to allow public trading of such securities ) . <p> While the purchases of Pipes under the new rules would directly affect some forms of private equity investments in Taiwan , we also note that other forms of private equity investments in Taiwan to date are not affected and we may also see a rise in other forms of transactions which are potential substitutes for Pipes , such as SPOs and ECBs ( however , SPOs and ECBs do not have the pricing advantages vis a vis Pipes ) . <h> Legal issues for foreign companies IPOs <p> In early 2008 , the TWSE began to encourage foreign companies to conduct their initial public offerings ( IPOs ) in Taiwan . For private equity and especially venture capital funds with investments in the Great China region , exits via Taiwan 's capital markets are fast growing in popularity . This is on account of several competitive advantages that are attractive to rapidly growing companies , particularly in the technology sectors : relatively high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized companies , a cluster effect among technology companies resulting in high interest , familiarity among investors and analysts , and significantly lower IPO costs . As of September 13 2010 , there is one foreign company ( Integrated Memory Logic Limited ) listed on the TWSE and one foreign company ( Array Inc. ) listed on the Taiwan OTC . <p> To date , up to 59 candidates are in the TWSE pipeline ; five applied for primary listing in 2010 and the TWSE listing committee has already approved three companies to be listed in the near future . <p> We highlight some issues of relevance to the directors of foreign issuers below . <h> Thresholds <p> Not all types of foreign company will be able to list via the TWSE or the Taiwan OTC . For example , foreign companies whose revenues derive mostly from Taiwanese sources will be encouraged to reorganise as a domestic listing , rather than a foreign listing , and those foreign companies whose shareholdings exceed a maximum amount of PRC ownership will also be precluded ( see further below on this issue ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid in capital requirements for listing via the TWSE and the Taiwan OTC , which must be met by a foreign company . <p> Conversely , assuming that the foreign company qualifies for listing on the TWSE or the Taiwan OTC , there are some peculiarities about the Taiwan listing process which require some consideration . Unlike the rule-based listing process in most other jurisdictions , the Taiwan listing process is a merit-based review and therefore the foreign company must be prepared for a review process that could be more detailed from a business perspective than in other jurisdictions . The listing process can easily exceed six months and usually exceeds a year . <p> Accordingly , any of the issues below , if not dealt with in a manner satisfactory to the TWSE staff , will result in significant delays . <h> Conversion offshore holding structure <p> TWSE regulations require that a foreign issuer amend its organising documents to include a number of provisions based on the TWSE 's Guideline For Shareholders ' Protection that reflect Taiwan 's domestic corporate law . Some of these provisions may be incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's state of incorporation . In consideration of the foregoing , although the TWSE does not require the company to be incorporated in any particular jurisdiction , most foreign companies choose to restructure under a company organized in an offshore jurisdiction which offers a balance between international recognition and flexibility in its internal corporate governance laws and regulations . To date , by far the most popular jurisdiction has been the Cayman Islands . <p> Thus , in drafting the listing company 's memorandum and articles of incorporation , Taiwan counsel and Cayman Islands counsel must work together to ensure that all provisions required by the TWSE are included and that none of such provisions conflict with Cayman Islands law . <h> Informal caps <p> It 's very common for foreign companies to use incentive stock options and other equity awards to motivate their employees . Foreign companies should therefore be aware that listing on the TWSE may restrict their incentive plans in several key ways . <p> Most Taiwan listed companies operate under a de facto cap on shares underlying incentive stock options for employees , equal to 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In consideration of this , the TWSE would likely question foreign issuers with options authorized under an incentive plan in excess of 15% . <p> If the foreign company intends to issue stock options that would exceed the 15% cap , the company should take steps to ensure that the amount of stock options is below the cap prior to listing . In addition to the foregoing , the TWSE may also question issuances of a significant amount of options in the period leading up to an IPO . <h> Preferred stock and shareholders agreements <p> Startup companies typically undergo one or more rounds of preferred stock financings during their development . The company 's organising documents will provide for certain preferential rights to preferred stockholders , such as priority over common stockholders for liquidation and dividends . In addition , the preferred stock investors may have agreements among themselves and with the company that provide for a number of additional rights , such as voting agreements , information rights and restrictions on transfer of the company 's common or preferred stock . <p> Foreign companies planning on listing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to common stock at the time the company submits its application for listing , and that any agreements among shareholders should be terminated as well . Taiwan domestic law generally favours equality and free trading among shareholders , and the existence of preferred stock and shareholders agreements will raise significant questions from Taiwan 's investors and regulators . <h> Restrictions regarding mainland China <p> A foreign company with investments or operations in the PRC may list on TWSE as long as the listing company is a holding company rather than the PRC entity itself . However , Taiwan laws governing Taiwan-PRC cross-strait relations have other restrictions on investment by PRC citizens in a TWSE-listed company . In particular , a foreign company can not list on TWSE if 30% or more of its shares are held by PRC shareholders , or if a PRC shareholder has significant management influence over the company . Foreign companies with significant PRC shareholders or influence , or companies that do not know the nationality of their shareholders or management , should consider this issue ahead when planning for a TWSE listing . <h> Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might be required to adopt some Taiwanese corporate practices . These practices may differ enormously from corporate practice in other jurisdictions , and may have different impacts on the interests of investors , directors , management or employees . <p> Generally speaking , the more flexibility and simplicity a foreign company can accept in its capital structure and compensation plans , the more it will be able to adapt to TWSE compliance requirements . Many potential issues can be addressed or avoided by good communication with TWSE officers . Foreign companies considering or preparing a TWSE listing should work closely with their Taiwan underwriter and counsel to determine how to handle these issues efficiently . <h> Economic cooperation framework agreement <p> On June 29 2010 , representatives of Taiwan and China signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement ( ECFA ) , a preferential trade agreement aiming to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two sides . The agreement will become effective after both sides have completed relevant procedures and notified the other party of the same . Taiwan 's Executive Yuan approved the ECFA on July 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The signing of the ECFA creates heated debates in Taiwan as to the effects on local Taiwan businesses , as well as on how the government has presented it to the public . <p> We provide , below , a summary or brief introduction to the ECFA and focus on the Early Harvest Program with respect to financial service sectors under the ECFA . <p> Sector <p> Commitments by Taiwan <p> Commitments by China <p> Banking <p> A Chinese bank having a representative office in Taiwan for more than one year may apply for approval to set up a branch . <p> -A Taiwan bank having a representative office in China for more than one year may apply for approval to set up a branch or subsidiary . <p> -A Taiwan bank having a branch or subsidiary in China for more than two years that has been profitable for the previous year may apply for approval to offer Rmb services . <p> -A Taiwan bank having a branch or subsidiary in China for more than one year and is profitable may first apply for approval to offer Rmb services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None <p> A Taiwan insurance company may apply for approval to conduct business in China if the requirement of ? 5 , 3 , 2 ? ( assets of an insurance company be at least $5 billion , incorporated for more than 30 years and with a representative office in China for more than 2 years ) is met , through either integration or strategic consolidation . <p> Securities/Futures <p> None <p> -Simply the procedures for obtaining licenses by Taiwan securities agents in China . <h> Summary of ECFA <p> The aim of ECFA , as stipulated in the agreement itself , is to strengthen trade and investment cooperation between Taiwan and China , gradually reducing or eliminating the barriers in existence . The agreement is divided into two main categories of trade : goods and services . Based on the Early Harvest Program list for trade in goods , China will apply zero tariff for 539 types of goods imported to China from Taiwan over a period of three years , ; whereas Taiwan will also apply zero tariffs with respect to 267 goods imported to Taiwan . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvest Program , China opens up 11 items to Taiwan , on the other hand , Taiwan opens up nine items to China . <p> The signing of the ECFA further lifts restrictions regulating financial service sectors across the Taiwan Strait , in furtherance of the ROC 's Regulations Governing Approvals of Banks to Engage in Financial Activities Between the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area ( as amended the Regulations ) . In terms of financial service sectors under the Early Harvest Program , Taiwan only offers one commitment with respect to the banking sector . That is , a Chinese bank which is permitted to set up a representative office in Taiwan for more than one year may apply for approval to set up a branch . Nevertheless , the above commitment only represents a slight relaxation of what is already permitted under the Regulations . Under the Regulations , the requirement is two years . In contrast to the sole commitment given by Taiwan , China offers a wider range of relaxations , in all banking , securities and insurance areas . For instance , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese market and the offering of Rmb services by Taiwan banks are shorter . For the key provisions of commitments see the box . <p> The commitments offered by China under the Early Harvest Program seem to be more preferential than those offered to Hong Kong under Mainland China and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement ( Cepa ) . For example , with the re-defined " 5,3,2 " for insurance companies , the number of Taiwanese insurance companies qualified to conduct businesses in China are increased from the current six to ten . <p> ECFA is seen as the most significant agreement signed between Taiwan and China in terms of financial cooperation . However , Taiwan 's financial sectors are complaining that the " opening is too small " : that Taiwan 's securities firms may only invest up to 33.3% in China 's securities firms , Taiwan 's banks may only invest in China 's banks either directly or through an offshore subsidiary but not both , and China 's banks can only choose to either set up branches in Taiwan or invest in Taiwan 's banks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank can not exceed 5% . Specifically , under the Early Harvest Program , Taiwan only opens up one item for bank in respect of financial service sectors . Many see this as a concession given by the Chinese government for political reasons . More negotiations between the two sides to lift more restrictions are yet to be done .. For instance Cepa was signed on June 29 2003 , where seven supplements were thereafter signed between October 27 2004 and May 27 2010 . However , financial arrangements were not brought up at negotiation table until Supplement III . The two sides will resume the second round of negotiations by the end of 2010 . As restrictions on investments across the Taiwan Strait are gradually lifted , foreign investors in Taiwan will be offered an alternative option of existing investments with Chinese partners . However , we caution that the implementation of ECFA and related regulations will likely be a gradual process . <h> ECFA effect on PE and VC funds <p> For private equity and venture capital funds , the further development of ECFA and the gradual opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , as intellectual property protection is stronger in Taiwan vis-a-vis China , Taiwan becomes a suitable base for high tech companies who have intellectual property protection concerns . In addition , as Chinese companies can now establish a permanent presence in Taiwan , synergies may be realised via merger and acquisitions and joint ventures across the Taiwan Strait . Indeed , LCS had recently acted on the first major acquisition of a substantial portion of assets by a Taiwan list company by a Chinese listed company . Private equity and venture capital funds that own stakes in potential buyout targets in both Taiwan and China may be interested in exploring such opportunities . Finally , as mentioned above , many technology companies based in China under an offshore holding structure are beginning to look to Taiwan 's capital markets for IPO ; the further cooperation between Taiwanese and Chinese financial institutions will undoubtedly contribute to this growing trend as well and further strengthen this exit option for many private equity and venture capital funds investing in the Great China region . <p> About the author <p> Victor Chang has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , private equity fund formations and cross border transactions of all types , frequently involving parties from the US , Europe , Canada , Australia , Taiwan and China .

See section 7.4 for more detail . <h> 1.2 What is your outlook for public M&amp;A in your jurisdiction over the next 12 months ? <p> While there has been a slowdown in activity as a result of the current economic challenges arising from global fluctuations in oil prices , the size and continuing growth of Nigeria 's consumer class and sectoral developments such as the evolution of the power sector present opportunities for increased M&amp;A activity . <h> Section 2 : REGULATORY FRAMEWORK <p> The Investment and Securities Act ( ISA ) and the SEC rules govern M&amp;A activity in Nigeria .

Acquisitions are typically achieved by means of a negotiated contractual sale or buy-out , a scheme of arrangement ( SoA ) , a merger or a takeover bid ( voluntary or mandatory ) . <h> 3.2 What determines the choice of structure , including in the case of a cross-border deal ? <p> In addition to the parties ' commercial objectives , the structure of an equity acquisition is typically influenced by the nature of the target ; the size of the equity stake and whether majority control is required ; concerns about minority protection ; regulatory approvals ; concerns about ease of divestment ; and , currency risk and timing concerns . <h> 3.3 How quickly can a bidder complete an acquisition ? How long is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition structure , whether due diligence is to be conducted and whether regulatory approvals are required , an acquisition could be completed within two to three months from the point at which a bidder is selected . <p> The length of time for which a deal will remain open to competing bids will depend on the structure of the acquisition . A takeover bid must remain open for at least 21 days and up to 35 days . An acquisition by way of a SoA or merger can be completed within three months . <h> 3.4 Are there restrictions on the price offered or its form ( cash or shares ) ? <p> With the exception of a takeover bid , there are generally no restrictions on the price , or the form , of consideration . Pricing is usually determined by the valuation of the target and negotiated by the sellers and the bidders . <h> 3.5 What level of acceptance/ownership and other conditions determine whether the acquisition proceeds and can satisfactorily squeeze out or otherwise eliminate minority shareholders ? <p> For an acquirer to be entitled to squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shares that were subject to the bid must have been tendered . For the purposes of this threshold , the shares already held by the acquirer are not counted if the entity is a limited liability company . <h> 3.6 Do minority shareholders enjoy protections against the payment of control premiums , other preferential pricing for selected shareholders , and partial acquisitions , for example by mandatory offer requirements , ownership disclosure obligations and a best price/all holders rule ? <p> The takeover rules require that shareholders of the same class must be treated equally by an acquirer , given the same information and offered the same price for the shares . If the acquirer purchases shares of the target in the market at a price higher than the price offered under the takeover offer , the bid price will be deemed to have been amended accordingly . The takeover bid document must disclose the number of shares which the offeror and its affiliates already hold in the target . Any existing agreement or arrangement between the offeror and any of the directors of the target , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be disclosed . <h> 3.7 To what extent can acquirers make conditional offers , for example subject to financing , absence of material adverse changes or truth of representations ? Are bank guarantees or certain funding of the purchase price required ? <p> The ISA requires that offerors make adequate arrangements to ensure that the funds required to pay for any shares tendered under a takeover offer are available . The SEC would , therefore , expect to see clear evidence that the relevant funds are available in the form of bank statements or audited financials of the acquirer or a bank guarantee issued by a reputable bank . It is possible to make an offer subject to certain conditions ; for instance , the offer can be made conditional on the acquirer receiving a specified minimum level of acceptances . Other than in relation to SEC-governed entities , acquirers are free to make conditional offers as described . Bank guarantees , or certain funding , are not otherwise generally required for acquisitions . <h> Section 4 : TAX CONSIDERATIONS <h> 4.1 What are the basic tax considerations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Inland Revenue Service must be obtained for mergers and asset transfers involving related entities .

Where the borrower and lender have consented to use any of the stated assets as security for the loan , the parties enter into a written agreement in the form of applicable documentation , which would amongst other things indicate the nature of the security . The requirement of consent , registration , stamp duties would also apply , depending on the peculiarity of each security . <h> 3.2 Highlight any issues with securing obligations that may arise in the future . <p> Depending on the peculiarity of the relevant security , there are several issues which may arise after the creation of the facility . For instance , where a trustee who has no right to employ trust property as security in a mortgage transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reserved for the trustee in the trust instrument or by statute , this may result in issues in the future . Also , where there is default on a mortgage created on a property and such property is the security for more than one mortgage and the value of the property can not satisfy all mortgages created , the legal mortgage takes priority followed by other equitable mortgages in accordance with the time of creation . <h> 3.3 Can a universal security agreement be used to grant security over all assets in this jurisdiction ? <p> Yes , this is usually in the form of an all-asset debenture granted mostly by corporate bodies to banks and other financial institutions . <h> 3.4 Can security be granted for the benefit of different classes of creditors under the same security agreement and if so , are there any issues that creditors should be aware of in adopting this approach ? <p> Security can be granted for the benefit of different classes of creditors under the same agreement , provided that all the parties agree . One major issue that the creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priority of interests . The interest of a secured creditor , which in most cases is a legal interest , will take precedence over the interest of an unsecured creditor who usually holds an equitable interest . Where more than one creditor is secured , the first in time would take precedence . <h> 3.5 Can security trustee or security agent structures be used in this jurisdiction to secure obligations that are owed to fluctuating creditor classes ? <p> A loan or mortgage agreement is generally viewed as any other contract . A security trustee structure can be used in Nigeria to secure obligations to different creditor classes . A debtor can set up a security trust and appoint a trustee to manage the trust with the view to fulfilling obligations owed by the debtor to the creditors . <h> 3.6 Briefly outline any issues to consider when transferring loans and accompanying security interests between lenders . <p> The transfer of loans and accompanying securities can be done by either assignment or novation , provided that there are no limitations to transfer in any other relevant agreement between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case by case basis , depending on the type of loan and security involved . For instance , in a loan transaction where the security is a real property , the mortgage must have been duly registered at the relevant land registry and the Corporate Affairs Commission ( CAC ) , otherwise the loan transfer will be hindered. <h> 3.7 Can security be granted by third parties ? Are there any rights of contribution , subrogation or similar that might arise as a result of granting/enforcing third party security that ought to be/can be waived ? <p> Security can be granted by third parties on behalf of a borrower . This is usually created with a deed of guarantee executed by the guarantor in favour of the borrower . The waiver of rights to contribution or subrogation is usually reached by an agreement between a third party and a debtor before it can be enforced in a loan agreement . In the absence of any agreement to that effect , rights of subrogation or contribution will not be deemed to have been waived. <h> 3.8 Briefly outline the registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this jurisdiction , including any practical considerations such as the timing , expense and the consequences of non-registration ? <p> There are different laws guiding different transactions relating to the respective securities . Consequently , registration requirements of those securities differ from one to another . For instance , under the Registration of Titles Law in Lagos State ( Lagos State is the commercial hub of Nigeria ) , registration requirements for legal mortgages on real property include : ( i ) obtaining the Governor 's consent ; ( ii ) payment of stamp duties ; ( iii ) registering the mortgage instrument at the state land registry ; and ( iv ) where the mortgagor is a company , registering the mortgage at the CAC within 90 days of creation . <p> It is also important to note that , depending on the type of security involved , registration with other regulatory agencies may be required .

Also , mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission . <h> 3.9 Briefly outline any regulatory or similar consents that are required to create security ( other than board/shareholder approvals ) ? <p> The basic principle guiding priority of competing security interests is that the competing interests rank according to their creations . Therefore , an earlier security interest has priority over a later security interest . In securities involving real property , the priority lies with the interest that has been perfected over the interest which has not been perfected . Where there are two interests that have not been perfected , the first in time ranks in priority . <h> Section 4 " Guarantees <h> 4.1 Briefly explain the downstream , upstream and cross-stream guarantees available , with reference to any particular restrictions or limitations . Are there any techniques typically used to enhance credit support/guarantees that might otherwise be limited ? <p> There is no law in Nigeria prohibiting downstream , upstream and cross-stream guarantees . These guarantees may be in the form of letters of credit , performance bonds and payment guarantees ( popularly called bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such guarantees subject to certain factors , including the acceptable financial status of the guarantor , the nature and duration of the facility , the nature and value of security furnished by the borrower being guaranteed . Such guarantees are enhanced where the guarantor executes a mortgage or debenture over its assets as co-obligor to the borrower 's facility . <h> 4.2 What regulatory or other consents are required to grant downstream , upstream and cross-stream guarantees ( other than board/shareholder approvals ) ? <p> No other consents are required under the provisions of the Company 's Memorandum and Articles of Association . Where the security provided by the guarantor is real property , the consent of the governor of the state where the land is situated is required ( see 3.8 ) . <h> 4.3 Briefly , outline any enforceability concerns associated with the granting of downstream , upstream and cross-stream guarantees that lenders should be aware of ( eg any exchange controls or similar obstacles ) . <p> Enforceability of a guarantee only becomes difficult where the guarantee has no mortgage or lien .

Arbitral awards made by a recognised international arbitration will be recognised and enforced by Nigerian courts , subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enforce any award in accordance with the provision of the Arbitration Act . <h> 5.4 When enforcing security , what factors significantly impact the time such enforcement takes and the value of the proceeds received from such enforcement ? For example , are there any statutory requirements such as ( a ) holding a public auction ; ( b ) court involvement ; or ( c ) obtaining regulatory consents ? <p> The enforcement procedure in this regard depends entirely on the nature of the security or class of asset . Where such enforcement requires a court order , the time the enforcement may take depends on the schedule of the court and readiness of parties . <h> 5.5 Are there any restrictions that apply specifically to foreign lenders when taking enforcement action ? <p> There are no restrictions on enforcement action on loans by secured foreign lenders , provided a foreign lender has taken an adequate security for the loan , and other legal formalities of a loan agreement are satisfied to ensure that the loan is legal and enforceable . <h> Section 6 " Bankruptcy and insolvency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this jurisdiction , including any control or influence that creditors can exert on the process , the timeframes usually involved and any mandatory filing requirements . <p> The insolvency processes in Nigeria are carried out through winding-up proceedings initiated by the courts or winding up under the supervision of the courts . The bankruptcy processes as provided for under the Bankruptcy Act are carried out by the creditor where he serves a bankruptcy note on the debtor after obtaining a court judgment or by the debtor where he files a notice in court of his inability to pay his debts . The creditor can exert control on the bankruptcy or insolvency processes by simply initiating the process of bankruptcy or insolvency in court . The creditor can also exercise the right of lien on the debtor 's property . The timeframe for bankruptcy or insolvency depends mostly on the schedule of the court and the readiness of the parties . Mandatory filings with the CAC after the completion of the process are required for companies . <h> 6.2 Are there any preference , fraudulent conveyance , claw-back , hardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be aware of ? <p> The law protects the interest of the lender where it appears that there has been a fraudulent conveyance of the borrower 's property which has been used as security for the loan . The lender may apply to court on the ground that payment by fraudulent preference has been made , to determine any payment issues arising between the person to whom the payment was made and the guarantor , and to grant relief . With respect to claw-back , hardening periods or similar issues , the lender may apply to court if it appears that any of the borrower 's business has been carried out in a reckless manner or with intent to defraud the lenders . The court may declare that any person who was knowingly party to carrying on the business in such a way will be personally responsible , without any limitation of liability for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the borrower , as the court may direct . A floating charge created on the property of a borrower within three months of commencement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claw-back is , however , protected if proven that cash was paid to the company at the time of creation . <h> 6.3 Do bankruptcy/insolvency processes provide for any kind of stay/moratorium on enforcement of lender claims ? If so , does the stay/moratorium apply to the enforcement of security interests ? <p> Yes . Section 412 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act allows a lender to apply to the court for an order staying winding-up proceedings . The court may , with or without imposing terms , stay or restrain winding-up proceedings or , if it thinks fit , refer the case to the court hearing the winding up petition . <p> The moment the court grants an order staying the winding-up proceedings , the lender may , subject to the terms imposed by the court , apply to enforce security interests . <h> Section 7 " Other matters <h> Financial assistance <h> 7.1 Are there any restrictions in place on locally incorporated companies in assisting the acquisition of shares in itself , its sister companies or in its holding companies ? Do these prohibitions apply to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated outside this jurisdiction and indirect holding companies ? <p> Companies are not allowed to provide financial support to a third party for the purpose of purchasing the company 's shares , shares in sister companies or its holding companies . <h> 7.2 Are there any exceptions to these restrictions and/or are there any structuring techniques that can be used to achieve target collateral support ? <p> A company may acquire its own shares only for the purpose of : ( i ) fulfilling the terms of a non-assignable agreement under which the company has an option or is obliged to purchase shares owned by an officer or an employee of the company ; ( ii ) settling or compromising a claim against the company ; ( iii ) eliminating fractional shares ; ( iv ) complying with a court order ; or ( v ) satisfying the claim of a dissenting shareholder . <p> Olanrewaju Fagbohun is a professor with the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies , and a partner at RouQ &amp; Company .

Although this obligation granted enough time for each member state to transpose the Directive , it has not yet been implemented into Portuguese legislation , due to recent government changes . <p> To avoid confusion caused by the delay of the implementation in Portugal , a part of the Directive must be regarded as being already in force in Portugal , as stated by the Portuguese Securities Market Commission ( CMVM ) in a General Opinion issued on June 17 . <p> The Prospectus Directive will impact not only European companies but also companies registered outside the EU . Under the terms of the Directive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first EU member state in which they make a public offering or an admission to trading of securities ( at the choice of the issuer ) . And foreign non-equity issuers of securities with a denomination per unit of at least 1000 can choose between the regime of the first EU member state in which they make a public offering or admission to trading of securities or the framework of the member state were they already have securities admitted to trading in a regulated market . <p> The Prospectus Directive belongs to the maximum harmonization directives , also called detailed directives ( directives detaillTes ) , which leave member states a limited selection of means to achieve the imposed solution dictated by the directives ' content . If a member state fails to transpose such a directive , it will be subject to the Level 4 enforcement procedures implemented by the Commission and can be judicially compelled to comply . <p> To complete the Prospectus Directive application , the Commission Regulation EC/809/2004 of July 19 has been approved . This Regulation came into force on July 1 2005 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU member states . This Regulation defines the information to be provided in the prospectus and covers its format , the information incorporated by reference , the publication of prospectuses and the dissemination of advertisements , establishing also a standard format for all prospectuses , irrespective of their use . The Regulation was largely based on technical advice given by the Committee of European Securities Regulators ( CESR ) to the Commission . <p> The aims of the Directive and its implementing measures are : investor protection , market transparency and efficiency , and the creation of a single European market for securities and financial services where wholesale and retail cross-border offers are facilitated by a passport regime , following in the footsteps of the Commission 's communications " Risk capital action plan " and " Implementing the framework for financial market : Action Plan " . <p> The Prospectus Directive 's purpose is to harmonize requirements for the drawing up , approval and distribution of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prospectus Directive involves a two-tier regime . The first regime relates to issues that are admitted to an EU regulated market , after the approval of a prospectus by the home competent authority . The second regime , which relates to unlisted securities , requires that , where securities are offered to the public in any member state , a prospectus must be produced and published unless : ( i ) the offer is addressed only to qualified investors ; ( ii ) the offer of securities has a denomination above 50,000 euros ; ( iii ) investors will have to subscribe at least 50 000 ; and ( iv ) the offer is to fewer than 100 persons per member state . <p> One of the measures the EC predicts will attain its goals is the implementation of a single authorization system ( a single passport for issuers ) . Once approved by the competent authority in one EU member state , a prospectus will be accepted in another EU member state - provided the competent authority of that member state is notified - without further local examinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host-state competent authority . <p> Another intended driver of integration foreseen in the Directive is the possibility of the prospectus being produced in only one language in the case of multi-jurisdiction offers , either the language accepted by the competent authorities of the member states where the securities will be admitted to trade or offered or in a language customary in the sphere of international finance . This prospectus will enclose a summary , which might be subject to a translation requirement by the host-state authority , designed to accomplish the investor protection purposes of the Directive . <p> The implementation of the Prospectus Directive in Portugal will require the introduction of several amendments to the Portuguese Securities Code ( C=digo de Valores Mobilirios or CVM ) and a draft implementation Decree-Law was disclosed for public consultation on the last quarter of 2004 . However , the enactment of the Directive 's transposition Decree-Law is dependent on the government 's empowerment by the parliament for its approval . <p> To reduce the confusion caused by the delay of the enactment of the Directive 's transposition Decree-Law , CMVM has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doctrine as to Directives ' direct effect , the following provisions of the Prospectus Directive became enforceable in Portugal on July 1 2005 : <p> sub-paragraphs m ) and n ) of Article 2(1) , which lay down the definitions of home member state and host member state ; <p> Article 3(2) on the non-application of the obligation to publish a prospectus in certain types of securities offers ; <p> Article 4 , which sets out certain exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus ; <p> Article 5(3) and ( 4 ) and Article 12(3) and ( 4 ) , on the drawing up of a prospectus comprised by one or more then one separate documents and of base prospectus ; <p> Article 9 , on the validity of prospectus , base prospectus and registration documents ; <p> Article 11 , which addresses the incorporation into the prospectus of references to previously or simultaneously published and approved documents ; <p> Article 13(2) to ( 4 ) , which rules the delays for approval of prospectus by the competent authorities ; and <p> Articles 17 and 18 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the CMVM , the Portuguese Law is already in line with some provisions of the Prospectus Directive , such as : ( i ) the mandatory prior approval and publication of a prospectus in public offers of securities ; and ( ii ) the option given to offerors to draft their prospectus in Portuguese or any foreign language of common use in the international financial markets . <p> As said , the CMVM proposed , on the last quarter of 2004 , a draft Decree-Law to implement the Directive in question , having launched a public consultation process on this matter . Any Decree-law implementing the Prospectus Directive must introduce several amendments to the Portuguese Securities Code . The main amendments foreseen in the draft Decree-Law are related to the public offering of securities and to the rules on admission to trading on regulated markets . <p> If this draft Decree-Law is approved , it will imply the modification of over 50 articles of the CVM ( and the addition of nine more ) , mainly its Title III . Such modification will include the following : <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of the national competent authority to approve the prospectus ; <p> the possibility to choose the format of the prospectus : single or tripartite ( including the registration document , the securities note and the summary note ) ; <p> the new scheme of incorporation of information by reference ; <p> the adoption of a base prospectus for offering programmes ; <p> the obligation to provide annual information , that is , to report on information filed in other non-EU states pursuant to stock exchange requirements or securities laws ; <p> the requirement to deliver a summary ; and <p> the possibility of drafting the prospectus in a language customary in the sphere of international finance . <p> As far as public offerings are concerned , and given the differences between the new European regime for prospectuses and the Portuguese Law , the draft Decree-Law clarifies that the registration of a public offer implies the approval of a prospectus . This approval becomes the cornerstone of a public offering 's administrative control . Nonetheless , the existence of an offering registration is maintained in view of lawfulness control because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospectus . When a prospectus is not required for public offerings ( for example , certain offerings to employees ) , the offering is exempted from the assistance of a financial intermediary and a simplified registration procedure is created . <p> To adopt the Prospectus Directive and the requirement to launch a public offer announcement ( under the Portuguese Securities Code ) , the public offer announcement in public offers for distribution will need to be abolished , except for takeover bids ( OPAs ) , as in this case the publication of the prospectus summary is not mandatory ; and the announcement regarding the availability of the prospectus only when the offeror exclusively opts for the disclosure by means of electronic format must be retained . <p> Furthermore , some modifications will be introduced in the legal regimes of cash bonds , mortgage bonds and of collective investment undertakings and real estate funds , because the Directive also applies to the prospectus of public offers and admissions to trading of non-equity securities . <p> As a consequence of the implementation of the Prospectus Directive , two concepts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concept of qualified investors will replace the concept of institutional investors , as its scope will need to be extended to include : <p> financial institutions of states that are not members states of the EU ; <p> entities trading in commodities and in derivatives on commodities ; <p> national and regional governments , central banks and public entities that manage the public debt ; <p> international and supranational institutions , such as the European Central Bank , the European Investment Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ; <p> other legal entities whose corporate purpose is to invest in securities ; <p> companies that according to their last annual or consolidated accounts meet two of the following criteria : ( i ) an average number of employees of 250 ; ( ii ) a total balance sheet of 43 million ; or ( iii ) an annual net turnover of 50 million . <p> Moreover , the Portuguese Securities Market Commission will be empowered to extend this qualification , through specific regulation , to other entities with sophisticated competence and expertise in the securities field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public offers , its scope now includes those offers addressed at , at least , 100 natural or legal persons other than qualified investors residing or established in Portugal , whereas in the current legal framework the reference number is 200 persons . <p> The main features of the new public offer regime intended to promote financial services integration are : ( i ) maximum harmonization ; ( ii ) the full home country ; and ( iii ) the mutual recognition and passport regime . Despite improvements in terms of transaction costs and comparability of information , the Directive raises several issues that have been highlighted by market participants . <p> The maximum harmonization characteristic makes the Directive arguably an excessive measure that will erase the benefits of regulatory competition . Although justified by the aim of fully implementing the passport regime and avoiding the transaction cost created by regulatory discrepancies , those objectives could be achieved by prohibiting host-state authorities imposing additional requirements upon a passport approved by the competent authority . <p> Moreover , the new regime could be criticized on the grounds of erasing the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In particular , EU equity issuers will always be subject to the authority of the place of its registered and non-EU issuers and non-equity debt issuers have a limited choice . In spite of allowing full home country control , this policy option eliminates regulatory competition and its success is fully dependent on supervisory convergence between 25 member states with discrepant institutional structures and different levels of financial market development . <p> There are also high compliance costs of the disclosure requirements imposed by the Directive , in particular in relation to foreign issuers , which will be subject to the initial disclosure requirements foreseen in the Directive combined with the ongoing requirements established in the so-called Transparency Directive . This costs of this new disclosure regime are due , in particular , to the following : firstly , foreign issuers are faced with the risk of having to change their accounting requirements to comply with International Accounting Standards ; secondly , the exemption regime to private placements still contributes only to the developments of the wholesale market and creates a complex regime to certain markets such as the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria . <p> The Prospectus Directive will involve the following main changes : ( i ) the amendment of definitions of institutionalinvestors and public offer , with impact upon the scope of exempted offers ; ( ii ) the new structure of the prospectus , in particular allowing for the shelf registration mechanism of frequent issuers and for a summary containing special warning to retail investors ; ( iii ) the redefinition of the national competent authority to approve the prospectus with full control upon the relevant issuers ; and ( iv ) the obligation to provide ongoing information . <p> Although these changes will not mean a complete revision in the Portuguese framework , they will have a two-fold impact . The revised disclosure regime will impose an additional disclosure burden on Portuguese , EU and foreign issuers offering or admitting securities subject to the Portuguese authority 's competence , and impose additional supervisory costs on CMVM , which might have a broader competence and is subject to cooperation and supervisory convergence obligations . However , it will provide an environment for private placements under a unified regime with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-border retail public offers facilitated by the integrated regulations . <p> Taking all this into consideration , the Portuguese securities market expects that the implementation of the Prospectus Directive will permit a more friendly environment for public offerings and admissions in Portugal . <p> Author biographies <h> Jorge de Brito Pereira <h> PLMJ <p> Jorge de Brito Pereira is head of the capital markets department .

@@8538505 @1738505/ <p> The growing popularity of the public private partnership ( PPP ) model on large-scale infrastructure projects has made an impact on Turkey 's public procurement activities . Traditionally , the term PPP has also been used for procurement models , which enable private entities to provide public services , such as build-operate-transfer , transfer of operation rights , and concession agreements . However , this article focuses on the PPP model whereby the administration is heavily involved in the realisation of the project rather than leaving the operation and procurement of services entirely to the private sector . There are a number of reasons behind the rise of PPPs , but the most notable one is the increasing level of public debt in many jurisdictions . Due to a growing population and ageing health facilities , Turkey needs to invest heavily in healthcare . To match the needs of the country in a timely manner , Turkey has announced an ambitious PPP programme for the healthcare sector . <p> PPPs are generally defined as the contractual relationship between private sector entities and the government , where the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality services to the public . Therefore , the expertise and efficiency of the private sector are highly beneficial . The projects for which the PPP model is used include hospitals , schools , highways and prisons . <h> " Turkey has announced an ambitious PPP programme for the healthcare sector " <p> Originally , the PPP model emerged in the UK in the 1990s , where the implementation of infrastructure projects was carried out through a model called a private finance initiative ( PFI ) . PFIs became the main vehicle for the construction and replacement of schools in the UK . The successful implementation of the PFI model for the construction and operation of other infrastructure projects for public services such as roads , highways and prisons has led to its integration into the legal systems of other European countries . As to the distinction between PFIs and PPPs : the PFI is the name of the investment method and the PPP is used to describe the partnership between the private sector and the government . Consequently , they are similar and the end result is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a series of linked contractual agreements among the parties . The project agreement between the special purpose vehicle company ( SPV ) and host government is the basic framework of the PPP model , and it outlines the responsibilities of the parties and risk allocation between them ( it is important to note that SPVs are formed by the sponsors to design , build , operate and maintain the facility for a specific period of time ) . In addition to the project agreement , other major agreements in investments realised through the PPP model include the shareholder agreement among the sponsors as to the equity contribution into the SPV , loan agreements between the SPV and lenders as to the debt contribution into the SPV and the engineering , procurement and construction agreement between the SPV and a third party contractor . While the main purpose of such a structure is to balance the collaboration and risk allocation among the parties in the most cost-effective environment , it is also important to note that the financial and operational risks are substantially assumed by the SPV . <h> PPPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before 2005 , most infrastructure investments were realised through other outsourcing models such as build-operate-transfer , transfer of operation rights , build-lease-transfer , and build-operate arrangements . <p> The PPP model was first introduced through the Additional Article 7 of the Health Services Fundamental Law for infrastructure projects in the healthcare sector ( PPP Healthcare Projects ) , and the details of the model were provided under a separate regulation . Following challenges to the relevant regulation before the courts on the grounds that the allocation of treasury-owned lands for services are not directly related to the healthcare facilities , a new law , the Law Concerning the Construction of Facilities , Renovation of Existing Facilities and Purchasing Service by the Ministry of Health by Public Private Partnership Model ( Healthcare PPP Law ) , was passed in March 2013 . This new Healthcare PPP Law provides the regulatory framework for the construction and renovation of healthcare facilities and the procurement of services by way of public private partnerships based on a tendering process . The Healthcare PPP Law consolidates the previous legal regime under a single legislation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary purpose is the determination of the procedures and principles for the construction and renovation of integrated health campuses through a tender mechanism . <p> In addition to ongoing PPP projects in Turkey under the Healthcare PPP Law , the government is expected to launch more PPP programmes in the future for the renovation of schools and prisons in Turkey . <p> First , the land on which a facility will be built is to be transferred from the state to the SPV through an independent and continuous servitude right for a period up to 30 years , excluding the investment term set out in the project agreement . This servitude right is established with a servitude right agreement executed between the parties and its registration to the land registry . Servitude rights are regulated by the Turkish Civil Code and they are deemed to be continuous where their terms are at least 30 years . Further , servitude rights that are independent and continuous may be registered with the land registry as immovable property on which a mortgage right can be granted in favour of the lenders as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender process , there are three tender methods ; ( i ) open tender ; ( ii ) tender among predetermined bidders ; or ( iii ) the bargaining method . Under the open tender procedure , all bidders may submit their proposals , and the proposal that provides the maximum benefit with a minimum cost is awarded the project . <h> " The expertise and efficiency of the private sector are highly beneficial " <p> The tender among predetermined bidders , which has been used for all tenders launched thus far , is held by inviting qualifying potential bidders ( following a preliminary qualification assessment ) . The qualified tender participants submit a sealed bid relating to the project and the price . Then , the administration evaluates the bids , and lists the compliant bids according to technical quality and price competitiveness . The administration will then further develop the project with the participation of a certain number of tender participants that offer the most advantageous bids in order to determine the scope of the project . Following the determination of the project : ( i ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the sealed bids are opened before the tender participants ; and , subsequently , ( iii ) a reverse auction is held . As a result of the reverse auction , the administration initiates final negotiations with the tender participant who places the lowest bid ( the first tender participant ) according to feasibility of the administration . If the first tender participant 's bid is deemed sufficient , the tender is awarded to them . If it is not found to be sufficient , the administration continues final negotiations with the tender participant who placed the second most advantageous bid ( the second tender participant ) . As a result of the negotiations , if the second tender participant 's final price is lower than that of the first tender participant , that lower price will be counter-offered to the first tender participant . If the first tender participant accepts this counter-offer , it will be awarded the tender ; otherwise , the second tender participant will be the tender winner . <p> Please note that the bargaining method is used only in specific cases determined by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for the : ( i ) project design of the facility ; ( ii ) financing of the construction of the facility and commercial areas ; ( iii ) maintenance and repair of the facility ; ( iv ) performance of the services set out in the project agreement ; ( v ) management of the commercial services areas ; and ( vi ) delivery of the facility to the administration free from all debts and in good condition at the end of the term of the project agreement , which can not exceed 30 years . Finally , it should also be borne in mind that the project agreement is subject to private law , which allows the SPV more entitlements than in administrative law . <p> On a separate note , the SPV is permitted to transfer all of its rights and obligations to another private law person under the same conditions , provided that the consent of the administration is obtained . <p> Further , the criteria that should be taken into consideration for the determination of the contract price are also regulated under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the nature of the investment and project ; ( ii ) whether the equipment and medical devices will be provided by the SPV ; ( iii ) the profit of the SPV ; and ( iv ) whether the facility , services and commercial service areas will be operated by the contractor . The contract price may be amended after the execution of the project agreement in case it is determined that the works may not be completed in accordance with the conditions set out in the project agreement due to : ( i ) a force majeure ; ( ii ) unusual circumstances ; or ( iii ) causes which are not attributable to the SPV . <p> Likewise , an amendment of the project agreement after its execution is also allowed and it may be amended upon the occurrence of : ( i ) a force majeure ; ( ii ) unusual circumstances ; ( iii ) any situation that has impact on the implementation of the project agreement and its schedules ; or ( iv ) conflict between the provisions of the project agreement and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule requires that parties should resolve any dispute arising from the execution of the project agreement before the courts of the Republic of Turkey . However , they are also entitled to choose resolution of any dispute under Arbitration Law 4686 , provided that the governing law is Turkish and the seat of arbitration is in Turkey . <h> Financing PPPs <p> From a financing perspective , the equity amount of the financing obtained by the SPV should be at least 20% of the total fixed investment costs of the specific PPP Healthcare Project . Such equity is calculated over the periodic investment costs , which will be determined under the project agreement . <h> " The government is expected to launch more PPP programmes in the future for the renovation of schools and prisons in Turkey " <p> As to debt contribution , most of the same sources of project financing are also used in PPP projects . These sources include local and foreign commercial banks , multi-lateral agencies and development banks . Generally , the primary factors they take into consideration when determining the debt amount to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , environmental , social , health and safety issues surrounding the project , the investment climate of the host country from a legal , economic and political perspective , and the results of due diligence carried out by professional advisers . Additionally , lenders have a monitoring role by having tight control over any amendments of a project agreement and the general behaviours of all of the parties . <p> Moreover , in case of an unremedied default by the SPV , the lenders have the right to step in to remedy the default . The circumstances under which lenders may step in are set out in the direct agreement between the lenders , SPV and host government . Thus , the concept of default should be well defined in the project agreement . <h> Treasury 's debt assumption <p> The debt assumption mechanism is another critical issue for lenders . In case of early termination of the project agreement and the transfer of the facility to the administration , the under-secretariat of the Treasury ( the Treasury ) may assume the outstanding foreign debt and the amount arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the debt assumption mechanism , namely Law 4749 on Regulating Public Finance and Debt Management , which is applicable to PPP healthcare projects .

The Treasury 's affirmative opinion before the execution of the project agreement is also required .

The IP basically represents certain ordinary income of the current business year on a year-to-day basis and must be determined daily . The IP calculation is identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP is a lump sum : 20% of the redemption/sale price . For more details on the basic principles reference is made to Ernst &amp; Young 's article in the September 1997 and October 1997 issues of International Tax Review . <p> The German government enacted significant changes in German tax which became effective of January 1/April 1 1999 and may affect foreign investment funds distributed in Germany substantially . <p> Changes affecting an investment in foreign funds indirectly : <p> The introduction of a 25% withholding tax on the portion of income of German funds resulting from dividends of German corporations . <p> Effect : this ( somewhat ) reduces the advantages of German funds over their foreign competitors on investments in German shares . <p> The extension of the speculation period for taxable short-term capital gains for private investors for all assets ( including fund units , except real estate ) from six months to 12 months for all sales taking place after December 31 1998 . <p> Effect : German private investors will more likely hold fund units after the 12-month holding period expired . <p> Reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to DM3,000 ( married : double amounts ) , as of January 1 2000 . <p> Effect : An increasing number of German investors will look for tax effective investment structures ( eg funds focusing on tax free capital gains ) . <p> However , the most important changes concern the calculation of the DDI of white funds and the IP of white and grey funds in respect of gains from certain derivative income earned on fund level as of April 1 1999 ( the original draft legislation also provided for the taxation of any short-term capital gains realized by the fund ; this was eliminated during the hearings ) . <p> The amendment in section 17 para 1 FIC states that gains from private capital gains transactions as defined in section 23 para 1 No 4 , para 2 and para 3 German Income Tax Code ( GITC ) , are to be considered for DDI calculation . This change of the FIC is identical to the amendment of section 39 para 1 ( KAGG/Kapitalanlagegesetz ) for German domestic funds . Furthermore the scope of the IP was amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads : " derivative instruments from which the taxpayer gains a net settlement or a cash settlement or other benefit which is dependent on a variable underlying , provided such right to net settlement , cash settlement or other benefit does not exceed a one-year period .

Section 23 para 3 GITC contains ( among others ) a rule how to determine the gain . It is stated that gains in the meaning of section 23 GITC may not be offset against losses from other ordinary income sources ( as defined ) of the taxpayer , however they may be carried back ( restricted ) or carried forward ( indefinitely ) . <p> According to official sources , eg the following transactions fall under section 23 para 1 no. 4 GITC : <p> forwards , futures , options and swaps on securities , currencies or commodities ; <p> index-certificates and warrants ; and <p> any other transactions which grant a right on the payment of money or another benefit ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain underlying value ( eg the value of securities , indexes , futures , interest rates , etc ) . <p> Which instruments are affected by the amendment at the FIC ? <p> The new FIC rules have caused some confusion among the German and foreign investment industry " not only did the changes become effective within two weeks after they finally passed Parliament , but there is also still fierce discussions on how to interpret the new rules . So far the tax authorities have not issued an official statement in this respect . <p> The German Association of Investment Funds ( BVI ) issued ( internal ) letters on the changes of the KAGG . Even though the amendments in the wording of KAGG and FIC are identical , the consequences for German and foreign funds are unclear : <p> Fundamental difference in the definition of DDI for German and foreign investment funds ? <p> The DDI definition of the KAGG differs from the wording of the FIC . According to section 39 KAGG ( old ) only income in the meaning of section 20 GITC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , section 17 FIC ( old ) states that interest , dividends and other income constitutes DDI . The term " other income " is not defined . The tax authorities hold the opinion that any kind of proceeds resulting from investments ( including investments in innovative financial instruments ) or activities are taxable including realized gains from currency forwards and futures , gains from option trading and option premiums for writing options . For German domestic funds it is generally accepted that such income did not form part of the DDI prior to April 1 1999 . With respect to foreign funds domiciled in an EU country the tax authorities ' position could conflict with the anti-discrimination rules as it favours German domestic funds over their EU competitors . However , this issue has not been brought to court so far . <p> The amendment now made in section 17 FIC left the term other income unchanged and only added the reference to section 23 GITC .

The new wording of section 17 para 1 FIC also refers to section 23 para 3 GITC . However the consequences of this reference are disputed : <p> Loss offset restrictions are applicableFor the ( daily ) IP calculation a net private capital loss may not be offset against other IP relevant income . <p> For the ( annual ) DDI calculation there is no provision whether a carry forward is possible on fund level or on investor level .

Therefore a loss carry forward on fund level is the only feasible solution . <p> Loss offset restrictions are not applicable <p> According to an opinion also supported by the BVI there are no restrictions to offset losses from private capital gains against ordinary income . As a result the treatment of net loss as of business year end is no problem any longer " any losses from private capital gains are offset against ordinary income , ie a net loss is part of the total DDI for the year . <p> Conclusion <p> In view of the above it is obvious that the German tax treatment of investments in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing careful review is necessary .

This possibility is already frequently used , in particular by persons which evade such capital gains subject to a basic 25% capital gains tax in Austria . <p> The Treaty further provides for a payment on future interest proceeds , dividend proceeds , capital gains etc similar to the Austrian withholding tax on interest .

@@8538509 @1738509/ <h> Section 1 : GENERAL OUTLOOK <h> 1.1 What have been the key recent M&amp;A trends or developments in your jurisdiction ? <p> In 2015 , the Indian M&amp;A market registered a slower performance compared to 2014 . This was due to various factors , including a volatile rupee . Deal-making in the information technology , energy , mining and utilities sectors was comparatively higher . M&amp;A activity was primarily driven by cross-border inbound transactions , with investors from Japan and the US taking the lead . <p> A number of deals displayed so-called earn-out structures . The competition regulator showed an unprecedented level of activity as it received notifications in respect of a number of transactions . The securities market regulator introduced significant regulatory changes aimed at making going- private transactions easier . The government also worked hard to dissipate concerns around retrospective taxation . Overall the M&amp;A market was consistent with the slow and steady growth of India in 2015. <h> 1.2 What is your outlook for public M&amp;A in your jurisdiction over the next 12 months ? <p> 2016 promises to be a more robust year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government 's push to develop India as a global manufacturing hub , the impending introduction of a new bankruptcy regime and a more liberal foreign direct investment ( FDI ) policy are expected to boost M&amp;A deal making in 2016 . <h> Section 2 : REGULATORY FRAMEWORK <p> The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) regulates M&amp;A in listed securities in India ; <p> generally , the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( MCA ) regulates all companies through the Companies Act 2013 . However , significant corporate actions related to M&amp;A are still governed by Companies Act , 1956 ; <h> Section 3 : STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS <h> 3.1 What are the basic structures for friendly and hostile acquisitions ? <p> Friendly acquisitions are usually structured either as share purchase transactions or through court driven amalgamations . In certain cases , acquisitions can also be structured through a court process under the Sick Industrial Companies Act 1985 or through an asset transfer process . <p> Indian public companies usually have substantial promoter shareholding making it difficult to stage hostile takeovers . Only a shareholder holding 25% or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a voluntary offer . However , if a primary tender offer ( including a voluntary offer ) is made , any person could make competing bids . In other words , a hostile offer can only be structured through a competing offer mandated under the Takeover Code by an existing shareholder . <h> 3.2 What determines the choice of structure , including in the case of a cross-border deal ? <p> The structure depends primarily on the following factors : ( i ) the activities of the target and foreign investment restrictions governing the sector ; ( ii ) requirements to obtain licenses , if any ; ( iii ) consent of the lenders ; ( iv ) the CCI 's approval ; ( v ) the preservation of tax benefits ; and ( vi ) requirements to launch a mandatory offer . <h> 3.3 How quickly can a bidder complete an acquisition ? How long is the deal open to competing bids ? <p> Typically , a bidder could complete the tender offer process in 8-12 weeks . However , the timeline to complete an acquisition depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A competing bid could be made within 15 days of the date of the detailed public statement made by the acquirer who has made the first tender offer , unless such offer is conditional as to the minimum level of acceptances . <h> 3.4 Are there restrictions on the price offered or its form ( cash or shares ) ? <p> There is no restriction on the price that can be offered to a seller by an acquirer , except when the acquirer is non-resident . In this case , the acquirer can not pay less than the fair market value . <p> A share swap is generally permitted . However , government approval is required to pay consideration by shares by/to a non-resident , if the target carries out certain regulated business . <h> 3.5 What level of acceptance/ownership and other conditions determine whether the acquisition proceeds and can satisfactorily squeeze out or otherwise eliminate minority shareholders ? <p> The Takeover Regulations require an acquirer triggering the mandatory tender offer provisions to make an offer for at least 26% of shares held by public shareholders . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the acquisitions can be completed under the current law . <p> Currently , an acquirer who obtains the approval of 90% of shareholders by value of shares of the target company held by persons other than the acquirer or its nominees or subsidiaries can buy out the dissenting minorities . However , given the complex conditions that are part of the squeeze out provisions , such a transaction is rare in India . As such , an alternative strategy like selective reduction of capital is employed for squeezing out minorities . <h> 3.6 Do minority shareholders enjoy protections against the payment of control premiums , other preferential pricing for selected shareholders , and partial acquisitions , for example by mandatory offer requirements , ownership disclosure obligations and a best price/all holders rule ? <p> Any person holding more than 25% of the voting rights in a company must make an open offer for 26% of the total shares of the target company . A person holding shares between 25 and 75% can acquire more than five percent of the voting rights , unless they make an open offer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares that would take their shareholding to more than 75% ( ie. the promoter shareholding threshold for listed companies ) . <p> The Takeover Regulations envisage disclosure obligations on the acquirer in case of any change in his shareholding/voting rights . Any person holding five percent or more of the shares must disclose any acquisition/disposal representing two percent or more of shares/voting rights . Continual disclosures must be made by shareholders holding 25% or more voting rights , as of the 31st day of March , every year , within seven days from the end of financial year . Details of encumbered shares must also be disclosed . <p> The acquirer must pay to public shareholders the higher of the negotiated price paid to the seller and other prices calculated using a prescribed formula linked with the market value of shares of the target . Any premium paid by the acquirer to the seller must be added back to the price paid by the public shareholders as well . <h> 3.7 To what extent can buyers make conditional offers , for example subject to financing , absence of material adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain funding of the purchase price required ? <p> An acquirer can make a conditional offer based on the minimum level of acceptances subject to the following : <p> ( i ) the acquisition document should contain a condition that if the desired level of acceptances is not received , the acquirer shall not proceed with the transaction ; and <p> ( ii ) the acquirer and persons acting in concert shall not acquire any shares of the target during the offer period . <p> In the case of such conditional offers , an acquirer is not entitled to appoint any director representing them on the board of directors of the target company . <p> Whole or part of the consideration payable to public shareholders must be deposited in an escrow account and payments are thereafter , made by the bank . <h> Section 4 : TAX CONSIDERATIONS <h> 4.1 What are the basic tax considerations and trade-offs ? <p> In any share transaction , the rate of tax on capital gains depends on whether the gains are long-term ( shares held for more than 12 months ) or short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Capital gains in cross-border deals are a concern , especially in cases of indirect transfer ( transfer of foreign securities , which derives substantial value from underlying Indian assets ) . Capital gains made by a foreign shareholder by selling shares of an Indian company are subject to DTAA . In appropriate cases , it is advisable to obtain an advance ruling and include tax indemnity in the acquisition structure . <h> Section 5 : ANTI-TAKEOVER DEFENCES <p> 5.1 What are the most important forms of anti-takeover defences and are there any restrictions on their use ? <p> In India , hostile takeovers are rare ( see 3.1 ) . One of the pre-emptive strategies the promoter undertakes to thwart a hostile takeover is consolidating their shareholding by continuous creeping acquisition under the Takeover Regulations . <p> Pending a tender offer , the target can not initiate major corporate actions without obtaining majority shareholders ' approval . Further , during this period , the board of directors of target must act in the ordinary course consistent with past practice . As such , the scope of mounting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable measure appears to be the issue of shares on conversion of existing convertible securities . <h> 5.2 How do targets use anti-takeover defences ? <p> Takeover defences , if any , are usually taken by promoters or majority shareholders of the target . The target does not usually employ these defences . <h> 5.3 Is a target required to provide due diligence information to a potential bidder ? <p> There is a requirement for the target to permit a due diligence opportunity to a potential hostile bidder ; however , no such practice exists . <h> 5.4 How do bidders overcome anti-takeover defences ? <p> Anti-takeover defences could be overcome by instituting court proceedings against the target or its directors or by offering a higher price than the primary tender offer . <h> 5.5 Are there many examples of successful hostile acquisitions ? <p> No . <h> Section 6 : DEAL PROTECTIONS <h> 6.1 What are the main ways for a friendly bidder and target to protect a friendly deal from a hostile interloper ? <p> The Takeover Regulations do not prohibit a person from launching a competing offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 6.2 To what extent are deal protections prevented , for example by restrictions on impediments to competing bidders , break fees or lock-up agreements ? <p> Since a hostile offer does not need the agreement/support of the target , deal protection measures for the primary tender offer are not relevant . <h> Section 7 : ANTITRUST/REGULATORY REVIEW <h> 7.1 What are the antitrust notification thresholds in your jurisdiction ? <p> Any acquisition of shares , voting rights or assets that exceeds specific thresholds , acquisition of control , and mergers or amalgamations ( all are broadly categorised as combinations ) crossing certain thresholds require the approval of the CCI . <p> However , antitrust thresholds are not typically applicable in cases of intra-group mergers , mergers of two enterprises where one exercises 50% shares/voting rights of another enterprise such that such transaction does not result in transfer from joint to sole control , etc. <h> 7.2 When will transactions falling below those thresholds be investigated ? <p> Irrespective of the thresholds , any transaction that has caused or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antitrust notification filing mandatory or voluntary ? <p> An antitrust notification filing is mandatory in India , if a combination exceeds the thresholds . <h> 7.4 What are the deadlines for filing , and what are the penalties for not filing ? <p> A combination filing must be made within 30 days of approval of a proposal of merger or amalgamation by the board of directors or of execution of any agreement for acquisition or acquiring control of enterprise , whichever is earlier . <p> A penalty of up to one percent of the total turnover or assets , whichever is higher in the case of a combination , can be levied on the person or enterprise responsible for the same . <h> 7.5 How long are the anti-trust review periods ? <p> Typically , within 30 days from the date on which notice is given in respect of a combination , the CCI provides a prima facie view on whether the combination would have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India . Unless the CCI has passed an order approving or rejecting a combination , a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which notice was given . <h> 7.6 At what level does your anti-trust authority have jurisdiction to review and impose penalties for failure to notify deals that do not have local competition effect ? <p> The CCI can review deals taking place outside India , if the threshold requirements under the Competition Act 2002 are met regardless of whether they have a local competition effect . <h> 7.7 What other regulatory or related obstacles do bidders face , including national security or protected industry review , foreign ownership restrictions , employment regulation and other governmental regulation ? <p> Typically , a foreign bidder is free to acquire shares and assets unless the activities of the Indian target form part of a licensed sector ( for example , air transport services , defence production , and insurance ) . In such cases , conditions of license or approval in respect of ownership or management must also be complied with . Share acquisitions usually do not trigger employee compensation unless simultaneous lay-off/retrenchment is planned . <h> Section 8 : ANTI-CORRUPTION REGIMES <h> 8.1 What is the applicable anti-corruption legislation in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Code 1860 ; the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 ; and the Right to Information Act 2005. <h> 8.2 What are the potential sanctions and how stringently have they been enforced ? <p> These sanctions ( both pecuniary and penal ) have been heavily enforced recently . However , cases reported of such instances are rare . <h> Section 9 : OTHER MATTERS <h> 9.1 Are there any other material issues in your jurisdiction that might affect a public M&amp;A transaction ? <p> In 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 , there have been significant changes in the regulatory regime affecting public M&amp;A activities . These changes pertain to companies laws , securities laws and competition laws . Simultaneously , the government has liberalised the exchange control regime which is expected to ease cross-border M&amp;As especially in the manufacturing sector . <p> Dipankar Bandyopadhyay is an experienced M&amp;A lawyer and head of the corporate practice at Verus . Bandyopadhyay advises on public and private M&amp;A , private equity , venture capital and financing matters .

@@8538510 @1738510/ <h> Cayman Islands <h> Author : Published : 30 Sep 2004 @qwx115044 @qwx115046 @qwx115047 @qwx115043 <p> General framework and conduct of business <p> What legislation governs the authorization and regulation of banking activities in the Cayman Islands ? What has been the most significant regulatory issue ? <p> The Monetary Authority Law , which established the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority ( CIMA ) in 1997 , was amended in 2002 to divide CIMA 's principal functions into four categories : monetary , regulatory , cooperative and advisory . CIMA is responsible for the licensing and regulation of banks and other financial services businesses conducted in or from the Cayman Islands . The Monetary Authority Law prescribes CIMA 's general duties in the exercise of its regulatory functions , its specific powers in relation to any financial services business being contained in the relevant regulatory law . The regulatory law governing the licensing and regulation of banks is the Banks and Trust Companies Law . <p> The 2002 amendments to the Monetary Authority Law required the board of CIMA to publish a regulatory handbook setting out the policies and procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative functions . The handbook is also specifically required to include policies and procedures for giving warning notices to persons affected adversely by the proposed actions of CIMA , giving reasons for its decisions and dealing with complaints against its actions and decisions . The regulatory handbook was published in interim form in October 2003 . <p> At the same time , a number of statements of guidance were published , some of general application to all financial services business , others of specific application to licensed banks . The latter were developed using corresponding papers published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , to which licensees are referred for further guidance . <p> Another regulatory development has been the introduction of regulations under the Securities Investment Business Law which came fully into force on July 29 2003 . Two sets of regulations deal respectively with Financial Requirements and Standards and the Conduct of Securities Investment Business . The latter are referred to in more detail below . <p> What are the key activities for which authorization is required in the Cayman Islands ? <p> What sanctions are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against regulated bodies ? <p> Statutory sanctions are available to CIMA if it believes that : ( i ) a bank is or appears likely to be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due ; is carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the public interest , the interests of its depositors or other creditors ; has contravened the Banks and Trust Companies Law or has failed to comply with a condition of its licence ; ( ii ) the direction and control of a bank 's business has not been conducted in a fit and proper manner , or a director , manager or officer of the bank is not a fit and proper person to hold that position ; or ( iii ) a person acquiring ownership or control of a bank is not a fit and proper person to have that control or ownership . <p> In those circumstances , CIMA has various possible courses of action . It may : ( i ) revoke the bank 's licence , impose conditions or further conditions on that licence , or vary or revoke any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any director or officer of the bank ; ( iii ) appoint a person to advise the bank on the proper conduct of its affairs and to report to CIMA , or to assume control of the bank 's affairs ( any such appointment being at the expense of the bank ) ; and ( iv ) require the bank to take such other action as CIMA considers necessary . <p> CIMA 's approach to , and its procedures for , the exercise of these powers are set out in its policy statement , The Ladder of Compliance . This sets out the considerations that CIMA will take into account in determining what action to take in the event of any concern as to the matters referred to above ( a contravention ) , and the stages of action by CIMA , which depend on the seriousness of the contravention and whether any remedial required action is satisfactorily undertaken . <p> Does the regulatory regime in the Cayman Islands include regulatory conduct of business rules governing the obligations of a bank to its customers ? <p> There are no comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although any concerns will be taken into account by CIMA in its ongoing review of licensees . <p> As indicated above , specific regulations apply to banks that are licensed to conduct securities investment business : The Securities Investment Business ( Conduct of Business ) Regulations . Among other things , these regulations prescribe advertising standards , standards for dealing with clients and requirements relating to dealing with client assets and money . They also require the establishment of effective complaints handling systems and procedures . The standards for dealing with clients contain provision for classification of clients ( as private clients , professional clients or market counterparties ) , the contents of agreements with clients ( including discretionary management agreements and contingent liability investment agreements ) , lending to clients , reports , disclosure and client access to records . <p> Supervisory requirements <p> Does the regulatory regime for banking business in the Cayman Islands include regulatory capital requirements ? If so , are these based on the Basel Accord and are there significant variations from the core Basel recommendations ? <p> Licensed banks ( other than those holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement imposed by CIMA ( subject to a minimum of $500,000 ) : they are also required to risk asset ratios in accordance with CIMA 's policies . These policies do not have statutory force , though it is likely that they will in the future , and the requirements are imposed by CIMA as conditions of licences . CIMA 's stated policy is to adhere closely to the Basel Core Principles . <p> What effect will Basel II have on banking transactions in the Cayman Islands ? <p> The effect of Basel II on banks licensed in the Cayman Islands is uncertain , and is likely to differ between international banks and local banks . To the extent that , as part of the regulatory process , CIMA looks to the capital adequacy requirements of a bank 's primary regulator ( as is the case with Cayman Islands branches of foreign banks ) , that will be affected by the adoption of Basel II by the jurisdiction of the primary regulator . <p> More generally , a working group of the Caribbean Group of Bank Supervisors has been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a number of banks from the different regional jurisdictions will be asked to participate in obtaining data on the impact of Basel II . It is also expected to provide information to facilitate a regional approach to Basel II which is both harmonized and appropriate to each jurisdiction . <p> Does the regime in the Cayman Islands include rules and operational and organizational requirements relating to internal controls and operational risk ? <p> Among the guidelines published by CIMA at the time of publication of its regulatory handbook were guidelines on Operational Risk Management and Internal Controls for banks . Both are based on publications of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision . The Operational Risk Management guidelines deal with the respective roles of a bank 's board of directors and senior management in establishing , implementing and monitoring operational risk management procedures , including identifying and measuring operational risks , their control and mitigation . The Internal Controls guidelines deal more generally with the roles of the board of directors and senior management and apportionment of responsibilities , risk recognition and assessment , controls and internal audit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Does the regime in the Cayman Islands include a requirement for controllers and major shareholders of regulated banking institutions to be approved by the supervisory authorities ? <p> A person acquiring control or ownership of a licensed bank must be a fit and proper person to have such control or ownership , which is determined by CIMA by reference to published guidelines and in accordance with published procedures . <p> Consequently , the issue or transfer of shares of a licensed bank ( and of most other licensees under the regulatory laws ) is prohibited without CIMA 's prior approval , and this prohibition extends to beneficial as well as legal interests in shares . The transfer of shares in a bank 's parent company will be regarded , for this purpose , as a transfer of a beneficial interest in the shares of the bank itself . <p> However , a bank may be exempted from this requirement for prior consent if its shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange approved by CIMA . Any such exemption is subject to the conditions that the bank must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notify CIMA of any change of control of the bank , any acquisition by a person or group of persons of more than 10% of the issued share capital or total voting rights of the bank or its parent company ; and ( ii ) provide CIMA with such information , within such period of time , as it may require to assess whether each of the transferees of the shares is a fit and proper person to have control of the bank , or ownership of the shares . <p> Investor protection scheme <p> Have there been any recent significant changes to the insolvency legislation in the Cayman Islands or are any such changes proposed ? <p> The Cayman Islands has no comprehensive insolvency statute . The principal provisions relating to insolvency of individuals and partnerships are contained in the Bankruptcy Law and those relating to the insolvency of companies are contained in the Companies Law . There has been no recent amendment to either law in this regard . Amendments to the Companies Law are imminent , following a recent review , but no significant amendments to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate a deposit protection of guarantee scheme protecting retail depositors from loss in the event of insolvency of an authorized bank ? <p> There is no deposit insurance or guarantee scheme in the Cayman Islands , but deposits with a Class A licensed bank incorporated in the Cayman Islands ( that is , a bank that carries on local retail business ) constitute , up to a prescribed limit and subject to certain exclusions , preferential debts on the winding up of the bank . <p> The first CI$20,000 ( $24,000 ) of such deposits are repayable in priority to other debts of the bank ( other than certain taxes and wages , with which they rank equally ) . This is essentially a measure to protect individual depositors , and does not apply to deposits in the name of another financial institution , any director , controller or manager of the bank ( or anyone exercising those functions ) , any person holding 5% or more of the shares of the bank , or any parent , subsidiary or company under common ownership with the bank . <p> Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or similar scheme for the resolution of disputes between a bank and its retail customers other than through formal legal proceedings ? <p> Although a Complaints Commissioner has recently been appointed to deal with complaints about administrative actions of government departments , there is no equivalent official to deal with disputes with private institutions . <p> Other developments <p> EU Savings Directive <p> The Council of the EU 's Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of income in the form of interest payments is part of a package of tax measures , designed to tackle harmful tax competition , and agreed by the finance ministers of the member states of the EU in June 2003 . <p> The Directive does not contemplate that it will apply until a number of specified countries that are not EU member states have applied measures that are equivalent to , or the same as , those provided for by the Directive . Those countries include the Cayman Islands , as a dependent territory of the UK . <p> On February 24 2004 , the Cayman Islands government announced that it had agreed to implement with EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with effect from January 1 2005 .

The implementation by the Cayman Islands of exchange of information measures has been similarly postponed , and the Bill for the necessary enabling legislation has not yet been published .

Security <h> 2.1 What types of security are usually seen in project finance transactions in your jurisdiction , and are there any notable exclusions , including assets which can not be secured ? <p> Security which will typically be requested by lenders in a project finance transaction in Hong Kong comprises : security over shares in the project company and , in certain circumstances , also over the parent company of the project company ( by way of share charge ) ; security over relevant project bank accounts and cashflows ( account charge / account assignment ) ; security over all assets , plant and machinery of the project ( fixed and floating charges by a debenture ) ; security over all material project agreements ( including insurance policies ) ( assignment by way of security ) ; security over land use rights and immovable properties including the land where the project is located ( real estate mortgage ) . <p> To enhance their rights and interests in a project finance transaction , it is not uncommon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lenders and the counterparties to material project agreements ( including step-in rights for the lenders ) , debt service undertakings granted by sponsors and completion guarantees granted by sponsors and on occasion cost overrun support . <h> 2.2 Would the law of your jurisdiction enforce arrangements whereby debt is subordinated by way of a contractual agreement ( including in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings ) ? <p> Yes , contractual subordination of debt is permissible provided that it complies with the mandatory statutory requirements and pari passu principle applicable on insolvency . <h> 3 . Perfection , priority and enforcement <h> 3.1 How is a security interest in each type of security perfected and how is its priority established ? <p> Perfection requirements of security interest varies according to the types of the secured assets . <p> Registration at the Companies Registry <p> The Companies Ordinance ( Cap . 622 ) sets out the list of charges that shall be registered with the Hong Kong Companies Registry . A company incorporated in Hong Kong or a non-Hong Kong company registered in Hong Kong will have to make filings for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security . <p> The consequences of failure to comply with the security registration requirements under the Companies Ordinance ( Cap . 622 ) are ( i ) liability to a fine and ( ii ) the relevant charge being void against any liquidator and creditor of the security provider so far as any security on its undertaking or property is conferred by the charge . <p> Registration at the Land Registry <p> The law does not impose any time limit on the registration of a real estate mortgage with the Hong Kong Land Registry , but late registration may lead to a loss of registration priority . If a real estate mortgage is duly presented for registration within one month after the date of its execution , it may retain a priority back to that date . If outside the one-month period , the priority will be counted from the date of its due presentation for registration . <p> Other specific registers <p> Security over certain assets will need to be registered with certain asset-specific registries . For instance , security over a registered trademark must be registered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and registered design must be registered with the Hong Kong Patents Registry and the Hong Kong Designs Registry respectively . Security over Hong Kong-registered ships must be registered with the Hong Kong Shipping Registry . <p> Other perfection requirements <p> Assignment by way of security will need to be perfected by delivering a notice of assignment to the relevant counterparty . <p> Priority of security <p> Generally , the priority between competing security interests over the same asset is determined by the date of security creation ( the earlier prevails ) . The following rules apply to specific types of security interest created on the same date : <p> A legal security ranks above equitable security <p> Priority between competing floating charges is determined by the date of crystallisation ( the earlier prevails ) <p> Priority between competing security interests over receivables is determined by the order in which written notice is given to the debtor <p> The rule which may override the above principles is that a bona fide purchaser , including a subsequent secured party , only loses priority if it has notice of the prior encumbrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give notice to the world of the existence of such charge and prevent the loss of priority to a subsequent secured party . <h> 3.2 Are any fees , taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and , if so , are there lawful techniques to minimise or defer them ? <p> Tax <p> No tax will be charged for perfecting a security interest in Hong Kong ( except in the case of a legal mortgage of shares which requires transfer of shares in a Hong Kong company , a nominal stamp duty will be charged ) . <p> Fees and charges <p> Registration fees and charges at various registries per security document : <p> Registry <p> ? Fees/Charges <p> 1 . Companies Registry <p> HK$340 <p> 2 . Land Registry <p> ? HK$230 per mortgage per property for consideration of not more than HK$750,000 ; HK$450 per mortgage per property for consideration of HK$750,000 or more <p> 3 . Trade Marks Registry <p> ? HK$800 <p> 4 . Patents Registry <p> HK$325 <p> 5 . Designs Registry <p> HK$590 <h> 3.3 May a corporate entity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party ? <h> 4 . Foreign investment and ownership restrictions <h> 4.1 What restrictions , fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project ? <p> Hong Kong does not subject foreign investments per se to special regulatory , tax or fees regimes or requirements . There are however restrictions on voting control by non-Hong Kong residents and corporations in the broadcasting sector . <p> Hong Kong law does not impose restrictions on foreign ownership generally but operation of certain business will require application for the relevant licences from the relevant governmental authorities , eg in the case of mining , mining licences from the Civil Engineering and Development Department , in the case of electric power and light generation , certain licences from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Environmental Protection Department , etc. <h> 4.2 Can a government authority block or unwind a transaction involving foreign investors after it has closed for strategic , national security or other reasons ? <p> The Hong Kong courts may refuse to uphold certain commercial agreements if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial agreements are also subject to limitations arising from insolvency or similar laws generally affecting rights of creditors in Hong Kong eg transactions may be set aside by the court on the ground of unfair preference or fraudulent preference . <h> 5 . Documentation formalities and government approvals <h> 5.1 Is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable ? <p> Hong Kong courts give effect to the choice of foreign law as the governing law of a contract generally subject to qualifications , eg the choice of foreign law as the governing law does not restrict the Hong Kong courts from applying the overriding mandatory provisions of Hong Kong law or the Hong Kong courts may refuse to apply a provision of foreign law if application of that provision would be contrary to or incompatible with public policy in Hong Kong . <p> A waiver of immunity clause commonly included in contracts will not be effective in Hong Kong . Immunity can only be waived in Hong Kong in advance of a claim in a state-to-state treaty . The sovereign or crown entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the suit and enforcement action is commenced by taking an active role in the Hong Kong court proceedings without claiming immunity . <p> The FG Hemisphere Associates v Democratic Republic of the Congo case confirms that the doctrine of absolute immunity applies in Hong Kong ( ie the domestic courts of one state would not normally have jurisdiction to adjudicate on matters in which another State is named as defendant subject to the only exception where the defendant state waives immunity before the forum state ) . <h> 5.2 Is English or New York law recognised as a valid choice of law in your jurisdiction ? <p> Yes , subject to qualifications as mentioned in section 5.1. <h> 5.3 Would courts recognise a foreign arbitral tribunal award or court judgment ? If so , what are the conditions applicable to such recognition ? <p> The conditions for recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral tribunal awards and foreign court judgments in Hong Kong vary according to where the arbitral award or where the foreign court judgment was made . It is easier to enforce certain foreign arbitral awards or court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforcement of arbitral awards or court judgments . For instance , arbitral awards made in a state who is party to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ( the New York Convention ) will be recognised and enforced in Hong Kong who is a party to the New York Convention . The Mainland Judgments ( Reciprocal Enforcement ) Ordinance ( Cap . 597 ) provides for the recognition and enforcement of the civil and commercial judgments of designated Mainland courts . <h> 6 . Bankruptcy proceedings and enforcement <h> 6.1 How does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral/security ? <p> Generally , security interest will be not affected by the commencement of an insolvency proceeding against a company but : <p> ( a ) security interest may be held to be wholly or partially invalid and set aside in full or in part on certain grounds provided in the Companies ( Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions ) Ordinance ( Cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) a floating charge will usually crystallise and become a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of the security document when a bankruptcy proceeding has been initiated against the chargor ; <p> ( c ) the contractual set off rights in a security document may be ineffective against a liquidator or creditor due to mandatory insolvency law provisions ; and <p> ( d ) certain preferential payments like wages and severance payments to employees will need to be made in priority to the claims of a chargee of a floating charge . <p> Hong Kong law does not have a moratorium regime to prevent creditors from enforcing security against a company . <h> 6.2 Outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding , what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the security ? <p> A creditor may enforce its rights under a security document as a secured party in accordance with the terms and conditions therein . There are usually provisions in the security documents or in other finance documents ( eg an intercreditor agreement ) governing the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enforceable . <p> Before the security is enforceable , there may be restrictions on actions that may be taken by the security provider in respect of the secured assets . Typically , the security documents will also confer certain rights on the secured parties to facilitate enforcement eg power of sale , appointment of receivers , etc . A floating charge can only be enforced after it is converted into a fixed charge and security documents will usually provide that such conversion shall be triggered by a notice from the chargee to the chargor upon the occurrence of certain events eg an event of default . <h> 6.3 What processes , other than court proceedings , are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement ? For instance , is contractual enforcement ( such as receivership ) recognised ? <p> To avoid security enforcement through court proceedings that may be costly and time-consuming , creditors may prefer contractual enforcement of security in Hong Kong . Security documents usually include provisions on appointment of receivers by secured parties , powers of receivers ( which usually include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of sale . The powers of receivers could be very extensive in the case of a share charge . <h> 7 . Foreign exchange , remittances and repatriation <h> 7.1 What , if any , are the restrictions , controls , fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal , interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions ? <p> There are no governmental restrictions , controls or fees applicable to foreign currency exchange in Hong Kong . It is worthwhile to note that the renminbi conversion limit for Hong Kong residents of RMB20,000 per day has not been applicable since November 17 2014 . <p> There is no capital gains tax on investment returns or withholding tax on payments of principal , interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions . <p> There are no restrictions on project companies establishing and maintaining foreign currency accounts in Hong Kong or in other jurisdictions. <h> 8 . Public-private partnerships <h> 8.1 Is there a public-private partnership ( PPP ) act or similar statute authorising PPPs , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no general legislation ( or ordinance ) creating a framework for the implementation of PPPs in Hong Kong . The government 's constitutional power to contract is considered to be sufficiently extensive and flexible in most cases . The relevant public authority will determine the feasibility of the proposed PPP . The bureau or department will take a number of steps to select a private partner . The executive council will then need to approve an implementation framework for the proposed PPP , followed by the government issuing a project brief . The government and private partner will then reach provisional agreements and then a Bill should also be introduced into LegCo which provides the legal framework for the proposed PPP . <p> As for brownfield or greenfield PPP , nothing expressly prohibits either and the treatment of land as an asset should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis . <h> 8.2 May a concessionaire grant security interest in the project to its lenders and , if so , is consent of the government or contracting authority required ? <p> Whether security interest can be created and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevant contracting authority will depend on the terms and conditions of the agreements between the proposed security provider and the government or the relevant contracting authority . For instance , in the case of land , the terms and conditions of the governmental lease will need to be reviewed <h> 9 . Insurance <h> 9.1 Are there any restrictions , controls , fees or taxes on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies ? <p> In Hong Kong there are no controls on foreign exchange or transfer of funds preventing payment of insurance proceeds by a foreign insurance company . Only profits arising in Hong Kong from a trade , profession or business carried on in the territory are taxable . Offshore income or income derived from investments outside Hong Kong are therefore not taxable in Hong Kong . <h> 9.2 Is reinsurance in the international market commonly seen on project finance transactions in your jurisdiction and are cut-through clauses permitted ? <p> Hong Kong has an active reinsurance market . Hong Kong may also develop as an offshore RMB reinsurance centre . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a specific clause or an endorsement attached to the reinsurance agreement . However , to be effective in Hong Kong , such clauses or provisions must be expressly agreed to by the parties to operate effectively ( namely by the reinsurer in favour of the insurer ) .

The country is gearing up for new regulation and products that will make the jurisdiction more attractive and easier to operate in <p> Financial globalisation is particularly important for emerging markets and Colombia has not been indifferent to this reality . Foreign financial entities are increasingly looking to Colombia , not only for selling their products and services but also for making direct or portfolio investments . Similarly , Colombian investors are willing to explore foreign markets to diversify their risks . This situation , along with issuance of the Basel III guidelines and the fact that Colombia is seeking to be included in the OECD , has led the Colombian financial authorities to consider certain modifications to the regulations to facilitate and promote cross-border transactions . There are a number of new initiatives coming down the regulatory pipeline that will create opportunities for foreign financial entities interested in offering their products and services in Colombia ( including the securities markets ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid instruments for Colombian banks. ( 1 ) <h> Hybrid instruments <p> The Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) issued Decree 1648 on September 2 2014 ( Decree 1648 ) to regulate the requirements that hybrid instruments must meet to qualify for tier 1 additional capital and tier 2 capital of financial institutions in Colombia , among other things . Decree 1648 aimed to follow the Basel III guidelines . However , it included a very broad and general regulation of these instruments that left more questions than certainties for potential Colombian issuers . As a consequence , the MoF is planning to issue a new decree ( the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree ) regulating in a more detailed manner hybrid instruments to be issued by Colombian financial institutions . The planed modifications to the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree include a number of new factors . As noted previously , hybrid instruments may qualify for tier 1 additional capital or for tier 2 capital . The requirements for these purposes are in essence the same when it comes to the full subscription and payment of the instruments , the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms , and the fact that the issuer is prohibited from accepting differing prices in payment for the instrument . However , in addition to meeting the above-mentioned requirements , a hybrid instrument qualifying for Tier 1 additional capital must also meet the following requirements . <p> The instruments must be perpetual ( in the case of Tier 2 capital instruments , they must be issued with a maturity of at least five years ) and , therefore , they could only be redeemed early if the following three requirements arising from Basel III were met : ( a ) the issuer obtained the Colombian regulator 's authorisation to that effect ; ( b ) the instruments were substituted for others having the same or better features ; and , ( c ) the issuer did not create expectations as to the repurchase of the hybrid instruments . <p> The prospectus , offering memorandum , or the relevant offering document must contain provisions allowing the issuer not to make payments of coupons under certain circumstances . However , the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree plans to allow the resetting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to redeem the instrument early , following the provisions explained below . <p> In any event , the offering document must clearly state that the non-payment of coupons must not be regarded as a default or event of default by the issuer . <h> " The Ministry of Finance is planning to issue a new decree regulating hybrid instruments " <p> Finally , the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree does not allow the accumulation of coupon payments , once the financial strength of the issuer is recovered , as the case may be . <p> As previously regulated by Decree 1648 , the loss absorption mechanism may consist of the conversion of the hybrid instrument into shares or the early amortisation of the same . However , the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree confirms that the conversion must be into common or preferred shares , provided that those shares comply with the requirements for Tier 1 capital . In any event , the decree allows the issuer to determine in the offering documents the conversion methodology that it deems appropriate . <p> In cases of early amortisation , the Proposed Hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the issuer . In other words , this decree , at the time of writing , does not allow future write-ups of the instruments , once the financial strength of the issuer is recovered . <p> As provided by Decree 1648 , the Proposed Hybrid Instrument Decree reiterates that the loss absorption mechanism must restore the basic solvency ratio of the issuer to a minimum of 5.125% or to any other higher percentage defined by the issuer in the offering documents . These percentages are , thus , the automatic triggers for the loss absorption mechanism . However , the decree also confirms that the offering documents must clearly include provisions stating the Colombian regulator 's trigger in this regard . <p> Finally , the Proposed Hybrid Instruments Decree allows the parent company of the issuer to include in its technical patrimony the hybrid instruments of its issuing subsidiary , if the offering document contains provisions to the effect that the loss absorption mechanisms are also triggered when the events mentioned in point 3 above are met by the parent company . <h> Foreign investment <p> Colombia has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows the free flow of currency into and outside Colombia , is formalistic in the extreme . In addition , it is not aligned with the suggestions and guidelines of the IMF and the OECD . Given the fact that Colombia expects to be formally admitted into the OECD in the near future , the MoF is planning to amend the foreign investment regulations , which include the exchange control regime , in order to closer comply with international standards . <p> One of the shortcomings of the foreign investment regime is the way in which direct investments ( FDI ) and portfolio investments are defined . Indeed , FDIs are simply defined as a list of operations commonly regarded as such and , in turn , portfolio investments are defined as investments in listed securities and local funds . <p> The problem with this kind of approach is twofold : for one thing , there are a number of operations that fall outside the list of operations that are considered FDI and , therefore , can not be registered ( and that registration is required to obtain remittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not capture the essence of FDIs . <p> According to the IMF and the OECD , FDI is defined as investments in which the investor takes control ( or , at least , a large degree of influence ) of the issuer , or when the investor aims at establishing a long-lasting strategic relationship with the issuer . In brief , the two approaches look after a permanent liaison of the investor in the target . <h> " One of the shortcomings of the foreign investment regime is the way in which FDI and portfolio investments are defined " <p> None of these elements are taken into consideration in the definitions of FDI or portfolio investments , hence leading to confusion ( and sometimes sanctions ) when investors register their foreign investments with local authorities . One example of this situation would be an investment in listed companies with a long-lasting outlook : foreign investors tend to register these investments as FDIs . However , in a document recently issued by the MoF , these investments were considered portfolio investments , given the definition mentioned above . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amend the prevailing foreign investment regime by following the ' substance ' approach of the IMF and the OECD . Furthermore , although in the existing draft decree the list of operations remains as the approach for defining FDIs , at least the substantial test mentioned above is also included , providing much more certainty to investors and local advisors . <p> Other areas of concern around the rigid formalism of our foreign investment regime include : the fact that there are different ways to register different kinds of operations ( which also creates confusion ) ; the strict timelines in which the registration must be accomplished ; and , the capacity of the local exchange control authorities for reviewing the existence of the underlying operations that give rise to the foreign investment . <p> The new approach of the MoF in these respects involves simplifying the registration procedures , limiting the authority of the governmental agencies in reviewing the existence of the underlying operations ( exchanging this process with an affidavit from the investor ) , and abolishing the time limits for carrying out the registration . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign investors and , hence , result in fewer administrative investigations that might lead to sanctions for the investors . <h> Promotion of foreign financial products and services <p> To recognise the evolution of the local and international stock markets and to protect non-sophisticated local investors , by the end of 2014 , the MoF proposed modifying Decree 2555 of 2010 in respect of the promotion of foreign products and services in Colombia ( the Proposed Off-shore Services Decree ) . <p> The aim of the Proposed Off-shore Services Decree is to establish a clear difference between the types of clients approached by foreign financial institutions . Indeed , if the foreign financial institution plans to engage in promotional activities aimed at institutional or sophisticated investors , the MoF is proposing reducing the regulatory burdens for the promotion of foreign financial products and services . By the same token , the Proposed Offshore Services Decree also aims at de-regulating the requirements for foreign reinsurance companies wishing to promote their business in Colombia , by requiring them to incorporate a representation office without the need for any previous authorisation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies that are deemed to be sophisticated entities . The mere registration of the representation office with the SFC will suffice . <p> To prevent non-sophisticated Colombian investors from misunderstanding foreign products and services and the risks associated with them , the Proposed Offshore Services Decree plans to include strict advisory duties for local officers of foreign financial institutions engaged in promotional activities . To this effect , the Proposed Offshore Services Decree , following the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive issued by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union , requires marketing personnel of foreign financial institutions to make recommendations and disclose warnings to the client . This is to help ensure that the client understands the offered product or service and its applicable regulations thus enabling the client to make an informed decision . <p> The Proposed Offshore Services Decree also requires that officers engaged in promotional activities evaluate the individual conditions and risk-tolerance of the client . Furthermore , if the professional rendering the advice considers that the client 's profile is not adequate for the risk it is taking in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose his/her opinion in writing . <p> Finally , the Proposed Offshore Services Decree assigns a very important role to local stockbrokers as being the only agents in Colombia for foreign financial entities . In fact , if a foreign financial institution needs to promote its capital market services in Colombia , the Proposed Offshore Services Decree requires it to either incorporate a representative office or enter into correspondent agreements solely with stockbrokers . These agreements may also be entered into with financial corporations . <p> However , the main component of the Proposed Offshore Services Decree is that only stockbrokers will be allowed to trade , on behalf of Colombian investors , with foreign securities in the primary or secondary markets and with securities and shares issued by offshore investment funds . For this purpose , the decree establishes a series of rules to protect this type of investment from unnecessary risks . <p> With this regulatory pipeline in mind , it is clear that the Colombian government is looking to incorporate international standards into the financial regulatory framework , not only to promote cross-border transactions but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain procedural burdens and the creation of incentives to trade with international financial products are a response to a business necessity at a time when the combination of the devaluation of the Colombian peso and the drop in the price of crude oil is certainly impacting our economy . <p> Juan Fernando has advised lenders and borrowers , including the Colombian government and state-owned companies , in the areas of corporate finance , asset finance , and project finance , among others .

With more than $1 billion invested in about 500 portfolio companies during the past 12 years - and with over 25% of the sum allocated in the whole of central and eastern Europe having been invested in Hungarian portfolio companies - the country is playing a dominant role in the region 's venture capital market . <p> THE VENTURE CAPITAL ACT <p> By the end of 1998 , venture capital investments - the overwhelming part of which had come from foreign sources - made up 6.5% of foreign direct capital investments , and their rate within the total volume of the working-capital inflow for 1998 amounted to more than 10% . <p> It became ever clearer to Hungarian governments that private equity and venture capital investments could play an essential role in long-term economic growth . To foster the creation and improvement of advanced and competitive enterprises , the Hungarian Parliament passed the Venture Capital Act ( Act XXXIV of 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all venture capital entities , and accordingly applies not only to venture capital funds and to venture capital companies set up in Hungary , but to branches of foreign companies registered in Hungary as well . These entities serve as intermediaries between investors and the target companies . <p> A company may , of course , make investments in Hungary without complying with the rules of the Act and without fulfilling the obligations . In such a case , the company is not entitled to certain tax and accounting benefits granted to venture capital entities . One of these benefits is set out in the Act LXXXI of 1996 on Corporate Tax and Dividend Tax , according to which venture capital entities need not pay corporate tax , under the condition that the rate of the entity 's capital investments is higher than certain limits ( see below ) . <p> The most important provisions of the Venture Capital Act are : <p> Licensing procedure .

The subscribed capital of a venture capital or fund must be at least Ft500 million ( $2.1 million ) , and - another disputed provision of the act - the total amount has to be paid upon subscription : commitments only are not accepted . <p> Rules of investment . The main activity of the capital investment entity - capital investment - is both encouraged and restricted by the Act . On one hand , fund must invest more than 30% of its issued capital within 24 months of its subscription , and this percentage must not fall below 30% for four years . In addition , the percentage of capital investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach 50% on average in the first six years , and 70% in at least three years over the same period . <p> On the other hand , the maximum investment a venture capital entity may make in one undertaking is also regulated : it must not be greater than 15% of the entity 's own equity . <p> Certain investment restrictions . Venture capital companies and funds can not acquire interests in financial institutions , investment service providers , asset managers , clearing houses , insurance companies and gambling companies . With only a few exceptions , funds may not acquire real estate , and venture capital companies have only a limited right to do so . The acquisition of stock-exchange-listed securities is ruled out . <p> As described in the preamble of the Act , the legislative aim was to stimulate investment into small and medium sized Hungarian companies and to regulate and encourage investment by venture capitalists . But the act suffers from a number of limitations . The registration procedure is too cumbersome and complex .

Fundamental characteristics of both are their separate legal entity and their limited liability to their capital . This means shareholder 's of the Rt and members of the Kft are not liable thereof . <p> Only an Rt has shares representing the holding in the company . The Business Corporation Act distinguishes between public and private Rts . An Rt qualifies as private corporation if its shares are not issued publicly . <p> RECENT RESULTS <p> Because the Hungarian market is still small compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe market correction in the history of the venture capital industry in 2001 , the overall health and maturity of the local venture capital industry should not be overlooked . <p> Rises in 2000 <p> In 2000 Hungary saw record levels of activity in the venture capital and private equity industry . Forty-seven back-up deals were completed by 35 venture capital funds and similar entities in 36 companies . This represented an outstanding increase on 1999 , when 12 transactions were realized in 11 companies . The amount invested more than doubled : $103 million compared with $40 million in 1999 . Investments in later stage companies increased . While the number of investments rose only slightly , the amounts invested grew much more . With $53 million going into already established companies , these so-called follow-on investments represented over half of the amount invested in total , and thus dominated the market . <p> But the most exciting event in the industry was the growth of start-up investment activity . This part of the industry did not exist in 1998 . Even in 1999 there were only four transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 back-up deals . <p> The slow-down in 2001 <p> Like most capital markets , the Hungarian venture capital industry experienced a notable slow-down in 2001 compared to the 2000 results . As you would expect , both the number and the volume of transactions saw a significant - 40% - decrease compared to the record 2000 numbers : a total of $64 million gathered in 28 transactions , including buyout transactions . <p> Start-up investments fell by a third . Still , because 2001 had only been the second year so far of the existence of such deals in the domestic market , it is fair to say that technological start-up investments held-up well , especially compared to the EU market , which suffered a far greater decline during 2001 . This is all the more important because start-up investment was in better shape than the less risky later stage investing . This clearly demonstrates the entrepreneurial climate in Hungary . <p> It is also important to note that by the end of 2001 , buyout investments constituted a well defined and independent branch of the domestic venture capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them public-to-private transactions . <p> The targets of the venture entities registered in Hungary remained the same : half of the investments in 2001 were financing the domestic operations of foreign companies . But an increasing proportion of investment - a third of the total - went to regional companies , signalling not only Hungary 's integration to join the European Community , but also more broadly its desire to integrate into the global market economy . <p> TRENDS <p> While the growth of the venture capital and private equity sectors slowed in 2001 , The past 12 months have been a strong year for the industry once again , with more than $80 million invested . If we look at the new trends and the developments of the market , some important facts stand out . <p> First , as an HVCA study shows , it is becoming ever clearer that with the emergence of a powerful and well-trained management class , the time has come for management buyouts . These have brought discernible benefits in several western countries , including at the macroeconomic level . A survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 underlined the fact , that private equity-backed management buyouts lead to better than average performance , competitiveness employment and remuneration , increased employee involvement and the creation of additional value . <p> Second , the increasingly noticeable trend in he venture capital industry is the growth of investments that can solve , on a business basis , the financing problems of small- and medium-sized companies . <p> And also , as the Venture Capital Act is now widely recognized as having failed to achieve its objectives . The government is making efforts to amend the legal framework of the industry , and therefore to provide a more attractive legal environment for the private equity sector . One proposal is that after three years of investment , capital gains from venture capital are tax-free . <p> We are sure the Hungarian government is determined to make some of the most welcome reforms in the domestic venture capital and private equity industry . This will strengthen the country 's position as a centre of the industry in central and eastern Europe . <p> * ( The figures in this article are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Equity Association. )

What legislation and/or regulatory bodies are responsible for regulating the relationship between landlord and tenant in Belgium ? The relationship between landlord and tenant is regulated by the provisions of Title VIII , Chapter II , Section I , Articles 1714 through 1762bis of the Belgian Civil Code . Most of these general provisions are not mandatory and will apply only if the parties did not provide for them otherwise by contract . <p> Under Belgian law , the term " lease " ( huur or louage ) refers to a contract pursuant to which one party commits to deliver to another party the possession of property for a specific term and in consideration of a certain price , which the latter commits to pay ( Article 1709 of the Civil Code ) . The term " leasing " , in both Dutch and French when used by Belgian legal commentators , refers to transactions where , typically , the lessor purchased the asset according to the requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leased asset ( financial leasing ) . We will use " lease " to mean huur or louage , as opposed to " leasing " . <p> Certain specific contracts between landlord and tenant have been imperatively regulated . The law of February 20 1991 applies if the tenant uses the premises leased as his main residence ; the law of November 4 1696 applies to farm leases ; the law of April 30 1951 is applicable to " commercial leases " , ie leases of real property to be used mainly by the tenant or a sub-tenant for retail trade or for the activity of a craftsman directly in contact with the public ( such leases will be referred to as " retail leases " ) . <p> The lease of offices or warehouses is only regulated by the general lease provisions of the Civil Code . <p> The law of April 30 1951 regulates , inter alia , the term of the lease agreement and the right for renewal , the revision of the rent , the tenant 's right to modify the leased premises , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of the property , the indemnification of the tenant in case of government taking and certain specific procedural issues . The provisions of the law are mandatory . <p> 2 . What is the effect of a tenant 's insolvency , and what remedies are available to landlords ? In the event of bankruptcy of the tenant the contract will most likely be terminated . The landlord may apply a contractual termination clause applicable in such an event . The receiver has the option to terminate the lease or to perform it further ; the receiver is bound to make his choice upon formal request given by the landlord to do so . <p> In the event of request of the tenant for a settlement with its creditors ( gerechtelijk akkoord or concordat judiciaire ) the landlord will not be able to terminate the lease exclusively because of such initiative . However the landlord maintains the right to require the court to terminate the lease for non-performance . <p> By law , the landlord is granted the benefit of a security interest in all furnishings ( including stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the payment of a maximum of two years of rent overdue . <p> Conflicts might arise between the security interest of the landlord and a creditor of the tenant holding a pledge on the business , an unpaid seller claiming the benefit of a retention of title clause on assets sold and delivered and present within the leased premises . Under certain conditions , the claim of such creditors will prevail . <p> As a general rule the first date will be decisive ( date of first performance of the lease , date of entry of the pledge on the business of the tenant ) . Under certain conditions , typically information given to the landlord prior to the entry of the assets in the premises , the claim of the unpaid seller might prevail . <p> In the ranking of priorities granted by law , the privilege of the landlord comes third , after the privilege for the recovery of the enforcement expenses and of expenses made for the preservation of the debtor 's assets . In order to prevent removal of the furnishings , the landlord has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How might changes in accounting standards affect the landlord/tenant relationship ? We are not aware of any proposed changes to the Belgian accounting standards . Changes to the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) are less relevant , as the latter are not yet applicable in Belgium . As of 2005 , listed companies will be obliged to draft their consolidated accounts in accordance with the IFRS . The Belgian government has still not decided in which other cases the application of the IFRS will also be allowed . The immediate impact of the application of the IFRS will of course depend on the final version of the exposure draft regarding the first time application . <p> 4 . How has recent statutory reform affected ( or , how will proposed future statutory reform affect ) the lease renewal process ? The lease renewal process is only regulated in a mandatory manner with regard to retail lease , main residence lease , and farmer 's lease , pursuant to the specific statutes referred to above in section 1 . The renewal process of none of the types of leases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory reform ; we are not aware of any proposed future statutory reform . <p> When a building is offered for lease on the market , a landlord may not discriminate when selecting a tenant . In addition to criminal sanctions , a victim of discrimination may request an injunction order to stop the discrimination . <p> 6 . What is the effect of conditions restricting tenants wishing to divest themselves of surplus properties ( ' alienation ' ) , and how can those restrictions be satisfied or circumvented ? Under the general lease provisions of the Civil Code , a tenant may sub-lease or ( partially ) transfer the lease . Most leases restrict this by requiring the prior approval of the landlord . With regard to retail leases , the law of April 30 1951 provides that a contractual clause restricting the transfer of the lease will remain without effect in case the tenant transfers the lease jointly with the business operated in the leased premises . <p> In case of sub-leases , the initial tenant remains liable vis-a-vis the landlord for the performance of the contractual obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of the lease the same rule applies for a limited period of time . <p> Securitization of real estate assets <p> 1 . How significant is the real estate securitization market in Belgium ? A securitization model was developed many years ago using real estate certificates , ie typically securities issued by the owner of the real estate where the certificate holders are entitled to a portion of the rental income and of the proceeds of the sale of the property . This rental income is treated as interest and only subject to a withholding tax of 15% . The repayment of the principal will , moreover , be tax neutral . From a tax point of view , a real estate certificate therefore constitutes an effective hybrid . <p> There have been private deals for the securitization of lease receivables , some related to leases granted to the European Communities . <p> 2 . What have the key real estate securitization deals been over the last 12 months ? To our knowledge , there have not been any significant real estate securitization deals in Belgium over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail ( if at all ) are the parties obliged to disclose the lease terms on a formal registry ( eg the land registry ) ? An original or a certified copy of all lease agreements for real property must be submitted for registration ; the registration duty to be paid is of 0.2% ( 20 basis points ) on the aggregate rental amount increased with certain costs to be paid by the tenant ( for residential leases the duty is limited to euro 25 ) . The document filed with the registration office is not accessible to the public . None of its contents are published . <p> As creditors of the landlord might challenge any lease granted for the term exceeding nine years , the tenant , in order to be protected by a longer term , will need the contract to be notarized and to be copied in the register of the local mortgage keeper . Any interested person may have access to the register of the mortgage keeper . <p> 4 . To what extent can uninsured risks or potential legislation leading to rent reviews affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between landlord and tenant is regulated by the general lease provisions of the Civil Code as further implemented by case law . Pursuant to Article 1722 of the Civil Code , if , during the term of the lease , the leased premises are totally destroyed by force majeure , the lease is automatically terminated . If it is only partially damaged , the tenant may request a reduction of the rent or the termination of the lease , according to the circumstances . During the lease , the tenant will be held liable for any damages to the leased premises and , in case of fire , will be deemed liable save evidence to the contrary ( Article 1733 of the Civil Code ) . In such a case , the tenant 's obligation to pay full rent will continue for the entire term of the lease . <p> The landlord and tenant may agree to allocate risks ( as well as the consequences of an incident ) in a different way . Often , the lease agreement will provide that the tenant must provide evidence of sufficient insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is insured , absent any contractual clause on the subject , will not have an influence on the question of which party bears that risk . <p> Contractual clauses as to the unconditional liability of the tenant to pay the rent are an essential element in any attempt to achieve " sanctity " of the receivable securitized . <p> 5 . How important a role do the rating agencies play in securitizations ? We are not aware of any significant securitization transactions whereby securities were offered to the public , and not of any significant role played by rating agencies . <p> Property outsourcing <p> 1 . How prevalent is property outsourcing in Belgium ? At present property outsourcing is a limited practice . There are more traditional sale and lease back transactions , but with no significant increase in the services rendered by the landlord / property manager to the tenant . <p> 2 . What are the relative benefits of each of private finance initiatives ( PFIs ) and public-private partnerships ( PPPs ) ; and <p> 3. what lessons have been learnt from both private sector and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service provision , financial benefits , problems ? PFIs and PPIs are not ( yet ) common practice in Belgium . The rules related to the sale of government-owned real estate procedures are still relatively undeveloped , and recent published transactions have indicated that the government indeed obtained expert assistance . <p> 4 . To what extent should the service provider extend services to cover back office systems such as IT and human resources ( HR ) ? It is to be expected that , when property outsourcing develops IT , and to a more limited degree , HR , they would have to be included in the services offered . <p> 5 . What has been the effect of Enron and the accounting scandals on corporates considering off-balance sheet property outsourcing ? We have seen no noticeable effects . <p> 6 . What is the future of property outsourcing for the private sector ? There will likely be slow growth , with outsourcing most successful in the major cities . <p> Financing of real estate transactions <p> 1 . What are the most common methods by which purchasers finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method is the middle or long term loan , secured by a mortgage on the real estate purchased combined with a pledge on the rental income from the property . <p> Since the cost of entering a mortgage is quite high , ( 1% of the secured amount ) a practice has developed to reduce the amount secured by the mortgage ( eg to 10% of the entire debt ) and to require the owner to sign a power for mortgage for the balance . The lender may , at any time , register the mortgage for such amount but this second mortgage will only rank at the date of its entry . <p> Another common method of financing buildings ( as distinguished from land ) is a real estate leasing structure . As a general rule , the lease of real estate in Belgium is exempt from value added tax ( VAT ) . As a consequence , the VAT paid for the construction of the building ( presently 21 % ) , can not be offset with any incoming VAT on rent . Subject to certain conditions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAT ( as set forth in a Royal Decree No 30 dated December 29 1992 ) . Since , with this VAT leasing structure , the costs of construction can be reduced with 21% , real estate leasing has been used extensively . <p> Finally the purchasing company might consider issuing bonds secured by a mortgage on the property . <p> 2 . To what extent does stamp duty ( or the equivalent ) affect the cost and method of financing real estate transactions ? The transfer of real estate is subject to a registration duty of 10% ( for property located in the Flemish Region ) or 12.5% ( for property located in the Brussels Region or the Walloon Region ) of the purchase price . If the tax administration proves that the price paid for the property is at least 1/8th ( 12.5% ) below its market value , it will require payment of an additional registration duty and of a fine . <p> Under certain conditions the transfer of title to professional resellers is subject to a reduced registration duty rate of 5% . <p> Until December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building has first been occupied or used ( after its constructions or important transformation ) , the transfer of the building may be subject , at the discretion of the parties , to VAT ( at the normal applicable VAT rate ) . The plot of land on which the building is erected will remain subject to registration duty . <p> In order to reduce the tax burdens , an investor may choose not to purchase the land but to enter into a long-term lease agreement ( erfpacht or emphytTose ) or to acquire a right to build ( opstalrecht or droit de superficie ) . This right allows the investor to become owner of the building . Both a long-term lease and the right to build , as well as the buildings erected pursuant to such rights , can be mortgaged . The mortgage will not , however , survive the termination of the long-term lease , or the right to build . <p> The granting of both a long-term lease and a right to build are subject to a registration duty of 0.2% on the indemnities paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land burdened with such rights may still sell ( the land ) . <p> As a general rule , no registration duties will be due on the transfer of shares of a real estate portfolio company . <p> 3 . To what degree of detail are the parties obliged to disclose the terms of financing on a formal registry ( eg the land registry ) ? A mortgage deed must be inscribed ( and not copied ) in the register of the local mortgage keeper . Such inscription will contain the identity of the creditor and debtor , the secured amount , and the identification of the encumbered property . Any interested party may obtain a mortgage certificate containing this information . <p> 4 . Is there any debate as to who holds the legal title to a mortgaged property ? This issue is not the object of any controversy or debate in Belgium . The lender never holds title of any kind to the mortgaged property ; title remains with the initial owner . Even in case of an event of default , title to the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreclose on the mortgage by requiring a court order for the public sale of the property . <p> Conveyancing issues <p> 1 . What are the various forms of property ownership in Belgium ? Under Belgian law , there is only one form of ownership ( propriTtT or eigendom ) which is the most complete right in rem . Other rights in rem can be granted with regard to real estate , such as a long term lease ( emphytTose or erfpacht ) and a right to build ( opstalrecht or droit de superficie ) , usufruct , and easements . <p> A lease agreement does not grant a right in rem , but the tenant will have a contractual right to possession ( genot or jouissance ) of the property . <p> 2 . Other than the general principles of contract law governing agreements between vendor and purchaser , what other statutory governance , regulations or guidelines exist to protect the parties to a property transaction ? Most provisions on the sale of goods as contained in the Civil Code are not mandatory , so that the parties may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be enacted per notarial deed . The role of the notary public is , as a public officer , to verify the compliance with all applicable legislation and to receive the tax . In addition , he will also advise the parties as to their rights and obligations . Any party may request to be assisted by a separate notary public without the incurrence of additional costs . <p> The notary public must verify the seller 's title to the property and the absence of any mortgage or other encumbrance . <p> For real estate located in the Flemish Region , any sale is subject to the prior obtaining of a certificate of no-objection from the Flemish administration in charge of environmental issues . If no such certificate can be delivered further procedural steps are to be taken . <p> 3 . Is the practice of the vendor wanting to take advantage of development uplift prevalent ? How do lawyers usually achieve this ? Without saying that the practice is prevalent in Belgium , we have seen development projects - mainly in retail - where in a share purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be negatively adjusted in relation to take-up and rental income . In another transaction the price of the land was to be increased if the building permit to be granted allowed for a higher number of lettable properties than the parties initially expected . <p> 4 . How significant is e-conveyancing ? What rules and regulations govern the e-conveyancing process ? E-conveyancing is insignificant in Belgium . Any transfer of real estate necessitates the intervention of a notary public . The notarial deed establishing the transfer will be registered at the registration office and transcribed at the register of the mortgage keeper . The only computer programme intervening in the process is the notary 's word processor . <p> Modern communication methods are only used for marketing purposes . <p> 5 . How have legislation and recent case law addressed the issue of adverse possession ? The ownership of goods can be inquired by inheritance , donation , the effect of agreement ( eg a sale and purchase agreement ) , accession or incorporation , or adverse possession . <p> Ownership title on real estate can be acquired after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of 30 years . Shorter terms are provided for the possessor in good faith and holder of a " lawful title " of acquisition . The " lawful title " in theory contains everything that is required to transfer ownership , but was not granted by the true owner of the property
