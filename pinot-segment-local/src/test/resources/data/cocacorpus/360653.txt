The main benefit is this lends the authority of a writer to a piece of content on a website and also aligns the author with the types of content they are experts in . <p> How does this help your website , you may ask ? Well , it helps in a few ways . First , you get the nifty image of the author in google.com search results , this helps increase the number of clicks to your site as the authors picture will show next to your article ! <p> *Rich snippet from an author of a blog post <p> *Rich snippet from an author of a Google Plus post <p> *Circle Activity on a Google Search Listing <p> Next , any article that the author has contributed to will also show to all of the people that are circling that author in search on google.com , that is huge ! This means that your new content will now be exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience ( extended circles ) <p> Now , to qualify for authorship on your blog , there must be a bidirectional trust link . This is pretty easy to establish in a few steps . Ps establishing this trusted link relationship helps with semantic search and is a signal that shows Google the topic of your site and establishes the authorship authority of the writer , the more authority the more semantic relevance is granted to your website . <p> So here is how it works . <p> 1 . The author adds to their personal profile a nofollow link on their about page ( In the contribute to section ) to your blog URL or main URL. ( you need a Google+ account for this of course ) 2 . On the article the author is writing , you link to the authors google plus profile using rel=author as the link .

@@45020492 @5020492/ <h> Look closely at this Google Doodle , its all handwriting <p> Look even closer and you 'll see the big G is made of words , and holding a scepter with the cross <p> This Google Doodle is the cleverest pun of navigating social media you 'll ever see , its a poem of the internet . Its the artists self acknowledgement of the value and complexity of the work she puts into working online . As a social media manager , rather like a great Poe whom were unable to perceive which side they 're really on , she illustrates the wild and complex Edgar Allan Poe style visuals of the social landscape . Her simple advice is this , let these poes ( Social Media Managers ) guide you under Googles glowing acknowledgement sign ( the plus ) . <h> " Go plus yourself " an essay from the artist . <p> With the recent reshuffling of Google as a company subsidiary under " Alphabet Inc . " I found myself doodling a perspective of the internet , using words and phrases . A befitting idea really , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find words to describe it until now . On explaining the chosen name for new parent company " Alphabet " , Google Founder Larry Page writes : " The name Alphabet means a collection of letters that represent language , one of humanity 's most important innovations , and is the core of how we index with Google search ! " And that my folks resonates with me ! I let go of trying to describe the social landscape of the internet , and just let the words fall onto the page into its own illustration . <p> I call this series " The Poe of the Internet " . My inspiration is that I -like many people can that can possibly relate- - work almost solely online in the virtual world . I manage brand pages , 8 hours a day , that 's all I do , and yet that 's not all I do . To say " all I do is manage brand pages " is belittling the value of the work I do , and since brands see great reason in what I do for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living working online . 10 years ago who would have thought it ? The online landscape has matured and now there are lots of people like me , we learn all the tools of social media , all the qualities of each network , and we work unseen by our colleagues , brands , and even our friends . We are the Poe of the internet , and we are only now just figuring out how to describe ourselves . <h> What is a Poe of the internet ? <p> I wonder if you can spot all the poes of the internet here ? I have represented Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , Instagram all hidden in poetry <p> When I first hear the term Poe , I was playing Zelda video games and Poes where ghosts you had to shoot down with a fairy bow . I also related the word to the supernatural and mysterious Edgar Alan Poe stories , which is probably where the game developers for Zelda snitched the name . I later found out that a Poe , was someone who satirically performed in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really on . It takes a lot of intelligence both on the IQ level and the EQ level to be able to pull this off . EQ being the emotional quotient is the more abstract ability to connect with peoples emotions . So , I 'm not just coining the word Poe for my illustration series , as Zelda had adopted for ghosts in their game . To me , the sense of being Poe fits . I wonder if the etymology of " poetry " is also somehow related . Edgar Allen Poe was a great poet and also a Poe himself through his sinister stories that artfully took a dig at the complex issues in society . Look even more closely at my illustration , and you 'll see it is really a poem . When I started mindlessly penning down the internet , what came out was a series of lyrics that densely overlaid took the form of the poes of the internet . <h> What walks of life did we come from ? <p> I am an introvert . And I am an Artist . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored my IQ with rocket science and fluid dynamics for some time until I was logistically BORED out of my brains . I mean , I get it . Complex mathematics and analytical skills where code is another form of poetry.But soon after graduating I took the brave step of saying " Nope not for me " and I sidestepped out of the corporate engineering world into the chaos of finding myself . I built my own fashion design business , watched it morph into a slave monster then I pulled the rug out from under that Frankenstein . I tried many other creative entrepreneurial side-streams such that my resume would appear to some corporate machine as a definite no-go area -I was too risky , I did n't  have the robotic brain of conformity. - <p> I took my first job in the US with a corporate hosting company , I had capitalized on the appeal of having a fresh start with receiving my green card , and although I was well liked by my team , - my constant drive for doing things outside the box did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate me , I was the quirky cog that did n't  quite fit , it was the first time I had suffered rejection , and they were pretty nasty about it too . My own chaotic ways had always given me opportunity , my self belief system developed out of surviving on my own in freelance , paid gigs , or entrepreneurial adventure . Good things had always come to me from studying how to get what I wanted through the internet . It took a while for me to overcome my rejection at the corporate slavequarters . <p> Now the reason I introduced myself first as an introvert , was not meant as self deprecating , or derogatory . I personally find I resonate well with people , age , gender , seniority , understudies , team-working . The hiccup I experienced with overseers previously was simply because I never listened to my EQ at the interview stage and chose the wrong bunch of " Corprocrats " to work for . Whatever comes I can usually find a common grounds for connection with anyone almost immediately . To me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends my energy . I want to spend my energy with the right people , I am very conscious of my own EQ , translating how I feel to myself , and then to communicate that with the world ( that 's the artist in me ) . Some people steal your energy and feed off your ideas , and since I am very conservative with how I spend my energy , I am very protective of who enters my bubble or sphere of connection . This is what I call introvert , tuning into the realization that sometimes , sometimes you just function better when left to your own devices . Be as it may that I am great with people , NO ONE invades my time alone when I need it . There is a difference between having meetings and just getting this shit done . <h> What makes a good Poe of the internet ? <p> Social Media incorporates the various channels for communicating , now you be the tool and express your communication <p> I believe what makes me good at what I do , is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete strangers , and yet still find a connection . It is like acting , where actors are expressing an emotional arc in a story to which the audience relates . It is like psychology where ( hopefully ) we are all looking to improve ourselves , and actually taking the time to listen to other peoples feelings . It is like marketing , where we are studying the right time , place , and product intercept windows to " get " the right audience . It is also about language and how we communicate to the world . Since that is the one thing that unites us in the online world as stated by Larry Page . And it is also knowing the landscape of the online world , such that you can navigate it and find the right people , as has always been the case with me , that gave me all these opportunities in making a flexible living off the internet . <p> At the top of the illustration , I placed the big G , for Google , and in his left hand he holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to validate everything below him.There is the murmer of birds on Twitter , and no coincidence that it appears dark like crows . There are many a bokeh of light trapped in the lenses of social image content , and the mysterious friends of Facebook . There is no coincidence either that these are shown as shadows of people . None of this means the internet is a dark , bad , place . Its simply one translation I have of many to describe the various needs and patterns I feel from different platforms of the internet . That , is ultimately what makes me good at my job . My ability to differentiate what I would use each platform for , and that has to ultimately come from my own use of the tools and witnessing very disparate social behaviors on social media . <h> Where do you find us Poe ? Its hard because we do n't  really gather . <p> Unlike people who proselytize about social media , we are merely blending in . We are difficult to contain and define in the words of friends who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends even now that ask me what I do , and I fail miserably at telling them , because until now I did not have a map showing them the world I work- LIVE in . We are striving to understand and communicate all the time , you will find we are bloggers , OCD writers , constant content generators . This is what makes us stand out from the crowd , we do not simply get " good " at social media , we are compulsive at using it as a means to communicate ourselves out there , and hopefully find others that relate.Because we are still new , we are gradually amassing into new forums , and trying to give ourselves names . Social Media Manager though , just does n't  cut it for me . <p> Some people would say , " well that must make you good at social media " and I will disagree . I 'm not just " Good at a tool " , I 'm not attention seeking and looking for self acknowledgement that I 'm right all the time , I 'm merely incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the room I need to move . Those that proselytize about social media and self proclaim their talent at it , merely occupy the vessel in which they preach . Open the container , and they leak into no visible form outside their community . That 's where learning the language of others come in handy for a Poe of the internet.Give us new space , and well explore and experiment with our expression around it . For every Brand I work with , I am given an opportunity to do a different dance . I 'm not talking about being good at social media anymore , I 'm talking about getting the dance of my brand acknowledged by the big G. <p> I realized why I had the urge to draw the internet . I wanted to give myself the acknowledgement of the work I do for big brands , since I am invisible . It is too hard to describe it in words , and yet finally I did just that , I created it in poetry and in a pun . The biggest pun being that we doodle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others become more visible . Yet that 's how I finally gained self-worth as an introvert , realizing the invisibly abstract but important work I do for Brands on Social Media . <h> About Juliana Payson <p> Juliana has an honours degree in Composites Engineering which allows her to focus on qualitative analysis of various business projects .

@@45020498 @5020498/ <p> We asked a panel of experts to answer a few questions about SEO and social media . Specifically , we had each of them share their ideas on emerging social metrics and tracking , Google Author Rank and its potential use in business , and their go-to sources for social and SEO news and innovation . <p> We hope you enjoy this compilation of advice from some of the biggest names in the social/SEO industry . Note that this is an interactive piece . We will regularly grab particularly insightful ideas from the comments section and add them into the piece with author credit . <p> 1 . What new Social Media Metrics do you think will appear in 2013 , and how will they be tracked ? <p> Jim Boykin Well , in December of 2011 , Eric Schmidt said , The social signal , the people you hang with , ' is actually a ranking signal . " Then in March of 2012 , Google started to bridge the gap by adding social tracking to analytics . As they said at that time , The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics you care about " allowing you to better measure the full value of the social channel for your business . " They are also tracking via Pubsubhubbub . <p> Bruce Clay There are several important metrics , each specific to social activities : Reach , Mentions , Engagement , Visitors , and Social-induced Conversions . <p> I believe the top metrics today are much like links : they should only be a byproduct of what we earn . What we do know is that social is much faster than search at identifying content . When a social activity stimulates a visit to your site , failure to present superb content targeted to that visitor is a fail . As a result , social activity without the content to fulfill the promise of that event degrades your authority and effectiveness at the same speed as the social network " they are inseparable . Hence the quality of the content makes the effectiveness of the social media all that it can be . All of these metrics count more than ever , but the ultimate value is strictly in conversions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social rank , I think search engines will get better at measuring a user 's social score . And when social users with high social scores endorse web pages , they will potentially rank higher . <p> I think search engines have to do something similar to this if they want to continue to take social signals into account , as you can easily game the system by buying tweets or Facebook likes . <p> Warren Whitlock We are continuing to develop KPIs that target what social media does best , start and develop relationships with individuals . Rather than measure a mass of people that you can push a message to , well see more focus on real engagement with thought leaders and prospects . We are now moving back from what ad or event triggered a sale to tie in connections from social graphs and the inception of the idea that got the buyer interested before the first click . <p> Take-away : The value of strong connections on social media is increasing all the time , and the quality of content on all websites is becoming integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking users " users who understand that " social " is primarily about relationship and interaction , not self-promotion . <p> 2 . What are your thoughts on Googles Author Rank and how businesses can leverage Author Rank ? <p> Jim Boykin Well , that 's kind of a tricky question . If someone has something worth writing about ( meaning , its something that will spread via social or links ) , then sure , Author Rank can be great but , if a business thinks they 're going to just publish " stuff " and throw an author tag on it , then there 's no value . <p> Bruce Clay This is a great concept that is yet to be seen . We have fully implemented the use of author tags ( rel=author , rel=publisher ) on our site . Our SERP entries do stand out , and that alone is reason enough to pursue the use of author tags . That advantage will encourage others to engage the tags , and that participation will spread and eventually improve the statistical population and reliability of author merit . This merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) will result in improvements over the specifically spammed link networks we regularly see . <p> It is my belief that Author Rank is going to significantly but not solely complement the importance of content and replace links as a measurement of page importance . This will be a major ranking factor this year , exponentially increasing in importance as time passes . <p> Neil Patel Author Rank is a way for Google to potentially know which authors write great content . Before authority was mainly given to websites. Now with Author Rank they can potentially give certain authors who write great content more of an authority so their content can rank higher no matter what website they write on . <p> As for ways businesses can leverage this , they can hire these authors who have great content and good Author Rank and have them write on their own company website . This can potentially boost the company 's web traffic . <p> Warren Whitlock Author Rank is doing a better job of connecting real human contributors and their networks to content creation . Like the citings that PageRank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some are trying to game that system , but we 've learned that the best way to look authentic is to be authentic . <p> Take-away : Author tags only have value if connected to meaningful content . As the power of Author Rank becomes common knowledge , more will get involved and reliability will improve , enhancing the Webs human authenticity . Authors will trump links for page relevance , ranking highly regardless where their content is posted . <p> 3 . What websites do you frequent daily to keep up with Social and SEO ? <p> Bruce Clay I am fortunate " information comes to me . I am an advisor to a great curation product ( PublishThis ) that gathers topic-specific social and website information on topics that matter to me .

I spend approximately 3 hours per day reading and studying what is happening in the space admittedly a lot is provided by Facebook colleagues and groups " I lurk often . <p> I believe that to really understand either social or SEO ( or any other Internet Marketing Optimization discipline ) , you need to both follow those that do detailed research and perform your own research . You should , if possible , develop tools or be involved in tools . You should really have skin in the detailed discussions about why it matters , how it is measured , how to cause actions , and obviously how to make it repeatable and foolproof . If you want to do SEO , then do it instead of just watching it . Same for social. - As time passes the slow follower will always lose the race . <p> Warren Whitlock I 've stopped looking at social as a topic . I spend most of my time connecting with experts and those actually doing the connecting . In SEO , looking for the engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carburetor . There are still a lot of things that will artificially boost a page for a time , but keywords and links built for SEO are fading in importance .

Doing ones own research , following those who do research , and being involved in the development of tools are all essential to growing your skill set . Do n't  forget keywords and links , but shift your primary focus to great content . <p> Wrap-Up <p> Many of the more salient points made by one of the panelists above were echoed in some form by various panelists . One broad notion is that social media and search engine optimization are becoming more interconnected all the time . Quality interaction , both through ones website and through ones social media presence , will determine the level of reach that a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming more individualized , in the sense that the human source of the content will soon become a huge element " possibly the defining factor " of online reputability and influence . <p> Finally , Author Rank is on the rise , and with it , Google+ .

@@45020500 @5020500/ <h> Are you a Sketchy Google Plusser ? <p> I was preparing for a Hangout On Air , to introduce the basics of Google Plus to small businesses . This is where I first came up with the concept of SKETCH . <p> The first thing we went over is that Google+ is not another social network , it is filled with experts that lead by example , care about others , share knowledge , help others in many ways and express expertise by behaving like a thought leader , who can be trusted . <p> At first I was not going to make this up as a blog post . Then after talking to my friend Lee Smallwood , I shared the concept of SKETCH and he encouraged me to make a blog post out of it . So , here we are . <p> So , let 's break down SKETCH . <h> S Share what you like <p> Let 's start with the basics ; sharing what you like , love and having a passion for is key to defining your audience your future self will thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the likemindness . For instance , me , I love gaming , SEO , Google Plus , experimenting and martial arts . So , most of my posts center around these topics . The people I engage with on a regular basis also share some of the same interests . If you share what you like then you will build an audience of like minded individuals , who will carry your message and at the same time align your authorship with the correct subjects . <h> K Be Knowledgeable <p> We already talk a bit about how Google Plus is not another social network . In the same sense of share what you like , also when you share content add insight that adds value to what you are sharing ( or posting ) . Let 's say you share this post ( heh which you should , if you like it ) , instead of just sharing the post and adding a few hashtags or saying " Nice post " add some- of your own thoughts about what resonated- with you personally or professionally . Your audience will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sentences- ( or paragraphs ) that add to the value of the content you are sharing . <h> E Share Your Expertise <p> This is different than just sharing someone elses- content but is very similar in nature to being knowledgeable . Try and stand out from the crowd . Engage with other users in communities and in posts that you are truly interested in . If you have an opinion or are an expert in a certain area , then express your thoughts . I have personally experienced amazing discussions that spawned from a single thoughtful expert comment . By sharing your expertise , you express your thought leadership and not only will people respect you for this , but you may even get some business out of it . <h> T- Be Thankful and Thoughtful <p> If you see a post that you really like and want to share it . The first thing that is a common courtesy is to acknowledge people . Let 's say , you find this post because someone shared it from my profile . Then you would thank two people in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the post and H/T to +NAME for the share ! ( H/T means Hat Tip ) <p> Also , I want to note one other thing you can do here to be thankful , if the original poster used an image to share a link . Look for the first link in the posters original share and reshare that URL . This helps the original posts in many ways ( one of those ways being social signals passing to the intended post ) . <h> C Be Caring and Connect <p> This is similar to being helpful , but with more of a focus on connecting . Be genuinely interested in what people are saying . If they resonate- with you then put them into the right circle so you can connect with them on a one to one or one to many basis . <p> When these people +1 or comment or share , organize them into circles . Ask their permission to share directly with them ( this will help you in the future and act like a permission based list ) . <p> Care about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Public sharing is meant for all the time , circle sharing is- meant for the right time . <h> H Be Helpful <p> If you are browsing around the Plus and see someone who could really benefit from your area of expertise connect with them via a private message , in a comment or email and ask how you can help . This is- NOT- Always Be Selling , this is more always be caring and helpful . If you help people then the rewards will be personally satisfying and if there is business to be had , then this one new person will let you know . You never know who you are helping , they could be your next huge customer . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389

Called End2End Hangouts , it reduces the cost of interrelated online video and textual content 90% , amounting in a small fraction of the expense of a strong YouTube series and blog articles related to the topic . <p> The idea for this service arose from our general experience that it was challenging for many brands to produce content . Often companies do n't have enough time to be able to create video themselves or enough money to finance regular YouTube episodes . <p> The idea behind this project was to make it easier to integrate online marketing efforts . Without making production more time-consuming , we thought this would be a way to increase the value of a company 's social media presence , blog publication , and thought leadership development .

@@45020506 @5020506/ <h> Google My Business Now Allowing Regulated Industries <p> Google just announced that they now allow regulated goods back into Google My Business manager . <p> Previously , Google would not say whether they would allow businesses like liquor stores , gun shops or other businesses that offered regulated goods to be verified on Google Maps . <p> If you were a business owner who owned a local shop in a regulated industry , you understand how frustrating this has been . <p> But why did Google do this , historically ? <p> The close connection to Google+ and Maps caused GMB listings to fall victim to suspensions because of policy violations . The reason for this was that Google+ was seen as an advertising platform , therefore these types of businesses violated Googles strict policy . <p> Now that they are not connected in the traditional sense , Google is allowing companies with regulated goods to claim listings on Maps . <p> What still does not make sense is what will happen in the future , since Maps is also an advertising platform . Well have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen is this , a business would show on Google Maps as unverified , there would be publically available information ( often inaccurate ) along with reviews ( unanswered ) and in the most extreme circumstances the listing would have the wrong phone number or be listed as permanently closed . <p> The business owner would try and claim the listing into Google My Business and then be met with an error . What was really happening was Google was looking at the category and automatically declining the claim . <p> However , the good news is that now businesses that sell or provide the following regulated goods or services may be listed on the map provided that they comply with the existing GMB guidelines for eligibility <p> Alcohol <p> Gambling and lotteries <p> Pharmaceuticals ( and other unapproved supplements ) <p> Tobacco <p> Fireworks <p> Weapons <p> Health/medical devices <p> Additionally , businesses that sell or provide regulated goods or services must also comply with local and regional laws . <p> Many have voiced concerns with how Google previously handled regulated businesses . If someone is searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in Bing or Yahoo they can easily get 10 businesses results in that city . However , the same search in Google would show the user zero local results . <p> This was a frustrating experience , both for users and business owners alike . <p> Take one of our clients for examplethey are a Gun shop in Northern California and have had a lot of trouble working through Googles varying constraints . We worked with them to develop- a massively successful Google+ presence with a high level of engagement , followers , and Collection followers. - This initially gave- them a great local SEO visibility ( as many of our previous case studies have proven ) and helped with their GMB identity as a whole . <p> Because of the work we were doing , they were getting over 400 phone calls per month from both Google Maps and Search . <p> However , because of the prohibitive policy , their Maps listing was revoked and- their page has been blocked . They have since seen a sharp drop in phone calls and have been hindered from creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , our team will be able to take back control of their listings , verify their local presence and begin rectifying all of the barriers- they 've encountered up to this point . <p> Needless to say , our team and many other local , regulated businesses are very excited about these positive changes the Google My Business and Maps teams are making . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389

How to use them all to get results . <p> With the Added You Back Opportunity , you are focusing on creating a two way relationship/connection with someone that has been circled by you and then they have in turn circled you back . Today , we are going to focus on how to send a private message to that person/brand privately . <p> This is very similar to how you Direct Message someone on Twitter . Unlike Twitter however , by sending private messages on Google+ you are strengthening the semantic connection between your brand and the person/entity with whom you are engaging with . <p> Now , the whole premise of this is that you will be utilizing your Google+ notifications in order to know who to send a private message to . So in this post well go through understanding your Google+ notifications , and then the workflow of the " Added You Back " tactic . <h> Your Google+ Notifications <p> Before leveraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notifications you will be getting inside Google+ . The types of notifications you will see are : <p> Shared with you : This is when a post has been shared privately or to a specific circle <p> +1d post/comment : pretty much says what the action was <p> XYZ Commented on a photo/post : someone commented or did something on a post you have commented on <p> Invited you : an invitation to join a community or event <p> Added you to their circles : When someone adds you to their circles and you have not added them to yours <p> Mentioned you : privately or in a post or comment <p> Added you back : This is what we are looking for <p> XYZ Re-shared : This is important too , always thank someone for sharing <p> Sidenote : It is outside the scope of this article , but you can tweak the communication settings of your business page - so you only get the kinds of notifications you want . I suggest having " Mentions You in a Post " selected , you want to know when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can also select " Comments on a Post you created " and have both of these notify you by email/phone . <p> To get to your page settings , go to a link like this : <p> https : //plus.google.com/u/0/b/ ( YOUR PAGE HERE ) /pages/settings/plus <p> That little red dot shows how many notifications are pending . <h> How to View Notifications on Google Plus <p> In the upper right area of Google products ( Gmail , Google Plus , Search ) you will see +Your Name ( this is you ) a 3+3 box ( this is a list of apps that are from Google , a red ( with a number ) or grey ( no notifications ) circle for notifications , a box with a + in it ( this is to share a post ) and then a picture of your currently controlled profile/page . <p> As a Google Plus page manager , the icons we will be focusing on today will be the picture and the notifications icon . <h> Where to find a notification ( or private message ) after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From inside of Google Plus , while logged in as your business page , - click on the " Notification Bell " then " Google+ Notifications " . and look for a ( Shared Privately ) message . <p> Note : From here you can sort the posts from ALL , YOURS , and OTHERS . <p> Here is a quick link to get to the Notifications area : - <p> https : //plus.google.com/b/ ( YOUR PAGE HERE ) /notifications/all <p> Use YOURS , when you are trying to track down a private message you sent out earlier . Use OTHERS to find people who have communicated with you in one of the ways described above . <p> Alternatively , from the notification bell . You can scroll to the bottom of the list and view " Previously Read " and this will bring up previous notifications . This is handy when you are replying to people and accidentally click off a person/post . Click " Previously Read " and you are taken to your latest read notifications . <h> Creating a great Private Message <p> Now its time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum effect . <p> Start with an open ended question to create a connection with the intended recipient . <p> Example : <p> Hey +Name Thank you for joining my tribe ! I see you are into X , I would love to hear more about you . What do you think about Y ? <p> You should open with an open ended question that is related to both them and what you do as well . <p> When the mentioned person responds , re-engage the conversation with any thoughts you may have and then direct to a blog post , optin guide or even your phone/email address . The key here is that you are interested in continuing the relationship and providing value . <h> Track your results <p> If you want to track your results with this tactic , we suggest using a spreadsheet with the following cells : <p> # of added me back today <p> # of canned response 1 <p> # of canned response 2 <p> # of replies to me today <p> # of replies from canned response 1 <p> # of replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to response 1 <p> # of replies ( from me ) to response 2 <p> # of ( my replies ) sent to CTA 1 <p> # of ( my replies ) sent to CTA 2 <p> Response rate to CTA 1 <p> Response rate to CTA 2 <p> So there you have it . You can use Google Pluss communication- system to prove some ROI . Of course , it depends on how you define ROI and how you are tracking it all . In the example image above , I look for information ( answers to questions ) and I am looking for a opt-in to an email guide ( which you can grab at guide.steadydemand.com ) . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389

@@45020515 @5020515/ <h> Google Plus Business The Added You Back Opportunity <p> Communicating on Google Plus is a lot like how we communicate in the real world . <p> Imagine yourself at a networking event ( seriously , close your eyes .. and imagine that for a moment ) . OK , cool you are back now . You walk into that networking event and you are surrounded by a few familiar faces , some people you desperately want to get to know and a few people you think may be interesting . <p> So you do what comes natural , you go up to the people you know and you all huddle around each other to have a conversation among yourselves . <p> Well , this article is NOT about that ! <p> This article is about getting out of your comfort zone and meeting new people , finding out what they care about , listening and then finding new friends and creating business from a social platform , via the Added You Back Opportunity . <p> Google Plus has many benefits for business , but today , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why ? <p> Because as a brand it is hard to get people to trust you . Even if you are communicating to a real live person on the other side , you are still a brand page and that in itself leads the people whom have never met you to feel as if they are only going to be communicated with if you are trying to sell them on something . <p> Back to the networking event <p> You walk away from the group of friends and saunter up to someone who just ordered a drink . What do you do ? Say hello ? Ask them how the drinks are ? <p> Tip : The biggest mistake you can make , is to open with your sales pitch , think about the real world consequences of this . If you just met someone at a networking event , and they just said " Hi , I am joe blow from XYZ corp . We work with people just like you to help you understand widgets . " What would a reasonable response from that person be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walked up to ( or on G+ followed ) has a barrier up and is looking out for the sales BS , this is your golden opportunity . <p> In a previous guide I went into how to craft a " perfect post " on Google Plus engagement . You have setup your Google plus account , you have made sure that your web site is connected to your Google plus business page by running an audit . All of that is totally awesome ! <p> How can I start to prove ROI from this Google Plus thing ? Here is a starting guide for that . <p> In this article , we are only going to touch on one aspect of managing a Google Plus business page that will help lead you to a positive return on your time . <h> The Added You Back Opportunity ! <p> Back at the networking event <p> In the real world , you give me your business card , I give you my business card . On Google Plus , I follow you , you get a notification that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just add me back .

Impact on Personalized Search Results and Semantic Connections <p> As Mark Traphagan of Stone Temple Consulting state in his article regarding how Google Search is Personal - " If you have worked hard at building a significant following on Google+ and have been posting well-optimized content there that is likely to be relevant to topics for which your audience searches , you may gain a significant advantage in search exposure to that audience . " <p> David Amerland ( Author of Google Semantic Search and SEO Help ) states " the different degrees of relationship that exist in such context , from total stranger to casual acquaintance , to conversation partner to ( perhaps ) someone you have circled with the intent to follow and interact with more in future . And even when you have circled someone , it understands that unless the interactions continue and the bond is strengthened " in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Plus , not only are we feeding Google information about your company via the posts , BUT also the connections you make and the frequencies of those connection and even the content of the conversations . <p> Bottom Line : Connect frequently to those who have followed you and if your content is there to answer a question they have , there is a high probability that your content will show in Google Search above the rest . <h> 2 . Building a Real Relationship <p> People buy from people . We all want to know that there is some kind of value we are providing each other . Not to mention , if feels good to buy from someone or some brand you trust . The idea , of forming a deeper relationship with your prospective customer need to be something that is part of your company culture . Yes , it takes time ! Yes , it takes the willingness to listen and answer questions . If you build these relationship , you will find out that you can gain results . <p> Every day , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added us back .

And , 1% end up becoming qualified prospects . But , all are tied to the brand in search , so that in itself is a win . <h> So , now we need to strengthen that bond !

@@45020516 @5020516/ <h> 7- Steps To Add Your Blab or Hangout To the IMDB <p> Getting yourself listed on the IMDB , is a pretty big deal for anyone that has aspirations of recognition in the acting or entertainment business . It is also something that you can proudly put on your resume. - As we move further down the road toward being on air personalities , using Hangouts On Air , or even your Blab.im , the IMDB can become a critical asset in your BIO . <p> Why is this important ? Well I am glad you asked credibility ! If you can prove that you were instrumental in a blockbuster Hangout On Air , produced a show , interviewed a great guest , then future producers and Hangout hosts will have a much easier time vetting you . Even if you are the guest , add yourself ! <h> Step 1 : Search for your name <p> Tip : You may already be in the IMDB , anyone can add you , especially when adding a show . Search for you name first . <p> Each permutation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when- Andrij Harasewych- added the Social Media Hangout ( first HOA to make it ) - to IMDB , I was added as- Ben Fisher ( XV ) this ties me into the IMDB as this name as a unique entity . Any future additions should be classified this way . So , make sure to search for your name and see if you are related to any shows that you recognize . <p> Pro Tip : Search for ALL your cast members , producers , co-producers , guests ( himself/herself or Actor ) , Set Designers ( art production ) , how you designate people is completely up to you . ( Note : I am still experimenting with the difference between Actor and Himself ) <h> Step 2 : Adding a new title : <p> If your HOABlab is not already in IMDB , then just pick an episode and use that in the Title field . <p> Select Type : Made for TV <p> Status : Released and Screened <p> Year : Add the Year released <p> If you are adding from your profile ( which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro tip you can be multiple roles later in the process . <p> Click Check These Updates ( You will be clicking this button a lot ! ) <p> Doing so will highlight area in red ( does not exist ) , green ( all good no errors ) or yellow ( please clarify just a little more ) So now select the subtype ( TV Series ) then click- - Check These Updates <p> This is the next screen you will see , it is a yellow clarification screen . Check the box next to " This is not an existing title . " We are doing this so we can insert the HOABlab into the IMDB . ( More on adding the core series coming soon , I promise ! ) click- - Check These Updates ( or Re-check These Updates ) Note : At this time you can also create a series by selecting " on-going " ( There will be a separate guide for that ) <p> Now we get to the fun part , oh sorry I mean incredibly meticulous attention to detail part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently in the IMDB will be highlighted in yellow until submitted . <h> Step 3 : Next Step : Mandatory Information <p> Release dates : Add 1 item Select Country select day and month then type in year in- attribute you can leave it blank or put in- ( internet ) Yes just like that . Miscellaneous Link this is to verify that the title you are adding is real . I use the YouTube link and list YouTube as the description field . ( no you can not use your website ) At this point I re-check these updates just for less stress ( Sweet green = move forward ) Tip : if you get tired you can always save the update - for later too <h> Step 4 Adding Basic Identifying Information <p> Select Country <p> Select Language <p> Select Color <p> Select Genres Talk-Show ( unless you have a different theme ) <p> Select Director <p> IMPORTANT There should only be one director , even if you are a two or more person team , only add one director . Later in the process you can designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those titles . Just remember someone real is going to review the entry , so if you over do it you may not get approved , or the approval process could take longer . <p> Type in the persons name as Last Name , First Name ( do not worry if you put it in backwards the system will fix it for you ) <p> If someones name is already in the IMDB , it will Yellow out and ask you to clarify . <p> If the persons name does not exist , you will get a yellow box with a question like this " This is a- different- person not currently listed create Hovnanian , Stephan. " ( make sure to select that radio button ) doing this will create a new person in IMDB . Write down the name and give it to your guest . <p> Press- Re-check These Updates ( at the bottom of the page ) <h> Step 5 : Production Information <p> Ahh the real fun begins ! <p> Select a budget of 200 ( this will translate into $200 ) NOTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning that the budget seems low , go back and check " Warning understood , go ahead anyway . " <p> Enter Official Sites Credits You can add as many as you want here for your HOA or Blab.im series . <p> Note : You do not have to add all of them right now , they can be edited later . <p> The description must be formatted correctly as one of the following : <p> Official site <p> Official site CountryCode- ( only give the origin of site if the site is not in English ) <p> Please remember : - The URL must link directly to the specific page for that title . <p> Please do not submit directors personal websites or production company sites . An official site must be *about* the title itself . <p> Do not put the title in the description itself . <p> Press- Re-check These Updates ( at the bottom of the page ) <h> Step 6 Step : Major Credits <p> Remember back in the beginning , where I asked you to search for peoples names , well here is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of people in the HOA / Blab <p> Writers : If anyone is writing add them ( could be a blog , script , or post ) <p> Producers : Hosts and Co-Hosts <p> Feel free to add anyone else you want to acknowledge at this time for pre or post production . <p> Press- Re-check These Updates ( at the bottom of the page ) <p> After you re-check , all the name fields will appear . Fill them in with the right information , spelled correctly or with the name as you found it in step 1 . Then designate the character as Himself , Herself or Actor . You can then further clarify a co-director etc as an attribute if you really want to . <p> Press- Re-check These Updates ( at the bottom of the page ) <p> Press- Re-check These Updates ( at the bottom of the page ) <h> Step 7 Additional Fields <p> Now just enter any additional fields you like , for instance the plot summary ( event description ) and you are ready to re-check the updates once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And then it gets tedious for me because I 'm caught between a rock and a hard place trying to wiggle my way out of his misunderstanding .

The penny dropped , but there is never a mention of Google Plus . And this becomes the moment when I feed them the valuable information they can be proud of for learning that day . I 'm going to tell you exactly how I tell them why I do it on G+ and spend less time on Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , or Instagram . <p> Facebook is like one big bar , where everyone goes to BS each other , behave like divas , tell stories , moan , share secrets , and then complain that there are barfights . On Facebook people come in to get away from the internet , and there are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just have to put up with that . We all try and stay within our little cliques and bar tables to stay comfortable , but we rarely go outside of those boundaries unless we want to go and dirty ourselves in the internet swamp and then comeback to the Facebook bar feeling a lot cleaner than the swamp outside . <p> On the other hand , Google Plus , is a the library lounge .

Community policing , prevents disruption and drama in a much different way than Facebook . Public endorsements in the form of Plus Ones ( +1s ) reach far and wide across the world via your degrees of connections , and yet could be relevant and local to you . " Likes " on Facebook absolutely stay within the cliques of the Facebook Bar , and have very little contextual , local or even searchable meaning . You could n't find or be recommended anything relevant even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Plus though , is different . Fed by Google who has already established the authority of voices , which separates out the " I can typing " trash that plagues the quality of other social networks with the hit-and-run of trash-speak . <p> And there you have it . Google Plus is the Library lounge bar that welcomes everyone else to help them on their journey of learning .

@@45020531 @5020531/ <h> Google My Business Page for Real Estate : What 's In a Name ? <p> Google My Business and Google Plus are critical to growing your business . However , those in multi-agent real estate settings should be careful how they set up their pages so that they do n't violate Google guidelines and hurt themselves long-term . <p> In this post were going to walk you through what you need to- know and what you should do if you are working in a multi-agent office . Were going to aim at answering some of the most popular questions , including : <p> How can I use a Google My Business local listing to help my SEO efforts ? <h> The one and only Google listing <p> As a real estate agent , you know that you should have a Google My Business local listing , and you want to be found on Google Maps . Plus ( no pun intended ) , you want a Google Plus page for Social media exposure . However , things can get quite sticky and downright confusing when you are located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is the big- rule of thumb : - there can be only one . Meaning , there can only be one unique identifying name , address , and phone number when identifying a business on Google Maps . Also , this needs to be consistent across all of your other " citations " " such as Yelp , Zillow , Trulia , etc . <h> But Mom , everyone else is doing it ! <p> Everyone is messed up in how they represent themselves on Google Maps . Get over it and do it the right way now ! You 'll thank yourself later . <p> You will see all sorts of naming conventions , and they rank exceedingly well . As a matter of fact , having a name of a city , state , town or agency name can give you a huge edge . However , in 90% of cases you will be violating Googles Terms of Service unless the city name is a part of your business name legally . <p> Here are four examples : <p> XYZ Realty City State Agent Name <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XYZ Agent of the XYZ Team <p> And the most common : XYZ Agency Agent Name . <p> So if you want to get the boosted SEO benefit of having your city name in your name , be sure that you have a legal DBA to support it . Otherwise , fear the Google ToS hammer ! Possibly ? ? <p> Pro Tip : Joy Hawkins , a Local SEO Expert , and Google My Business Top Contributor offers her thoughts regarding the Terms of Service , what she would do if found on Maps but some strong sound advice on what you should really do . " I would correct them ( the listing ) if I find them on Maps but if I was being honest with a realtor on what I would do if I was them , I would list both the name and real estate company " <h> How to set up your Google My Business Local Page and Listing <p> What is the best way to approach setting up listings for real estate agents in multi-agent environments ? <h> 1. - Check with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be to ensure that the main office has a Google My Business page . It will need to- set one up- under the agency brand name first . They should always use the agencys unique name , address and phone number ( NAP ) along with the main website URL . <p> There will be the temptation to claim the listing using a format like XYZ Realty . Yet , if you do this , it will hurt you in the long haul when the main office gets around to setting up a local listing via Google My Business . <p> Multiple practitioners at one location- If the practitioner is one of- several- public-facing practitioners at this location : <p> The organization should create a page for this location , separate from that of the practitioner . The title of the page for the practitioner should include only the name of the practitioner , and should n't include the name of the organization . <p> To add a little bit more information that confuses the topic , if there is one public-facing agent/broker , then the Solo Practitioner guideline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that belong to branded organizationsIf a practitioner is the only public-facing practitioner at a location and represents a branded organization , its best for the practitioner to share a page with the organization . Create a single page , named using the following format : brand/company : practitioner name . Acceptable : " RE/MAX : Joe Miller " ( if Joe is the sole public-facing practitioner at this RE/MAX-branded location ) . <p> To Recap : A Real Estate Agency with multiple forward-facing people who are promoting themselves should have the main agency set up a Google My Business Listing / Google Plus Page for the main office as XYZ Realty. <h> 2 . Set-Up your Google Local Listing Page as an individual agent <p> So , OK , by now you are a little upset . I get that . You are not supposed to have your Real Estates agencys name on your Google My Business Maps listing . And everyone else is doing it ! <p> Yet , to stay forever in Googles good graces ( unless they change their minds ) is to avoid having the agencys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing should be all about you . It should link to your website , have your phone number ( cell preferably ) and feature your headshot as the business logo . It is common to see other agents using XYZ Agency My Name , yes . But while they are getting away with it , for now , it is in violation of Google guidelines . <p> To Recap : An individual agent ( not a broker- or- owner ) should list themselves as XYZ Name ( according to Googles Guidelines ) . Then in the About section of your Google Plus page , list your Agency name , areas you serve , along with anything else someone should know about you . <p> Pro Tip : There are some instances where the name , address and phone number are significantly different , and therefore the " XYZ Agency Name Broker/Agent Name " is still within guidelines . For example , a listing that has your cell number , possibly go as far as to add a suite number . <h> 3 . Consider the role of Google Plus <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ? Feed Google . Think about it this way : By default , Google Search is personalized . Everything you put into Google Plus on your business page- is indexed by Google and has a 90% chance of showing in someones personal search results if they have followed your page/collection or engaged with your page . <p> Understand that what you put into- Google Plus teaches Google Search- more about you as an entity , the same as Yelp or reviews do . The difference is that its owned by Google . In other words , it is a social networking tool that is optimized for and owned by the company that runs the world 's most powerful search engine . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389

@@45020535 @5020535/ <h> 4 reasons your holiday marketing needs Google Plus <p> Email marketing , ad buying , and social media will all work together this holiday season , just as they do every year . And yes , starting your holiday marketing plans in July will give you enough time to prepare all the content , creative , and automation necessary to run successful campaigns from Black Friday ( which seems to get earlier every year , does n't  it ? ) and New Years . <p> If Google Plus is not part of your strategy , you are missing out on an incredibly powerful resource to be discovered by your target audience in all three phases of email marketing , ad buying , and social media . How is this possible ? Google Plus is not a standalone social network , it is a connective layer between your brand and website , and YouTube , Google search , Gmail , Google Play Store , even AdWords . Google Plus offers brands a suite of features for content marketing , visual media , and even lead generation . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Plus , and below we are going to explore four ways they should fit into your holiday marketing strategy : <h> 1 . +Post Ads <p> If you have an engaging Google Plus page that has over 1,000 followers , you may be eligible for +Post Ads . The +Post Ad is an AdWords product whereby a Google Plus post gets displayed in the Google Display Network ( the websites that run AdSense ) . People can interact directly with the ad if they are logged into their Google Account , meaning someone could leave a comment from a website , and not have to be on Google Plus itself . The person could also add your brand page to their circles right from the ad . <p> This is a huge opportunity for brands to develop engaging , interactive messages that already have some social proof on them ( +1s and comments ) . What 's more , the Google Plus post that you turned into a +Post Ad is still a Google Plus post , meaning it can be indexed and possibly displayed in Google search long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a compelling incentive for your prospective customer ! <p> Take a look at the post below from one of our clients , an online jewelry retailer . If you saw this as an ad on a website , with over 500 +1s , would that influence your perception of the product and the brand ? <h> 2 . Opt-in Circles <p> Every brand has an email list , and email marketing should be a major component of your holiday marketing strategy . On social media , you should encourage followers to sign up for your email list as well . But on Google Plus , there is a unique opportunity to combine social with email marketing techniques , and we call them " opt-in circles . " <p> Like an email list , you ask your audience if they would like to opt in to receive notifications when you post certain types of content . Take the responders and put them into a circle . When you post that type of content , be sure to add that circle to the selected audience . There will be a checkbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . " Check the box . <p> Google Plus will send a notification to the people in that circle that you have shared a post with them ( compared to them happening to see that post in their stream because they follow your page ) . If their settings are such , they will receive an email from Google Plus that you shared a post with them as well , but the checkbox really refers to " pushing a notification " to that circle of people . <p> Like email marketing , pushing too many unwanted messages to your audience can result in your getting muted or uncircled ( the Google Plus equivalent of " marked as spam " ) , so be sure to treat this technique with the same respect you treat your email subscribers . But in the end , notifying opt-in circles is a very powerful feature on Google Plus . <h> 3 . Hangouts on Air <p> Nothing is more powerful than being able to communicate visually with one another . Face-to-face , with live interaction , we can read body language , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply than through traditional broadcasting and advertising formats . <p> Google Hangouts on Air is a live video broadcast that is recorded to your companys YouTube channel ( where you can further optimize it ) . The associated Google Plus Event can be promoted anywhere , and those who RSVP " Yes " or " Maybe " can have the event added to their Google Calendar ( along with reminders if they have their settings set up that way ) . Google is also experimenting with boosting the visibility of live events directly in search results . Pretty awesome to have people opt in to watch you showcase your holiday line of products , special deals , or even do interviews or product reviews . <p> Google also has a beta product called Shoppable Hangouts that allows a retailer to hook product data from their website up to the hangout window , so that people watching can actually click through to the website and buy . Even if the tool does not become publicly available by the holidays , you will still have plenty of opportunities to get creative with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and your brand through video . <h> 4 . Semantic Relevance and Hashtags <p> You are most likely going to use hashtags in conjunction with your marketing this holiday season . Hashtags are essentially a way to link posts about a common keyword term together without having to worry about whether the keyword was spelled the same as others . From a discovery standpoint , this is very useful since , for example , you could add #blackfriday to your social media posts and appear in searches for #blackfriday on Twitter , Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , and Google Plus . <p> Oh but wait , you can also search for hashtags in Google search , and Google will automatically retrieve related keywords and hashtags ( they do that " search " thing really well , do n't  they ? ) . So your #blackfriday hashtag on a Google Plus post could have a farther and longer lasting reach than it will on other social networks . <p> What 's more , you can start to associate your brand name with certain phrases and hashtags well before the holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand . And by participating in discussions related to the products you sell , your brand will start to be associated with those products and people . Much like you optimize your website for certain terms , semantic relevance on Google Plus adds the relationships and conversations in which you are a part to determine " what you are really all about . " <p> 8. - Extend your hashtag campaigns onto Google Plus , and add other hashtags to create a semantic correlation between your campaign and the general keyword . ( Example ) <p> The most important thing is to start now , to build up your targeted and engaged audience . Those are the people who will want to buy from you anyway , and spread the good news of your products when the holiday season is upon us . <p> All of the microcontent you will have created along the way will also help you get found in Google search , since every post on Google Plus is indexed , and may even rank . <p> Will all this take time ? Of course it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work and seeds you sow on Google Plus have a long-term effect on your presence across Google products and services , long after your ad buys are spent .

Reducing the number of dashes from 3 1 and then tested with am em dash ( - " ) <h> UPDATE : 11/23/2013 <p> After some further experiments , - I have noticed a fairly large change unfortunately the implications ( while they make sense ) are far reaching . <p> The first one I will let out of the bag is this . <h> Editing a Post and Adding Links will NOT allow for the Passing- of Social Signals to the first link in the body of a post ( Change ) <p> It was previously thought that publishing a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ala- Pin it for later ) Would allow for new +1 signals to pass to the top URL , this is now incorrect . Having multiple links in a post will block all the social signals from flowing <p> Edit the post to include other resources and links. , I added a test2 page and an pinterest- link . <p> Republish the post . ( Result +1 remains on first link ) <p> Plus one the post ( Result no additional +1s passes ) - <p> Comment on Post - - ( Result no additional +1s passes ) <p> Delete test post so we can start at zero +1s <p> UNLESS .. <h> Discovery : An embedded link will catch all the social signals ( with multiple links in a post ) <p> Now this is going to burn you all up a lot . As it impacts the intent of how we share . Do we share with an image for higher- shareability ? OR without an image to gain signals and have multiple attribution ? <p> The secret here is that if you want to attribute social signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one link in a post then you must have the social signal link as an embedded link ( attached link ) <p> Create a post with as many links as you want , in this case I chose the same 3 after signals were wiped . <p> The first link in the set will generate a preview link . Remove the link preview and add a completely different link than what are in the body of the post . ( This is the target we want +1s to flow to ) <p> Publish the post ( Result +1 passes to embed link ) - <p> +1 post - ( Result +1 passes to embed link ) - <p> Comment - ( Result +1 passes to embed link ) - <p> No +1s passed to link in the body of the post . <p> Final Test to confirm results in a real world trial : <p> Publish this article with the link to this blog post- as only the embed link ( Baseline +1 = 291 for the blog post ) <p> Added copy and 3 links that are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the real world test , the target link is not even in the body of the post . <p> First we started with a simple test to reaffirm that +mentions do not break a social- signal being passed to a blog post . When we started this test , *being human , we made a mistake* we ended up making a discovery . ( btw as expected +mentions did not break the social signals ) <p> Step 1 : Made a post that was shared with Dustin and I ( forgot to add the link ) Step 2 : Edited the post added one link - Unexpected Result : +1 passed to post Takeaway : If you forget to add a link to a post , edit it and add a link ( if it is within a certain timeframe ) then the social signal should pass <p> This led to a few more tests:The Theory 2 links first link gains the +1 <p> Step 3 : Removed the first link to see if +1 would transfer to the second link : Result : +1 remained on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second link ! - Unexpected Result <p> Takeaway : - Now , we struggled on if we should release this information , as it can be used to game the system . In retrospect , it is not inherently evil to use this tactic as any future signals will be passed to the second link and only the first link gains an initial social signal . <p> Test : - If an old post has social signals , and you had placed a link at the top to someone elses post but wanted to pass those signals to your own post ? <p> For grins and giggles , we also tested the theory on an old post . What if you made a post that went viral , only to find out that the first link went to someone elses post . They received all the social signals . Sigh , a missed opportunity . <p> Here was the test : Step 1 : Edit an old post and replace the link with another link Step 2 : Wait 20 seconds to see if social signals pass Result : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD G+ post Result : only new signals pass to the new link . Step 4 : Wait 2 weeks to see if social signals pass from the old post to the new post Result : Thankfully no old signals pass to the new page.Takeaway : If you forget to add your link as the first link , and do not catch it within a short period of time , only new social signals will pass . <p> We are all humans , we make mistakes , the good news is that when editing a post on Google Plus you have a short period of time to correct your links to make sure that the link you want to gain social signals does get the credit . <p> Take Aways : <p> If you forget to add a link to a post , edit it , and +1s will pass <p> The first link in a post creates the shared link <p> On an existing post , when deleting the first link , the link retains any social signals gained before editing . <p> Replacing a link on a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link . <p> Old posts can not transfer social signals that were previously- gained . <p> As always , please use this information with good intentions , not to inflate social signals . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389 
@@45020541 @5020541/ <h> How to Format a Google Plus Post For Engagement <p> A perfect post is elusive at best . In reality , there is no perfect post , but there are some fundamentals best practices on Google Plus- that will help you get the highest return on your time spent posting- and reward you with engagement . <p> The one thing that makes Google Plus such a special place , is that those- who engage on peoples posts want to see that you actually took more time to post something meaningful and thoughtful versus the standard 140 characters or quick Facebook post . One sure way to lose ( or just not gain ) followers on Google Plus , is to auto-post from other platforms or create thin content posts . <p> The aim of this article is to just help you understand what some of the best practices are . Straight up , I will tell you it takes time and creativity to shake and back a great Google Plus post . But , if you aim is to build an active/engaged following on Google Plus that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may become a customer ) , then this is something to pay attention to . <p> 1 . Titles are very important Think of this as the title of a blog post . Why ? well every post that is made on Google Plus is considered a web page- in Googles eyes ( seriously , view the source code ) so treat this with the utmost care . Additionally , this is what people will see when they are looking through their notifications. - It is also the first thing they see on mobile , and if that is not enough this is what helps a post rank in Google search . <p> Pro Tip : It is best the title be no longer that 40 characters and bold using an asterisk , I use- http : **26;340;TOOLONG to count the characters . <p> Examples ( Red = BAD , Green = Good ) : <p> This is a Title For a Post <p> *This is a Title- For a Post* <p> 2 . Summarize the post Try to not just copy and paste the content from your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary ( may as well create a few summaries , since you will be posting the same post to your brand page , personal page , and into communities , but more on that at another time ) . This is the precious few moments where you have my attention as a reader . Think about your own reading behavior , then write that . <p> Examples ( Red = BAD , Green = Good ) : <p> This is a great guide on posting . <p> I was wondering today , how to get the best engagement on my posts . <p> Then I read this post from +SteadyDemand , I highly recommend you take a peek at it as well . <p> Pro-Tip : Notice the summary is 159 characters in length , this is because when someone is viewing the post in-stream , they can only see FOUR lines of text in a collapsed post . So , therefore , shoot for a 40 character title and 160 character summary in a G+ Post . <p> 3 . Add a link - If you are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the post . If you really want to understand how plus ones are passed then read this guide , if your intent is to provide value then just include a link that is in context to the summary you previously wrote . Use a shortened link from goo.gl or bit.ly to make it easy on the eyes . <p> Pro-Tip : If it is a link to someone elses post , go for the bonus and +mention them so they are notified and- the audience knows where they are going if you have shortened it . <p> 4 . Add some personal commentary You already put in a title , and a summary , then a link to the destination . Now , write a little bit more , this time with some of your personal or business brands perspective . How does this post/link align with your business ? What are your thoughts on the topic ? How is it relevant to your followers ? <p> Examples ( Red = BAD , Green = Good ) : <p> I really like how they formatted the article . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Plus . I have had a hard time understanding why I need to put so much effort into it . Every post I made just did not get any engagement at all ! After implementing the tips in this guide , however , my engagement and followers have- gone through the roof ! <p> 5 . Ask a question ? I mean really ask a question , something that you are prepared to answer . The chances of your brand page showing up in a users home stream or in Googles search results is dependent on engagement . So What better way to get engagement , then by asking a question . <p> Examples ( Red = BAD , Green = Good ) : <p> What do you think ? <p> So , what do you think is the best aspect to focus on when making a post on Google Plus ? <p> 6 . Add in some #Tag ( HashTag ) magic No less than three and no more than five . This - helps with discovery in Google Plus , in Google Search and is fundamentally easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the best engagement on my posts . Then I read this post from +SteadyDemand , I highly recommend you take a peek at it as well . <p> There is a lot to learn when it comes to Google Plus . I have had a hard time understanding why I need to put so much effort into it . Every post I made just did not get any engagement at all ! After implementing the tips in this guide , however , my engagement and followers have- gone through the roof ! <p> So , what do you think is the best aspect to focus on when making a post on Google Plus ? <p> #googleplustips #postformat #howtoguide <p> As you can see , the amount of content is not that much different , but the results are far greater . This clearly communicates that your brand is articulate and not " phoning it in " like most other brands . <p> 7 . Use an image when possible - ( Does not have to be all the time ) Google Plus is a very visually orientated platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chance of going full width in someones stream too . <p> Bonus : - Ping in people - with a +mention . Make sure relevant to the conversation , enhances the possibility they will comment and share , do not abuse this power . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389

( Btw , if you are a local business , check out this killer guide on performing a local SEO Audit on your website , courtesy of MOZ . ) <p> So , now you know a bit about the importance of Google Plus to business . You know the value of a registered Google Plus user , and you know a bit about how to optimize your Google Plus business page and how to make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Stop . Do you hear that ? Crickets <p> You make your blog post ( which is epic ) , you post it to Google Plus ( properly formatted of course- Thanks Dustin W Stout ) , and then you site back with a grin on your face , because you know exactly what is going to happen next .. right ? The floodgates are going to open , traffic is going to spike , people will +1 your post , comments are going to be all the rage , people will share it on Twitter ( for a moment ) , Facebook ( where you hope to be seen without paying ) , Ello ( because it is awesome No Ads ! ) , and even TSU- ( You are there right ? ) , - manna is going to pour from heaven ! <p> Ok , I must have done something wrong ( you say to yourself ) , I will just try again , and again , and again ( this is the definition of insanity right ? ) and you keep getting the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need Followers That care About What YOU Have To Say <p> So , glad you have made it this far into the post , what can you do , today , to gain some followers ? <p> Step 1 . Change The Way You Look At Google Plus <p> Think of your Google Plus business page as a connector , a public facing entity that is similar to what is reflected on your website and other social entities . It should be the entity that connects all the dots and feeds Google all about your company , culture , products , services , and probably most important it solves peoples problems and is helpful . Human to human is the new wave of marketing , so let you brand breathe . <p> Why ? Because , as you start to engage with people and other brands , they will visit your Google Plus business page . So think in terms of " what do I want my last ten posts to say to a person , just meeting my business for the first time ? " and no it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step 2 . Get Out Of Your Easy Zone <p> The " easy " - way to do things , is post something to your blog , let it auto post to Twitter , Facebook and Google Plus via a tool like HootSuite right ? I mean , hey I have a business to run ! Well , you can get away with that on some networks . but on Google Plus , people will see the same ol content and not really care . ( P.S. Neither will Google ) . So take a little time - and write up a summary about that blog post you are about to post , ask an insightful question , or add some more content to your post that the person will not get in the blog post they are about to visit . <p> Step 3 . What Part Of Social Are You Not Getting ? <p> Google Plus is a Social Platform that connects all of Googles services together , and it is also a Social Network . Take these following steps every business day . <p> 3.1 Say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , any question ( beside the canned " What 's Up ? " ) . Think about it a second , they took the time to actually follow you , they have a limit of 5000 people they can follow , and you are one of them . Let 's say you own a company that sells " the ultimate widget " , why not take this opportunity to ask you shiny new follower " So what do you like about widgets ? " or " What is it about widgets that really frustrates you ? " <p> 3.2 Join a Few Communities These are one of the secret weapons of Google Plus . A place where like minded people can congregate and have " usually " intelligent conversations , seek help , - talk about business- and sometime just have fun ! But , really in the end , they are a really fast way to find people who are interested in a specific topic . People , who may actuallycare about what you have to say ! Now , do n't  be a link dropper , not at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engage on some conversations , welcome new people to the community . All of these things humanize your brand and will make you more likable and approachable . Do n't  worry , business will come , especially if you add value to conversations . <p> Step 4 . Follow people and brands <p> Ok , this should be a DUH ! moment . Today , I saw someone who was insulted for being followed . I have to admit , I was a bit confused at that . Being followed by someone is an honor really . Remember what I said earlier ( you did real the article right ? ? ? ? ) You can only follow 5000 people/pages . So , take the time and follow people and brands . Put them into circles that are relevant to you ; brand I like , brands I hate , brands that taste good , people I hangout with , people I hangout with that taste good ( OK strike that ) , just make sure you follow people and pages that are interesting to you as a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just something you want to sell them . That will happen naturally . <p> Reality check <p> 10 20% of people you follow will follow you back . But this is NOT a numbers game . Quality over quantity . If you see some mega ball , or any circle over 100 really , avoid it , the smaller the better . <p> So , there you have it 4 ways you can start getting followers on your Google Plus page . Pretty easy right ? Spend some time and give it a chance . If you have any questions , swing back on by here , more to come on followers .

@@45020554 @5020554/ <h> Embedded Posts and Authorship This is Awesome ! <p> Today Google+ has unleashed two new features that are meant to help authors and bloggers gain new engagement as well as credit for their work no matter where they content flows on the web . <h> Auto-Author Attribution <p> The first feature to roll out today is a fairly straightforward one . When you use Googles sign-in feature on a wordpress.com site ( I expect this to roll out to hosted WordPress soon ) - the articles you publish will now be associated with your Google+ profile automatically . Pretty cool especially for non coders or those with no control over plugins . <h> Google Plus Embedded Posts <p> The second feature shows that Google+ is really stepping up the game . Coming on the heels of Facebook announcing embedded posts- ( which twitter has been doing for quite a while ) , now Google+ posts are able to be embedded and are fully interactive ! <p> Example : You are writing an article about Tips on crochet and you made a series of posts on G+ about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , so you write your blog post , embed the G+ posts and now any conversation that happens in that post will show on your blog page , within that new blog post . <p> So pretty awesome so far right ? Well what about social signals ? We recently conducted an experiment about how many social signals pass from a post on Google Plus , and I wondered if the signals would pass in real time when interacting with an embedded post . <h> The good news is that the answer is YES , social signals work the same . <p> The reasoning for this is pretty simple , we are using an iFrame- to embed the post , so therefore the signals behave exactly like they do outside of G+ as they do inside G+ . <p> So in this experiment all I am doing is taking one post from GooglePlus , embedding the post on a blog page , then clicking the plus one and wanting to verify that the plus one does indeed reflect on the google plus post as well as the post on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plus one from my blog page <p> Post on Google+ after I click on the plus one- from- my- blog post <p> Embedded Post on a Blog page Before I plus one from Google Plus . <p> Embedded Post on a Blog page After I plus one from Google- Plus . <p> Oh for reference here is the actual embedded post = <p> So the takeaways : <p> Embedded posts do not work on community posts ( Tried that , no options ) <p> Embedded posts work- on brand pages ( can get public shared embeds- ) <p> Embedded posts work from personal profiles- ( can get public shared- embeds- ) <p> Actions taken on the embedded post are reflected on the post on Google Plus . <p> Actions taken on the post on Google Plus are reflected- on- the embedded post . <p> What is your take on embedded posts ? How do you plan to use them ? <p> UPDATE : Stephan Hovnanian has some awesome insight on the uses of embedded posts : <p> Coming up , test regarding social signals , embedded posts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal in a post that the embedded post links to . 53388 @qwx463388 53389 @qwx463389
