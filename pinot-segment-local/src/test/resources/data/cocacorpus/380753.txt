A final section gives basic , but crucial information on maintaining safety for MRI patients , staff and visitors . <p> History of magnetic resonance imaging <p> Magnets were first discovered by the Romans more than 2000 years ago . Over the years , the understanding of magnet has increased and many applications have developed . <p> The history of NMR ( known as MRI ) begins with a french mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier ( 1768 " 1830 ) who developed a mathematical method to analyze the heat transfer between solid bodies . Later this discovery made rapid processing of phase and frequency signals possible in NMR . <p> The unit strength of a magnetic field is the Tesla ( 1 Tesla = 1 Newton/Ampere-meter ) and is named after Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla ( 1856 " 1943 ) who discovered the rotating magnetic field . <p> An Irish physicist , Sir Joseph Larmor ( 1857 " 1942 ) discovered a way to calculate the rate at which energy is radiated by an accelerated electron . He also explained the splitting of spectrum lines by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NMR for the so-called larmor equation , which states that the frequency of precession of the nuclear magnetic moment ( - ) is directly proportional to the product of the magnetic field strength ( B0 ) and the gyromagnetic ratio ( + ) : - = +B0 . <p> An Austrian , Isidor Rabi ( 1898 " 1988 ) working in the Department of Physics at Columbia University in New York , discovered a way to detect and measure single states of rotation of atoms and molecules . He also succeeded in determining the magnetic moments of the nuclei . For his discoveries , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944 . <p> In 1940s , Felix Bloch working at stanford university and Edward Purcell from harvard university independent of each other , described a physicochemical phenomenon which was based on the magnetic properties of certain nuclei in the periodic system . They found that when certain nuclei were placed in a magnetic field they absorbed energy in the electromagnetic spectrum and re-emitted this energy when they returned to their original state . The strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Larmor relationship . For this discovery , Bloch and Purcell were awarded with the nobel prize for physics in 1952 . <p> In 1971 , Raymond Damadian from Downstate Medical Center in New York measured T1 and T2 relaxation times of normal and cancerous rat tissues and found that normal tissue had shorter relaxation times than the tumour tissue . <p> In 1974 , Paul C. Lauterbur , a professor of chemistry and radiology at New York University and Peter Mansfield from the department of physics at the Nottingham University England independent of each other , described the use of magnetic field gradients for spatial localization of NMR signals . These discoveries led to the foundation for Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . For this discovery , Lauterbur and Mansfield were awarded with the nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 2003 . <p> In 1975 , a Swiss physical chemist Richard Ernst described the use of Fourier transform of phase and frequency encoding to reconstruct 2D images . For this discovery he was awarded with the nobel prize for chemistry in 1991 . <p> Later in - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan technique , which led to the first cross sectional imaging of human anatomy ( cross section through a finger ) .

@@77121045 @5821045/ <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) or number of signal averages/acquisitions ( NSA ) is a measurement parameter . It is used to represent the number of times each line of k-space data is acquired and is primarily used to improve signal-to-noise ( SNR ) ratio . Doubling the NEX only improves the SNR by the square root of two ( G2 ) because random noise is also sampled . The noise in the MRI image is from electromagnetic noise in the body resulting from molecular movement and electrical resistance of the receiver coils . Therefore , as the number of NEX increases , noise begins to be cancelled out . Repeated sampling and the accumulation of signal results in a high signal image . <p> Doubling the NEX will increase the SNR by 140% and double the scan time . For example , if you take a sequence with a scan time of 2 minutes , NEX 1 and SNR of 1 ( 100% ) and increase the NEX from 1 to 2 , this will increase the scan time to 4 minutes and SNR by 140% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NEX ) <p> NEX can be used to increase SNR in high resolution imaging with small field of views . Employing multiple signal excitations is also effective for reducing motion and pulsation artefacts . The only disadvantage of increasing NEX is the significant increase in acquisition time . <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and slice thickness <p> Decreasing the slice thickness in high resolution imaging will reduce the SNR . The most appropriate way of increasing the SNR is to increase NEX . For example , if a T1 TSE sequence with a slice thickness of 4mm , NEX 1 , SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes is changed to a slice thickness of 2mm , the signal will drop to 0.49 or 49% . In order to compensate for the signal drop , the user needs to increase the NEX from 1 to 3 but will increase the scan time from 2 to 6 minutes . This is the most appropriate method when reducing the slice thickness without compromising image quality . <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and field of view ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and produce an image with low SNR . In order to compensate for signal loss , the user needs to either increase the NEX or reduce the matrix size . Decreasing the matrix size will slightly reduce the image quality whereas increasing the NEX will improve the image quality . Again , the only disadvantage of increasing the NEX is the significant increase in scan time . If a T1 TSE sequence with 200mm FOV , NEX 1 , SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes is decreased to 100mm FOV , the signal will drop to 0.39 or 39% . The user should increase the NEX from 1 to 4 , increasing the scan time from 2 minutes to 8 minutes . This is the most appropriate method to use when performing high resolution imaging with a very small FOV e.g. temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) and pituitary imaging . <p> The same principle can be used to reduce the scan time when increasing the FOV as increasing the FOV will increase the SNR . In order to reduce the excess signal , the user can reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition time of 6 minutes , 100mm FOV , NEX 2 and SNR 1 , an increase in the FOV from 100mm to 200 mm will increase the signal to 2 or 200% . To reduce the excess signal , the user can to decrease the NEX from 2 to 1 which decreases the scan time from 6 minutes to 3 minutes . <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and resolution <p> Increasing the matrix size will reduce the pixel size and produce a low SNR image . To compensate for signal loss the user can increase the NEX . Increasing either matrix size or NEX will increase the scan time . Increasing both of these parameters will nearly triple the scan time but the result will be a very sharp and detailed image . As an example , take a T1 TSE sequence with parameters : 256x256 matrix , NEX 1 , SNR 1 and acquisition time of 2 minutes . Increasing the matrix size from 256x256 to 320x320 causes a reduction in the SNR to 0.72 or 72% . The scan time will also increase to 2.31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the user needs to increase the NEX from 1 to 2 , however this will increase the scan time from 2.31 to 5.02 minutes . Nonetheless , it is the most appropriate method to use when performing pelvic high resolution imaging where both sharp detail and high SNR are necessary. - - - - <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and Bandwidth <p> Increasing the receiver bandwidth will reduce SNR and increasing NEX is the most appropriate technique to resolve this . If a T1 TSE sequence with a receiver bandwidth of 100 Hz , NEX 2 and a relative SNR of 1 sees an increase in bandwidth from 100 to 250 the new SNR will be 0.49 . The signal loss can be compensated by increasing the NEX from 2 to 3 but again , this will significantly increase the scan time . <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and artefacts <p> Motion artefact is a form of noise commonly caused by physical movement , respiration , peristalsis and vascular pulsation . Static anatomy produces consistent signal whereas moving components do not . Increasing the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static objects , reducing motion artefacts in the resultant image . This method itself however will not remove motion artefacts completely and result in long scan times . Respiratory gating/triggers , respiratory compensation ( phase re-ordering ) , radial k-space filling ( BLADE or PROPELLER ) and navigator echoes are more practical methods to counteract motion artefact.

@@77121049 @5821049/ <p> MRA stands for magnetic resonance angiography . MRA of brain is used to assess abnormalities in the arterial blood supply system of brain . 3-dimensional ( 3D ) - time-of-flight ( TOF ) MRA is the most common technique used to assess the arterial blood supply system of brain . 3D TOF provides higher signal-to-noise and shorter imaging times . MRA brain is easy to perform and does not require contrast administration . <p> Time-of-flight ( TOF ) <p> These techniques derive contrast between stationary tissues and flowing blood by manipulating the magnitude of the magnetization . The magnitude of magnetization from the moving spins is very large compared to the magnetization from the stationary spins which are relatively small . This leads to a large signal from moving blood spins and a diminished signal from stationary tissue spins . Time of flight ( TOF ) utilizes the longitudinal magnetization vector for imaging .

@@77121056 @5821056/ <p> Resolution is the ability of human eyes to distinguish one structure from other . In MRI the resolution is determined by the number of pixels in a specified FOV . The higher the image resolution , the better the small pathologies can be diagnosed . Resolution is directly proportional to the number of pixels ( The higher the number of pixels the greater the resolution ) . Pixel size can be calculated by dividing the field of view by the matrix size ( e.g.FOV 320 , Matrix 320x320 , Pixel size =320/320=1mm ) .

@@77121059 @5821059/ <p> These techniques derive contrast between stationary tissues and flowing blood by manipulating the magnitude of the magnetization . The magnitude of magnetization from the moving spins is very large as compared to the magnetization from the stationary spins which are relatively small . This leads to a large signal from moving blood spins and a diminished signal from stationary tissue spins . Time of flight ( TOF ) utilizes the longitudinal magnetization vector for imaging . The 3D acquisition allows for thinner slices with smaller voxel size ( 0.6-1mm ) . <p> MRI image appearance <p> The easiest way to identify TOF images is to look for blood vessels in the body ( circle of willis and carotids ) .

@@77121061 @5821061/ <p> Contrast is the difference in brightness between the light and dark areas of a picture . An MRI image also has a contrast , the areas with high signal are bright on the image and the areas with low signal are dark on the image . The areas with intermediate signal are usually gray . Tissues with a large transverse component of magnetisation give a high signal due to the large signal amplitude . Tissues with a small transverse component of magnetisation give a low signal due to the small signal amplitude . <p> In MRI , contrast in the image is obtained through three mechanism i.e. T1 recovery , T2 decay and proton density . The image contrast depends on how much we allow each process to happen . <p> T1 contrast and weighting <p> The T1 time of a tissue is the time it takes for the excited spins to recover and be available for the next excitation . Let us take an example of fat and CSF in the human body . According to the larmor equation , the frequency of hydrogen atoms in CSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , hydrogen atoms in the fat recover more rapidly along the longitudinal axis than CSF . As the T1 time of fat is shorter than CSF , the fat vector realigns with B0 faster than that of CSF . Therefore , the longitudinal magnetisation of fat is larger than CSF . <p> After a certain TR , the next RF excitation pulse is applied - and this will flip the longitudinal magnetisation of fat and CSF- towards the transverse plane . As there was more longitudinal magnetisation in fat before the RF pulse , the net magnetization vector of the fat spins can be flipped into the X-Y plane more easily as compared to CSF . This means the contribution from CSF to the overall signal will be too small in comparison to fat . Therefore , fat has a high signal and appears bright on a T1 contrast image and the low signal CSF will be dark . This is called T1 weighted imaging . <p> - <p> Repetition Time ( TR ) and T1 Weighting . <p> Repetition time ( TR ) is the length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial for T1 contrast . TR controls how far each vector can recover before it is excited by the next RF pulse . For T1 weighting , the TR must be short enough so that neither fat nor CSF has sufficient time to fully return to B0 . If the TR is too long then both fat and CSF will fully recover to the longitudinal magnetisation . In that case , the difference in T1 contrast can not be demonstrated in the image . <p> Short TR G strong T1 weighting Long TR G low T1 weighting <p> For T1 weighting we should chose a short TR . <p> Tissues with a short T1 appear bright because they regain most of theirlongitudinal magnetization during the TR interval and produce astronger MR signal.Tissues with a long T1 appear dark because they do not regain much longitudinal magnetization during the TR interval and - produce a weaker MR signal . <p> A typical T1-weighted spin echo ( SE ) sequence is acquired with a TR/TE of 400/15 msec . <p> The T2 time determines how quickly an MR signal fades after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSF again . The T2 decay occurs as a result of energy transfer between spins . The energy exchange in the hydrogen atoms in fat is more efficient than in water . As a result , hydrogen in the fat loses transverse magnetization more rapidly than in CSF . The T2 time of fat(80ms) is shorter than the CSF(200ms) . Therefore , the transverse magnetisation of fat decays faster . The magnitude of transverse magnetisation in CSF is large . It therefore appears very bright as compare to fat in T2 contrast image . <p> Echo Time ( TE ) and T2 Weighting . <p> Echo time ( TE ) is the interval between application of the excitation pulse and collection of the MR signal . If a short echo time is used ( 25ms ) , the signal differences between tissues are small because T2 relaxation has only just started and there has only been little signal decay at the time of echo collection . The resulting image has low T2 weighting . If a long echo time is used ( 100ms ) , the signal differences between tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost most of their signal and appear dark on the image while tissues with a long T2 produce a stronger signal and thus appear bright . This is the reason why cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) with its longer T2 ( 200ms ) is brighter on T2-weighted images as compared to fat(80ms) . <p> Short TE G low T2 weighting Long TE G strong T2 weighting <p> Tissues with a short T2 appear dark on T2-weighted images . Tissues with a long T2 appear bright on T2-weighted images . <p> A T2-weighted fast spin echo ( FSE ) MR image can be acquired with a TR/TE of 3000/100 msec . <p> The proton density ( PD ) is the number of excitable spins per unit volume . Proton density determines the maximum signal that can be obtained from a given tissue . The image contrast in PD images is not dependent on T1 or T2 relaxation . The signal we receive is completely dependent on the amount of protons in the tissue . Less protons means low signal and appear as dark areas on the image whereas more protons produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . Proton density can be enhance by minimizing the effect of T1 and T2 contrast . If you go back to the example of fat and CSF , a long TR allows both fat and CSF to fully recover there longitudinal magnetisation and therefore reduces the T1 weighting and a short TE does not give fat or water time to decay and therefore reduce the T2 weighting . <p> A typical PD weighted spin echo ( SE ) sequence is acquired with a TR/TE of 2500/15 msec . <p> PD sequences are very useful for evaluating structures with low signal intensities such as the bones or connective tissue structures ( ligaments and tendons ) . Proton density weighting is often used for high-resolution imaging . SE sequences are preferred over FSE sequences for PD imaging as SE images are less prone to distortion . PD sequences are mainly used for the imaging of brain , spine , and musculoskeletal system . <p> Table below shows Proton density(%) for various tissues , <p> Tissue <p> Gray matter White matter CSF Meningioma Metastasis Fat <p> Proton density(%) <p> 85 70 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apart from the water protons , biological tissues also contain a specific pool of protons bound in macromolecules ( normally proteins and membranes ) . These macromolecular protons can not be directly visualized because of their very short T1 . Macromolecular protons have a wider range of Larmor frequencies than the water protons . Therefore , these macromolecular protons can also be excited by RF pulses with frequencies slightly different from the Larmor frequency of hydrogen protons . It is possible to selectively excite a tissue with a large pool of macromolecular protons without directly affecting the protons in free water . Repeated delivery of the magnetization transfer pulse saturates the magnetization of the macromolecular protons and it is transferred to free protons nearby . This process is associated with a drop in signal that depends on magnitude , concentration of macromolecules and their interaction with free water , and is known as magnetization transfer contrast . The magnetisation is transferred by cross-relaxation and chemical exchange . Magnetization transfer pulses are used in spin-echo or gradient-echo sequences to produce additional signal suppression of tissue water . <p> Aplications <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore named as magnetization transfer imaging . MTC imaging is used in cartilage imaging to improve contrast between synovial fluid and cartilage . As synovial fluid contains only a few bound protons , it shows only a little magnetization transfer while cartilage contains a large proportion of bound protons and shows large magnetization transfer . In brain scanning MTC technique improves the detection of gadolinium-enhancing lesions . Another use of magnetization transfer is - in 3D time-of-flight MR angiography . In time-of-flight MR angiography , contrast between normal , stationary tissue and flowing blood is provided through T1 saturation of stationary-tissue water by repeated excitation pulses . Additional suppression of the stationary-tissue water with use of magnetization transfer pulses enables smaller vessels to be visualized.

@@77121068 @5821068/ <p> Signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) is a standard used to describe the performance of an MRI system . An MRI image is not created by pure MRI signals but from a combination of MRI signals and unavoidable background noise . <p> MRI image = signal + noise <p> Noise in an MRI image does not contribute useful information toward image formation and is produced by the static fluctuation of signal intensity , usually appearing as grains or irregular patterns . Noise in MRI is from two main sources : <p> 2 . Electrical resistance - resistance from the receiver coils , data cables and the electronic components of the measurement system <p> Noise produced in the MRI image depends on : <p> 1 . The coil - the number of elements , type and size and of the coil e.g. 8-channel body coil , 4-channel flex coil <p> 2 . Bandwidth - differs in each pulse sequence <p> In MRI the SNR is mainly used for image evaluation and measurement of contrast enhancement . SNR is also used for quality assurance , pulse sequence comparison and radiofrequency ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure SNR . The most common of these is done by measuring the signal of two separate regions within a single image and utilising a formula . Most MRI systems have a region of interest ( ROI ) option in their image processing section which measures signal intensities . In order to measure the SNR on an image , place the first ROI on tissues with the most homogenous area and the highest signal intensity . Then record the values of the signal intensity in that region . Subsequently , position the second ROI ( in the largest possible size to include maximum noise ) , outside of the tissues in the noisy image background. - - Record the values of signal intensity in that region . Calculate the image SNR using this formula : SNR = signal/noise In the example below , a T1 axial brain image is used and the signal intensity of the white matter and the image background is taken . In order to get the SNR value of the image divide the signal intensity value of the white matter by the standard deviation value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Field strength and SNR <p> Field strength and SNR are directly proportional to each other . Increasing the field strength will increase the longitudinal magnetisation by aligning more protons to the axis of the main magnetic field . This results in an overall increase in the amount of signal produced which will improve SNR . MRI systems using higher field strengths produce higher SNR images in comparison to the low field strength systems . Along with higher SNR images , high field strength MRI systems will also be able to produce high spatial resolution images in a shorter amount of time . This is particularly advantageous in high resolution imaging or in performing fast scans on claustrophobic or moving patients . For example , a T1 tse sequence with matrix size of 320x320 and number of excitations ( NEX ) 2 with 100% SNR will take approximately 5 minutes in a 1.5T scanner . A similar amount of SNR can be achieved in a 3T system with NEX 1 in 2.5 minutes . <p> Radiofrequency coil and SNR <p> There are a wide range of RF transmitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appropriate radiofrequency coil is essential to achieving the optimum SNR . In order to achieve maximum SNR , the RF coils should be as close as possible to the anatomy being imaged . This the main reason that most MRI systems have dedicated coils for each body part . SNR also depends on the number of transmitter and receiver elements within the RF coils . The higher the number of transmitter and receiver elements , the better the SNR eg. a 32-channel ( receiver element ) body coil will produce better SNR compared to a 4-channel body coil. - <p> MRI operators will most often notice a significant drop in SNR while scanning patients with a high BMI . The reason being the centre of the anatomy is too far from the receiver coils . The user must manipulate the scanning parameters to improve SNR while scanning patients with a high BMI . <p> Tissue Characteristics and SNR <p> SNR also depends on the magnetic characteristics of the tissue being imaged . Tissues with a higher number of protons will produce better signal intensities and higher SNR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same protocol in an infant and adult , the infant scan will see a higher SNR . <p> MRI operators may have noticed that adding fat saturation to sequences often results in a grainy , low SNR image . Here , nullifying the signals from the fat protons reduces the overall signal intensity from the anatomy being imaged . Any reduction in signal intensities reduces the overall SNR. - <p> TR and SNR <p> Increasing the TR will increase the SNR as a high TR will allow the longitudinal magnetization to approach its maximum and produce high signal intensities . Increasing the TR beyond a certain limit will however reduce the T1 effect . If we take a T1 sequence with TR of 500 and SNR of 100% , increasing the TR to 1000 will increase the SNR but reduce the T1 effect and produce images with very poor tissue contrast . Adequate use of TR is very important in T1 weighted imaging to produce good SNR and tissue contrast. - - - - - - - - <p> TE and SNR <p> Increasing the TE will reduce the SNR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay to very low values and result in signal loss . Decreasing the TE beyond a certain limit will reduce the T2 effect . For example , a T2 sequence with TR of 5000 , TE 110 and SNR of 100% , decreasing the TE to 50 will increase the SNR but reduce the T2 effect and produce images with very poor tissue contrast . Reduction of the TE to increase the SNR should only be used for T1 weighted sequences . <p> Flip angle and SNR <p> High transmitter bandwidth can be used effectively to reduce scan times in claustrophobic and moving patients . This option will significantly reduce the minimum TR and TE values allowing the user to reduce the TR and TE values manually , reducing scan time . The main disadvantage of this method is shortening the TEs and TRs usually results in more noise and increases the potential for peripheral stimulation . The diagrams below show how to choose these options and the results of the manipulations . <p> Slice thickness and SNR <p> Increasing the slice thickness will increase the SNR . This follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size resulting in an increase in the amount of signal received by the individual voxels . Increasing the slice thickness will however reduce the spatial resolution and increase the partial volume effects . Taking a T1 sequence with slice thickness of 2 mm and relative SNR of 40% , increasing the slice thickness to 6 mm will increase the SNR to 90% . <p> Slice gap and SNR <p> Slice gap is the distance between two adjacent slices . Slice gap is usually calculated as a percentage of the slice thickness . They are necessary on order to avoid slice overlapping due to the imperfection of the RF pulse . Even choosing a rectangular slice profile does not produce perfect rectangular signals . By removing the slice gap the two adjacent slices will overlap at their edges . This will result in the RF pulse of one slice exciting a small portion of the adjacent slice . This phenomenon is also called a cross-talk . The cross-talk effect creates a saturation effect in the area of slice overlap and results in a significant reduction of SNR . <p> If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4mm slice thickness and 50% ( 2mm ) slice gap sees a reduction in the slice gap to 0% , this will result in a slice overlap and produce low SNR images . This is one of the main reasons why HASTE sequences with continuous slice acquisitions will have a high SNR in the first image followed by low SNR in subsequent images . This can be either reduced by increasing the slice gap or choosing the interleave option ( which scans odd number slices together then even numbered slices together ) . It should be noted that increasing the slice gap beyond certain limits , usually above 50% , can cause misregistration . <p> Matrix size and SNR <p> Increasing the matrix size will reduce the SNR . Increasing the matrix reduces the voxel size , reducing the amount of signal received by the individual pixels . Smaller pixels will receive less signal and produce a low SNR image . As an example , after a T1 tse sequence with 100 FOV , 4mm slice thickness , 256x256 matrix size and a relative SNR of 100% , sees an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNR will reduce to 74% . Conversely , decreasing the matrix size will reduce the spatial resolution and produce blurry images . Correct selection of matrix size for a particular FOV is necessary for the production of optimum quality images . <p> Field of view ( FOV ) and SNR <p> Increasing the FOV will increase the SNR . Increasing the FOV will increase the pixel size which will increase the amount of signals received by individual pixels . Large pixels will receive more signal and produce high SNR images . Increasing the FOV will however reduce the spatial resolution and produce blurry images . In order to achieve maximum spatial resolution , the user must increase the matrix size whenever the FOV is increased . If a T1 tse sequence with 100 FOV , 192x192 matrix and relative SNR of 100% has an increase in the FOV from 100mm to 210mm , this increases the SNR to 170% . This step produces a high SNR but low spatial resolution image . To overcome this , increasing the matrix size to 256x256 will improve the spatial resolution and give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increasing the receiver bandwidth reduces the SNR . Receiver bandwidth is the amount of frequencies or wavelengths collected during the reception phase ( frequency encoding ) of RF pulses . Increasing the bandwidth reduces the scan time , susceptibility artefacts and chemical shift artefacts . Decreasing the band width to half will increase the SNR by 30% . In this example , a T1 sequence with a 260 bandwidth , acquisition time of 2 minutes and relative SNR of 100% has a decrease in the bandwidth from 260 to 130 . This increases the relative SNR to 130% but increases the scan time to 3 minutes . Care should be taken as decreasing the bandwidth beyond certain limits will see an increase in susceptibility and chemical shift artefacts . <p> Number of excitations ( NEX ) and SNR <p> Number of excitations ( averages ) are a measurement parameter that is used to represent the number of times data is repeatedly acquired to form the same image . Increasing the Number of excitations ( averages ) will increase the SNR by the square root of two ( G2 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the scan time . If a T1 tse sequence with a scan time of 2 minutes , NEX 1 and SNR of 40% sees an increase in the NEX from 1 to 4 , it will have its SNR increased to 100% but have a scan time of 8 minutes . <p> Phase oversampling and SNR <p> Phase oversampling is a technique used to eliminate phase wrap or wrap-around artefact . Phase oversampling is performed by increasing the sampling frequency in the phase encoding direction . Increasing the phase oversampling will increase the FOV and number of phase-encoding steps in the phase direction . Increasing the phase oversampling will also increase the SNR and acquisition time . If a T1 tse sequence with 150 FOV and relative SNR of 100% has its phase oversampling changed to 100% , the SNR will increase to 120%. - <p> Partial K-space filling and SNR <p> Partial K- space filling techniques save significant amounts of scan time without making changes to any other scanning parameters . The two main types of partial k-space acquisition techniques are partial Fourier imaging and partial echo imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce similar resolution images but with compromised SNR . <p> In partial Fourier imaging only half or just more than half of the K- space lines in the phase encoding direction are acquired to create the entire image . This will reduce the scan time but produce low SNR images . <p> In partial echo imaging only part of the echoes in the frequency encoding direction are sampled to create the entire image . This method will again reduce the scan time but produce low SNR scans . <p> Parallel imaging techniques and SNR <p> Using parallel imaging techniques will degrade the SNR of the reconstructed images . The noise produced in the reconstructed images are due to decreased data sampling and noise amplification caused by the parallel reconstruction algorithm . Increasing the acceleration factor in parallel imaging will reduce the SNR . As a final example , if a T1 tse sequence with a parallel imaging acceleration factor of 2 has an increase in the acceleration factor to 4 , there will be a reduction in the original SNR by 40%.

@@77121071 @5821071/ <p> MR sialography is a non-invasive MRI technique used to evaluate diseases of the salivary ducts . MR sialography is based on the principle that stationary fluids will produce bright signal on heavily T2-weighted images . Sialography uses T2 weighted sequences with very long TR ( 8000 ) , TE(500) and spectral pre-saturation inversion recovery ( SPIR ) fat suppression to - highlight fluid and suppress other surrounding tissue signals . MR Sialography has the advantage of depicting the glandular parenchyma in addition to depicting sialolithiasis and other changes of the ductal structure . MRI imaging has the potential to provide spatial information on salivary gland function . <p> Ductal anatomy <p> Salivary glands are exocrine glands which secrete saliva into the oral cavity . There are three major pairs of salivary glands ; parotids , submandibular and sublingual glands . <p> Parotid gland : parotid glands are the largest salivary glands situated below the external acoustic meatus between the mandible and sternocleidomastoid muscle . The parotid duct extends from the parotid glands and runs a short distance obliquely forward between the buccinator and the oral mucosa to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This duct is about 5-6cm long and about 1-2mm thick . <p> Submandibular glands : submandibular glands are situated beneath the lower jaws , superior to the digastric muscles . The submandibular duct extends from the submandibular gland to the posterior edge of the mylohyoid muscle , curves around the muscle , then enters the sublingual space on the surface of the mylohyoid muscle and opens into the floor of the mouth on the summit of the sublingual papilla at the side of the frenulum of the tongue . This duct is about 5cm long and about 1 " 3mm thick . <p> Sublingual gland : The sublingual glands are situated beneath the tongue , anterior to the submandibular glands . Sublingual glands do not have striate ducts . <p> MRI Sialograms are only possible in the parotid and submandibular ducts . 72325 @qwx692325 72329 @qwx692329 72324 @qwx692324 <p> Head first supine Position the head in the head coil and immobilise with cushions Give cushions under the legs for extra comfort Centre the laser beam localiser over the nose tip <p> PAROTID SIALOGRAM 72330 @qwx692330 <p> localiser <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@77121076 @5821076/ <p> The inversion recovery sequences are spin echo sequences with a 180- preparation pulse to flip the longitudinal magnetization into the opposite direction ( i.e. spins are flipped to the 180- position ) . Transverse magnetization remains equal to zero therefore we do not receive any an MR signal . During the recovery , the negative longitudinal magnetization decays to zero and then begins to rise . Because transverse magnetization is not possible , no signal is measured . To generate an MR signal , the longitudinal magnetization is then converted to transverse magnetization through the application of a 90- pulse . The interval between the 180- pulse and the 90- stimulation pulse is known as inversion time ( TI ) . - As the spins relax back to their equilibrium configuration the signal for each spin group will evolve from a negative signal which is zero ( null point ) to a positive signal . This rate is determined by the T1 of the spin group . Since at 1.5 T , T1 - fat= 260 ms and for most other tissues T1 &gt; 500 ms . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner than the other tissues . Therefore an inversion recovery sequence with a short inversion time ( TI ) of 130-150 is used for fat suppression . <p> MRI image appearance <p> The easiest way to identify STIR images is to look for fat and fluid filled space in the body ( e.g. Cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and spinal canal , free fluid in the abdomen , fluid in the gall bladder and common bile duct , synovial fluid in joints , fluid in the urinary tract and urinary bladder , oedema or any other pathological fluid collection in the body ) . Fluids normally appear bright and fat appear very dark in a STIR image . <p> Pathological processes normally increase the water content in tissues . Due to the added water component this results in a signal increase on STIR images . Consequently pathological processes are usually bright on STIR images . 
@@77121077 @5821077/ <p> MRV stands for magnetic resonance venography . MRV is used to assess abnormalities in venous drainage of the brain . 2-dimensional ( 2D ) time-of-flight ( TOF ) MR venography ( MRV ) and 3-dimensional ( 3D ) phase-contrast ( PC ) are the technique commonly used to assess the cerebral venous sinuses because they are easy to perform and do not require contrast administration . <p> Time-of-flight ( TOF ) <p> These techniques show contrast between stationary tissues and flowing blood by manipulating the magnitude of magnetization . The magnitude of magnetization from the moving spins is very large compared to the magnetization from the stationary spins which is relatively small . This leads to a large signal from moving blood spins and a diminished signal from stationary tissue spins . Time of flight ( TOF ) utilizes the longitudinal magnetization vector for imaging . <p> Phase contrast ( PC ) <p> These techniques derive contrast between stationary tissues and flowing blood by manipulating the phase of the magnetization . The phase of the magnetization from the stationary spins is zero and the phase of the magnetization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of how far the magnetization process from the time it is tipped into the transverse plane until the time it is detected . A bipolar gradient pulse with equal magnitude and opposite direction is used to diminish signal from the stationary tissue . Phase contrast angiography ( PCA ) utilises the transverse magnetization vector . In phase difference images , the signal is linearly proportional to the velocity of the spins . Fast moving spins give rise to a larger signal and spins moving in one direction are assigned a bright signal and appear white in the scan , whereas spins moving in the opposite direction are assigned a dark signal and appear black in the scan . Phase contrast methods are sensitive to a range of velocities , so the user must choose this value carefully . Different velocity encoding values can be used in different scans to highlight different vessels.High velocity encoding for arteries ( 40-70 cm/sec ) due to arterial flow is fast . Low velocity encoding for veins ( 10-20 cm/sec ) due to venous flow is slow . 72325 @qwx692325 <p> Positioning magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first supine Position the head in the head coil and immobilise with cushions Give cushions under the legs for extra comfort Centre the laser beam localizer over the glabella 72330 @qwx692330 <p> localiser <p> A three plane localiser must be taken to plan the sequences .

@@77121085 @5821085/ <p> When a patient is placed in the magnet the hydrogen atoms in the water of their body tissues line up along the magnetic field .

This difference in relaxation times is used in MRI to distinguish normal and pathologic tissues . - Each tissue is characterized by two relaxations times : T1 ( longitudinal relaxation time ) and T2 ( transverse relaxation time ) .

@@77121087 @5821087/ <p> In MRI bandwidth is defined as the amount of frequencies or wavelengths that can be transmitted or received in a limited amount of time . Bandwidth is measured in cycles per second or Hertz ( Hz ) . An MRI sequence is designed with two types of bandwidths : transmitter bandwidth ( tBW ) and receiver bandwidth ( rBW ) . Transmitter bandwidth describes the properties of transmitted radiofrequency ( RF ) pulses and receiver bandwidth describes the quality of MRI signal . <p> Transmitter bandwidth ( tBW ) <p> Transmitter bandwidth is the bandwidth used during the transmission of RF pulses . This is used to excite a discrete slice thickness or volume . The lowest possible slice thickness of a pulse sequence is directly proportional to the transmitter bandwidth of the RF pulse type i.e. the higher the transmitter bandwidth higher the lowest possible slice thickness. - - - - <p> Siemens scanners offer three type of RF pulses in most of their sequences . A low specific absorption rate ( SAR ) option which is the low bandwidth pulse , a normal option which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher bandwidth pulse. - <p> Low SAR <p> This is a low bandwidth RF pulse with very good slice profile and allows less crosstalk between slices . This option will allow you to choose the lowest possible slice thickness in most pulse sequences . This RF pulse type will give reduced SAR values . Choosing this option reduces the chance of the sequence going into first level mode. - A disadvantage of the low SAR RF pulse type are long scan times due to longer minimum TEs , TRs and echo spacing ( the time from one echo to the next echo ) . Also , low transmitter bandwidth pulse type is more susceptible to susceptibility and distortion artefacts . <p> Normal <p> This is a medium bandwidth RF pulse with good slice profile and optimized SAR behaviour . <p> Fast <p> This is a high bandwidth RF pulse with compromised slice profile and will give a higher SAR compared to the other modes . This RF pulse type will provide the user an opportunity to reduce TEs and TRs . It has shorter echo spacing ( ES ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that a Fast RF pulse will have a higher chance of peripheral nerve stimulation. - - <p> Practical applications of low transmitter- bandwidth ( Low SAR mode ) <p> Low transmitter bandwidth mode is the most appropriate option to choose when scanning neonates and sedated patients due to their inability to feedback to the operator . Low SAR mode must be chosen while scanning pregnant patients to avoid any potential RF harm to the foetus . Low transmitter bandwidth RF pulses are also useful for scanning patients with MRI conditional implants e.g. MRI conditional pacemakers , heart valves . <p> Practical applications of high transmitter bandwidth ( Fast mode ) <p> High transmitter bandwidth can be used effectively to reduce scan times in claustrophobic and moving patients . This option will significantly reduce the minimum TR and TE values allowing the user to reduce the TR and TE values manually , reducing scan time . The main disadvantage of this method is shortening the TEs and TRs usually results in more noise and increases the potential for peripheral stimulation . The diagrams below show how to choose these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitter bandwidth is the most appropriate option to select when scanning areas with metal implants . This option will significantly reduce the susceptibility and distortion artefacts . During these sequences it is important to carefully monitor the SAR levels to avoid RF burns . The examples below show the differences in image quality using low and high transmitter bandwidths in a patient with metal crowns . <p> Receiver bandwidth ( rBW ) <p> The receiver bandwidth is the range of frequencies used during the reception of RF pulses . During the reception phase the readout gradient receives a range of frequencies and converts it into an MR signal using an analogue digital converter ( ADC ) . The time taken for the ADC to check and store the amplitude of the echo signal is called the dwell time ( D ) . For a 256 matrix the ADC samples the signal 256 times . <p> Total sampling time ( Ts ) = matrix in read ( N ) x dwell time ( D ) <p> The receiver bandwidth is the reciprocal of the total sampling time . The unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandwidth : BW = 1/Ts Hz/pixel <p> Each manufacturer defines the receiver bandwidth differently . Siemens and Toshiba scanners use receiver bandwidth per pixel ( Hz/pixel ) . GE scanners use the bandwidth of the entire matrix which is usually measured in kHz . Philips scanners use the water-fat shift in pixels ( WFS ) to measure the bandwidth . In a 1.5T scanner the resonating frequency difference between a fat and water proton is 220Hz and in a 3T scanner it is about 440Hz . <p> WFS in 1.5Tscanner = ( Hz/pixel ) / 220Hz <p> Receiver bandwidth is one of the parameters you can change on most scanners . Bandwidth and sampling time are inversely proportional to each other . Increasing the bandwidth shortens sampling time . It however reduces the signal amplitude and increases the noise level in pixels resulting in a significant reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) of the image . <p> Practical applications of high receiver bandwidth ( rBW ) <p> Increasing the receiver bandwidth shortens the scan time by allowing shorter TR and TEs . For example , a T1 sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TE is usually acquired in about 3.30 minutes . The same sequence with a bandwidth of 300 will give you the option to reduce the minimum TR to 450 and TE to 16 reducing the scan time from 3.30 minutes to 2.10 minutes . This option can be used for scanning claustrophobic and moving patients . A disadvantage is that choosing a higher bandwidth results in a reduction in the SNR . <p> Increasing the receiver bandwidth can be a method to produce less blurry images as it reduces the echo spacing . In turbo spin echo sequences , higher bandwidth increases the turbo factor due to short echo spacing . This increase in turbo factor results in a higher fat signal in TSE scans . <p> Higher receiver bandwidth sequences are also very effective in reducing metallic susceptibility artefacts . The area around the implant is manipulated by strong local off-resonances resulting in field distortions . The degree of field distortions depends on the size , shape and properties of the metal . During signal processing these in-plane and through-plane distortions will shift the image pixels from their real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe field changes will lead to signal voids and appear as black areas in the image. - The regions with signal pileups appear as very bright areas . Increasing the bandwidth reduces the through-plane distortion of the slice profile and produces less distorted final images . <p> Higher receiver bandwidth also reduces chemical shift artefacts . Fat protons resonate at an approximately 3.3 ppm lower frequency than water protons due to the difference in their molecular structure . Signals from fat protons always shift to lower frequencies by a certain pixel in the readout direction . This is known as chemical shift artefact . The degree of shifting depends on the bandwidth and field strength of the magnet . Increasing the receiver bandwidth will reduce chemical shift artefact by reducing the shifting of fat protons. - Higher field strengths increase the chemical shift artefact which usually appears in 1.5T and 3T scanners . <p> Practical applications of low receiver bandwidth <p> Decreasing the bandwidth increases the SNR . This method can be used to boost the SNR in high resolution scans with very small field of views e.g. temporomandibular joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TR , TE and echo spacing . This results in an increase the scan time and can also increases the chances of chemical shift , distortion and susceptibility artefacts. - <p> Lower receiver bandwidths will reduce the minimal field of view . For example , a sequence with a bandwidth of 250 will give a minimum field of view of 130 and the same sequence with a bandwidth of 80 will reduce the minimum field to 90 . This option can be used while scanning small body parts e.g. TMJ and thumb imaging . <p> Receiver bandwidth manipulation <p> Bandwidth is one of the main parameters that can be manipulated by the Radiographer to reduce scan time , increase SNR and reduce artefacts . The section below will show you how to manipulate the bandwidth while maintaining the SNR . For the manipulation of bandwidth , it is necessary to know the relationship of bandwidth with other parameters . Radiographers can choose one of the following techniques to successfully manipulate the bandwidth. - <p> Bandwidth and Resolution <p> Both resolution and bandwidth uses the readout gradient . The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher bandwidth also requires a higher readout gradient . Increasing the bandwidth and resolution at the same time increases the workload of the readout gradient . The result is a significant drop in the SNR producing very grainy images . <p> If you want to increase the bandwidth to reduce artefacts it is necessary to compensate the SNR by manipulating other parameters . One of the main parameters that you can reduce to improve the SNR is resolution . For example , take a T1 TSE sequence with 200 FOV , 320x320 matrix and bandwidth of 130 . If you want to increase the bandwidth from 130 to 500 the signal will drop from 100% to 49% of the original SNR . To compensate for the signal drop you can reduce the matrix size from 320x320 to 256x256 . This will increase the signal from 49% to 85% and will also reduce the scanning time . Increasing the bandwidth will provide the user the option to reduce the TE and TR , reducing the scan time further . This is one of the most effective ways of cutting down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most time efficient method while scanning metal implants , claustrophobic and moving patients . <p> Increasing the bandwidth will reduce the SNR . Increasing the averages is the most appropriate technique to increase SNR . For example , take a T1 TSE sequence with a bandwidth of 100 , averages 2 and a relative SNR of 100% . Increasing the bandwidth from 100 to 250 will reduce the SNR to 74% of the original SNR . The signal loss can be compensated by increasing the averages from 2 to 3 . This method will provide better quality images than the previous option . The down side of this method is that it will significantly increase the scan time . This is the most appropriate technique to use if time is not of concern. - - - - - - - <p> Bandwidth and field of view ( FOV ) <p> Increasing the FOV will increase the pixel size . Larger pixels will receive more signals and produce high SNR images . In order to compensate from the SNR loss from increasing the bandwidth the user can increase the FOV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 FOV , bandwidth of 130 and a relative SNR of 100% . Increasing the bandwidth from 130 to 250 will reduce the SNR to 74% . Increasing the FOV from 200 to 260 will bring the SNR back to 100% . This method will however slightly reduce the image quality . It is not an appropriate method to choose where high-resolution scanning is required e.g. pituitary fossa imaging . <p> Bandwidth and oversampling <p> Increasing the oversampling will increase the SNR and reduce aliasing artefacts . This option can be used to increase the SNR in small field of view scans with high bandwidth e.g. prostate imaging . This method will result in superior image quality . The only disadvantage of this method is that the scan time will increase .

@@77121105 @5821105/ <p> Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW MRI ) provides image contrast that is dependent on the random microscopic motion of water protons , which may be substantially altered by different pathological process . <p> Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging uses a T2-weighted pulse sequence with two extra gradient pulses which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction . These gradient pulses are applied in between the nuclear spin excitation and data acquisition . As a result , imaging is more sensitive to water molecular motion in the direction of the additional applied gradients. - The extra gradient pulses lead to an attenuation of the signal intensity along the axis to which they are applied which is directly proportional to water diffusion- in that area. - Higher water diffusion will result in greater signal attenuation and appears darker on the image . For example , in brain scans regions of ischemic infarction are characterized as reduced water diffusion areas due to reduced blood flow . Therefore , those areas appear hyperintense ( bright ) on diffusion-weighted images . <p> The magnitude of water signal attenuation on diffusion-weighted images depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the amount of diffusion weighting . The latter varies according to the strength , duration , and separation time of the gradient pulses . The sensitivity to water diffusion is defined by the gradient factor b ( sec/mm2 ) . The higher the b values , the better the sensitivity of diffusion weighted imaging ( usually three to four b values are used in diffussion-weighted sequences b50 , b500 , b1000 and b1400 ) . <p> Beside the diffusion-weighted row data images , there is one more way to present diffusion data which is called the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map of water . These are calculated from diffusion-weighted images after the acquisition .

Using parallel acquisition MRI techniques , it is possible to reconstruct full-FOV images from under sampled k-space data by using the uncorrelated information from RF array coil elements . The main disadvantage of parallel acquisition techniques is that the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) is degraded due to the reduced data samples and the spatially correlated nature of multiple RF receivers . <p> Contrast administration and timing of scans <p> Guess timing technique : - <p> This is one of the simplest methods . It works by estimating the time of contrast traveling from the site of injection to the vascular structure of abdomen . This technique is highly dependent upon the site of contrast injection , age of the patient , cardiac output , and vascular anatomy . Generally , the contrast takes about 15-20 seconds to travel from antecubital vein to the arch of aorta . Therefore the post contrast T1 acquisition should start within 17seconds of contrast administration . <p> Care bolus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used bolus detection technique . This technique uses a coronal fast gradient refocused sequence . Real-time images are obtained every second through the vascular structure of interest ( usually placed over the heart ) . The operator can then watch the contrast bolus arriving in the heart and then switch to the centric 3D sequence . <p> Planning care bolus <p> Plan the coronal care bolus slice on the sagittal plane ; angle the slice parallel to the ascending aorta . Check the positioning block in the other two planes . <p> Care bolus scans must start one second prior to the contrast administration . The operator can then watch the scans live and wait for the contrast bolus to arrive in the heart . When the contrast reaches the heart the care bolus must be stopped immediately and wait for 2-3 seconds before starting the centric 3D dynamic sequence ( this 2-3 second delay - is the travel time of the contrast from heart to upper arm ) . <p> Plan the coronal slices on the axial plane ; angle the position in the sagittal plane ( parallel to the humerus ) .

It is highly advisable to use parallel acquisition technique to reduce scan time ( scan time should be less than 20 seconds to get the best results ) .

@@77121138 @5821138/ <p> Magnets where first discovered by the Romans more than 2000 years ago . Over the years the understanding of magnet has increased and so many applications have developed . In 1940s Felix Bloch , working at Stanford University , and Edward Purcell , from Harvard University , found that when certain nuclei were placed in a magnetic field they absorbed energy in the radiofrequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum , and re-emitted this energy when the nuclei transferred to their original state . With this discovery NMR spectroscopy was born and soon became an important analytical method in the study of the composition of chemical compounds . For this discovery Bloch and Purcell were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1952 . The strength of the magnetic field and the radiofrequency matched each other as earlier demonstrated by Sir Joseph Larmor ( Irish physicist 1857-1942 ) and is known as the Larmor relationship ( i.e. , the angular frequency of precession of the nuclear spins being proportional to the strength of the magnetic field ) . This phenomenon was termed NMR as follows : " Nuclear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; " Magnetic " as a magnetic field was required ; " Resonance " because of the direct frequency dependence of the magnetic and radiofrequency fields . In 1973 , Paul Lauterbur , a chemist and an NMR pioneer at the State University of New York , Stony Brook , produced the first NMR image . Mike Goldsmith , one of the graduate students cobbled a wearable antenna coil to monitor the hydrogen broadcast detected by the coil . On July 3 , 1977 , nearly five hours after the start of the first MRI test , the first human scan was made as the first MRI prototype . <p> Nuclear Magnetic Resonance <p> Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) uses the signal from the nuclei of hydrogen atoms ( 1H ) for production of the image.It is used becouse it is very abundant in the human body . A hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus containing a single proton and electron orbiting the nucleus . The proton having a positive charge and the electron a negative charge , the hydrogen atom as a whole is electrically neutral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from its positive charge , the proton possesses spin , an intrinsic property of nearly all elementary particles . This means that the proton rotates about its axis like a spinning top . According to low of electro-magnetism a magnetic field will be created when a charged particle moves . There for because of the proton spin - the hydrogen nucleus has a magnetic field induced around it and act as a small magnet . - A proton has two important properties : <p> As a rotating mass ( m ) , the proton has angular momentum and acts like a spinning top that strives to retain the spatial orientation of its rotation axis . <p> As a rotating mass with an electrical charge , the proton additionally has magnetic moment ( B ) and behaves like a small magnet . Therefore , the proton is affected by external magnetic fields and electromagnetic waves and , when it moves , induces a voltage in a receiver coil <p> We can not see the intrinsic angular momentum , or spin , of a hydrogen atom from outside . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Nevertheless , we can identify the orientation of its rotation axis from the magnetization vector B. Thus , when we describe the rotation of a proton , we are not referring to its ( invisible ) angular momentum but to the " visible " motion of its magnetic axis , B. This motion is visible , so to speak , because it generates a signal in a receiver coil just like a magnet does in an electrical generator . <p> There is a big difference between the spin of a spinning top and a proton . A spinning top can be slowed down and thus finally comes to a standstill ; a protons spin always has the same magnitude and can neither be accelerated nor decelerated , precisely because it is a fundamental property of elementary particles . Spin is simply there all the time . The behaviour of a spinning proton in a strong external magnetic field can be described with the example of a spinning top . When earths gravitational field G acts on a spinning top and tries to alter the orientation of its rotational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called precession . At the same time , friction at the point of contact withdraws energy from the spinning top and slows down its rotation . As a result , its axis becomes more and more inclined and the top finally falls over . <p> Same like a spinning top when the hydrogen nuclei are exposed to an external magnetic field , B0 , the magnetic moments , or spins , align with the direction of the field like compass needles . The magnetic moments do not only align with the field but , like spinning tops , undergo precession Precession of the nuclei occurs at a characteristic speed thatis proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field and is called Larmor frequency . Alignment of the spins parallel to the magnetic field is a gradual process and is associated with the dissipation of energy . <p> Larmor equation <p> The Larmor equation - is a very important concept for MR imaging . The value of the precessional frequency is governed by the larmor equation . The larmor equation stat that The Larmor or precession frequency is the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the strength ( B0 ) of the magnetic field . <p> The precessional frequency -0= B0 x ++ <p> Where B0- is the magnetic field strength And - ++ is the gyro magnetic ratio <p> Protons have a gyro magnetic ratio of ++ =42.58 MHz/T , resulting in a Larmor frequency of 63.9 MHz at 1.5 T that means at 1.5 T the protons spin at approx. 63.9 million times a second . <p> Resonance <p> When hydrogen atoms placed in a strong magnetic field(B0) - the spin system relaxes and settles into a stable state , longitudinal magnetization Mz is building up in the z-direction because the magnetic vectors representing the individual magnetic moments add together.Actually , things are even a bit more complicated : the spins tend to align parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field with parallel alignment being slightly preferred because it is equivalent to spins residing in a more favorable energy state . Hence , under steady-state conditions , a slightly larger fraction aligns parallel to the main magnetic field . It is this small difference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the net magnetizationvector ( NMV ) . Since the energy difference between the two orientations depends on the strength of the external magnetic field , Mz increases with the field strength . <p> Energy can be introduced into such a stable spin system by applying an electromagnetic wave of the same frequency as the Larmor frequency . This is called the resonance condition . The required electromagnetic wave is generated in a powerful radio transmitter and applied to the object to be imaged by means of an antenna coil . The process of energy absorption is known as excitation of the spin system and results in the longitudinal magnetization being more and more tipped away from the z-axis toward the transverse ( x , y ) plane perpendicular to the direction of the main magnetic field . <p> All of the longitudinal magnetization is rotated into the transverse plane by a radiofrequency ( RF ) pulse that is strong enough and applied long enough to tip the magnetization by exactly 90- ( 90- RF pulse ) . The resulting magnetization is now denoted by Mxy rather than Mz because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the NMV moves out of alignment is called the flip angle . the magnetide of the flip angle is depends upon the amplitude of the RF pulse.Normaly the flip angle is 90- . Whenever transverse magnetization is present , it rotates or precesses about the z-axis , which has the effect of an electrical generator and induces an alternating voltage of the same frequency as the Larmor frequency in a receiver coil : the MR signal . This signal is collected and processed with sensitive receivers and computers to generate the MR image . <p> Free induction decay - <p> When RF pulse switched off the NMV is again influenced by the main magnetic field ( B0 ) and it tries to re-align with B0 . During this processes NMV loses its energy given by the RF pulse . the processes by which NMV loses its energy called the relaxation . <p> During FID the amount of magnetisation in the longitudinal plane gradually increases this is called recovery and the amount of magnetisation in the transverse - plane gradually diereses this is called decay <p> As the magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage induced in the receiver coil . This is called free induction decay signal . <p> Relaxation - <p> Relaxation results in recovery of magnetisation in the longitudinal plane and decay of magnetisation in the transverse plane . The recovery of longitudinal magnetisation is caused by a process termed T1 recovery . The dacay of transverse magnetisation is caused by a process termed T2 decay . <p> T1 ( Longitudinal Relaxation ) - <p> When relaxation occur the projection of the magnetization vector onto the xy plane decreases slowly and the MR signal fades in proportion . As transverse magnetization decays , the longitudinal magnetization , Mz " the projection of the magnetization vector onto the z-axis " is slowly restored . This process is known as longitudinal relaxation or T1 recovery.The nuclei can return to the ground state only by giving up - their excess energy to their surroundings environment or lattice which is why this kind of relaxation is also called spin-lattice relaxation . The time constant for this recovery is T1 and is dependent on the strength of the external magnetic field B0 , and the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - <p> T1 and T2 relaxation are two independent processes- the one has nothing to do with the other . The only thing they have in common is that both processes happen simultaneously . T1 relaxation describes what happens in the Z direction , while T2 relaxation describes what happens in the X-Y plane . <p> Before the 90- RF pulse . The net magnetization vector is the sum of all the small magnetic fields of the protons , which are aligned along the Z-axis.Each individual proton is spinning around its own axis . Although they may be rotating with the same speed , they are not spinning in-phase ( no phase coherence ) . When we apply the 90- RF pulse the net - magnetization - flip into the X-Y plane Apart from that all the protons will also start spinning in-phase. - that means the net magnetization vector is rotating in the X-Y plane around the Z-axis with all the vectors pointing - in the same direction because they are In-Phase . However they wo n't - stay like this for long because each proton is tiny magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same sign repel each other- so the protons will start repelling each other - . Because the magnetic fields of each vector are influenced by one another the situation will occur that one vector is slowed down while the other vector might speed up . The vectors will rotate at different speeds and therefore they are not able to point into the same direction anymore : they will start to de-phase - the phase coherence is gradually lost as some spins advance while others fall behind on their precessional paths . The individual magnetization vectors begin to cancel each other out instead of adding together . The resulting vector sum , the transverse magnetization , becomes smaller and smaller and finally disappears . <p> Transverse relaxation is the decay of transverse magnetization because spins lose coherence ( dephasing ) . Transverse relaxation differs from longitudinal relaxation in that the spins do not dissipate energy to their surroundings but instead exchange energy with it 's neighbours because of this this is often termed as spin to spin relaxation . Coherence is lost in two ways ; <p> Energy transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic field . Such fluctuations are due to the fact that the spins are associated with small magnet fields that randomly interact with each other . Spins precess faster or slower according to the magnetic field variations they experience . The overall result is a cumulative loss of phase . It is a process due to pure spin-spin interaction . Dephasing occurs with the time constant T2 and is more or less independent of the strength of the external magnetic field , B0 . <p> Time-independent inhomogeneities of the external magnetic field B0 . These are intrinsic inhomogeneities that are caused by the magnetic field generator itself and by the very person being imaged . They contribute to dephasing , resulting in an overall signal decay that is even faster than described by T2 . This second type of decay occurs with the time constant T2* , which is typically shorter than T2 . Most of the inhomogeneities that produce the T2* effect occur at tissue borders , particularly at air/tissue interfaces , or are induced by local magnetic fields ( e.g. iron particles ) . T2* effects can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy transfer between spins , while T2* refers to the effects of additional field inhomogeneities contributing to dephasing . <p> The decrease in the MR signal due to T2 relaxation occurs within the first 100 " 300 msec , which is long before there has been complete recovery of longitudinal magnetization Mz due to T1 relaxation ( 0.5 " 5 sec ) .

You may be asked to change into a hospital gown . An MRI scan can last from 10 minutes to an hour or more depending on the part of the body being examined . Some patients who require a contrast injection will have a small intravenous line known as a cannula inserted into their arm before the scan starts . <p> During the scan <p> Once in the scanner room you will lie on the scanner bed and equipment may be placed over the part of the body being scanned. - You will be given an emergency buzzer in case you need to call the MRI staff during the scan .

The part of the body being scanned is in the middle of the tunnel which stays open at both ends. - The MRI machine makes a series of loud noises as it takes the pictures . Try to relax and lie still to avoid blurry images. - In some procedures , you will be asked to hold your breath for a short period . If contrast dye is to be administered , it will be injected through a cannula or using a small needle . <p> Claustrophobia : Patients who know or suspect they suffer from claustrophobia ( fear of enclosed spaces ) should talk to the staff before their scan . For some scans the radiographer may be able to adapt your positioning , and s/he can talk to you through the headphones during the scan to provide reassurance . Some claustrophobic patients ask their doctor to prescribe a mild sedative to help them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRI scan <p> MRI is a very safe and painless scanning method and uses no radiation . However , as a strong magnetic field is involved so it is very important to follow the safety guidelines outlined above . Loose metal or mechanical items must be removed before the scan , as they may fly into the machine and cause injury or equipment damage . Metal implants or fragments in the body such as bullets or shrapnel can be dislodged or heat up during the scan causing injury to the patient. - - Mechanical implants such as pacemakers , neurostimulators and insulin pumps may malfunction as a result of the magnetic field and place the patient at risk . It is therefore , very important to comply with the screening process undertaken by the MRI staff before entering a scanner room .

When they do occur they tend to be short-lived and mild " itching , pain or nausea . A rare condition called Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) affecting the skin and organs has been associated with MRI injection in patients with severe kidney disease . MRI staff will screen patients to make sure they do not receive contrast if this is a risk . <p> After the scan <p> An MRI scan is sent to a radiologist or physician trained to interpret the images . The result is then forwarded to the doctor who requested the scan for you. - Some doctors will ask you to provide CD with pictures of the scan . You can ask the MRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open MRI works on the same principles as normal MRI but the machine is designed so that there is more space around the body of the patient as they lie in the machine . In many cases , the sides of the tunnel are removed so the patient can turn their head and look out into the room . Open MRI is particularly suitable for claustrophobic patients , bariatric patients ( high body mass ) , children , and elderly patients . <p> MRI of Children <p> MRI is generally considered very safe for children because it does not use ionising radiation . A parent or carer can generally accompany their child into the room during a scan , and young babies may sleep through the whole process . However , as the patient needs to stay still during the scan , older infants and children up to the age of 5 or 6 may require sedation beforehand . - In this case , the child 's pulse and oxygen levels will normally be monitored by an accompanying doctor. - Older children may be able to stay still during an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience by careful reassurance and age-appropriate explanations of what will happen during an MRI. - <p> MRI scanning is expensive and the scans are relatively lengthy , so availability may be limited Unsuitable for patients with some metallic or mechanical implants e.g. aneurysm clips , internal defibrillators Unsuitable for claustrophobic patients and those with a high body mass index or those unable to tolerate noise Unsuitable for patients unable to lie still during the procedure Contrast scans can not be carried out on patients suffering from severe kidney disease 
@@77121155 @5821155/ <p> Constructive Interference in Steady State ( CISS ) is a modification of TrueFISP . CISS sequence uses a strong T2-weighted 3D gradient echo technique which produces high resolution isotropic images . Two consecutive runs of 3D balanced steady-state free precession with different excitation levels are performed internally and subsequently combined . Image contrast in CISS is determined by the T2/T1 ratio of the tissue . Tissues with both long T2 and short T1 relaxation times have high signal intensity on CISS images . Due to high T2/T1 ratio , water and fat have high signal on this sequence . The CISS sequence provides excellent contrast between cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) and other structures in the brain . For these reasons , CISS sequence is very useful for evaluating structures surrounded by CSF ( e.g. cranial nerves ) . <p> MRI image appearance <p> The easiest way to identify CISS images is to look for fat and fluid filled space in the body ( e.g. cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and spinal canal ) .

@@77121248 @5821248/ <p> Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo Imaging ( MPRAGE ) is a modified TurboFLASH technique with magnetization prepared inversion pulses . Image acquisition uses an initial 180 degree inversion pulse followed by a GRE imaging sequence ( steady state using rewinder gradients ) . In order to produce 3D images , a secondary phase encoding occurs in the slice select direction . Only one segment or partition of a 3D data record is obtained per preparatory pulse . After the signal acquisition all the rows within a 3D partition use delay time TD . The delay time is necessary to prevent saturation effects . MPRANGE sequences are commonly used for high resolution 3D isotropic brain imaging . In comparison with T1-weighted SE sequences , MPRANGE provides a superior image quality and better gray matter and white matter contrast . <p> MRI image appearance <p> T1 SE and MPRANGE sequences look similar . The only noticeable difference is MPRANGE sequences have better contrast between gray and white matter .

@@77121250 @5821250/ <p> SPACE is a variant of the three dimensional ( 3D ) turbo spin echo sequence . Compared to a conventional turbo spin echo sequence , SPACE uses non-selective , short refocussing pulse trains that consist of RF pulses with variable flip angles . This allows for very high turbo factors ( &gt; 100 ) and high sampling efficiency . SPACE sequence produces high resolution isotropic images which can be reconstructed in multiple planes . SPACE sequences are less sensitive to susceptibility , flow and chemical shift artefacts which makes it superior over the conventional turbo spin echo . By using a SPACE sequence , - it is possible to produce isotropic 0.9mm 3D TIR , FLAIR and T2 contrast images in less than 7 minutes .
