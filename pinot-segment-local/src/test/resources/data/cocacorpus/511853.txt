@@106868390 @2268390/ <h> Grouptest - Winter Riding Mountain Bike Jackets <p> With winter fast approaching it might be about time to think about investing in a waterproof mountain bike jacket so you can keep riding , even when the conditions are n't in your favour . <p> We have compiled a mix of jackets on test here from a range of manufactures to cover all eventualities so it 's very hard to pin down one as our overall winner , but rest assured we put them through the mill so you do n't have to . <p> We have taken into account the durability , breathability , the features on the jacket , styling , fit , construction and price of each jacket to come to a well rounded verdict . <p> Before we start here 's a bit of science about waterproofness ... How waterproof a jacket is can be assessed by how much water can be suspended above one square metre of the fabric before it begins to seep through . A top score in this test is about 20,000mm , so if the fabric performs anywhere near that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much the same . The figure produced at the end is decided by how many grams of water vapour can rise though a square meter of the fabric in a 24 hour period . Its unit of measure is g/m2/d or just g for short ! A good score in this test is around about 20,000g . Not all manufactures produce these figures for all their jackets but if we could get our hands on them we would have the figures for you here , otherwise you will just have to take our word for it ! <p> There probably is n't going to be one magic jacket that will be the best out there for all disciplines of riding , for example a XC racer is going to demand something entirely different from their jacket to a downhill rider on a soggy uplift . The weight and fabrics used to make the jackets are going to need to be completely different to match the completely different styles of riding , but they will need to share one common factor . Keeping you both dry and warm when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacket <p> First up we have the Atmosphere soft shell jacket from the new One Industries Bike range , which is n't advertised as a straight out waterproof jacket more a highly water resistant option . <p> The jacket is constructed from a soft shell material with a honey comb pattern on the inside to maintain airflow inside . It also features headphone routing from the chest pocket , but you wo n't be getting your iPhone in there as it 's small to say the least . The Storm flap on the jacket is held shut with magnets opposed to the usual poppers or velcro that you see on so many jackets , making it easy to close up your jacket . <p> The addition of an " optic wipe " in the pocket is something we like . It 's always good to have a speedy way of keeping your glasses clean or the end of your camera lens streak free ! <p> We love the stealth and understated styling on the jacket with the black fabric only being broken by the simple white One Industries logo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big side , with our small test model being more suited for someone or normally opts for a medium size . The jacket is very warm and did n't feel overly breathable but it would be a great option for out on those freezing night rides throughout the winter . <h> One Industries Atmosphere Windbreaker Jacket <p> Next up we have another offering from One Industries . It shares the name atmosphere with its soft shell brother but instead consists of nylon construction with taped seams throughout for a more water resistant finish . <p> The jacket is heavily ventilated with a large back exhaust vent and arm pit vents to make sure you do n't overheat and keep the air flowing . It also features the handy optic wipe to keep your glasses smear free like the other Atmosphere jacket . It features internal waist adjusters to get a good fit around the bottom but no hood to keep the rain from dribbling down your neck which is n't great with the trail helmet but works brilliantly with the full face helmet . <p> Out on the trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it certainly was pretty warm ! All I had underneath for most of our testing was a thin jersey and after a while I started to feel the sweat building up inside . Not having a hood is a blessing in disguise when wearing the jacket with a full face helmet but it somewhat limits how much use you can have for the jacket when your helmet is n't on your head and your waiting for your mates or having a breather . The cuff design is great with both a velcro adjustment and an elasticated cuff gave a really comfortable fit around your wrists and did n't interfere when wearing gloves . <p> My favourite feature has to be the presstud buckle half way up inside that let 's you ride with the zip undone for maximum air flow but without any flapping as the top of the jacket is still fastened . A truly genius piece of design . <p> Overall the Jacket looks great with its cool understated white on black design . One Industries have certainly got the styling spot on across their entire 2013 range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very lightweight and packable option that is constructed from Ared V02 5000 fabric . It is n't the same level of waterproofness as most of the other jackets we have here on test with a rating of only 5000mm , but not all of the jackets we have can fold as small as this one ! The Struckout jacket neatly folds up entirety into the left hand pocket of the jacket for ultimate storage and portability when out on a ride . <p> The Struckout does n't feature any air vents in the armpits or the rear so I started to feel a bit warm after a short while during test rides , but I personally see this jacket as more of a fold up , emergency heavy rain jacket than an entire epic ride jacket . The only other fault I could find was with the lack of pockets . It only has two front pockets but no internal pockets or gadget pocket with a headphone port to keep your possessions in . <p> Out riding I was definitely left with a feeling this jacket is n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test but nothing else was aimed at this price range ! The Struckout jacket does n't restrict movement on the bike and it 's as light as a feather but if the rain was really hammering down it would n't be too long before you were starting to get wet on the inside . <p> The Struckout is available in a few different colourways . Camo is n't normally my thing but it looks pretty good in the flesh . <p> The hood was a welcome addition when used with a trail helmet and even offered a bit of wind protection around the back of the neck but it was n't so great when used with the full face shuttling runs at the local downhill spot . More of a nuisance . <p> Price wise this one is an absolute bargain with an RRP of 50 but if you act quick its going for 25 in the sale over at www.dare2b.com <p> " Our favourite of the super packable variety available in a great range of colours all at a reasonable price . " <h> Dare2b Mindset Stretch Jacket <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top end jacket from Dare2b . It 's the jacket of choice for MTBCut 's Joe Barnes , so you know it must be good ! It 's constructed from Ared V02 20,000 stretch fabric with taped seams that is both breathable and light weight . <p> It features large arm pit vents for added breath-ability but the zips were tricky to undo while riding . It features a hood that 's just about big enough to fit over your trail helmet of choice , and it even rolls up neatly out of the way and is held by a velcro tab in the back of the neck . The jackets mesh lined throughout and has some very deep pockets on the front and even an internal gadget pocket with a tidy cable routing for your headphones . <p> I would describe the Ared V02 20000 fabric as warm and cosy . Straight from the off as you put it you feel at home with it 's soft touch and non waterproof feel , but when the rain starts falling it will keep you more than dry ! <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop to open the arm pit vents the airflow was definitely making it through inside the jacket to stop me cooking alive . <p> It 's available in this bright green colour we have here and also in black with fluoro-orange zips at an RRP of 100 ... but once again like the other Dare2b jacket the struckout if you act fast its available over at www.dare2b.com for 60 . What a bargain ! <p> Great colours and design constructed from my favourite fabric on show here all at a bargain price . Winner ! <h> Endura Photon Jacket <p> The Endura photon jacket is a super lightweight and ultra packable nylon waterproof jacket with a waterproof and breathability ratings of 10,000mm and 10,000g respectively . It 's of very simple construction with only one pocket on the rear which is just about big enough for your car keys and phone . <p> The photon , like the elementary particle of light it takes its name from , is tiny ! In fact the jacket will pack down to about the same size as a 500ml water bottle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on some basic features . The lack of any pockets on the front is a bit of an annoyance and having absolutely no ventilation ports makes it a bit on the warm side and considerably less breathable than other jackets , even with the fabrics 10,000g breathability score . <p> This jacket offers good coverage on the rear to stop mud getting on the back of your shorts and it incredibly lightweight but the sizing was n't very generous at all , especially around the forearms . Our medium we had on test felt more like a small so it was a bit of a squeeze . <p> In terms of the jackets durability , one crash and it would probably be curtains . The fabric has very little stretch and is quite thin to the touch , so tearing it would be a real possibility . <p> This jacket comes in at an RRP of 69.99 and is distributed in the UK by Endura . <p> " Packs away to virtually nothing , but lacking in basic features such as ventilation and pockets . " <h> Madison Flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison which is their top end offering from the UK 's largest cycle distributors own Clothing range . It 's constructed from a stretchy material that has scores of 20,000mm breathability and 10,000mm waterproofness , so it 's a pretty well specced out jacket ! It has an MP3 pocket on the inside with headphone port to keep all your gadgets out of the rain but annoyingly the pocket is n't really big enough to fit an iPhone 4 in without a fight , never mind any other smartphone out there that 's even bigger ! <p> We are big fans of the Royal blue colour and it looks pretty cool with all other riding gear ! <p> The Flux is covered in pockets and has some of the biggest and most accesible arm pit vents we 've seen on any jacket here on test , so air flow is never an issue and it 's even possible to undo the zips on the fly whilst riding with no hassle . <p> Out riding in the jacket you notice the fit is quite a slim cut and our medium test model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch in the fabric made this less of an issue . The fabric feels absolutely bombproof and feels like it would last for years . I 'm fairly confident that even in the event of a high speed crash your not going to tear or scuff a hole in it . <p> The jacket does n't have a hood so it is a bit of a struggle with the trail helmet but feels at home with the full face helmet . It would be the perfect choice for a wet day racing downhill or on an uplift . <p> The Flux has an RRP of 119.99 and is distributed in the UK by Madison <p> " Impressively bombproof fabric with loads of pockets but its a shame they are all in hard to reach places and a little on the small side . " <h> Sombrio Vapor <p> Our most expensive and final jacket we have here on test is the Sombrio Cartel Vapor Jacket . It comes straight out of Sombrios high end " Freeride " range with a slim fit , perfect for when out riding with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed from a four way stretch S-Tek II with taped seams throughout that feels lightweight and thin to the touch , yet still maintains high levels of waterproofness with a 10000mm waterproof rating and 10,000g breathability to match . <p> The Vapour features an Aquaguard waterproof YKK zip that will run as smoothly as it does today in 5 years time but still an internal storm flap just incase the water should make its way through . The jacket features tidy headphone routing through the pocket with a velcro crocodile clip to keep the headphone in check up around the neck . <p> In the style department this jacket is pretty plain with no real branding on show apart from the zips and cuffs it 's just a plain black high quality waterproof jacket . <p> When actually riding in the jacket it feels very lightweight almost like your wearing a jacket of much less substance than you actually are , which is something not many jackets can pull off ! The cuffs are very comfortable especially without gloves and it offers just the right amount of coverage over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In terms of the arm pit vents they were a struggle to undo while riding but they were very large in size and got good airflow through into the jacket . This was the only jacket with a hood that was comfortable with a full face helmet due to the supple fabrics and thin nature meaning the hood just folds neatly out of the way . <p> It 's very hard to pick one overall winner as each jacket performs so well in its own field . But if pushed to pick a favourite , it would have to be the Dare2b Mindset Stretch . It 's combination of good looks , a fantastic fabric and a cool colour scheme combined with an amazing RRP for all the features never mind the current price you can pick it up in the sale ! the Mindset Stretch is miles ahead of the rest . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , We have our favourite ! <p> Have you got an opinion on the outcome of our review ?

We 've crowdfunded around 30k of this with the rest coming from various sponsors . At this point massive thanks again go to Go Outdoors , Vulcan Engineering , Cotic Bikes , Norton Mayfield Architects and Avanti Conveyors for all their support . What we have managed to achieve is truly amazing , now the hard work begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails we have built , to keep them running well and to show that we can support them . There are already another couple of potential spots identified for further trail building ( we 'll keep schtum about where for now ) but the council , as responsible landowners , in these times of austerity have to be sure that not only can we build trails in partnership with them but also that we can maintain them and keep them safe . Unfortunately , the cash-strapped council ca n't do a huge amount to help so it will fall to us to do that work . <p> We will run dig days and volunteer sessions across the trails we build and manage ( Lady C , Radmires and Greno ) which will help to lessen the burden but with the huge use all of our trails get ( to give you an idea an estimated 3,000 runs on Cooking on Gas in the first month alone ) some of the work requires plant , manpower and expertise that we can not provide with bodies alone . We will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works and this will cost money , lots of money . <p> So to the crux of this post , money , the continued , reliable stream of funding we will need to look after the trails . We 'd estimate that we need to raise 15% of the cost of the build every year to give us enough to maintain the trails day today and build up a buffer to cover large-scale works down the line for rebuilds , post felling repair etc . This would come to around 20k per year . As I said before demonstrating we can do this is critical to getting permission to build further trails in other locations . <p> We started the RADtax idea the same time we launched the Radmires funding campaign and quickly they became one and the same . Maybe now is the time to bring it back to its original purpose . The idea was that it would be used to generate the consistent funding we need . All of our trails are free to ride at point of use , no parking charges or whatever apply so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each lap , each ride causes a little bit of wear or damage that in time needs to be repaired . <p> If each of our Facebook members gave 10 per year we 'd smash the 20k we need . That 's the equivalent of paying to park twice at Llandegla as an example and for that , you 'd get the feeling of knowing you 'd done your bit plus helping to keep Sheffield great . Unfortunately , right now not everyone donates , we do n't reach everyone with the information that we need money , not everyone even understands what Ride Sheffield is or that we are responsible for the trails they ride and this is where we need help and ideas from all of you about what we can do . <p> If we got 20 , 30 or 50 per year per person think what we could do , that kind of money would employ someone ( or more ) full-time to maintain trails and rights of way popular with riders and keep them running sweet all year round . Think what that would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown over by the wind - cleared quickly and back to carving turns , damp bits - drained and filled , the list goes on . That kind of funding would really make a difference , forget the Outdoor Capital we 'd be the Rad riding capital ! <p> So who 's with me ? What can we do ? How can we keep the money flowing in ? Your ideas are welcome ! Let 's help make the unsustainably high stoke sustainable , 1 a week seems like a bargain to me ! <p> Keen to get on board ?

@@106868420 @2268420/ <h> Location Settings <h> Easton EA70 XC 29er Wheelset <p> Average User Rating : <p> The Easton EA70 XC 29 " Wheelset stands out from the pack . This wheelset delivers minimal weight , incredible durability and solid performance at a low cost . The EA70 XC wheel is a full 150-grams lighter than the wheel it replaces ( our XC2 ) , and also features an enhanced rim profile and a welded seam for maximum strength in rough terrain . Another highlight of the EA70 XC : the rim widths have been optimized for each wheels size . Look closely and you 'll notice that the 26-inch version uses an 18-millimeter inner rim width ( 23-millimeter outer ) and the 29-inch version is a full two millimeters wider . That slight difference keeps these wagon wheels strong and true no matter what the trail throws at them .

Its obviously very waterproof and weighs next to nothing and has a reasonably tight cut but those are all things you would expect to find from a trail jacket that comes in at 160 RRP . <p> Its 10,000mm waterproof rating stacks up reasonably well against other jackets out there in the price range . There are cheaper options that offer more a greater waterproof factor such as the Madison Flux Storm jacket but they are nowhere near as lightweight or offer as much maneuverability as the Downpour . <p> Features ... <p> The Downpour has a removable hood that is " fitted " . It comfortably fits underneath a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water droplets running down your neck but would completely zip off when not required . <p> In the ventilation stakes the jacket features a rear vent panel for increased airflow and temperature control as well as two good sized underarm vents for added comfort under both arms which all equates to a good all round ventilation solution and it even has two waterproof zippered hand pockets that are of decent enough size to keep at least . <p> As you find in most MTB focused jackets these days the Downpour features a media pocket with internal headphone routing . The right hand pocket has a seperate orange pocket that can comfortably fit an iPod inside with a crafty hole to feed the headphones up to your ears tangle free ! <p> The jacket most definitely is n't a thermal layer , neither does it ever claim to be that . It 's a very lightweight and waterproof trail jacket .

It 's become the jacket of choice for MoreDirt big boss Carl and its most certainly the jacket he would pack if he was off out on the trail bike . <p> We love the fact that it 's a jacket that does n't necessarily look like a dedicated mountain bike jacket but has as many technical features as this one . It 's even smart enough to wear off the bike down to the pub as long as you like your clothing on the slightly tighter cut side of things . <p> When riding in the Downpour we were surprised by how warm it would actually actually keep you despite its thickness and weight . Initially the thickness and feel of the material had left a doubt in our minds to its ruggedness and warmth but after some heavy crashes in it and plenty of cold winter miles we are 100% sold on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main swing factor here though is without doubt the price .

This new Cree U2 LED bike light 's max output can reach 2200 lumens , which is powered by a 6600mAh battery pack . " <p> This description made for some fairly pleasant reading and got us all quite excited to see how the spiker 1207 performed in the flesh . <p> The light arrived in a great little padded carry case and included a vented helmet strap , a handlebar mount block , an extension cable , mains charger , the light unit and its considerably sizey battery along with some instructions .

The lights body is machined from 6061-T6 Aluminium alloy with some cool styling features and a slick black and red finish that adds a bit of bling . The cable out of the light unit is mounted at the rear on the right hand side of the body . It sticks out from the light at right angles and does n't feel like the most sturdy cable entrance but on our test model it never once faltered . <p> Mounting the light . <p> The actual light unit mounts are reasonably versatile . The vented helmet strap gave a very secure and adjustable fit with the common rubber band solution to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also supplied with a very robust bar clamp that gives a very sturdy fit on the handlebars . My personal preference was to use the simplest rubber band mount for just plain and simple ease of use . Frustratingly to swap between the handlebar mount and headtorch it required a screwdriver and a really pretty fiddly process to swap the mounting plate on the light . <p> The Battery . <p> The battery used to power the Spiker 1207 does pack a hefty 6600mAh , but consequently it is about the same size as a breeze block There is simply no way the battery could ever be mounted to the rear of your helmet as the shear weight of the thing will strain your neck . If you are planning to use the 1207 on your helmet , the only sensible way is to carry the battery in it 's own small trailer you will be forced to tow behind you when out on the trails at night with an extension cable stretching up to power the light In all seriousness the battery is very large and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only real answer . <p> If you are planning to use the light on the handlebars you may be in luck as I feel the batteries primary design is for it to be mounted on the top tube up near the front of the bike with the short cable leading to the handlebar mounted light giving a neat and tidy set up . <p> In Use . <p> Mounted on the handlebars of your bike the 2200 lumen light throws a pretty awesome spread of light a very long way ahead and generally illuminates the trail well . From our experiences the consistent wide spread of the light and battery mounting lends itself more towards handlebar mounting , so for the majority of time during testing that 's where it spent it 's time I did use the light attached on a helmet mount but the weight was an issue and obviously the battery mounting that I eluded to earlier held the spiker back somewhat . <p> In terms of burn time the light always performed well and out lasted the length of my night rides every time but worryingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised 2.7 hours . I conducted the highly technical " iPhone timer to time how long the lights run in the office test " to see how long this light really would last for ! <p> After 55 minutes use the rear LED was showing blue indicating the light only had 70% remaining . After 1 hour 41minutes LED was showing red meaning 40% remaining . After 2 hours 40 it begain flashing red to show the battery had less than 10% remaining and I expected the light to have another 5 minutes maximum before eventually dying .

@@106868478 @2268478/ <h> Review : ODI/Troy Lee Designs Lock On Grips <p> Collaborations within the industry is n't anything new , but when Troy Lee Designs decided to team up with long time grip manufacturer ODI , producers of some of the most popular grips in MTB to produce a new grip , it was worth getting excited about . <p> There are plenty of options when it comes to buying a pair of grips and while they may not determine how your bike handles , finding the right grip can make a big difference to a days riding . Finding the the right grip is much down to personal choice and is worth experimenting with . With my old grips causing me problems on several wet and muddy uplift days , I was keen to get these new grips fitted . <p> The benefits of the partnership between ODI and Troy Lee Designs are quickly clear to see and feel . Between them they have created an all new innovative grip , that features the quality of ODI yet the style and design of Troy Lee Designs . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up right , as you need to pay attention to the helpful left and right markers on the inside end of the grips due to unique unidirectional feature of these grips before you press the clamps on . <p> Taking the time to set up these grips correctly is very important to fully benefit the two main design features which make these grips so unique and effective . There 's the custom shaped flange and the unidirectional grip surface . <p> So how do they perform ? It was inevitable that my first outing would be a wet and muddy one with my new grips , but it is where these grips really excel . The unique undercut pads provide a comfortable feel with plenty of grip , but the grooved channels do an excellent job of preventing water and mud building up . Perfect for UK conditions ! The grip itself does feel a little thicker than most grips I have tried before , but this is really down to personal preference and it is worth trying before you invest in these grips . <p> While the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't feel I really felt these benefits and were prone to damage . After only a couple of months riding these were quickly looking a bit worse for wear . <p> Laser etched reference marks on the inside clamp is a nice touch and useful when trying to line up your grips . The outside clamp is finished off with a laser etched Troy Lee Designs logo which completes the pro look ! <p> Troy Lee Designs and ODI have produced a great looking lock on grip that really performs no matter how bad the weather gets at a great price !
