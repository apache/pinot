The thickness of the pant , cut of the leg and the belt loops really give the look of being a dress pant . The size guide suggested going up size if your measurements fell in-between sizes , but I opted to go a size down since I was in the middle of a new workout program , and I was happy with the fit . <p> I immediately put them to the test the next morning and completed a quick yoga session before going out the door .

I am also the type to change out of my dress pants the moment I get home so that I can put on something more comfortable . With these , I wear them all day and I do n't  want to take them off ! <p> To care for the pants , the washing instructions say to machine wash cold , lay flat to dry or line dry . I had ordered them a bit too long as I was unsure of my pant length , so I washed them in cold water as suggested , but then dried them on high which brought them up about a 1/2 inch ( now they 're perfect ! ) .

The Betabrand dress pant yoga pants hold true to their claims and come in many colors , patterns , and- styles , so I look forward to ordering another pair. - Treat yourself this Holiday Season with the gift of style and comfort you 'll be happy you did !
