@@96020394 @220394/ <h> The 4 components of a reusable mail header <p> Marissa Petteruti March 14 , 2016 <p> Headers are the primary way companies maintain brand consistency in their emails . Having a consistent email header builds trust amongst your subscribers , since it allows them to immediately identify your emails when they open them . For this reason , it 's important that you build a header you can reuse in all the different types of emails you send . <p> 1 . Preheader Text <p> The first component of any email is the preheader text , which will be displayed in the inbox preview of an email and as the first line of text in the email itself . While the content of your preheader text will change from email to email , the formatting should remain consistent . Preheader text should be : <p> Smaller than your paragraph font <p> 2-3 shades lighter than your paragraph font , depending on whether it 's on the background or the content background of the email <p> A concise summary of the email <p> While the preheader text is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it to distract from the rest of your email once a subscriber opens it . <p> 2 . Logo <p> Your logo is the cornerstone of your brand , so it 's essential that it 's featured in your header . The layout of your logo should : <p> Match the layout of your logo on your website if it 's left-aligned on your site , it should be left-aligned in your emails . If it 's centered on your site , it should be centered in your emails <p> Unlike the preheader text , which should be subtle , your logo should mark your email so it 's immediately recognizable to everyone who opens it . <p> 3 . Navigation Bar <p> Below your header , you should have a navigation bar with links . Include : <p> A link to your homepage <p> A link to popular categories ( shoes and clothes , for instance ) <p> A link to your collections ( men 's or women 's , for instance ) <p> For sale emails : a link to the sale page <p> For abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't include more than four links in total , otherwise your navigation bar will be overly crowded . Stylistically , your navigation bar should be offset from both the email and content backgrounds . It should match the styling of the navigation bar on your site , but serve as a condensed version . <p> 4 . Social Links ( Optional ) <p> You can include social links in the header or footer of your emails . If your logo is left- or right-aligned , include your social links in-line , on the opposite side . If your logo is centered , include your social links in your navigation bar . <p> Are there any components of an email header that you think I missed ?

@@96020399 @220399/ <h> The Anatomy of an Email Template <p> Marissa Petteruti February 23 , 2016 <p> I 've already covered the basics of email template layout and how to use- fonts and colors effectively in emails . In this post , I 'm going to discuss the structure of an email , from your preview text to your unsubscribe link . Well work from the top of an email to the bottom . <h> Preheader- Text <p> Your preheader- text , sometimes called the preview- text , is the first component of any email . I 'll delve into how to write an effective preheader- in a future- post . For now , account for an initial line of text at the very top of your email template . This is the text that will be displayed in the inbox preview of your email , after the subject line , so its important that it relays your message to your recipients . Your preheader text shouldnt distract from the content of your email , so use a smaller font- than your paragraph text . To further differentiate it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content background area , and the font color should be a few shades darker than the email background color . <h> Logo <p> Your logo is the main element- you use to define- your brand , so you probably already know that your logo should appear in your email templates . However , - how your logo appears is very important . If your logo is centered on your site , center it in your email templates ; if it 's left-aligned , do the same in your templates . If you 're displaying your logo against the email background color , make sure your logo is n't a clashing- color . The size of the logo in your email templates should be the same as on your site , unless its taller- than 150px . If your logo is more than 150px tall , it will push the core content- of your email below the fold , which will force- recipients to scroll to see it . Since your logo is the cornerstone of your brand , its- also important to make sure that its high resolution you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You probably ca n't fit all the links from your websites- navigation bar in your email template , so include the 3 or 4 most important links . In all your templates , be sure to include is a link to your website 's homepage . After that , if you 're unsure which other links to include , include links to your sites most popular pages . <p> Stylistically , your navigation bar should match your websites . <h> Body <p> The body of an email is the part that is subject to the most variation , since it will change depending on the type of email you 're sending . <p> Email layouts come in two forms : single- or multi-column . Columns allow you to display content side-by-side on desktops , whether it be images , copy , or some combination of the two . On mobile , columns will stack , so its important to keep this in mind when planning their order . <p> Stacking columns on mobile- eliminates the problem of images shrinking on smaller screens to maintain a column layout . There are advantages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the- content and- the email . <p> Multi-column emails are especially great whenever you 're including a series of images or paragraphs , like abandoned carts or emails with an image gallery . <h> - Social Links <p> Below the body section of your email is the footer . Start by including relevant social links or links from your sites navigation bar that did n't  make the first cut , like links to your blog or RSS feed . By including these links- at the bottom of an email , you do n't distract from the other calls to action , but they 're easy to find if a recipient is looking for them . <h> Contact Information , Preferences Link , and Unsubscribe Link <p> - One required piece of information to include in your footer- is your company 's contact information namely your physical address . - This is legally required by the CAN-SPAM Act . Its also helpful to include an email address or phone number for sales or customer support . <p> In every non-transactional email , you should include an unsubscribe link. - Unsubscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you a good web citizen . A common place people look for an unsubscribe link- is at the bottom of an email. - If you 're creating a newsletter template , you should- also include a preferences link in the footer of your email . That way , recipients can simply update their mailing frequency- preferences instead of unsubscribing . <h> Conclusion <p> Use this email structure as a starting point . In my next two posts , I 'll cover best practices for images and copy in- each of these email sections. - <p> If you 'd like to download a higher resolution version of the email template example I went through in this post , click here ! 47562 @qwx907562 
@@96020400 @220400/ <h> The Basics of Email Template Layout <p> Marissa Petteruti February 19 , 2016 <p> Any email marketer will- tell you that a tremendous- amount of work goes into creating a stellar email template . After all , email marketers are n't  graphic designers , even though they sometimes have to be . But fear not : if- you do n't  have the luxury of employing- a graphic designer and are n't  particularly artistically inclined yourself , - there 's still hope . There are some basic aesthetic rules you can follow to ensure that your email templates look great and are consistent with your website. - <h> Starting with a Blank Canvas <p> Every email has a rectangular content area . Because of the limitations of styling and CSS in email clients , the- content area- that contains text and images- must be a rectangle and- have- a fixed width . The width of the content area- should be- between 500 and 700 px . Any wider , and your- recipients may need to scroll- to see the entire- email . Any narrower , and it will appear- condensed- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to choose the background colors of these areas . There are two strategies on how to pick colors for your- email and content backgrounds . <p> Use black or white- for the email and content backgrounds . <p> One point to note is that " pure " black ( hex code #000 ) creates too much of a contrast , so use- a slightly off-black , like #111 or #222 . <p> Use a white content background against a colored- or patterned email background . <p> This will frame the content of the email without creating too stark of a contrast . A good choice for the background color is the primary color of your website , and if you 'd like these colors to match exactly , you 're going to need to know the hex code . W3schools- web color chart- is a useful tool for- finding hex codes or you can download the ColorPick Eyedropper- extension- to grab- hex codes from web pages . If your website has a patterned background or if you 'd like to add texture to your email , either use the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a bolder approach , use a non-repeating image- as the email background . <p> Another , bolder method is- setting a non-repeating image- as your background. - The example above works well because the photo interacts with the content background the puppy looks as though it is peering out from behind the email . In a coming post , well teach you how to format this correctly . <h> Borders <p> Borders frame your content and , if you 're using a white email- and content- background , distinguish- the two from one another . Your border width can range anywhere from 1 to 10 px in the above example , I used a 1 px border . If you 'd like your email to feel like it is truly framed , choose a thicker border . <h> Conclusion <p> Email template design is a broad- topic , so I- will discuss how to choose colors and fonts- in my next- post . The key goal is to maintain brand continuity between your website and your emails , so customers have a consistent experience . <p> Do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 47562 @qwx907562 
@@96020410 @220410/ <h> The 4 Essential eCommerce Emails You Need to Be Sending <p> Janet Aronica July 17 , 2014 <p> With- your eCommerce store up and running , you- may be curious about how to use email marketing to drive more revenue . <p> But you may be at a loss on where to start . <p> Surely you 're somewhat familiar with email marketing already . After all , you get emails from your favorite retailers . But do you know the story behind those campaigns ? What workflows- are you rolled into ? Why ? When every email just seems to be a promotion for the " best sale ever ! ! ! " , it can be unclear what the strategy was- underneath it all- and what the best practices are for this stuff . <p> In this post , well run you through the basics of what an email marketing program could look like for your online store . In addition , well- share some statistics with you about why each of these emails is- critical to the customers buying journey and essential to driving sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great email you can use as an idea starter something that is n't just " the best sale ever ! ! ! " <p> Let 's dive in. <h> #1 Pre-Purchase Engagement Emails <p> Why- theyre- important : 81% of customers do research before making a purchase . ( source ) <p> What to put in these emails : - Classic marketing says that the sale begins with awareness . Awareness usually begins well before your customer signs up for your email list and happens through content marketing , PR , social media , and advertising . Once your customer has signed up for your emails , the next critical stage of the buying journey is education and engagement . The goal of your nurture emails is to get your subscriber to make that first purchase. - In order to do that , you need to teach the customer a little bit about your product . Its all about helping your customers with their pre-purchase- research . <p> When to- send them : At least once a week . <p> An example : - I like this- example from J. Crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few ideas on how to create outfits with the items in their store . Idea builders like this provide the right kind of education that a customer needs before he or she makes a purchase . <h> #2 Abandoned Cart Nurture Emails <p> What to put in these emails : - These emails can be a very effective sales recovery tactic. - The two things to keep in mind about your abandoned cart emails- are to personalize them and to create a sense of urgency . <p> Personalize these emails by recalling the specific product that your customer forgot in the shopping cart and- by pulling in the customers name in the emails subject line . Little touches like this will make your email stand out in the inbox and will make it more likely to get read and clicked on . <p> In terms of creating urgency , do n't  be afraid to send several emails . First of all , people are busy . It sounds pushy , but they might actually appreciate several reminders . Second of all , if they are comparing a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful to remind them of yours through those emails . Another way to create a sense of urgency is to let customers know when you 're running out of inventory for an item they left in the cart . This is a very real reason for taking action and a legitimate reason on your part for reaching out . <p> When to- send them : - No longer than two hours after the shopping cart is abandoned . <p> An example : - This email from Fab.com is a good example of how to personalize an abandoned cart email by recalling the product in the email content . <h> Email #3 Post-Purchase Follow Up <p> Why they 're important : Your chances of repeat purchases increase with each purchase. - A customer who has purchased from you once has a 27% of visiting you again , but a customer who has made three purchases has a 54% chance of returning for the fourth . ( source ) <p> What to put in these emails : - These emails boil down to the importance of- segmented email marketing . You have to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . With this information in your back pocket , you can send emails that make sense . You can send emails that ask the right things of your most engaged customers , and leave those who you 're still building the foundations of a relationship with alone . <p> As for those engaged customers who have purchased from you several times , you can create- email campaigns that encourage them to be a part of your social media communities , request product reviews from them , and- give them early access to new product versions so you can get their feedback . <p> When to send them : - You want to send the email when you know your brand is top of mind for the customer . Within a month of a recent purchase , email open , or site visit makes sense . <p> An example : This example of a product review request email from Zappos is a prime example of a friendly and to-the-point campaign requesting more engagement from an already happy customer . <h> Email #4 Transactional Emails <p> Why- they 're important : 53% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have far higher open rates than any other email . It could be a missed opportunity for brand building and revenue . ( source ) <p> What to- put in these emails : I 'll specifically focus on shipping confirmations here , given that transactional email is a broad topic worthy of its own post ( or book or blog ) . <p> Like I mentioned earlier in the post , people do a ton of research before they make a purchase these days . That means there 's already a lot of anticipation leading up to getting- a- product in the mail . Why not ride that feeling of excitement in your emails to customers and announce each step of the shipping process along the way ? - People love to talk about their incoming purchases on social media . With a more creative , visual , and interactive transactional email , you can encourage customers to talk about your products . <p> When to send them : - As often as possible . The day the purchase is confirmed the day the item ships send a confirmation each step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - I loved getting this email from Warby Parker , which let me know that my glasses were on the way . I waited a long time to get the glasses , and picking them out on the website was a lot of fun . This sweet subject line was kind of like the cherry on top of a great experience . Although I have to admit that I did n't  Tweet about the email as soon as I got it , I- did- feature it in this blog post , right ? <p> What other emails do you consider essential for any eCommerce store ? Let us know in the comments . <p> This article needs love , ecommerce has a ton to learn from the information marketer space in terms of segmentation based campaigns . There is a huge opportunity for marketing funnels with ecommerce stores . Thanks for writing this Janet = <p> Yeah , ecommerce is a real art !

@@96020415 @220415/ <h> Email #1 <p> Your first email should be the shortest of the three and prominently feature 3-6 products . There are several ways you can go about choosing the products you include in your first win-back email : <p> Include personalized product recommendations that will be unique for each customer . <p> Include your bestselling or trending products . <p> Include products from a new collection . <p> Include a hand-picked set of products that you think are your most compelling reasons to return . <p> If a customer has visited a product page since becoming inactive , include this viewed product in your win-back email . One caveat to this is that you should only do it if you 're not already sending browse abandonment emails . <p> Offer an incentive in this email , like 10% off or free shipping . Depending on what subset of your customers you 're sending to , you can change this incentive for instance , you might want to offer a stronger incentive ( 20% off ) to your high-priority customers . To make sure your inactive customers do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject line . <p> Make sure you include an expiration date with your incentive to add a sense of urgency to your email . The amount of time your offer remains valid for should depend on how long you wait between emails in your welcome series . Your customers should still have ample time to purchase after your final email , but they should be under a concrete time restraint . <h> Email #2 <p> Your second email should act as a reminder and reflect the incentive you offered in the first , as well as the sense of urgency . In this email , display a set of products that is different from the one you 've already shown . So , if you used one of the above methods to choose the products in your first email , use a different method to choose the products in your second . <p> Your second email can be a bit longer and act as a summary of what inactive customers have missed since they last purchased from you .

@@96020416 @220416/ <h> Overview of the Double Opt-In Process <h> What is Double Opt-in ? <p> Double opt-in is a process through which a new subscriber must confirm their email address before being subscribed to a given list . <p> When a Klaviyo list has double opt-in enabled , new subscribers will receive a confirmation email immediately after signing up . This email will prompt- them to confirm their subscription . Only subscribers that confirm their subscription will be successfully added to the list . <h> The Double Opt-in Process Visualized <h> Note <p> New subscribers will not get queued up for a welcome series until they have confirmed their subscription via the double opt-in process . <h> Why is Double Opt-In Important ? <p> When you add a sign up form to your site , you are not able to control who decides to take advantage of this form . Even if you add an extra level of email validation , it is n't always possible to ensure subscribers only submit valid or accurate email addresses . Well-intentioned subscribers could simply type their email incorrectly , but spam-bots could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The double opt-in process helps you grow your list while also minimizing abuse and preventing the accumulation of invalid or mistyped emails . This is important because most major email clients ( like Google and Yahoo ) track how recipients interact with emails from your domain -- how many emails are marked as spam , how many are opened , how many bounce , etc . <p> They then use this information to determine whether your emails are classified as spam . This means having a lot of uninterested people or a lot of invalid emails on your list will only hurt your efforts to reach those that actually do want to receive your emails.

@@96020429 @220429/ <h> Basics of Email Template Design <h> Overview <p> Well designed email templates are critical to ensuring that your brand and personality are reflected in every communication with customers and email subscribers. - <p> Creating a base template is a great way to ensure that your emails always look consistent and on-brand . Having a strong series of base email templates will also save you a lot of time as you expand your email marketing . A base template should include your company 's standard fonts , colors , and logos . Each template should also feature a design that reflects the email 's purpose . <p> Once you have a few basic templates designed and saved in your template library , creating compelling emails for any occasion will be much simpler . If you are looking for inspiration , visit the Klaviyo blog . <p> The guide- explains how to approach email template design in Klaviyo . Keep in mind that Klaviyo 's drag and drop- editor makes it easily to build out beautiful and responsive templates . Check out our comprehensive guide to Klaviyo 's drag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Style <p> Through the Klaviyo Setup Wizard , you can establish your company 's standard fonts , colors , and logos . The stylistic settings you establish in the Setup Wizard will automatically be applied across all existing and new email templates you create in Klaviyo . <p> - <p> When you choose a color scheme for your base templates , consider the color scheme already leveraged for your brand - on your website , in your logo , etc . Departing from this color scheme may confuse your email recipients , while sticking with an established set of colors in your emails can help build brand recognition . <p> What if you are n't sure how to identify the exact colors that match your logo/website ? When picking colors in Klaviyo , you will notice that each color comes along with a code in the format of #XXXXXX . Hexadecimal numbers are used on web pages to set colors . There are many tools available online that can instantly identify the hex code for any color on a webpage . <p> A few tools to consider : <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Color Picker <p> For Firefox : colorPicker <p> Regarding use of color , you will want to consider the following : <p> Email Background <p> Content Background <p> Text Color <p> To make your emails easy to read , consider sticking with black and white for your background colors , and adding in pops of color through your headers , footers , headlines , and - of course - images . If you are going to use the same color for your email and content background , you can add a border to anchor your content . You can also use a simple repeating pattern as your Email Background . <p> You can adjust all template-wide settings for your email by navigating to the Styles tab on the left-hand navigation menu : <p> The Email section is where you can set Email Background and Content Background , as well as set a border for your email <p> The Text section here controls normal or paragraph text <p> The Links section is where you can update the styles that will be applied to all hyperlinked text <p> The Heading 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-formatted headers ; if you use a specific color for different headings on your website , you 'll likely want to use the same styles here <p> These eight- template designs represent best practice layouts that can be customized and recycled for a robust email marketing strategy . We recommend using these templates as a starting point as you work to build your own branded base template library . <h> Optimizing for Engagement <p> Keep in mind that with a template layout , less is often more . This is especially true when mobile viewing is a consideration . We recommend sticking to three columns max , and keeping your emails short and sweet . A few reasons why size matters : <p> When you curate the perfect amount of content for each email , you 're sending from a position of power - you know you have something relevant and interesting to share that will resonate with your audience . Do n't weaken this position by padding your message with more content that will distract from the email 's purpose . <p> Too much content turns into an infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a reader making a quick decision to stop reading and move on ; studies show that users , on average , spend about 51 seconds engaging with a newsletter email and only 19% of newsletters are read in full - 35% of the time , readers merely glance at the email 's content . <p> If you pull in a lot of content , and use a significant number of images , the placement of your call-to-action ( i.e. a Buy Now button ) really matters ; if your call-to-action is near the bottom of your email , you will likely see your engagement levels suffer . <p> Some other tips to improve engagement follow : <p> User preheader text . You will notice that all of Klaviyo 's default templates include a text block at the very top with one line of text . Preheader text , sometimes called preview text , is the first component of any email . Preheader text is aptly named , as this is simply the first text that appears in your email - - a recipient will see this text directly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By accounting for the initial line of text at the very top of every email template , you can help your emails stand out in a crowded inbox . <p> Center your content around a clear call-to-action ( CTA ) . The purpose of each email you send may vary - one may encourage recipients to browse a certain area of your website , another might be focused on driving revenue around a particular item , while another might have a goal of generating more social media follows . If your email has a goal to prompt a specific action , do n't forget to actually prompt readers to take the action . With only 19% of all newsletter emails being read in full , a clear action step near the top of an email is crucial . You can use a button , link an image , or leverage styled hyperlinked text . The key here is to use " active language " to encourage your readers to take a decisive action ( i.e. BUY NOW , VIEW ITEM , FOLLOW US NOW ) . <p> Consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move quickly downward . This is called the " F Pattern " and this study provides much more detail around scanning behaviors . By placing your most eye-catching and engaging content on the left-hand side ( i.e. intriguing images , powerful statements in bold ) you can nudge your readers to continue reading . Furthermore , by placing need-to-know details and your email 's CTA in a strategic location near the top of your template , you 're more likely to see high conversion rates . <p> Find a balance between images and text in your emails . Emails that consist solely of images ( or are super image-heavy ) trigger spam filters - this means it 's important to make sure your emails contain a combination of images and text . Spammers have evolved and started using images as a way to avoid spam trigger words , but ISPs have evolved faster . Email on Acid found that your emails should contain at least 500 text characters in order to dodge spam filters. - <h> Other Resources <p> Still looking for inspiration ?

@@96020438 @220438/ <h> The Psychology of Why People Open Emails <p> Ever wondered why people open emails ? Between work emails , retailer subscriptions , and newsletters , your subscribers inboxes are certainly not lacking in content to read . <p> What makes someone click open on your content , in particular ? <p> Lots has been written and discussed about this . There 's the time of day , subject line tricks , and even best practices for your preview text . But one thing I have n't seen covered is the psychology around email opens . <h> When People Open Emails <p> Research shows that most people read their emails during the work day between the hours of 8 am and 10 am , and then again during the hours of 3pm and 4pm . <p> Email open rates show a slight uptick between 8pm and 10pm . <p> When you think about someones typical workday , these trends should n't surprise you at all . People go to work , and what 's usually the first thing they do ? They open their email . <p> By 5pm or 6pm they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids and putting them to bed ( I do n't  know how parents get it all done ! ) . But later in the evening they may go back online to finish more work and check email again . Hence , open rates pick up slightly again at 8pm and 10pm . <p> But with all this email checking , which certainly includes a little bit of checking of retailers emails and Groupons , one has to wonder : are we working hard or hardly working ? <h> Procrastination <p> At its core , procrastination is about creating a comfort zone and avoiding pain . <p> Think about something that you 've been avoiding . Really , really think about it , and concentrate on the feeling it conjures up . Its likely that thinking about doing that task feels unpleasant . That 's why you avoid it . <p> This scrapes the surface of why people are looking to do something other than real work , and what purpose email serves in peoples lives . <h> Distraction and Anxiety <p> Dr. Larry Rosen is a professor of psychology at California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying our use of technology . <p> One of his recent pieces of research looked at social media use among more than 1,000 people from four different generations . He found that , especially among young people , chronic checking of social media sites was driven either by anxiety or pleasure . But , more often than not ( the ratio , he says , was about 3:1 ) it was driven by anxiety . <p> " I think that what is driving our behavior of constantly checking in with our technology regardless of whether we have received an alert or notification " an external interruption " or we are musing about missing out on something in our virtual social world " an internal interruption " is akin to an obsession or compulsion , both of which are anxiety-driven issues . - We have not sunk to the level of a- psychiatric- disorder like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder but we are not far away . Just watch people in the world around you . If you are watching a young person who is not looking at his or her phone keep watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or purse , most likely without having gotten an alert or notification but being driven by a combination of pleasure and anxiety . " <p> Clicking for fun or compulsion ? <p> In related research , Dr. Rosen looked specifically at the social media usage among teens . Rosen and his team- observed nearly 300 middle school , high school and university students studying something important for 15 minutes in their natural environments. - They were interested in finding out whether the students- could maintain focus and , if not , what might be distracting them . The researchers- noted exactly what the students were- doing , if they were texting , if they were checking Facebook , etc . <p> The results : - The students were only able to concentrate- on average for three minute spurts . <p> When asked about why they veered off task , students explained that whenever they got an alert from- a beep , a vibration or a flashing image , they feel compelled or drawn to attend to that distraction . The things they wondered : <p> So , basically , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we check these things constantly- because were anxious to find out what 's on the other side of that click . <p> And then , to take that a step further the- anxiety we seek to soothe through chronic social media checking seems similar to another aspect of psychology that 's frequently used in marketing curiosity . <h> Curiosity <p> The Information GapGeorge Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon offers one of the leading theories on the topic , known as the " information-gap " theory . Through this theory , he- believes that curiosity proceeds in two basic steps : <p> A- situation reveals a painful gap in our knowledge ( a new email ) <p> We- feel an urge to fill this gap and ease that pain ( open the email ) <p> Curious individuals seek to obtain that missing information to eliminate that feeling of deprivation . If this is true , then curiosity is n't much different than other human needs like hunger . Its deeply troubling at the onset ( hangry ! ) , but its relief is very satisfying ( yum ! ) <h> Making Your Emails Useful In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep these things in mind when creating your emails to make them most useful to your audience . <p> 1 .

Consider , for example , the magic of Amazons shipping confirmation emails . They have one clear call to action ( track your package ) . With just one click , they allow you to get into the website , do that , get out , and get back to work . <p> Marketing does n't  have to be manipulative .

@@96020442 @220442/ <h> Integrate &amp; Send Data <h> API References <h> Email Design <h> Server-Side API Overview <p> The Server-Side API is composed of the Identify API and the Track API . These APIs are used for tracking people and the events or actions they do . For instance , tracking when someone is active on your website , when a purchase is made or when someone watches a video . They are optimized for low latency and high numbers of requests , so they do not adhere to the same REST principles our other APIs use . <p> If you are planning on a full ecommerce integration , please see this guide . <h> Libraries <p> The Track and Identify APIs are most commonly accessed with our JavaScript library . Use our step-by-step guide to get started tracking people and events on your website . <h> API Endpoint <p> https : //a.klaviyo.com <h> Summary of Resource URL Patterns <p> /api/track <p> /api/identify <h> Request and Response Formats <p> The Server-Side APIs use the same request and response formats . Requests are made with a GET request to the specified endpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base64 and JSON encoded string . The contents of the JSON dictionary or hash are different for each API , so the the documentation below will focus on that . If you 're using one of our language libraries to send data , they automatically handle properly encoding data before making requests . <p> Responses from requests made to the Analytics APIs return either 1 , for success , or 0 , for failure . Keep in mind API requests are processed asynchronously , typically in less than a second , so when a request returns there might be a very seconds before data appears inside Klaviyo . In certain cases , such as pixel tracking , it may be better to return a blank pixel than a success or failure message . In those cases , you can always return a blank pixel by adding a GET parameter i=1 to your request . <h> Requests <p> Formatted as base64 , JSON encoded strings . <h> Responses <p> 1 Success <p> 0 Failure <h> About Examples <p> For each example , we include what the dictionary or hash would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like . <h> Track API <p> The main Events API endpoint is /api/track , which is used to track when someone takes an action or does something . It encodes the following data in a dictionary or hash : <p> token <p> string <p> This is your public API key . <p> event <p> string <p> Name of the event you want to track . <p> customerproperties <p> hash/dictionary <p> Custom information about the person who did this event . You must identify the person by their email , using a $email key , or a unique identifier , using a $id . Other than that , you can include any data you want and it can then be used to create segments of people . For example , if you wanted to create a list of people on trial plans , include a person 's plan type in this hash so you can use that information later . <p> properties <p> optional , hash/dictionary or null <p> Custom information about this event . Any properties included here can be used for creating segments later For example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could include a property for item type ( e.g. image , article , etc . ) . <p> time <p> optional , UNIX timestamp or null <p> When this event occurred . By default , Klaviyo assumes events happen when a request is made . If you 'd like to track and event that happened in past , use this property . <p> If you only want to track the first occurrance of an event and ignore subsequent events , you can use /api/track-once . It uses the same request format as /api/track . <h> Special Event Properties <p> There are a few special properties you can optionally include when tracking an event . All of these belong in the " properties " dictionary . They are : <p> $eventid <p> an unique identifier for an event <p> $value <p> a numeric value to associate with this event ( e.g. the dollar value of a purchase ) <p> If you do n't specify $eventid , it will default to the timestamp of the event . In practice , you should send an $eventid if you have an unique identifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You should also set the $eventid if you expect certain events to occur at the same point in time . This can happen when someone takes one action which you will split into multiple events . For example , if someone purchases multiple items and you want to record one event for each item purchased . <h> Identify API <p> The Identify API endpoint is /api/identify , which is used to track properties about an individual without tracking an associated event . It encodes the following data in a dictionary or hash : <p> token <p> string <p> This is your public API key . <p> properties <p> hash/dictionary <p> Custom information about the person who did this event . You must identify the person by their email , using a $email key , or a unique identifier , using a $id .

@@96020453 @220453/ <h> Weather Powered Email <p> At Klaviyo , we 're focused on creating and delivering the best email experience by treating each email recipient individually . Instead of blasting out the same email to everyone , brands would be better off if each person received a personalized email . One interesting aspect of Klaviyo is finding unique ways to personalize emails . <p> For example , one type of data you could incorporate into emails is information about the local weather . Everyone wakes up in the morning and immediately notices if it 's raining or sunny , if it 's hotter or cooler than usual . So let 's build a small newsletter that personalizes emails based on the weather in someone 's area . <h> The Spec <p> Using the Python web framework of your choice ( we use Django , but you can use another one if you prefer ) , create a newsletter sign up page that allows someone to enter their email address and choose their location from a list of the top 100 cities in the US by population . Once they submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in a database and a confirmation message or page should be displayed . Keep in mind , the same email address should only be allowed to sign up once . <p> Then create a Django management command or a Python script to send a personalized email to each email address in the list . For each recipient , the script should fetch the current weather for that recipient 's location and change the subject of the email based on the weather . If it 's nice outside , either sunny or 5 degrees warmer than the average temperature for that location at that time of year , the email 's subject should be " It 's nice out ! Enjoy a discount on us . " Or if 's it 's not so nice out , either precipitating or 5 degrees cooler than the average temperature , the subject should be " Not so nice out ? That 's okay , enjoy a discount on us . " If the weather does n't meet either of those conditions , it 's an average weather day and the email subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In all cases the email should be sent to the recipient 's entered email address and come from your email address . <p> To look up a recipient 's weather by their location , you can use the free Wunderground API . <p> The body of the email can be formatted however you like . It should contain a readable version of the recipient 's location along with the current temperature and weather . For example , " 55 degrees , sunny . " ( For extra flair , include an image or animated GIF of the current weather . ) <h> Testing <p> When you 're ready , subscribe the following email addresses with the following locations to your newsletter and send out your newsletter . Once you 've done that , send a zip/archived project file to weatherapp@klaviyo.com and we 'll find a time to review the code together for 15-20 minutes . <p> Email Address <p> City <p> **26;65;TOOLONG <p> Anchorage , AK <p> **26;93;TOOLONG <p> Austin , TX <p> **26;121;TOOLONG <p> Boston , MA <p> **26;149;TOOLONG <p> Seattle , WA <p> **26;177;TOOLONG <p> Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few things you 'll want to keep in mind while you 're building this app : <p> Security How does your app handle invalid or even malicious input from users ? <p> Re-Usability What components of your app would make sense to be their own modules or services so they can be re-used by other sections of code later ? <p> Re-Inventing the Wheel ?

@@96020455 @220455/ <h> Q&amp;A with Fan Bi , CEO of Blank Label <p> Marissa Petteruti April 1 , 2016 <p> I spoke with Fan Bi , the CEO of Blank Label , an award-winning custom menswear brand , to learn more about his marketing strategy and how he uses Klaviyo to increase email revenue and expand brand awareness. - Since its foundation in 2010 , Blank Label has shipped over 100,000 custom garments to customers all over the world , and has just opened a new store in Washington D.C.- <p> How has your email marketing revenue increased since using Klaviyo ? What were you doing for email marketing before Klaviyo ? <p> " The game-changer for Blank Label was going from regular , en masse email campaigns to doing detailed segmenting and sending different messages to different customers based on their behavior . When we switched over from MailChimp and started doing segment-based email marketing , we immediately noticed a much higher open rate and click-through rate . " <p> What percentage of your annual revenue can be attributed to email marketing ? <p> " Over half of our revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate with our existing customer base is via email . Our customers do n't  engage with brands on social media , but they live in email all day . " <p> As a marketer , what do you find most difficult to do in your day to day ? How has Klaviyo helped alleviate these difficulties ? <p> " Blank Label takes more of a brand marketing approach than direct marketing approach . We aim to create messages that are brand positive first , and revenue positive second , which is why we do n't  run sales . With all the analytics available today , its easier than ever to figure out what marketing campaigns are working . But in a brand marketing world , we still need to be looking for leading indicators . For example , even if an email campaign did n't  get a lot of purchases , if it got a lot of clicks , its still successful because it shows a strong engagement with the content . " <p> When it comes to email marketing , what are some must-have features for you ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . This feature allows us to create a segment of customers , e.g. people who have n't purchased in a year , and send them an email ( or series of emails ) every time someone enters that segment . " <p> I know you have two brick and mortar stores do you use Klaviyo in conjunction with your point of sale system ? <p> " On a foundational basis , we have a different list for each of our stores , one for our Boston store , one for Washington , D.C. , and one for our ecommerce store . Depending on where the customer makes the purchase , our point-of-sale speaks to Klaviyo and tags each of our customers with a location . " <p> As your business has grown , have you changed your email marketing strategy ? If so , how ? <p> " The longer were around , the more rich our customer data set becomes . Weve been adding new products , new store locations , and more , so were able to create complex segments . For example , we can create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or havent purchased in a long time . We can segment based on whether someone has bought shirts but not suits , or pants but not jackets . We also segment based on a number of factors if they 've been to our Boston store but havent purchased online , for instance . In addition to email campaigns , Klaviyo is just a really easy way for anyone non-technical on our team to query our database and see how many customers have done x and y versus a and b . ' " <p> For your business in particular , how important is mobile optimization ? Do you find that a lot of your customers interact with your emails on mobile ? Is this number growing ? <p> " This has been a big shift since we 've been in business over the last six years . We did a major website redesign last year to make the website responsive to browser size , so our site looks great on large desktops , smaller laptops , tablets , or phones . Moreover , we now design emails for mobile-first , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking how our emails looked in mobile . " <p> Are there any marketing venues that you 've found particularly effective that you did n't expect to ? <p> " When coming up with a marketing strategy , we think about where our target customer is . Even though most of the Blank Label team is personally on more up-and-coming marketing venues like Snapchat , we do n't  believe our customer is , so instead we go where he likes to hangout . And that 's often offline . We do a lot of events and partner with organizations such as the Tiger Woods Foundation , Ritz Carlton , and Big Brothers Big Sisters . " <p> What advice do you have for ecommerce brands that are just starting out ? <p> " Try to grow organically . Whether that 's pitching bloggers and journalists , search engine optimization , or customer referrals , its very hard starting out to be able to be profitable doing paid customer acquisition , namely Google Adwords or Facebook Ads . Growing organically is a great litmus test if your business has legs , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or customers are n't  interested in returning or referring , youve probably got something more fundamental to figure out before hitting up paid marketing .

For some businesses , you are losing a lot of money . <p> From what I 've seen , companies tend to fall into one of three buckets regarding customer lifecycle marketing emails : <p> They do n't send them because they think customers will find them annoying . <p> They do n't send them because they do n't think the value of setting them up will outweigh the cost in terms of time . <p> They send too many and those have limited impact on customers . <p> These are n't acceptable buckets to fall in. - In each of these cases , they can know the answer by testing and then measuring what happens . <p> Here are 5 steps to help you get started : <p> Step 1 : Implement something . <p> If you are reading this and have n't put anything in place , stop immediately and go identify a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is everyone who used to be very active but has n't been recently. - - If you 're worried about putting too much time into , focus on the simplest group possible and do n't worry about automating it . <p> Step 2 : Pick a group as a baseline <p> In short , you want a group who let 's you know what would happen if you did n't implement the email you are planning on sending . For many of us , a great starting point is to just use what 's happened historically as this benchmark . <p> Over time , you probably want to consider holding out a set of customers as a control group who joined at the same time , from the same channels , etc . It 's not worth worrying about perfecting this at first . <p> Focus on multiple metrics " sales , profit , site visits , unsubscribes , purchase size , etc . Even if a customer does n't change their buying or usage patterns immediately , you want to see if there are related positive ( or negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just what 's immediate. - Because it 's easier to track , too many companies focus just on the impact they see from clickthroughs , but you really care about what happens over the next 7 , 14 or even 30 days . <p> The simplest way to do each of these is to look at average performance of customers at different times frames " 24 hours after email , 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , 30 days " of both the customers who received the email and those who didn't. - Over time , you 'll want to get more accurate and detailed about this , but this is a good starting point that will likely get you 80% of the right answer . <p> Step 4 : Measure Qualitatively <p> It 's also worth identifying a random subset of customers and having quick conversations with them . The goal is to better understand the customer impact but also to generate new hypotheses about emails or approaches they might find helpful. - Something to keep in mind is that what people say does n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of their ads , they found that people reported not liking them when explicitly asked , but they also reported being happier on pages with ads than those without ads . <p> A final note we have seen that offering a small token of appreciation ( gift certificate , shirt , etc ) helps engage people more quickly than otherwise. - Depends on your business , but if you 're struggling with low response rates , might be worth considering . <p> Step 5 : Automate <p> If it worked , go ahead and implement it. - If you 're unsure , increase the size of the group or modify the email to try to create a test that you 'll be more certain about . <p> Summary <p> The main barrier is sending the first email . Measurement is a great way to figure out what 's working , but if you take it too far , it too can become a barrier to getting started . Good enough actually does tend to be a great place to start " once you know how your first efforts went , you can focus on optimization later .

The fact that I , and every member of the Klaviyo team , can help our customers deliver better results for their companies tops that list . I 'm incredibly proud to play even a small part in the success of their business . And I know how important Black Friday and Cyber Monday are to every retailer , which is why we invested a lot of time preparing and testing our infrastructure to prepare for the start of the holiday marketing season . <p> But despite those preparations , we fell short . We delivered a poor experience on one of the most important days of the year . I 've apologized and sent this note to all of our customers , but I 'm also sharing it publicly because I want to make sure our community at large understands what happened , and what we 've done to prevent it from happening again . <p> There were three types of issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , app accessibility , and event processing delays . <p> Email sending delaysWe were equipped to process 10x our average sending volume over the holiday weekend . On Monday morning around 9am , we noticed email sending was not progressing as quickly as expected , and we started adding additional capacity immediately . Campaigns sent between approximately 9am and noon ET on Monday , however , may have experienced sending delays of up to 5 hours . I would like to reassure you that all campaigns sent on Cyber Monday were delivered . I understand how time sensitive promotions are , particularly on Cyber Monday , and the delays we experienced were unacceptable . <p> Application accessibilityAround 11am ET on Monday , the capacity we added to improve email sending led to a spike in hits to one of our databases , and we started experiencing some connectivity issues . That resulted in parts of the Klaviyo UI being inaccessible for up to one hour . This did not impact any scheduled campaigns or flows , and we were able to resolve it by adding capacity to the impacted database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a backup in analytics processing in the Klaviyo application . This led to issues across reporting , AB testing , and segment processing : <p> On the reporting side , the fact that events were taking longer than usual to process meant that campaign and flow performance reporting was not real-time . Things like opens , clicks , and sales all appeared to be lower than they actually were . This has been resolved , and the results from yesterday 's campaigns are now accurate . <p> Because reporting was delayed , this issue also led to problems with selecting a winner for A/B tests sent between 11am and 2pm ET yesterday . All emails sent via A/B tests were delivered . However , for some campaigns selecting the winning variation was delayed up to 5 hours . A few A/B campaigns did not have engagement data a few hours into the test and so a winning variation was chosen randomly to send the rest of the campaign . <p> I 'm confident that the updates we 've made in the last 24 hours will set us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season .

This is because these blocks only work for emails sent by Klaviyo . <h> Create a Product Feed <p> Go to the Data Feeds tab in Klaviyo , and click on the blue button that says Add Product Feed . - If you have one of our built-in ecommerce integration enabled , popular and trending product feeds are automatically created for you. - <p> After you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of weighting you 'd like for your feed . There are three options : Unweighted , Popular , and Trending. - <p> You can also configure a feed such that it is limited to ( and will exclude ) certain categories : <p> Include : Item must be in at least one listed category to show up in the feed <p> Exclude : Item must be in none of the listed categories to show up in the feed <p> When there is a conflict , exclude takes priority over include , as we err on the side of not showing something that you do n't want customers to see . <h> How Product Feeds Work <p> There are two components when it comes to how we sort and present product recommendations : a personal recommendation engine and a weighting system . <p> Any products that do not have images associated with them will get filtered out automatically . For each email recipient , we will automatically also filter out products the recipient has purchased in the past . If products are out of stock , Klaviyo will consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these products in your feeds . <p> Popularity is calculated by dividing the number of times a specific product was bought by the total number of products sold over the period of last 90 days . This means a new surge in a single product may not impact a product feed immediately . <p> Items that an individual has already purchased will- not be displayed in a product feed , regardless of whether or not personalized recommendations are turned on . <h> Personal Recommendation Engine <p> Based on past purchasing data , we look at how similar the email recipient is compared to the other users in the dataset . Then we come up with a recommendation score for each product and sort the products based on this score . <p> Personalized recommendations are based entirely on past purchase behavior . For example : <p> User A orders Product 1 , Product 2 , and Product 3 <p> User B orders Product 1 and Product 2 <p> In this example , recommendations for User B will show Product 3 . <p> If a user has never placed an order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed rather than a personalized recommendation . Whenever there is n't enough data available to generate customized recommendations , the general settings of the feed will prevail . <h> The Weighting System <p> UnweightedThere is no sorting priority . If you have the personal recommendation engine turned off or if you are a free account user , this option means a randomized product mix . We recommend this option if you have a sizable amount of products and a lot of transactional activity . If you have very few products and/or have little transactional activity , you will want to use a different weighting system . <p> Popular Products FirstPopularity is calculated by dividing the number of times a specific product was bought by the total number of products sold over the period of last 90 days. - <p> Trending and recently popular products firstSimilar to how we calculate popular products , but we give more weight to products that are bought frequently recently . This is also calculated over the period of 90 days . It 's possible that if you have two products that are equally popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than product B over the last 90 days , product B will be shown as trending higher. - <p> After we have these two scores , we then assign different weights to them and come up with a composite score . This score determines the final order of products shown in product feeds . <p> This is great for if you want to send out the campaign to people who 've bought your products and people who just signed up for your mailing list . We will personalize the feeds for those who purchased previously and show the most popular items to those who have not yet bought anything. - <h> Using a- Product Block <p> The Product Block in Klaviyo provides two ways for users to populate buyable items from their product catalog into an email template : <p> Populate from Feed : - Klaviyo will populate products into your template- dynamically at send time , where items are curated from a pre-defined product feed . <p> Select from Catalog : Want to choose your own items to feature ? We make it easy to browse your entire product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicks . <p> When you add a product- block , and choose the " populate from feed " option , you will have the option to enable the personal recommendation engine and send more targeted emails to your recipients . If you have personal recommendation option turned off , product recommendation will depend completely on the weighting system of the feed . If you have the personal recommendation option turned on , a recommendation is determined by both the more advanced personal recommendation algorithm and the weighting system . <p> If you are using a feed , and you want each product , when clicked , to redirect to a URL that is different from your integrated store 's URL , you will have to manage this from within your ecommerce platform . For Shopify users , you can navigate to Shopify 's Domains- panel and force all domains to be redirected to your alternative domain . While links from Klaviyo will still start with the root domain , recipients will be re-directed in real time to the same product pages but with your alternative domain .

While most resources we find give strong examples of onboarding flows people like , they do n't do much to address the question of how you build a great onboarding flow and then iterate on it over time. - After all , what makes a great onboarding flow ? - And how do you know as soon as possible whether onboarding is working ( before customers disappear and churn ) ? <p> As we 've thought about this question , we believe there 's a key part of the conversation missing : what data should companies be using to evaluate their onboarding flow and any iterations they make ? - Waiting to see differing churn rates may take too long , and be too difficult to read without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime ? <p> As a start , we propose three metrics as crucial starting points ( and we 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments on what you 've found to be effective ) : <p> How much time passes before setup is completed ? - Is it measured in hours ? In days ? For several startups I 've talked to , there seems to be a clear point by which if a user has n't setup the application , they probably are n't going to. - Keeping track of the gap between sign-up and setup completion can be invaluable for planning outreach to customers who are nearing that dangerous <p> How frequently do new users login ? - Are users actually logging in ? Do successful users login once a week ? What 's their ramp-up curve ? - This answer surely differs for each site , but your goal is to know what makes a successful user , and then to provide the support and outreach to make sure your users get there. - If you see a user with too few logins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be a sign that you are missing something in your onboarding flow . <p> What key features are hit by successful users ? - Are your best users those who hit certain features ? Say you are Facebook " is it crucial that new users post a photo album ? Or is it really their first status item that makes them loyal ? - Knowing the answer to questions like this helps you both better design your flow , but also to better understand how particular users are doing in the onboarding process . <p> In short , we propose tracking ( at a minimum ) the following metrics by user : <p> When setup was completed ( and the length of time since sign-up ) <p> Logins and when they happened ( not just last login ) <p> Which key features are used <p> Once you have this data , you 'll be able to much more easily see how onboarding is going , but you 'll also be able to assess the impact of any changes you 've made to your onboarding flow ( via a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a future post ) . - At the end of the day , if your onboarding flow is n't leading to more usage , more retention , and more value for your users " it probably does n't matter how perfect you think it is.

Every time you go into your account , you see lots of information about the emails you 've been sending : What 's performing well ? What needs to be optimized ? And most of all , how much money is email generating for your store ? <p> But maybe you 've wondered about what other ecommerce stores are seeing in their accounts . What if you could get a look into their email marketing metrics too ? How about for , say , a thousand of our U.S.-based customers in the aggregate ? Well , there 's good news : now you can . <p> Today marks the official launch of our ecommerce industry benchmark report .

@@96020510 @220510/ <h> Create a Segment <h> Overview <p> Unlike traditional subscriber lists , segments are defined by a set of conditions . Klaviyo 's segment builder allows you to create dynamic cross-sections of your contacts that will update in real-time . A few examples of useful segments you may want to build : <p> A- segment of customers that purchase a new product before that product even- goes to market , so you can watch the segment grow after launch <p> Isolate your inactive subscribers by finding those who have been on your list for at least 6 months but have never opened or clicked an email <p> Build a segment of your VIP customers , which includes everyone who has purchased at least X number of times before or have spent over Y amount of money <p> Analyze the lifetime value ( LTV ) of your customer-base- by creating segments that capture different ranges of total spending <h> Create a Segment <p> After clicking- Create a Segment , you 'll be taken to the segment builder . <h> Note <p> Depending on the size of your segment , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning on sending a campaign to a segment , please allow time for your segment to populate before scheduling the email . <h> Condition : What Someone Has/Has Not Done <p> This condition allows you to segment profiles based on their activity . If you explore the- Metrics- tab of your account , you will see all of the activity Klaviyo tracks through your different integrations . All of these metrics are available for segmentation using the- What someone has done ( or not done ) - condition . <p> For example , you can find all customers that have made at least two purchases : <p> As you explore this condition , you can adjust and filter the following aspects of the metric you select : <p> Frequency : - After selecting an activity , you can segment based on how often ( or not often ) people have done the activity. - The allowed operators are : <p> at- least once <p> zero times <p> equals ( is exactly the number specified ) <p> does n't equal ( is not exactly the number specified ) <p> is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than <p> is less than <p> is at most ( less than or equals ) <p> Timeframe : - After choosing a frequency , you will also need to select a timeframe- over which we 'll count the number of events for each person . The options here are : <p> over all time <p> in the last ( within the last X days , weeks or months ) <p> between ( between- two relative dates i.e. between 30 and 90 days ago ) <p> before ( before- a specific date ) <p> after ( after- a specific date ) <p> between dates ( between- two specific dates ) <p> If you click the- Add Filter- button , you can further hone which types of events are counted . All metrics- have a unique set of properties associated with them , and- you can leverage these properties to be more specific about who you capture in your segment . <p> For example , if you have an- Ordered Product- metric that represents each time some purchases a product , you might want to filter on the " Name " property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condition : Properties about Someone <p> This condition allows you to filter based on profile properties , i.e. the information you 've collected on your contacts in Klaviyo . Out-of-the-box , Klaviyo you can use the following profile properties to build a segment : <p> City <p> Country <p> Email- <p> First Active <p> First Name <p> Initial Source <p> Last Active <p> Last Name <p> Organization <p> State /- Region <p> Unique I 'd <p> Zipcode <p> As you collect additional information about your contacts ( i.e. custom properties ) , you will be able to use this information to build segments . For example , if you collect data on " Gender " from your newsletters subscribers , you will be able to segment based on gender . <p> After selecting a profile property for segmentation , you will also be able to select an operator. - The options available will depend on the data type of the property. - Below are the operators for string properties : <p> equals <p> does n't equal <p> contains ( property value contains the string specified ) <p> does n't contain ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in ( property value is in a set of values ) <p> is not in ( property value is not in a set of values ) <p> starts with ( property value starts with the string specified ) <p> does n't start with <p> ends with ( property value ends with- the string specified ) <p> does n't end with <p> is set ( property exists for the profile ) <p> is not set- ( property does not- exist- for the profile ) <p> After choosing a property and an operator , the final piece is the dimension- value . When you click , this value field will populate with a drop-down menu that features all available values given the property , operator , and data type selected . <p> If the property you select contains values that are numbers or dates , make sure to adjust the data type appropriately . Doing so will reveal type-specific operators and this will impact the values available for segmentation . <p> Below are the data types available : <p> String : - string value of plain text <p> Number : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - true or false value <p> List : - array of values , e.g.- " Offer1 " , " Offer2 " <h> Condition : If Someone is In or Not In a List <p> This condition can be used- to segment if someone is a member of ( or not a member of ) a specific list . This is an important condition to use if you are sending newsletter emails to a segment , since you 'll always want to make sure these recipients subscribed to your newsletter list before emailing them . Here are a few other key use cases for this condition : <p> If you want to combine two or more lists , you can configure a segment to include everyone in these lists using this condition once for each list ; make sure to separate each condition with an " OR " connector <p> If you want to create a segment of a specific list that captures a cross-section of that list ; for example , the following segment will curate everyone in your newsletter List from the United States : <p> When segmenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can filter based on when that person was added to the list : <p> in the last ( within the last X days , weeks or months ) <p> between ( two relative dates ) <p> before ( a specific date ) <p> after ( a specific date ) <p> between dates ( two specific dates ) <h> Condition : - If Someone is or is Not Suppressed <p> Segments do not automatically exclude profiles that are suppressed ( either because the users unsubscribed or emails to them bounced ) . If you 'd like an accurate number of the emailable people your segment is meant to capture , adding this segment condition is useful . Make sure to always add this condition using the AND connector after the previously added condition . While suppressed profiles will be skipped if you try to send an email to them , this condition is most useful when trying to get an accurate head-count . <h> Using AND vs . OR to Add Conditions <p> Using the " OR " connector between a sequence of segment conditions will make the segment- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence individually . For example , if Joe meets one condition in the sequence but does not meet another , Joe will still be included in the segment . <p> In the following example , anyone who is in our newsletter list- OR anyone that has placed an order at least once before- will be included . So , this segment will capture everyone who is in our newsletter list as well as anyone who has ever placed an order , even if there is no overlap between them:Using the- AND- connector between conditions will make a flow filter more- exclusive . We will check each condition separately AND individually , but each condition must evaluate to true in order for someone to be included . If Joe meets one condition but does n't meet another , Joe will be excluded from your segment . <p> In the following example , only those that are in our newsletter list AND also- have placed an order at least once before- will be included . So , if someone is in our newsletter list but has n't placed an order , they will- not be included .

This API is organized around REST . The API endpoints were designed to be predictable and resource-oriented and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors . This means a single resource or endpoint can and often does provide different functionality based on the HTTP verb used to access it . JSON is returned in all responses from the API , including errors . <p> This API only currently supports creating and managing standard lists . If you 'd like to create a new segment , you can do so from the lists and segments page . <h> Libraries <p> We are working on adding the Lists &amp; List Management API to our existing libraries . If you want to be notified when those libraries have been updated you can watch the following repositories : <h> Authentication <p> You authenticate to the Lists &amp; List Management API by providing one of your private API @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your private API keys from your account . We allow you to have multiple API keys at once in case you need more than one . <p> Authentication happens via the apikey parameter in each request . It can be sent as part of the GET or POST parameters . <p> Klaviyo 's API is served over HTTPS and all requests must be authenticated . <h> Your Private API key <h> 4xx range indicate an error from information provided as part of the request ( e.g. the requested object does n't exist , an invalid setting , etc. ) , and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error on Klaviyo 's end . <p> The response of all API errors contain a message parameter which has developer-facing information about why the request failed . <h> HTTP Status Code Summary <p> 200 OK - The request completed successfully . <p> 400 Bad request - Request is missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Request is missing or has an invalid API key . <p> 404 Not Found - The requested resource does n't exist . <p> 500 Server errors - Something is wrong on Klaviyo 's end . <h> Versioning <p> When we make backwards incompatible changes to the API , we release new API versions , which are reflected in the API endpoints . The current version , v1 , is the first version . In the future , if we switch to v2 , we will provide documentation on the changes as well as new documentation detailing how to use the new API . <h> Lists <p> List objects represent standard ( e.g. not dynamic ) lists of people . With lists , you can send campaigns and manage individual subscriptions . <h> Lists in Account <p> Returns a list of all the lists and segments in your account .

Defaults to asc . <h> Exclude or Unsubscribe Someone from All Email <p> Marks a person as excluded from all email . This works the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people page . Someone who is excluded will no longer receive any campaigns or flow emails . <p> Keep in mind , there is currently no API to un-exclude someone . In order to remove this block , you must manually remove someone from the unsubscribed list . <h> Arguments <p> email <p> email address <p> The email address of the person who will be excluded . <p> timestamp <p> optional , UNIX timestamp <p> A timestamp to use for recording when a user was excluded , defaults to current time . <h> Response <p> An alreadyexcluded flag that indicates whether this individual was already unsubscribed from all email .

@@96020537 @220537/ <h> How to Use Dynamic Tags to Personalize Your Emails <p> Janet Aronica August 22 , 2014 <p> Several years ago , jewelry retailer Helzberg Diamonds tested personalization with their email marketing . The team created a promotional email that spelled a subscribers first name by using- images of Helzbergs charms . They animated the charms to swing back and forth on a necklace in the email . <p> The results of the personalized campaign speak for themselves : Helzberg enjoyed a 288% lift in sales as a result of the campaign . <p> We talk about the value of personalization a lot . Weve gone over how to segment your email lists for maximum impact , and to appeal to where people are in the buying journey . But there is so much you can do after you segment your lists . You can take your emails to the next level and make your emails relevant for the individual subscriber by pulling in specific- information about them their name , products theyve purchased , etc . In this post well go through how that is done and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your email marketing . <h> Dynamic Tags <p> Dynamic tags offer a more granular way to personalize your email content . The simplest example , and probably the most common tag used , is customizing the " first name " field in an email greeting . here 's an example of this tag being used by Tone it Up : <p> If you are using an email service provider like Klaviyo that supports dynamic tags , the possibilities are endless for personalization . <h> Dynamic Tags and Klaviyo <p> Klaviyo provides a few different ways to customize content with dynamic tags so it looks great and is more relevant to your recipients . Let 's walk through some of the terminology and code to see how these tags can change the content of your emails . <h> Template Variables <p> Template variables allow you to include information about the recipient , such as their name , email address or custom properties you 've stored about that person . <p> To drive this example home further , see how the insertion of template variable firstname in the email editor changes the content of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags output important links or information . These tags are useful when you want to insert unsubscribe links , share links , dates and more . <h> Personalization Variables <p> Because Klaviyo focuses on people and what they 're up to , personalization is built into Klaviyos core . These include : <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Full Name <p> Email Address <h> Custom Properties <p> If you 've added extra properties to individuals , you can use them with the- person- variable and the lookup- filter . Its usually a good idea to also provide a default value in case someone does n't  have the custom property you 're trying to use by including the- filter . <h> Event Variables <p> For auto-responders , templates also have a variable that represents the event that triggered that email . This allows you to use information about that event in your email . For instance , if you want to thank someone for their purchase and refer to- the specific products they bought , you can easily do that with Klaviyo and the event variable . <p> This is pretty standard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> A Word of Caution <p> Before you go crazy with dynamic tags , you need to keep in mind that there may be only a certain number of subscribers that have the information you are customizing for ( like first name ) . Broken dynamic tags can look really sloppy . There is a way to avoid this , though defaults , and list suppression . <h> Defaults <p> This filter is used to specify a default in case a variable does n't  have a value . This is useful as placeholder when you do n't  always have the information you want to use . Heres what it looks like in the code and in the email : <h> List Suppression <p> There are some email sends for which the default wont really work . For example , let 's think again about the Helzberg Diamonds example- again . The entire thing was based on knowing what the persons name is . Take a look below : <p> For a campaign like this , if you do n't  have the right information for some subscribers , it may actually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  hinge on knowing that information . <p> Have you used dynamic tags in your campaigns ?

@@96020541 @220541/ <h> Five Triggered Emails Your eCommerce Business Should Send <p> Andrew Bialecki December 12 , 2012 <p> At Klaviyo , were strong believers in more personalized and targeted email marketing . Its better for consumers because the content theyll see in their inbox is more relevant to them . Its better for you because consumers will be more likely to read your emails , less likely to unsubscribe and , ultimately , more likely to make additional purchases or recommend you to a friend . <p> So without further ado , here are five emails you should be sending your customers that are triggered based on their behavior : <h> 1 . Win Backs <p> Win backs are triggered email campaigns designed to " win back " previous customers . Because marketing to existing customers is often much easier than new customers because theyve already had a positive experience , these campaigns can dramatically increase sales . <p> If you 're not yet sending these types of emails , the simplest approach is to get a list of all your customers and when they last made a purchase , choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and filter out customers who have made a purchase more recently . How long to wait before sending a customer a win back will depend on your business , but a good estimate is between three and 12 months . Once you have a list of customers , you will send them an email campaign designed to motivate them to revisit your website or business . The two most common carrots you can offer are either a limited time offer/discount or a summary of new or related- products . <p> Once you 've sent the first campaign , you 'll want to repeat the process at least every month or two . You can also start to test different ideas around what message or offer to use and who to target . For instance , you might want to send different win backs based on number of times a customer has purchased or what types of products they typically purchase . You 'll also want to measure the effectiveness of these campaigns and the number of purchases and sales they drive . Our Campaign Analyzer is a free and easy way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots more to discuss around win backs , but I 'll leave that for another post . <h> 2. - Abandoned- carts <p> Most businesses know they should be sending triggered abandoned cart campaigns , but few e-commerce businesses actually implement them . This can be a big missed opportunity . Studies have shown- that 87% consumers abandon online carts and 75% say they intend to complete their purchase . Most importantly , 54% of abandoners who intend to buy will do so in the first 24 hours after leaving . This means there 's a small window for reaching out to those consumers before they lose interest . <p> To send these emails , you need to know when a consumer adds something to a shopping cart online , but does n't  complete that- purchase- within an hour . You also need to collect their email address during the checkout process so you have a way to contact them . Once you have that information , you can monitor for new abandoned carts yourself or set up an automated system to do it for you . <p> Its also important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to think the reason for a consumer abandoning their cart is price , but that 's often not the case . It might be that the checkout process was confusing or complex or that consumer simply did n't  have time to finish the transaction . The content of your email should include a link directly to their shopping cart and a clear message for how someone can get help with their struggling with the checkout process or would prefer to complete it over the phone . As with win backs , you 'll want to experiment with different types of content and different timings to maximize the number of completely purchases . <h> 3 . Post-purchase Product Reviews <p> Weve discussed triggered emails before a purchase is completed and long after , but an often ignored opportunity is shortly after a purchase is made . A key to driving repeat customers is keeping the conversation going and growing their relationship with your brand or business . A good way to do this is by asking a customers to leave a product review after they 've made and received their purchase . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your website for the future , but it allows consumers to create a personal bond with your company by giving their opinions about your products . Just as politicians asking voters to pledge their vote increases the odds those voters actually vote , customers who write positive reviews are more likely to recommend your products or become a repeat customer . <h> 4 . Related Product Recommendations <p> Another strategy for engaging customers after a purchase is sending them a time based email with products related to the one they just bought . Larger retailers are famous for using these types of recommendation emails . This type of campaign might seem complicated , but getting value is easier than you 'd think . Most businesses have a handful of very popular products . To get started , choose one of your popular products and a few related products . Then find all of the customers who bought the popular product recently , but did not buy one of the related products and send those customers an email campaign highlighting those items . <p> You can then repeat this process for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have a few products which account for the bulk of your sales , you can do this process manually . However , if you have a large number of products youd like to try this with , you should consider finding an app or service to help you identify related products and automatically creating different customer segments . <h> 5 . Loyalty and Referral Offers <p> So far we 've focused on emails that are triggered based on the time of a purchase , but that 's not the only dimension that matters . You should also trigger emails based on a customers overall purchase history . For instance , when someone reaches five or 10 purchases all-time , theyve demonstrated some serious allegiance to your business . Simply recognizing their patronage with a thank you email is a great start , but you can take it even further . Once someone shows their commitment you can reward them with special VIP offers and incentivize them to refer others to your business with refer a friend deals . <p> This strategy is similar to a loyalty program , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get started by having a set of triggered emails that are sent when customers reach different lifetime thresholds . With a few well timed emails , you can encourage more repeat purchases or turn high value customers into great affiliates . <p> Those are just five triggered emails we think you should consider . What are others your business already sends ? Let us know . <p> And if you 're interested in easily sending any of the above triggered emails , you should give Klaviyo a try . <p> Is there a way to personalize the post-purchase review email ? Showing them the product and image in the email and linking it back to the review page on your store ? <p> Ed HallenJune 19 , 2014 <p> Absolutely . When you use one of our eCommerce integrations , that will create an event when customer place orders and when their order ships . You can use either of those as a trigger to send a follow up email inviting someone to review the products they purchased and you have access to the items and pictures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific questions , send an email to support and we can help you customize your email .

@@96020544 @220544/ <h> Email strategy teardown " Fab.com <p> Alicia Thomas April 19 , 2017 <p> Klaviyo 's email strategy teardown is an ongoing series where we take a look at the email strategy behind some of our favorite ecommerce stores . While there are many teardowns around , there are n't many teardowns that show you how a customer ( one that knows a thing or two about email marketing ) experiences an ecommerce store 's entire email strategy . <h> Why Fab ? <p> Our office just moved into a huge new space ( we now have room for over 100 people and even have beer on tap ) ! While we have furniture , we are in need of some additional decor to make the space look a bit more lived in and not so sterile . As an email nerd , this coincidence seemed like a great opportunity to dig into Fab 's email strategy and see- how they 're executing . <h> What I did <p> For this teardown , I created two different accounts . From there , I took two separate sets of actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first account . Using the second account I signed up , browse abandoned , and did n't purchase . <p> Then I looked at everything from the content and design of the emails- to the strategy behind Fab 's emails , what they did well , and what they could improve on . <p> Exceptional marketing is built on treating users as individuals , catering to their preferences , and reacting to their different behavior . With two different accounts and sets of actions I was able to see just how Fab responds to two unique sets of behavior . <h> A little background on Fab <p> Fab is a design-focused ecommerce store that sells everything from home decor to tech accessories . They 've been around since 2010 and have gone through many changes as a business . <p> Once valued at over a billion dollars , the business has taken a sharp turn in the other direction in the last few years . Fab built their empire on social commerce , flash sales , and venture funding . <p> Naturally , I wanted to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said , let 's dive into the teardown ! <p> If you bypassed the slides , let me fill you in on what I covered . <h> The emails <p> I got a lot of awesome emails from Fab over the course of three weeks . Along with a few other members of the Klaviyo crew , - I took a closer look at three different emails : a welcome email , an order confirmation , and a survey . <p> Being an ecommerce shop that sells modern , hip decor , I was not surprised to see that their welcome series mirrors that feeling ! The email feels just like the website . Their order confirmation and survey email did veer from this aesthetic , leaving me with a mixed experience . - The survey was a plain text email " a smart move in all likelihood . While the order confirmation left something to be desired with a variety of font types and sizes and was pretty bland . <p> Overall , Fab has a solid welcome series , complete with three different touches over three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really long though . I suggested that they take the sections on making a registry and adding profile information into additional touches in their welcome series . <h> Two huge opportunities for Fab <p> While the three other emails I took a look at had room for improvement , I was frankly shocked that Fab did n't have any abandon cart or browse abandonment emails in place . So shocked that I had to confirm this with another employee who also decided to subscribe to Fab and abandon a cart . <p> Add an abandoned cart series <p> Adding a series of abandon cart emails would be a game changer for Fab . With over half of all shopping carts abandoned , a well timed series of abandon cart emails could create a huge increase in revenue . All of our top-performing customers are using abandon carts to increase sales . After looking at the data of the top performing abandon carts we found found several consistencies . <p> Send the first abandon cart email between 1 to 4 hours after the abandonment <p> If you 're going to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the second 24 hours later <p> Include an image of the product abandoned <p> Create a sense of urgency in your message <p> An incentive ( like a discount or free shipping ) is always a good idea <p> A/B test subject lines , copy , and offers . Just not all at the same time ! <p> Add a browse abandonment series <p> While Fab is already using dynamic recommendations in their welcome series , they could go a step further and set up a browse abandonment series to target users after they 've left Fab . <p> Alicia is a Content Marketing Manager at Klaviyo .

@@96020550 @220550/ <h> Create a Base Template <h> Overview <p> Before you hit the ground running with Klaviyo , we recommend creating one or more base templates that you can use as a foundation for all your marketing emails . A useful base template , for example , might include a custom template header featuring your logo , a navigation button bar , etc. - <h> Note <p> When building your base template(s) , it 's a good idea to save blocks that you can reuse in other emails . For example , headers and footers can be reused in the default Klaviyo abandoned cart flow to save time . <h> Creating a New Base Template <p> First , navigate to the Email Templates tab in your account . Then , click Create Template . We will prompt you to choose a layout as a starting point and you can preview each option by clicking the magnifying glass icon . <p> If you are n't sure how you 'd like to structure your template , we recommend choosing a one-column template , since you can always add columns later . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Name it something descriptive , - like " Product Release Template , " and click Create Template . <p> Once your template is created , you 'll be taken to the template editor , where you can use a number of drag-and-drop blocks to customize the appearance of your emails . <h> Header <h> Preheader Text <p> Preheader text , sometimes called preview text , is the first component of any email . You will want to customize the preheader text for each individual email because it is displayed in the inbox preview . However , it 's good practice to place a text block at the top of every base template to remind yourself to add preheader text . <p> The preheader text is the first few lines of text in an email , so you do n't necessarily have to use a text block to display your preview text . You can also use a split block or a table , like in the example above. - <p> If you only want your preheader text to be displayed in the inbox preview -- and not in the template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same color as the content background . If you have white text on a white background , for example , the preheader text will not be visible within the email . <h> Web View Link <p> You 'll want to add a web view link if you 'd like recipients to be able to view your email in a separate window in their browser , not within their ISP ( i.e. Gmail , Yahoo , etc. ) . - <p> To add a web view link , simply input % webview % where you would like recipients to click . You can also choose " Webview " from the- Insert Tag drop-down in the text editor . <h> Learn more <h> Company Logo <p> The header of your template is a good place for common elements such as a logo and a navigation bar . Below your preheader text block , you can drag an image block to add your logo . We recommend a logo that 's no more than 150px tall to avoid pushing the content of your email too far below the fold . <h> Navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging a " Button / Link Bar " block . Your navigation bar should only have 3-4 links to avoid overcrowding . <p> To make your buttons blend in , you can set the background color of your " Button / Link Bar " block to match the content background color ; you can use horizontal rule blocks to set your navigation bar apart from the rest of the email , like in the example below <p> To make your- navigation bar a solid color , set the block background and the button colors to the same color <h> Body Content <p> Depending on the type of template you 're building , you 'll likely have common body elements that you 'll want to reuse . For example , you may have a headline and hero image in every product release email you send. - <h> Headline and Hero Image <p> Headlines and hero images can be added to a template by dragging in text and image blocks . Typically , these are the first two elements in the body of an email . A hero image should span the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences , you can use any of the &lt;h&gt; tags for your headline . <p> Beneath your headline and hero image will be the body text of your email . You can make this as short or lengthy as you 'd like , depending on the purpose of the template . <h> Learn more <h> Product Block <p> Product blocks are a great tool for displaying items from your product catalog in your email templates . Rather than manually grabbing an image from your site along with the link , description , price , etc. , you can use a product block to display this information dynamically , since Klaviyo syncs this from your ecommerce platform . <p> You are also able to use the product block to display only items from certain categories ( i.e. Men 's ) , as well as trending , bestselling , and recommended products. - <h> Add Columns <p> There are two ways to add columns to an email template : <p> Drag in a split block to create two columns <p> Drag in an " Add Columns " block to- create two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialog box will prompt you to choose the number and layout of the columns you 'd like to add <p> Split Block : <p> Add Columns Block : <p> - <h> Calls to Action <p> Use buttons as your main calls to action . Each email you send should have one primary call to action ( CTA ) , such as " Buy Now " or " Sign Up . " Buttons are highly customizable , and you 're able to edit the text , styling , color , other aspects of their appearance in the- Block Styles- tab . <p> When using buttons , be careful not to go overboard . Too many calls to action can confuse the message of your email and lead to lower conversion rates .

This API is organized around REST . The API endpoints were designed to be predictable and resource-oriented and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors .

@@96020556 @220556/ <h> What Ecommerce Reporting Metrics Really Mean <p> Marissa Petteruti October 12 , 2016 <p> When building reports inside and outside of Klaviyo , it 's important to first have a solid understanding of what each metric means . These metrics are what let you accurately measure the effectiveness of your campaigns and email flows . This guide will help you make sense of your analytics reports . <h> 1. - Open Rates <p> Open rates are often held up as a primary measure of a campaign 's success , but they are in large part a vanity metric . Across industries , open rates vary greatly by the type of email you 're sending . For example , an above average newsletter email will have an open rate over 20% . An above average welcome email , on the other hand , will have an open rate over 50% . <p> While high open rates are desirable , some fluctuation is to be expected and is mainly dependent on the health and engagement of the email list you 're sending to . <p> If you 're seeing an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Klaviyo , you can build a report that breaks down open rates by email client , which will further help you diagnose a potential deliverability issue ; you may only have low open rates for Gmail , for example . <p> If youre- seeing low open rates , you should send only to an engaged list to restore your- sending reputation . Typically , an engaged list is made up of people who have opened at least one email in the past 90 days . By sending only to this segment , you can boost open rates and get your emails out of the spam folder . <h> 2. - Click Rates <p> Click rates are a measure of recipient engagement . In Klaviyo , click rates are calculated as such : <p> This is important to note , since most other ESPs calculate click rates out of the number of opens , not recipients . <p> Because of this , click rates are typically low an above average click rate is over 2% . Below average click rates are lower than 1% . If you 're seeing low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test email content . Try experimenting with bolder or fewer CTAs too many CTAs in an email can confuse your message and have been proven to lower click rates . <h> 3. - Bounce Rates <p> Bounce rates refer to the number of emails that are not able to be delivered . There are two types of bounces : hard and soft . An email that hard bounces is not able to be delivered because of a permanent issue , like an invalid email address . An email that soft bounces , on the other hand , is not able to be delivered because of a temporary issue , like a recipient 's mailbox being full . <p> The best way to reduce your bounce rate is to regularly clean your email list . You can do this by clearing bounced addresses and sending to an engaged list ( i.e. people who have opened at least one of your emails in the past 90 days ) . <h> 4 . Complaint Rates <p> Complaint rates refer to the number of recipients who mark your email as spam . Your complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll likely experience deliverability issues . <p> It 's important to keep in mind that even if an email ends up in the spam folder , this does n't contribute to the complaint rate the complaint rate only takes into account the recipients who actively mark an email as spam . If you have complaint rates over .1% , you should look into the list you 're sending to to ensure that all recipients have opted in to hear from you . If they have , you should consider switching to double opt-in or cleaning your email list , since it 's likely outdated . <h> 5 . Unsubscribe Rates <p> Unsubscribe rates refer to the number of people who unsubscribe from a given email , out of the total number of recipients . A higher than average unsubscribe rate is over 1% . While having a high unsubscribe rate may be worrisome , it 's not necessarily something to stress too much about . After all , it 's better for recipients to unsubscribe rather than mark an email as spam . <p> If you 're seeing a high unsubscribe rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone or content of the emails youre- sending . High unsubscribe rates often indicate that recipients are aware of who you are ( since they 're not marking you as spam ) , but are receiving emails that they did n't expect to . <p> You may also see high unsubscribe rates if you start sending to an old list these recipients may have opted in to hear from you at some point , but forgotten . This is especially common if you 've been- silent for a while and are trying to get back in touch . <h> 6 . Number of Placed Orders and Revenue Value <p> These are the conversion metrics ecommerce marketers most often use to measure a campaign 's overall success . While open and click rates are important , they 're mainly important from the standpoint that they enable recipients to place an order . <p> Establish a placed order and revenue value benchmark for your campaign and flow emails this will vary pretty widely based on individual businesses , so you may have to send a few emails before you have an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see how the content of each email correlates directly with these metrics . Flag the ones- that perform especially well and try to replicate them in future emails to drive sales . <h> Bottom Line <p> Understanding what each of these metrics means is half the battle when it comes to analyzing reports and planning an email strategy . Once you have this down , you can diagnose potential issues , identify what 's doing well , and see where you have room to improve . 47562 @qwx907562

@@96020566 @220566/ <h> How to Use Preheader Text <p> Marissa Petteruti March 1 , 2016 <p> Preheader text , also called preview text , is one of the first things recipients see when an email reaches their inbox . Like subject lines , preheader text can mean the difference between a customer opening or deleting your email . Unlike subject lines , on the other hand , preheader text also appears as part of the content of an email once a recipient opens it . <h> Types of Preheader Text <p> There are two main ways you can use preheader text to enhance your emails : <p> 1 . Summarize the Email <p> If a subject line is the title of an email , the preheader text is the summary . It 's a short snippet that should hit the key points of what the email is about . If you 're having a sale , for example , use the preheader text to outline what percent discount you 're offering and on which products . If you 're introducing your newsletter , let recipients know what they can expect from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subject Line <p> Preheader text can also act as a continuation of your subject line . Using two different components of an email to tell a single story makes your email look cohesive and well thought out in your customers ' inboxes. - This method shifts the focus on the inbox preview and away from the header of the email . <h> Formatting <p> For reference , here 's how preheader text looks across devices : <p> Preheader text is the first line of text in an email and , to differentiate it from the body of the email , is oftentimes in a smaller , lighter colored font than the paragraph text . So , if your paragraph text is 14px , your preheader text should be 10px , and a couple of shades darker than the background it 's against . <p> In some cases , preheader text can disrupt the layout of an email template and some marketers would prefer to skip it altogether .

Whether you choose to have your preheader text on the email or content background , it will only be displayed in the inbox preview . <h> Mobile <p> Preheader text is especially important on mobile , since it 's given a lot of visual space in email apps . It 's also formatted in a way that is similar to the preview of a text message , which people tend to read . To leverage this fact , if a high percentage of your email list opens on mobile , consider including emojis in your preview text to draw recipients ' attention .

@@96020575 @220575/ <h> 3 Ways to Determine Customer Type <p> Marissa Petteruti March 3 , 2016 <p> Segmenting your email list is integral to keeping your subscribers engaged , since it allows you to deliver more targeted messages . In order to create segments , though , you first need data on your subscribers . Since you can create segments based on behavioral as well as demographic data , you 'll have many different options . To avoid overcomplicating the process , it 's best to start with- two or three different segments- ( gender or location , for example ) and then expand- from there . There are three main ways you can acquire this data : <h> 1 . Ask Your Subscribers Directly <p> When someone first subscribes to your newsletter via a popup , flyout , or other email collection method , you can ask them to fill out multiple fields , not just their name and email address . If you sell men 's and women 's products , for instance , you can ask them to indicate which they would like to see in the emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding many fields to a signup form can add friction to the process and , though the quality of your subscribers may be higher , you may not receive as many . <p> As an alternative , you can include an optional profile form in your first welcome email . While you may not receive as many responses , you wo n't lose email addresses at the expense of this information . You can also include the link to this form in future emails so subscribers will have the option to update their preferences , if they wish to. - <h> 2 . Infer Data from Purchase Information <p> You can use this method of data collection in addition to the first to fill in any blanks your optional signup forms might have left . Let 's continue using gender as an example . If a customer has only ever purchased women 's products , you can add them to a segment of your female customers . Likewise , you can do the same with customer 's who have only ever purchased men 's products . Actual purchases are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <p> You may encounter some customers who have purchased from both men 's and women 's categories . If one type of purchases outweighs another i.e. they 've bought five men 's products and one women 's place them in the dominant segment , male customers . Add customers who have purchased equally from both categories to whichever mailing list is more popular . If you primarily sell women 's products , for instance , add them to your- segment of female customers . <h> 3 . Infer Data from Web Browsing <p> You may also want to segment subscribers who have n't indicated their interests and have n't made a purchase yet . If you have web tracking set up on your site , you can use this information to add them to one segment or another . To continue the gender example , you can add subscribers who have only ever viewed or primarily viewed women 's products to your segment of female customers . This data will be noisier because viewing a product is n't as strong an indicator of interest as purchasing a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data for subscribers who have n't given you any other indication of their interests . <h> Conclusion <p> Sending your subscribers relevant emails is key to driving engagement . So , use these data collection methods to send your segments different newsletters- tailored to- their interests . Simple segments based on metrics like gender or location are a great starting point when segmenting your email list . 47562 @qwx907562

For most ecommerce marketers , email is just one component of a larger , overall marketing strategy and for many , Facebook ads make up a large piece of this puzzle . <p> Klaviyo 's integration allows you to marry your email and Facebook marketing strategies to deliver a targeted , cohesive message across several different media . <h> How Facebook Ads Fit with Email Marketing <p> Using Facebook ads to complement the emails you send your subscribers is something many email marketers already do , regardless of whether or not they have integrated Facebook and Klaviyo . Ads are a more passive touchpoint with your subscribers , but are still a way for you to reach them in their day-to-day . The key lies in the segments you target and how any segment you reach in your email marketing , you can reach in your Facebook ads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . In Klaviyo , create a segment of subscribers who have viewed a particular product and sync it with Facebook . Then , show this audience ads that contain the product . If they saw something they liked , they will be reminded of it in their daily activities . This is a common method of advertising that many ecommerce companies , like Amazon , use you 've probably experienced this firsthand . Many of you probably already do this in your emails . Some other existing segments you should target : <p> Try to win back inactive subscribers using Facebook . Win-backs are a common and effective email marketing technique . Sometimes , though , subscribers just stop opening your emails . Facebook ads are a great way to reach these people . Create a segment of customers who have n't opened an email in some duration of time , like six months . <p> This is a practice that tech gadget startup Nomad uses and has found to be very effective in generating sales . Facebook allows you to reach some subscribers who just are n't interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to your site to purchase . You can show these subscribers a variety of different ads , from product releases to sale ads since they have n't been opening your emails , everything you show them should be new to them . <p> Utilize Lookalike Audiences . For any Klaviyo segment that you sync with Facebook , you can create a Lookalike Audience , or audience of similar people- who are n't on your email list . These are people you would not be able to reach in your email marketing , since you do n't have their email addresses . By targeting people who are similar to your existing customers , you can reach new potential customers , and in this way you can use Klaviyo 's segmentation features to generate new leads . <h> Conclusion <p> Facebook ads can act as a complement to your emails , but they can also act as a supplement . By using Klaviyo 's integration with Facebook , you can reach both existing and new contacts , something that you ca n't do with email alone .

Hell , sometimes that 's precisely the kid 's goal . As a result , we tend to withhold our nicest things from kids until they can truly appreciate the value and purpose of that particular item . <h> Why Marketers Ca n't Have Nice Things , Either <p> See where I 'm going with this ? <p> Like kids , we marketers are drawn to shiny new things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic , or an innovative idea , most of us are in this line of work because we love finding new ways to drive better results . Of course , some of us also live for the opportunity to squeeze every last little bit of beauty out of that new thing and ruin it for everybody else . <p> One case study of this in action : Popup email capture . <p> Popups have been around for a while . Darren Rowse famously used them to grow his photography blog 's audience by more than 800% in 2008 and numerous other marketers have had similar success using popups to build their opt-in lists and drive engagement . Shopify 's Richard Lazazzera does a great job of breaking down the different types of popups and exploring a few impressive success stories in this post . <h> So , what gives ? <p> Are popups the greatest new tool in the modern marketer 's toolkit ? Or are they the wolf in sheep 's clothing " a false prophet not to be trifled with ? <p> As with most things in marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be excellent tools for capturing email addresses , building lists , and engaging customers , they can also be user experience killers . The latter is particularly true when marketers fall into the trap of assuming that if some is good , more must be better . This almost always leads to every page on a website being peppered with every type of popup imaginable . <p> There are several big problems with that approach . Qualitatively , it produces a heinous web experience that 's akin to a sales rep chasing you around a store , dangling a clipboard in front of your face , and begging you to sign up for their email newsletter . Quantitatively , it 's been proven to hurt several key engagement metrics , including number of pages visited and average visit duration ( one brief experiment saw both decrease by about 10% ) . <h> How to Use Popups without Destroying User Experience <p> Given the fine line between using popups effectively and driving your customers insane , does this mean popups should be avoided completely ? Not exactly . <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media marketers continue to see great results from those channels , there 's no reason your business ca n't see positive results from popups " even if some other brands are giving them a bad name . For that to happen , however , you need to be methodical and purposeful " using the right type of popup in the right situation , and only when certain behavioral triggers have been activated . <p> To help you stay within those boundaries , here are some good best practices to keep in mind : <p> 1 . Be patientThe general rule of thumb with email capture popups is that you should wait at least 15 seconds or until the visitor has explored multiple pages . The argument behind this is simple : Customers and website visitors need time to understand who you are and why your brand is valuable . When you give them that time , two things are more likely to happen : <p> The right types of people " people who align with your brand and are more likely to engage with it " will self-qualify and opt-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , which will only serve to improve the results of your other marketing efforts . <p> While this approach might lead to fewer contacts , it 's a tradeoff worth making if it ensures your website 's experience remains clean and unobtrusive . <p> 2 . Segment messaging and popup types by specific behavior <p> Of course , there will be times where the basic time-based parameters above do n't apply . For instance , if someone is about to bounce from a page , you might use an exit intent popup to interrupt their decision with a compelling offer ( discounts are always popular ) . Similarly , if a user has visited your site multiple times and never converted , you might consider greeting them with a popup that welcomes them back with a custom offer . <p> It 's laid out well , plus they offer an incentive the possibility of winning $500 without promising the usual discount . Not only does it help their offer stand out a bit , it also keeps average sale price up . <p> Ultimately , the idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offers . The more your popups are built around " and triggered by " specific behaviors , the more effective ( and less annoying ) they 'll be . <p> 3 . Be considerate of when ( and how ) to show popups againSumoMe published a pretty comprehensive study last year that revolved around the collection of more than 100,000 emails that were captured over a 30-day span . One of the questions the company wanted to answer : How long between visits should you wait to deliver a popup to the same person ? <p> Here 's a chart showing what they found : <p> The similarity in the number of emails collected after a minute versus after a month is somewhat surprising , but it does n't mean marketers should suddenly feel free to hit visitors over the head with the same offer every 60 seconds . <p> Truth is , the right frequency will depend largely on the types of products you sell , the types of offers you 're presenting , and your visitors ' tolerance for popups in general . The only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test different timing , refine based on your results , and optimize based on that information . <h> One Guiding Principle to Keep in Mind <p> Of course , all of this is only scratching the surface . You 'll inevitably learn even more as you begin to implement these ideas and test some of your own . That said , if you want to take a deeper dive into popup best practices and optimization , here are handful of great guides : <p> As you read , just keep this one , very simple principle in mind : Think about the experience your customers want to have . Do they want you following them around and badgering them with generic offers ? Or do they want the right offer at the right time for the right reason ? 
@@96020588 @220588/ <h> List Cleaning <h> Why List Cleaning Matters <p> List cleaning allows you to : <p> Reduce unsubscribe rates and increase open and click rates . <p> Increase your deliverability scores with email providers . Most major email clients ( like Google and Yahoo ) track how recipients interact with emails from your domain -- how many emails are marked as spam , how many are opened , etc . They then use this information to determine whether your emails are classified as spam . This means having lots of uninterested people on your list will only hurt your efforts to reach those that actually do want to receive your emails . <p> Retain and engage customers . By knowing when people start to fade away , you can know when to send targeted campaigns to re-engage them . <p> Personalize content based on your best customers . By knowing that your list is full of real , active , and interested potential customers , you can start to personalize content around those people . <h> Identifying " Inactive " Profiles in Your Account <p> Here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your Klaviyo account : <p> Newsletter subscribers that joined your list over 6 months ago but have never opened an email AND have never purchased : <p> Newsletter subscribers that joined your list over 6 months ago but have n't opened an email AND have n't purchased in the last 6 months : <p> Inactive contacts that first engaged over 6 months ago but have n't ever opened an email AND have never purchased : <h> Removing Inactive Profiles from Klaviyo <p> If you decide you then want to clean a segment of inactive people from your account , you have two " removal " options : <p> Delete Contacts Permanently from Your AccountIf you want to permanently remove a list/segment of contacts from your account , you can go your account settings and navigate to Account &gt; Settings &gt; Account Maintenance . Here , you will see a Remove Profiles section where you can choose a list/segment from a drop-down menu to delete . If you delete people via the Account Maintenance tab , these profiles will be completely erased and no history will be kept --- this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete because this can not be reversed . <p> Suppress Contacts Permanently from Your AccountIf you want to keep these contacts in your account , stop them from receiving any and all emails from you , you can upload a list of contacts to your account 's suppression list . Once you create a segment of those you want to suppress , export this segment as a CSV file . Next , find your suppression list by navigating to the Profiles- tab- page in your account . Click the Suppressed Profiles- link in the upper right and you will see an Upload File button . When you suppress a group of people , their profiles will remain intact in your account . They will be considered " inactive , " and you will not be able to email them . This is also permanent because there is no way to bulk un-suppress contacts . <h> Cleaning Soft Bounces <p> It is also important to regularly clean out contacts to whom your emails just keep bouncing . There are two main types of bounces : hard bounces and soft bounces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email can not be delivered due to a permanent reason -- this could be caused by a variety of reasons , including a misspelled email or a deliberate block by the email server <p> Klaviyo will automatically remove emails that hard bounce , and then suppress them from future emails . <p> Soft Bounce <p> A soft bounce is always caused by a temporary reason , such as a full inbox or the recipient email server being down momentarily <p> Klaviyo will try sending emails for up to 48 hours but will not suppress an email that does n't get delivered in that 48 hour period . This means you might have a lot of " Soft Bouncers " dragging down your deliverability that you do n't even know about . <p> To create a segment that identifies these chronic " soft bouncers , " use the following conditions : <p> What someone has done ( or not done ) &gt; has Bounced Email is at least 4 over all time <p> AND <p> What someone has done ( or not done ) &gt; has Received Email zero times over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can then use one of the two list cleaning methods above to clean this group .

@@96020591 @220591/ <p> Shopify Plus recently introduced Scripts , a feature that allows ecommerce store owners to customize your store 's logic based on shoppers ' behavior . In practice , this allows you to customize discounts based on specific items or combinations of items that shoppers add to their carts and apply these discounts at checkout , as well as a whole slew of other custom conditions . For Shopify Plus users , this means far fewer restrictions on customizing how shoppers can interact with your store . Each of the four best practices below can easily be implemented using Shopify Plus ' pre-built script templates , which include : <p> Percent discount <p> Fixed discount <p> Percent- and- fixed discount <p> Tiered discounts <p> By one get one free ( BOGO ) <h> 1 . Free Gift with the Purchase of a Specific Product <p> Using Shopify 's BOGO- template , you can create a promotion that includes a free gift with the purchase of a particular item . This is a great incentive to try if you are promoting the release of a new product . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , include a free sample with all purchases leading up to its release . Alternatively , if you just released a new product , include a free gift in the purchase of this product to incentivize buyers . <p> More generally , if your store does n't offer sales or discounts , free gifts are an excellent way to take advantage of holidays or changes in season , when other companies would typically run sales . For example , you could offer a free Santa hat with every purchase during the winter holiday season . On the other hand , you could offer a free Santa hat exclusively with the purchase of a Christmas-themed sweater if you 'd like to promote this seasonal item . <h> 2 . Percent Off a Purchase Combo <p> Offering a percent discount for the purchase of a specific combination of items allows you to easily upsell and cross-sell products . For example , if you offer a percent discount on the purchase of both shoes and socks , you will incentivize customers purchasing one item to purchase the other . This works best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only offer this discount for three or more specific items , for example , you weaken the incentive . <h> 3 . Fixed Amount Off the Purchase of Multiple Products <p> Like offering a percent off a particular purchase combination , offering a fixed discount for the purchase of a number of products helps you upsell and cross-sell . Offer this discount for the purchase of more than two items , but allow customers to choose any items they want from your product catalog or specific collection . Giving customers this freedom of choice while still offering a discount will incentivize them to purchase multiple items . If you 're introducing a new beach line that contains swimsuits , towels , and sunglasses , for instance , offer $10 off the purchase of three or more products from the collection . <h> 4 . Fixed Amount AND Percent Off the Purchase of Specific Products <p> You can combine methods #2 and #3 to upsell or cross-sell three or more specific products . For example , you can offer a percent discount off the purchase of shoes and socks together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , socks , and shoe polish . This works best if you have a third item you are trying to sell that customers might not purchase alone ( i.e. shoe polish ) . <h> Conclusion <p> The ways in which you can customize your checkout process with Shopify Plus ' Scripts are endless .

@@96020594 @220594/ <p> To get your brain thinking in that way , here are the key metrics you should be tracking . <h> 1 ) Revenue From Email <p> Essentially , is your email marketing helping you sell things ? Sometimes you need to pull away from the weeds and think of the big picture like this . <p> Using behavioral analytics in an email marketing platform like Klaviyo , you can see down to the person-level if the people who open your emails are buying things . Additionally , you can offer specific coupon codes through email campaigns and judge based on the number of coupons redeemed what the sales result of that campaign was . Whether its directly or indirectly , the goal of anything in marketing is to ultimately help boost sales . With that in mind , its clear why its critical to track email . <h> 2 ) Clickthrough Rate <p> Clickthrough ( CTR ) rate is a popular email marketing metric among marketers because it helps you easily see the performance from each send and determine the success of A/B tests . And obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your site , so it directly impacts revenue . Analyzing who comes to your site through email marketing campaigns is important for this reason . <h> 3 ) Conversion Rate <p> This metric is tightly tied to revenue . Are your calls-to-action and offers producing the right results ? After an email recipient has clicked through on your email , the hope is that take the intended next step on your website and usually that is to make a purchase . <h> 4 ) Bounce Rate <p> Bounce rate is the percentage of emails that couldnt be delivered to a recipients inbox . Its important to keep track of this because whether or not the email even reaches your subscribers inbox determines a lot of other metrics like open rate , clickthrough rate , and revenue . <p> To fully grasp what this metric means , you should know the differences between " hard " bounces and " soft " bounces . <p> Soft bounces are the result of a temporary issue with a real- email address , like a- full inbox or a problem with the recipient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the problem gets resolved . Or , you can even try resending your emails to soft bounces . <p> Hard bounces are invalid , closed , or non-existent email address . You may have picked up a few from running a contest or daily deal . These emails will never be successfully delivered , so you should immediately remove them from your lists . <p> First of all , since most email service providers charge by list volume , you could be paying for emails thatll never generate a return . You could safe yourself some cash and redirect your marketing budget elsewhere . <p> Additionally , internet service providers ( ISPs ) use bounce rates as an indicator of an email senders reputation . If you have a lot of hard bounces , your company can appear as a spammer from the point of view of an ISP . If you 're considering a spammer , none- of your emails will hit- anyones inbox. <h> 5 ) List Growth Rate <p> Marketing is n't just about optimization . In addition to metrics that help you assess the effectiveness of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep one eye on the long term . Are you growing your email list ? <p> There 's a natural 22.5% decay in email marketing lists each year , so its important that you 're not only replacing those old contacts but that you are scaling your business with fresh customers . <h> 2 Metrics- You Do n't  Need to Obsess Over <p> Its worth mentioning that there are also a couple of email marketing metrics that really are n't  worth tracking closely . <h> 1 ) Open Rate <p> More opens are a great thing , but more clicks are even better . <p> Usually , an email is only counted as " opened " if the recipient also receives the images embedded . A lot of recipients have image blocking turned on , so they wont be included in your open rate . This is why this metric can be misleading . <p> Its best to consider open rate as something you compare to previous sends . Did the open rate drastically go up or down compared to past performance ? If so , you know its worth taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that open rate is actually a very misleading metric for a few reasons but most importantly , - an email is only counted as " opened " if the recipient also receives the images embedded in that message . And a large percentage of your email users likely have image-blocking enabled on their email client . This means that even if they open the email , they wo n't be included in your open rate , making it an inaccurate and unreliable metric for marketers , as it underreports on your true numbers . <h> 2 ) Unsubscribe Rate <p> This metric is helpful if you view it through the right lens . But oftentimes , people are impulsive about an uptick or slip in unsubscribes . <p> When viewed appropriately , this metric can- help you determine if you should offer more granular subscription options or if there 's an issue with your design that prevents it from rendering your design properly. - As mentioned , there 's certainly a natural decay in your email marketing lists year over year . A- drastic uptick in unsubscribes could signal a larger issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your message ? Are you sending too many emails ? <p> The reality , however , is that- any subscribers who do n't  like your email marketing messages bother to go through the whole unsubscribe process . They 'll just- ignore you . A low unsubscribe rate could give you false hope that your email marketing is working . This is why its better to focus you analysis time on engagement numbers like clickthrough rates and conversion rates . If those are slipping , you can address issues thatll improve those metrics along with solving anything potentially increasing unsubscribes . <h> Key Takeaway <p> Focus is a virtue , and that applies to how you analyze your business . " Measure everything " is n't actually the best advice in the world since most people follow it by spinning their wheels .

Subject lines , send times , and list quality are all factors that come into play when a recipient decides whether or not to open one of your emails . Below , I 'll outline four tried and true methods that are guaranteed to boost your open rates . <h> 1 . Allow Subscribers to Choose How Often They Hear from You <p> Once a new subscriber signs up , the last thing he or she wants is to be immediately inundated with emails . If you send a daily newsletter , we strongly recommend you allow your subscribers to choose how often they hear from you in order to avoid sending your list emails they wo n't open . The lower your open rates , the higher the chance that you will start to have deliverability issues . Plus , this behavior could increase your unsubscribe rate so , it 's in your best interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subscribers may not select the frequency they would prefer , so it 's important to include a default setting . Instead of making the default frequency daily , consider making it weekly or biweekly . To start , you can test setting the default to daily and keep an eye on your open rates . If they are low , try changing the default setting to a lower frequency . <h> 2 . Send to an Engaged List <p> I 've mentioned the importance of list cleaning many times before , but it 's worth reiterating that sending to an engaged list is a key aspect of boosting open rates . To identify who in your master list is engaged , create a segment of subscribers in the list that have opened at least one of your emails in a certain amount of time . Six months is a good rule of thumb . <p> Instead of continuing to send daily or weekly newsletters to subscribers who have n't opened an email in over six months and joined your list over six months ago , send these unengaged subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean funneling them into a win-back flow , or even sending them a series of targeted campaigns to re-activate them ( try running a contest , for example ) . <h> 3 . Personalize Subject Lines <p> MarketingSherpa reports that personalization in subject lines leads to around a 30% increase in open rates across all industries , with consumer products seeing an increase of 41.8% . Personalizing subject lines is a simple step that delivers huge results . Personalization can include mentioning the recipient 's name in the subject line , or even referring to a product a customer recently purchased . <p> When brainstorming ideas for subject lines , try sticking- with options that work with or without personalization . This way , you can A/B test the personalized subject line against the generic one and see how personalization resonates with your unique audience . <h> 4 .

High open rates help you establish your sending reputation and add legitimacy to your business , so it 's important that you do n't simply mass blast your entire email list . Klaviyo makes it easy to target engaged subscribers , personalize emails , and optimize send times .

Below are four do 's and don'ts of sending to a master list and some common mistakes to avoid . <h> Do 's <p> These practices will help ensure that your master list stays up-to-date and includes those who have opted in to receive emails from you , and in turn prevent your emails from winding up in the spam folder . <p> 1 . Have all your subscription methods lead to one segment . Often , master lists are actually segments . If you have multiple ways people can sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyout , and embedded signup ) , creating a segment that aggregates these methods can give you a more accurate read on how many subscribers you actually have . <p> 2 . Periodically clean your master list . Depending on the age of your website , your master list might be years old . To make sure you 're not sending to inactive subscribers , periodically remove those who have n't opened an email or made a purchase in six months or more . Continuing to send to these inactive subscribers can harm your deliverability . To learn more about cleaning your email list , check out my post on list cleaning . <p> 3 . Segment your master list .

For example , if you want to send a marketing campaign to a segment of customers who have purchased a particular item , make sure you add a condition that includes only contacts in your master list . If you have multiple subscription methods , add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pull from every email address stored in your account , including those who have never opted in to hear from you . <p> 2 . Do n't send marketing emails , like newsletters , to contacts who have not subscribed to receive these types of emails . Resist the temptation to send to everyone you have an email address for . If a contact has n't opted in to hear from you , odds are they do n't want to receive your emails and wo n't open them , which can affect your deliverability. - <p> 3 . Do n't send the same email to everyone on your master list . Segments allow users to drill down and learn about their customer bases . Take advantage of this feature by segmenting based on gender , location , or some other metric and editing the content of your marketing campaigns accordingly . <p> 4 . Do n't overwhelm your existing subscribers . Be aware of how often you email your subscribers . Even if someone has opted in to hear from you , they may not stick around for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a daily newsletter , we recommend allowing subscribers to choose how often they hear from you . <h> Conclusion <p> The key point to keep in mind is that your master list should include only those who have specifically given you permission to send them marketing emails . Even if someone has purchased from you , this does n't necessarily mean that they have opted in to receive your newsletters or other marketing campaigns . Keep these do 's and don'ts in mind whenever you 're sending a campaign , and you 'll see increased engagement and higher deliverability. 47562 @qwx907562 
@@96020610 @220610/ <h> What is a Suppressed Profile ? <p> A suppressed profile is a person who can no longer be emailed . A person can become suppressed for the following reasons : <p> The person unsubscribedThe main way a profile will become suppressed is if the person unsubscribes from one of your emails ; when someone unsubscribes , Klaviyo will suppress- the person to ensure that he/she no longer receives emails from you . <p> The person marked an email as spamIf a recipient struggles to find an unsubscribe button , or otherwise wants to take action against your email as spam , many inbox providers allow for a user to directly mark an email as spam ; when this happens , Klaviyo will automatically suppress this person to ensure that- he/she no longer receives emails from you . <p> An email hard bouncedA hard bounce occurs when an email can not be delivered due to a permanent reason . This could be caused by a variety of reasons , including a misspelled email or a deliberate block by the email server . A hard bounce signals a permanent email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help ensure your lists stay clean . <p> Manually addedIf you have a file of people you want to manually upload to your suppression list , this is an option ; you will be able to distinguish these people on your suppression list by the reason " manually added . " You can not bulk un-suppress individuals from your suppression list even if you manually added them . <p> To find your suppression list in Klaviyo , navigate to the Profiles tab and then click Suppressed Profiles in the upper right-hand corner . Once you navigate to your suppression list , you will be able to filter by reason , export this list to a CSV , add an email address manually , or upload a file of people you 'd like to suppress . <h> How Klaviyo Treats Suppressed Profiles <h> Suppressed Profiles &amp; Pricing <p> Klaviyo 's pricing tiers are based on the total number of active profiles in your account . An active profile is any profile that is n't suppressed ; Klaviyo does not charge for suppressed profiles . <p> If you navigate to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of- counting against your plan limit. - On the Profiles tab of your account , you will see the counts for total Active Profiles and Suppressed Profiles separately . <h> Automatic Exclusion from Email Sends <p> Klaviyo will automatically exclude all suppressed profiles from any email . This means even if you try to send an email to profiles that are suppressed , Klaviyo will automatically ensure these intended recipients are skipped . <p> For flow emails , for example , under Recipient Activity &gt; Other- you will always find a Skipped : Person Suppressed- count that signals how many people did n't receive the email because they are suppressed in your account . <h> Global Suppressions <p> If you have Klaviyo's- Global Unsubscribe feature enabled , which is highly recommended , someone will become " globally " - suppressed in your account after unsubscribing from any email . This means that if someone unsubscribes from just one list , he/she will stop receiving emails altogether vs. just being removed from that single list . <p> Keeping this feature enabled- is recommended because it is most in-line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action signals he/she would- like to stop receiving emails from the sender . If this recipient- continues to receive emails from the sender , he/she will either ignore your emails , - begin- to mark them as spam , or take more aggressive action -- as a sender , all of these consequences can significantly harm your email deliverability . <p> After someone becomes globally suppressed , however , this person is- not- automatically removed from all lists and segments that he/she may be part of in your account. - This suppressed person 's existing subscriptions and segment inclusions will remain intact , but the " suppressed " tag will ensure this person does not receive any emails moving forward . If someone reaches out asking to opt back in , you can then simply remove the " suppressed " tag and this person will begin receiving the same emails as before -- this person wo n't have to worry about re-subscribing . <p> This means , for example , that your newsletter list may have 500 people on it , - but it 's possible that 5% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign to this newsletter list , Klaviyo will automatically skip all suppressed users and you 'll notice that only 475 emails were successfully sent . <p> To test this out , use the segment builder to view- a cross-section of your list that is suppressed . This segment should include- the following two conditions : <h> Keeping vs . Deleting Suppressed Profiles <p> Klaviyo will never charge you- for suppressed profilesKlaviyo 's pricing tiers are based on the total number of active profiles ; you will never be prompted to upgrade to pay for suppressed contacts , so there is no cost associated with keeping them in your account . <p> Suppressed users still matter for business insightsKlaviyo 's segmentation tools can help you gain important business insights . If you plan on creating segments to analyze customer behavior , website activity , etc. , deleting profiles ( even those you ca n't ultimately email ) will skew these segments and make it impossible to get accurate insights . <p> People can re-subscribeIf someone chooses to re-subscribe to the list he/she initially unsubscribed from , Klaviyo will automatically un-suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you also keep their entire engagement/activity- history that can be useful if they resubscribe in the future .

For instance , " Purchased product " or " Signed up for webinar . " If you have multiple actions to track , you should upload them as separate CSV files . <p> If you do n't specify $eventid , it will default to the timestamp of the event . In practice , you should send an $eventid if you have an unique identifier for each event , for example an order I 'd . You should also set the $eventid if you expect certain events to occur at the same point in time . This can happen when someone takes one action which you will split into multiple events . For example , if someone purchases multiple items and you want to record one event for each item purchased . <p> Each row in a CSV file represents one action taken by one person . If someone does something multiple times , you should have one row for each time they did that action . <p> The first row of your CSV file contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You need one column labeled Timestamp which has the date and time that row 's action occurred . You should format the date and time as YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS . So 1:30pm on November 11th would be 2012-11-14 13:30:00 . <p> You need a column labeled Person//Email or Person//ID to identify the person who did that action . If you use a Person//Email column , the data in that column should be the email address of that person . If you use a Person//ID column , the data in that column should be a unique identifier for that person , such as their customer I 'd . You can include both columns , if you want , but you need to include at least one of them . <p> If you have additional data about the person who did something , it should go in a column whose label starts with Person// and then the type of data that column has . For instance , if you had the company or organization each person belongs to , you 'd want to label that column Person//Organization . The special prefix let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each person rather than the activity . The following are special columns you can use to help you identify people : <p> Person//Email " email address <p> Person//First Name " first name <p> Person//Last Name " last name <p> Person//Phone " phone number <p> Person//Organization " organization <p> Person//Title " job title <p> If you have additional data about each action , you can include it in extra columns with any labels you want . For instance , if someone purchases something and you want to include what item they bought , you could include that data in a column labeled Item Purchased . <p> If you do n't have data for a particular column , leave it blank and we 'll ignore it . For instance , if you do n't know someone 's organization , you can leave the column for Person//Organization- blank and we 'll skip tracking that property <h> How to Name your Event <p> After you load and import your CSV file , you will have the opportunity to name the event . If you are attempting to map the imported data to an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to type the event name exactly as it already appears . <h> Note for Ecommerce Stores Loading Purchase Data <p> If you 're uploading purchase data , you 'll want to upload two files - one for the overall order , and a second that includes item by item data . - Here 's what the headers of those files should look like typically : - <h> Placed Order <p> Person//Email <p> Person//First Name <p> Person//Last Name <p> Timestamp <p> $eventid <p> $value <p> Quantity <p> Categories <p> Items <p> John@example.com <p> John <p> Smith <p> 2014-03-10 08:55 <p> 12425 <p> 49.00 <p> 2 <p> " Books " , " Games " <p> " To Kill a Mockinbird " , " Pictionary " - <h> Ordered Product <p> Person//Email <p> Person//First Name <p> Person//Last Name <p> Timestamp <p> $eventid <p> $value <p> Quantity <p> Category <p> Item <p> John@example.com <p> John <p> Smith <p> 2014-03-10 08:55 <p> 12425 <p> 24.00 <p> 1 <p> Books <p> To Kill a Mockinbird <p> The reason to include two metrics is that it makes it easier to later trigger emails off of both an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For Ordered Product , $eventid needs to be a unique identifier for each combination of the order and the product ordered . - The easiest way to do this is usually to use a combination of the Order I 'd and product I 'd or item number in the order. - <h> Import Troubleshooting <h> My Import is Taking a Long Time <p> Imports can take between 5 minutes and 24 hours depending upon the size of your list -- we highly recommending beginning the import of any list at least 24 hours in advance of needing it for a given campaign to ensure the import process does not hold up your send . <h> My Import Keeps Failing <p> If your import fails , it is likely due to one of the following reasons : <p> Is your file a . csv file ? - Your file must be in . csv format .

@@96020618 @220618/ <h> What You Should Test in Your eCommerce Emails <p> Janet Aronica July 18 , 2014 <p> There are tons of variables you can test in your ecommerce emails " and that fine-tuning can lead to significantly better results . <p> This is n't the first time we 've discussed the value of testing your emails on the blog . Best practices can get you started and help you develop your instincts , but ultimately that all goes out the door- once your emails land in the hands of a customer . From there , its all about what the data shows you and whether or not they open , they click , and whether or not those campaigns are driving a sale . <p> With this in mind , here- is an introduction to testing for your email marketing as well as a few ideas for things you should be testing . <h> Introduction to Testing Your Emails <p> Testing your emails , more specifically A/B testing , - simply means to send out multiple versions of your emails to a small segment of your list to see which versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emails to the full list . The things you are typically trying to optimize for are : <p> Open rate <p> Click-through rate <p> Spam rate <p> Unsubscribe rate <p> Subscribe rate <p> Bounce rate <p> Mobile specific engagement rates <p> Conversion rate <p> The first seven- are pretty obvious , but you may wonder how one could optimize for the conversion rate . Wouldnt that be beyond the control of the email ? <p> Yes and no . Your email and your landing page should be consistent with their design and message . - A fresh design or copy change in an email could drive a higher click-through rate , but if its inconsistent with the offer on your product page , it could feel like a bait and switch for the user . This would result in a lower conversion rate. - These things are all connected together and need to be considered as a whole , so that 's why you also need to keep your eye on the conversion rate . In addition , once you create a culture of testing and really get rolling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of optimizing all of the supportive metrics and tracking those . At the end of the day , the number one thing that needs to keep moving forward is sales , and that 's the thing you need to consistently track no matter what smaller optimizations you are making . <h> Tests You Should Be Doing <h> 1 ) Subject Line <p> As open rates- consistently flail- due to Gmails promotions tab , subject line testing- is ever more essential . You need to be creative AND- data-driven in your approach. - Brainstorm many different subject lines and then select two or three- to test . <p> Some specific variations you can test include : <p> Using- the recipients first name in the subject line <p> Using the product name in the subject line <p> Using brand names of products the user has bought or browsed before <p> Using the name of someone famous or trusted in the subject line <p> Being brief or vague in the subject line to spark curiosity <p> Target subscribers based on location and call out the name of their city in the subject line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up nearly as prominently as your subject line especially on mobile . And yet , its one of those things that typically gets ignored . <p> Take a look at these two different approaches : <p> Instacart reinforces their value proposition by describing what the startup does . First Round Review ( which is an awesome blog , by the way ) is still using the default preview text in this particular email . Which one makes you want to click ? <h> 3 ) Personalize the " From " <p> 43 percent of email recipients will mark an email as being spam based on the name or email address of the sender. - This means that you need to really think through who your subscribers know more a person at your company or the name of your company itself and leverage that in the " from " section of your email . <p> In the case of B2B companies , the employees at those businesses build- credibility as the stars of webinars , speakers at conferences , and authors of blog posts . Sometimes that same opportunity is extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bearman , Director of Communications for Oscar De La Renta , has amassed quite the following as " Oscar PR Girl . " But her case is a bit of an outlier , and I 'd still say people would be more likely to recognize Oscar De La Renta as the email sender than Erika Bearman . Try testing your founder , a specific employee , or the companys name itself in your " from " section on your email campaigns and see how it impacts opens and your spam rate . <h> 4 ) - The Email Copy <p> A recent study from Nielson group- show that people scan their emails in about 51 seconds , and people only entirely read about 19% of email newsletters . If you take a look at this heatmap from the study , you 'll see that people primarily focused on the headlines in the newsletter and skipped through the rest of the content . <p> I find that most people would look at this information and say this simply shows people do n't  like to read long form things anymore especially not in emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like to read garbage . If you give them- something interesting to read , they may stick around to dive into it and read . But you 'll only know if you try out different versions and test . <p> A few ideas : <p> Test plain-text emails vs lots of pictures <p> Test discounts vs no discounts <p> Test short emails vs long emails <p> Test a casual tone vs more formal tone <p> Test which products you feature <h> 5 ) The- Unsubscribe Experience <p> The unbelievably successful 2012 Obama fundraising campaign raised a total of $500- million thanks in large part to testing their emails . They tested everything under the sun , including the little details like the unsubscribe text at the bottom of the emails . <p> Obviously if someone has unsubscribed from your emails- they are less likely to be regularly engaged with it and make donations . Although the email team credits " bigger rocks " like sending more regular emails and personalizing the emails as optimizations that generated the biggest value , these tiny tweaks also helped drive more conversions . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can test - CTA button copy , CTA button color , whether you use a CTA button or just a text link the kinds of photos you use in the email design the list goes on . The point is that you make a commitment to test and that you measure your emails regularly . <p> What email other testing tips do you have ? Let us know in the comments . 
@@96020621 @220621/ <p> One of the best places to get inspiration is from real-life email marketing experiments . <p> Taking a data-driven approach to your email marketing is important . Weve been talking a lot about what to test in your email marketing campaigns lately . You wo n't find the magic approach by guessing alone . But you can get ideas for campaigns , sales promotions , design changes , copy tweaks , and other things you can optimize for based on what worked for others . <p> Here are three- success stories from data-driven eCommerce marketers who dared to test the waters with a fresh approach . <p> Heirlume is a jewelry retailer founded by a simple premise : one wife was sick of telling her husband what jewelry she wanted for every birthday and holiday . <p> At first , the company- assumed it was mostly men browsing the site and subscribing to emails . However , a sophisticated- email address analysis revealed that many subscribers were actually women browsing the site for themselves , and therefore the messaging of the emails was completely off . <p> The team- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lists by gender and began sending females more frequent- newsletters and updates about new styles . For the men , they focused newsletters on holiday-centric promotions , the idea being that those subscribers were- buying for others during those times of the year . <p> Building off of this strategy , the company looked for other ways to optimize their emails. - To increase click-through rates , they- decided to test- the inclusion of product recommendations in their emails . <p> For the female subscribers , they pulled in product recommendations based on past buying and browsing behavior . <p> For male subscribers , they presented- product recommendations differently and emphasized the " gift buying " perspective . As you can see in the example below , they remind subscribers about timeframes for ordering custom gifts in the product recommendations at the bottom of the email . <p> The result of the test speaks for itself : - Heirlume averaged a 9% increase in open rates and a 3% lift in click-through rate- from the campaigns . <p> The key- takeaway : - To get the data you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may need to think outside of the box . In this case , Heirlume had to use a proprietary algorithm to figure out the gender of the their email addresses . But the extra effort was well worth it. - <h> 2 . Case-Mates Flash Sales Drive 236% More Revenue <p> Case-Mate sells premium smartphone cases . The- team had seen flash sales work successfully- for other companies , so they decided to give it a try for their own online store . <p> The promotion- turned out to be such a success that they ended up reorganizing their marketing calendar to do a second flash sale two weeks later . here 's how they planned their flash sales , ran their email campaigns , and learned from the first one to make the second sale even better than the first : <p> For the first flash sale , the Case-Mate team carefully planned just how theyd time the sale and promote it . <p> First , they figured out the right day and time for the flash sale based on when they got the most traffic and conversions . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more conversions on Mondays . So they went with Monday , December 7th , as the date for the first flash sale . <p> Next , they looked back at past promotion performance to figure out their discount " sweet spot " for highest conversions . It turned out that 30% off was the number , so they moved forward with that . <p> On the flash sale launch day , the- team sent two emails to promote the sale . The first one was sent at 11 a.m. to announce the sale , which would take place from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. that night . The second one was sent at 7 p.m. to indicate the start of the sale . Social media postings were sent out in the morning to coordinate with the timing of the first emails . <p> Subject line : - Holiday-Flash-sale : Our Flash Sale Starts Tonight ! <p> This first sale was a huge success , generating a 51% increase in traffic , a 50% increase in conversion rate , and a 236% increase in revenue . Given this success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks later . This time , they fixed a few things though : <p> They switched the timing of the flash sale from 7 p.m. 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. to 10 p.m . They did this to accommodate the availability of their customer success team , who actually ends work at 7 p.m . <p> They changed the email timing to 1:30 p.m. for the announcement email , and then did a " last chance " send at 6:30 p.m . <p> The second sale also performed amazingly well , enough for the team to plan to add flash sales as a regular marketing practice . Here were the results : <p> 5% increase in traffic <p> 105% increase in conversion rate <p> 78% increase in revenue <p> The key takeaway : - Take calculated risks . Case-Mate found ways to use past customer data like site visits and conversion rates to approach this sales promotion in an informed way , and it paid off big time . <h> 3 .

Thinking of a way to stand out from the crowd is no small endeavor , but Airbnb did this in a big way in 2012 . <p> Rather than focusing on an end-of-year promotion , they focused on doing something that would connect the Airbnb users to each other. - They- created a tool that enabled- subscribers to send holiday greetings to hosts they had stayed with or guests they had accommodated- that year . <p> The idea for the campaign came up last minute , so they had to pull together this tool quickly and alert their users of the campaign to generate interest . <p> The team worked fast to pull together an interface where Airbnb users could browser from five templates , - select recipients from a pre-populated list , and use a standard message or write their own . <p> The email messages did n't  include any promotional content whatsoever . It was purely a community-focused promotion . The team was happy , and somewhat surprised , by the results . The emails had a 52.3% open rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on marketing emails . The emails had a 26.5% click-through rate , and the team usually gets up to a 12% click-through rate on emails . According to Marketing Sherpa , the Airbnb team was most impressed with- the number of reservations driven by the campaign- - over 600 bookings since that 's more than the team would typically see for email campaigns even dedicated directly towards driving conversions . <p> The key takeaway : - Know your business model ! - Airbnb is a- marketplace , and a travel company , and they were perfectly positioned to keep themselves top of mind during a busy travel time. - Because the sales are made between people , the call to action to connect the people to one another makes perfect sense . <p> What did you learn from these email marketing experiments ? What were your key takeaways ? Let us know in the comments . 
@@96020623 @220623/ <h> When to Send Your Win-Back Series <p> Marissa Petteruti May 2 , 2016 <p> When you should send a win-back series depends a lot on your industry and the types of products you sell . Your target customers are those who are at risk of lapsing , but have n't yet lapsed completely . In this post , I 'll outline how you can determine which initial send time is right for you , as well as when you should send the individual emails in your welcome series . <h> Determining What Send Time is Right for You <p> Whenever you experiment with send times , you 'll need to have a baseline . Six months of inactivity is a good place to start sending your welcome series . Inactivity should be defined by two factors : when someone last opened an email from you and when someone last purchased . If a customer has n't opened an email or made a purchase in the last six months , they should be considered inactive . <p> Again , this six-month time span is subject to variation across industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people purchase fairly frequently , six months is a good rule of thumb for inactivity . On the other hand , you may sell something that people only purchase very infrequently , like mattresses , so you 'll want to extend the timing to a year or more . <p> You may also sell something that you know only lasts a certain amount of time , like candles . If you know your candles will only burn for three months with typical use , you may want to send your welcome series after four months . Knowing your products is a prerequisite for being able to determine how often customers will purchase them , so make sure you understand how customers use- your products . <p> You can dig into your customers ' purchase data to see how often the average customer purchases and base the timing of your win-back series on this information , too . If you find that the vast majority of your customers make a second purchase no later than four months after their first , adjust your win-back series accordingly . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of inactivity as your baseline and test the timing to determine what converts the best . <h> How Many Emails to Send and When to Send Them <p> We recommend that you send three emails in your win-back series . As I mentioned above , your first email should be sent around six months after a customer has become inactive ( i.e. has n't purchased or opened an email ) . <p> Your next two win-back emails should be sent within a week of the first . I 'll discuss the content you should include in your win-back series in more depth in a later post , but you should include a sense of urgency in your win-back emails if you 're offering a discount or other incentive to your customers . For this reason , send your second win-back email two days after the first , and the third two days after the second . <h> Conclusion <p> Win-back emails are at the cornerstone of customer retention . No matter what you sell , you should absolutely send a win-back series to try to get existing customers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend on your particular business , but start sending your win-back series six months after a customer goes inactive and then test different send times from this baseline . 47562 @qwx907562 <p> A great feature to add to Klaviyo would be identifying the buying cycle of our customers so I know I 'm not sending these offers too early , especially in an industry where driving the price to the bottom is prevalent as it is . <p> I have seen this in action and it really helped me look at where our customers were dropping off . I imagine the data I had is now out of date and useless as it is at least a year old .

Once this historic- sync is complete , you will see a green border around your OpenCart integration in you account 's Enabled Integrations tab . <p> We will automatically sync all historic order data . To verify this , you can compare the number of event on a particular day in Klaviyo with what 's in your OpenCart- interface and confirm they match . <p> For example , when exploring the Placed Order metric in your Klaviyo account's- Metrics- tab , you can mouse over yesterday 's data point or look at the table of data below the chart to see how many orders were reported yesterday .

@@96020628 @220628/ <h> Feature Spotlight : A Look Into Lists &amp; Segments <p> Marissa Petteruti October 13 , 2015 <p> Like multivariate testing , which we covered last week , lists and segments are at the core of Klaviyos functionality . Many other ESPs will charge you extra to segment lists , but Klaviyo offers the same features to all accounts " as such , lists and segments are some of our most-used and most useful features . Lists are static , and can be imported or exported into or from Klaviyo . They 're often used to collect names from signup forms and various other opt-in methods . Segments , on the other hand , are dynamic and change based on certain conditions and filters . <p> How Klaviyo 's Customers Use Lists &amp; Segments <p> Choosing a list or segment to target is a crucial step in setting up both flows and campaigns . One of the main benefits- of segments is that they allow for personalization based on the parameters you choose . <p> However , the way Klaviyo users- actually employ- lists and segments may surprise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few customers at a time , larger companies choose to alter their newsletters and send different versions to different segments . This may seem counterintuitive , as newsletters " often campaigns sent en masse " seem to require the least amount of personalization out of other regularly-sent emails . <p> ( Pictured : - two newsletters sent by Karmaloop to different segments within- two days ) . <p> The reason this is a common practice is because it 's effective . Apart from transactional emails , such as abandoned cart reminders or payment confirmations , newsletters account for the overwhelming majority of emails ecommerce companies send through Klaviyo . They 're typically one-offs , designed to be current and appealing to a broad audience . That said , if you sell many products or a large variety of products , it would make a lot of sense to segment your newsletters . For example , you could : <p> Make one newsletter geared towards men , and another towards women . <p> If you 're a department store , - you can customize your newsletters based on specific products people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bought shoes , make shoes the focus of the newsletter they 're sent , and likewise for people who have only bought other products . You can separate these by gender , too . <p> A number of Klaviyo customers , like Karmaloop , have found success in segmenting by brand . So , if you have a large subset of your mailing list who purchases from a specific brand , you may choose to send them a specific newsletter featuring said brand . <p> The same goes for different tiers of spenders " you might choose to offer different tiers different discounts or deals in order to entice them to buy . <p> What 's to Come- for Lists &amp; Segments <p> As we revamp our flows , the way you use lists and segments will evolve . With even more filtering options , you 'll be able to market more specifically .

@@96020631 @220631/ <h> How to Build Your Email List <p> Marissa Petteruti January 19 , 2016 <p> Since Klaviyo is an email marketing software , we often discuss best practices for campaigns and flows to make sure you 're getting the most out of our features . However , as you well know , you need to have contacts to market to before you employ any of these best practices . The larger your list size , the higher the impact each of your emails will have . So , it 's easy to see why list growth is an absolutely essential component of maximizing your email marketing revenue . You 're probably wondering , then , how to build your mailing list . <p> Klaviyo <p> Klaviyo offers three variations of list-building tools embedded signups , popups , and fly-outs . They 're all customizable and incredibly easy to set up . We outline how to configure all three in our docs , but here 's a quick breakdown of what each entails : <p> Embedded Signup : An embedded signup is usually placed in the header or footer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential subscribers can input their email addresses ( as opposed to a field for first name , last name , etc . ) . Alternatively , you may choose to have an entire page on your site dedicated to collecting email addresses , in which case you would use an embedded signup with several fields . Most companies typically include a simple embedded signup in the header or footer of- their site in addition to a popup or fly-out . <p> Popup : A popup is set to appear on a page after a designated amount of time , or when a website visitor scrolls to a certain area of the page . This is the most aggressive of the three options , since it blocks the entire page and requires visitors to take some action , whether it be subscribing or exiting the screen . <p> Fly-out : Similar to a popup , a fly-out will appear on a page after some specified amount of time , or when a site visitor scrolls to a specific point on a page . The key difference between the two is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but usually appears from the side or in the lower corner of the screen . Because of this , it 's less obtrusive and oftentimes a happy medium between an embedded signup and a popup . <p> With Klaviyo , you can customize the text , timing , colors , font , and button layout of your list-building tools . You can also add additional fields to collect more information ( in case you 'd like to create segments based on these data fields ) , but bear in mind that the more effort required to sign up , the less likely people are to do so . If you 'd like to customize these even further by adding images , for example , we integrate with a number of great products that specialize in email collection . Here are two integrations we highly recommend : <p> Both Justuno and SumoMe offer advanced customization options . Justuno allows users to add personalized messages to their promotions , and has special recovery features for abandoned cart pages . <p> Double vs . Single Opt-In <p> Which opt-in method is most effective is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts argue in favor of double opt-in because it usually leads to a more engaged list , while others advocate for single opt-in because it drives sheer numbers . <p> Single opt-in , because it is the path of least resistance , does indeed lead to more signups . However , since the the email addresses are n't verified , it can also lead to bounces ( if an address is incorrectly inputted ) or more emails being flagged as spam ( if subscribers were n't sure they actually wanted to subscribe ) . Many studies have been conducted to determine which option is better , and data shows that double opt-in leads to 40% higher email open rates ( source ) . - <p> Conclusion <p> Building your email list is the first step of organizing an effective email marketing strategy . Whether you choose double or single opt-in , you should make sure- you have an embedded signup form in the header or footer of your homepage , as well as a popup or fly-out to collect addresses . You should also include signup areas on your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Do you prefer popups or fly-outs ? Double or single opt-in ?

It points to a host name and not an IP address ( so different from an A Record ) . For example , if we wanted to point mail.domain.com to domain.com it would be better to do this with a CNAME record . If you have multiple subdomains , you can create multiple CNAME records pointing to the same A Record . That way if you ever change servers and the IP address changes , you will only need to change one A Record and the CNAME records will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for DomainKeys Identified Mail . It was designed to help ISPs prevent malicious email senders like phishers/spoofers who were sending emails to recipients by saying they are from a trusted brand ( think PayPal , Amazon or eBay schemes ) . It works by adding a digital signature to your email message that validates your domain name when an ESP like Gmail receives it . DKIM 's main purpose is to verify sender identity . <h> DMARC <p> DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication , Reporting and Conformance . Basically , the DMARC policy associated with an email tells an ISP where to place an email based on the SPF and DKIM results . SPF and DKIM must be implemented before a DMARC policy is put in place . DMARC records standardize what happens to your sent mail if the SPF and DKIM authentications fail from the receiving party . DMARC removes guesswork from the receiver 's handling of these failed messages , limiting or eliminating the user 's exposure to potentially fraudulent &amp; harmful messages . <h> Domain <p> This is the web address that users type into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP addresses computers use to connect to the internet . <h> DNS <p> Behind every email message there are settings that tell the mailbox provider - - like Gmail or Hotmail - who you are and if your messages can be trusted . These settings are your email domain 's DNS records . If these settings do n't align , mailbox providers are likely to block your messages from getting delivered because you look suspect . <p> DNS stands for Domain Name System . This system is essentially the " phone book of the Web " . When you update your DNS records , you can consider this the equivalent of updating your address in the web 's phonebook so that it 's possible to verify who you are when you send email . Examples of DNS records include , MX , SPF , DMARC , DKIM etc . <h> IMAP <p> Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) . This is the Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages on a server without having to download them to your local hard drive . Doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple computers . This is widely used by most email service providers. - <h> IP Address <p> The Internet Protocol ( IP ) address is a unique address that identifies other devices and computers on a network . There are two IP addressing standards IPv4 and IPv6 . IPv4 which is most widely used consists of a group of four numbers , each between 0 and 255 . For email purposes , a single IP address can be used or an IP range or pool can be used with multiple domains . In the latter case , the reputation of the IP is based on the overall performance of all senders who use it . <h> MX Record <p> An MX-record ( Mail eXchange-record ) contains the mail server that is responsible for accepting emails on behalf of the domain . <p> An example of an MX-record : <p> Domain : domain.com <p> MX : mail.domain.com <p> Priority : 10 <p> All emails sent to whoever@domain.com will be sent to the mail server mail.domain.com with the IP address 44.55.66.7777 . <h> SMTP <p> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet . Email clients use SMTP to send messages to a mail server and that mail server uses SMTP to send that message to the correct receiving mail server . Together , SMTP is a set of commands and rules that authenticate and direct the transfer of electronic mail . If you ever view the original code behind the sleek email you create , you 'll see the commands and instructions that SMTP uses to get your email into the inbox of your recipients . <h> SPF <p> When you start sending emails through a ESP like Klaviyo , you will be placed on a certain sending IP address that is associated with that ESP . This will raise a red flag for mailbox providers unless there is some setting that tells them this sending IP is allowed to send mail on your behalf . This is where the SPF record comes in as a simple email-validation system .

Not only can you show targeted ads to your subscribers using Custom Audiences , you can also show ads to potential new subscribers using Lookalike Audiences . This presents a huge opportunity to send more relevant ads and expand your brand awareness . Here are six- segments you should reach with your Facebook advertising : <h> 1 . Previously Viewed Products <p> Have you ever seen an ad for a product you were just looking at appear in your Facebook sidebar ? If you have , you 've experienced retargeting firsthand . In fact , customers who have been retargeted are 70 percent more likely to convert on your website . Showing subscribers images of products they have already seen will draw their attention and encourage them to give them a second look . <h> 2 . Product Category <p> You may already segment your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a particular category of products . If you sell leather goods and have a subset of customers who have only ever purchased wallets , for instance , this is a good indicator that wallets are the product category these customers are most interested in . So , to deliver a more relevant message to these customers , feature wallets in the Facebook ads they 're shown . <p> You may also already create segments based on customers ' profiles . Unlike product category segmentation , these subscribers do n't necessarily need to have purchased in order for you to show them more targeted ads . <p> Segmenting based on customer type is great for Lookalike Audiences , too . Since you 'll already be narrowing the pool of user profiles based on a specific metric , these ads will resonate well with people who are similar to your existing subscribers . <h> 4 . Upsell or Cross-Sell <p> If you have a particular product or set of products that you know is popular , you can upsell or cross-sell other products based on this information .

@@96020640 @220640/ <h> How to Drive Customer Reviews <p> Marissa Petteruti June 24 , 2016 <p> Customer reviews are a huge asset in any ecommerce marketer 's tool shed . Positive reviews add social proof to your products , which in turn helps you sell them and the more positive reviews , the better . Studies have shown that product reviews can lead to as much as an 18% increase in sales . But how do you get happy customers to share their feedback ? There are several ways you can go about encouraging customers to review your products using both email and other marketing channels ( think social media ) . <h> 1 . Just Ask <p> The most direct method of generating reviews is simply asking your customers . One of the biggest benefits of sending email is that it provides you with a 1:1 channel to speak to your customers . As part of your post-purchase email series , you can include an email that asks customers about their experience buying from you and request feedback . <p> The key point to keep in mind when implementing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to leave a review . Refresh customers ' memories by including a photo of what they purchased , and also include a direct link to your reviews page in your main CTA . To further streamline this process , you can even opt for a star rating system in lieu of asking for written reviews . <p> Also be sure you do n't  send you product review too soon after a customer has purchased a product , since they might not have had a chance to try it out yet . Send your product review email within a week of an items delivery . <h> 2 . Incentivize <p> To give your customers an extra push to review , you can offer an incentive . There are a few ways you can go about incentivizing your customers to review : <p> Contest Running a contest is a great way to drive engagement . For example , you could reward the customer who leaves the highest number of reviews . Alternatively , you could give a prize to one of your customers and draw only from a pool of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process will drive engagement everyone loves a bit of friendly competition . <p> Feature the Best Reviews If you display reviews elsewhere on your site ( i.e. your homepage , website footer , etc. ) , you can encourage customers to review by calling out the fact that they could be featured on your site . Depending on your customer base and the products you sell , this can act as an incentive because customers will receive special attention and acknowledgement from you on an individual level . Furthermore , it gets their own name out there . <p> Reward Customers Who Leave Reviews with an Exclusive Offer Provide customers who leave a review with something of value . This can come in many different forms , such as a free gift with their next purchase , a discount on their next purchase , or early access to an upcoming sale . <p> Offering an incentive is a great- way to ramp up the number of reviews you get if you 're not receiving as many as you would like to . <h> 3 . Leverage Your Social Networks <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Instagram , you can use social media as a channel to drive reviews . If you are trying to generate reviews for a specific product , you can post to social media asking your followers who 've purchased this product to reviews . In addition , you can create ads asking customers to review- this product and display them on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram. <h> 4 . Get Testimonials from Influencers <p> Getting famous industry leaders or celebrities to endorse your products is a very effective way of driving engagement , since it adds social proof . Reach out to influencers in your field and offer them one of your products for free in exchange for a testimonial . You can quote them on your site or , if they have a large social media following , ask them to feature your product on their account . <h> A Note : What to do with Negative Reviews <p> As you receive more reviews , you will inevitably encounter some negative ones . It is important to leave these up to foster transparency , but you should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsive to their concerns , and this can also be a learning experience . - Addressing to negative reviews gives you an opportunity to get to the bottom of what went wrong with an individual customer 's experience and improve as a business . <h> Conclusion <p> Product reviews are an important part of any ecommerce marketing strategy . Encourage customers to review using targeted emails , social media posts , and ads . This way , you can reach each subset of your audience in a way that is most convenient for them some customers who do n't open your emails might be more likely to respond to ads , and vice versa . For an extra push , you can incentivize your customers to review using contests and exclusive offers . 47562 @qwx907562 <p> For example : 1 . ) Customer opens review e-mail . 2 . ) In the e-mail , there is a section like this which has a form for comments and stars for ratings . 3 . ) Customer fills out form and puts in stars and presses post . 4 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hey , Darren .

@@96020642 @220642/ <p> The Internet has something to learn from dentists . Every dentist Ive ever been to is a master of getting me to come back . They send me notes in the mail , call me , give me little gifts as a I leave their office with their phone numbers on them , and their staff usually know my name . <p> When I buy something online , its different . Most of the time , I do n't  hear anything from the store whether its a thank you for purchasing , an email letting me know new products have come out that are similar to what I bought , or a discount or free gift for coming back . The thing is , financially , - one of your most valuable assets as an Ecommerce store is your community of existing customers . <p> Once you 've already paid to acquire customers , getting them to come back is way easier ( and way more profitable ) than acquiring customers initially ; however , amidst efforts to grow sales and traffic , the value of customer retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like going , dentists are one step ahead . <h> Using Segmentation to Understand Retention <p> The first step for most stores is to understand what your customer retention currently looks like. - We recommend segmenting your customers in 3 ways : <p> Purchasers : Everyone who made their first purchase 6-12 months ago . <p> Next , you 'll create two subsets of that list : <p> One-time purchasers : Everyone who made their first purchase 6-12 months ago and have only bought once ever . <p> Return purchasers : Everyone who made their first purchase 6-12 months ago and have bought at least two times in the last year ( but did n't buy before the last 12 months ) <p> You can also calculate this by subtracting the one-time purchasers from the overall number of first-time purchasers . <p> I chose the 6-12 month time period because for most stores , this is long enough for people to have come back and made a second purchase ( And if they have n't come back , they are unlikely to ) . - Based on what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . <p> If you 're a Klaviyo user , well be adding resources in the Academy for you to help get started with customer retention . <h> Analyzing Ecommerce Customer Retention <p> At this point , you have what you need to calculate retention rate : <p> Return purchasers / Overall number of purchasers <p> This number serves two purposes : <p> It 's what you 're trying to increase . Focusing on increasing this number helps you understand how retention is changing over time . <p> It indicates the opportunity. - Say you doubled this percentage . Would that materially impact your business ? - ( A simple back of the envelope way to calculate this is to take the number of return purchasers and multiply it by your average order size . ) . <p> The remarkable thing about this retention rate is that these customers are significantly more profitable than typical customers . Imagine your cost of getting a new customer was $10 and the average purchase had gross margin of $15. - In this hypothetical model , one-time purchasers would generate $5 of profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times greater than a one-time buyer . <p> While most Ecommerce stores do have major opportunities to increase retention , there are certain types of business where retention will always be lower " for example , stores that sell products someone only buys once that also have a limited product range ( think wedding invitations ( for the most part ) or stores that sell a single item that lasts forever ) . That said , even those stores have a major opportunity to encourage past customers to refer friends . <h> 5 Ways to Increase Customer Retention with Email- <h> 1 . ) Use targeted win-back campaigns <p> Setup 2-3 emails that go out to customers who bought once over all time but have n't come back . - A few pointers : <p> Keep them short and simple. - These emails are meant to stand out from the typical emails you send customers. - For this reason , many companies use either text emails or a very basic template . <p> Use discounts ( but somewhat sparingly ) . For customers who you believe are n't coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount . <p> Be Personal . Unlike a newsletter , each customer wo n't get more than a handful of emails like this from. - Given this , it 's a good opportunity to be a bit more personal than you might normally be . You can do this by sending it from a person , by including pictures of what they bought , or by just using a personal tone . <p> For Klaviyo users , you 'll see a set of pre-made win-back campaigns on the Ideas tab . <h> 2 . ) Send a newsletter consistently <p> Newsletters keep your newest products in front of your customers and keep you top of mind . Too often , customers do n't come back and buy because they do n't even think to revisit your store . For most stores , one of the most effective steps is to send a newsletter weekly . <h> 3 . ) Referral programs <p> Once you 've identified customers who have bought more than once , use them as a way to market to new customers . By sending a targeted campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging them to recommend a friend , you can turn these customers into advocates . <h> 4 . ) Recognize your Loyal Customers <p> Full-scale loyalty programs like SLoyalty are great , but you can also use email to take an initial step . Once a customer buys for the first time , automate a thank you message. - Once they buy a second time , send a message calling out how much you appreciate them . Going forward , you may even want to consider sending special campaigns or offers to those customers first . <h> 5 . ) Get to Know your Best Customers <p> In addition to marketing campaigns , you can also use your most loyal customers as a community to learn from and to support. - One idea is to send a survey to these customers asking about new products they 'd like , asking for ideas , or holding targeted events . If you ran an off-line business , youd naturally get to know these customers but there 's no reason you ca n't use email to build the same types of relationships with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a very small store , start by focusing on your newsletter .

@@96020648 @220648/ <h> Designing Email Sucks : A Brief history And How Were Making It Better <p> Andrew Bialecki June 17 , 2014 <p> We spend a lot of time helping people improve their email . And over time we 've become acutely aware of the reasons why creating and designing emails is a hard process . Frankly , it kind of sucks . But- why its difficult thats- important . Because if we know- what makes it so- hard , we can probably solve those problems and- make the process less painful , maybe even enjoyable . Over the next- few weeks , were going to run a series of posts about why designing and creating emails is- hard and some ways to make it better . First up : - why even scaffolding- a basic template layout sucks . <h> Email is just HTML . From 1999 . <p> The nice- thing about email is that its " basically " HTML . If you 've designed emails before , you 're probably gnashing your teeth at that last sentence . Basically HTML ? More like barely HTML . There are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't spent a lot of time with email , here 's the situation . Just like- how you 'd design a web page and need to worry about different browsers , the same is true for email , except its not just browsers , its email clients . For web designers , this used to be a really big pain- five or 10 years ago. - Thankfully , standards- like HTML 5 and the eventual decline and death of some very old browsers- has made the situation much better . However , in the world of email , were still stuck in- the past with different email clients behaving in very different ways . There have been been efforts to create email standards , but we just have n't seen the same- progress . <p> For all other email clients , as browsers have improved their support of various HTML and CSS features- in- their underlying rendering engines , theyve- improved right along side . And a few older email clients ( looking at you Blackberry ) - are- dead or dying . <p> However , with Microsofts decision to use- Words rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSS features is likely to be stuck for quite some time . Since Outlook still has lots of users , you 're stuck working with- the lower common denominator . And so the differences between email clients and how they render emails will likely grow . <h> How to solve cross client compatibility <p> Its a frustrating situation that HTML and CSS support in email clients is where it is , but- it is n't hopeless. - In fact , if you follow- the strategies web developers took to deal with cross browser issues , you- can dramatically reduce the pain . Looking back , there were two big pieces to their strategy ( other than waiting it out ) : <p> Build frameworks- that automatically account for those differences so they 're largely abstracted away from framework users . <p> Remember Quirksmode.org ? I rarely spend time there anymore , thanks mostly to the fact that I no longer spend a lot of time worrying about- IE 6/7/8 and early- versions of Firefox . Its still a great resource- for understanding browser compatibility , especially on mobile , but its just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , I spend more- time on caniuse.com- for checking HTML 5 feature support. - Its another- great repository of what browsers can and cant do . But , honestly , I do n't  use that very often anymore either . <p> Aside from browsers getting better , one reason- is that- the rise of CSS frameworks and JavaScript shims has- smoothed out the differences between browsers to the point that there are few features I cant use without some reasonable fallback . Everyones heard of- and probably used Bootstrap . Its clearly a framework that fits that bill . But , for the record , even pre-Bootstrap , I was using- Compass and SASS a year- or so before for the same reasons. - Instead of having to know what the quirks or incompatibilities are , these- frameworks abstract away- the- issues , which makes- development much easier . <p> So the whole process went from- great- websites- that could tell you definitively- why something did n't  look right in a given- browser to frameworks that took those quirks and made them almost completely transparent to- developers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in email . Great resources ? There are plentyofthem- and I 'm sure Im leaving some out . Frameworks ? These have just started to emerge in the last year or so , but they 're starting to- pick- upspeed . And- that 's where we stand today . <p> In surveying email frameworks that exist so far , there are lots of features you want. - One of the first and most important- is a way to- scaffold an email so you can then focus on different areas . Some sort of grid system . Existing email frameworks are a good start , but they do n't  go far enough to abstract the table-itis , not to mention indent-itis , you 're likely to get from actually building a template. - They- still require you to a steady stream of- &lt;table&gt;s , &lt;tr&gt;s and &lt;td&gt;s to create- your email , which is kind of a bummer . <p> The peaks and valleys of email design . <p> If you step back , what would be really great- is an email framework that let 's me think in terms of- &lt;div&gt;s and then compiles- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely have to look at . I could build semantic HTML that I can easily edit and preview in a regular web browser and when Im done , have the peace of mind knowing itll compile into HTML that will look the same and consistent across all email clients even Outlook . You can imagine it would be a little like Bootstrap ( because itd have semantic classes to create a grid and various components ) and a little like LESS or SASS ( because it would take your simpler HTML- and compile it to the final , nastier , but cross client compatible version ) . <p> So why does n't  that exist ? I think its only a matter of time . And we want to help push that effort forward so were working on it right now- ( its internally coded named Mailstrap ) . Were most of the way there towards something releasable , but to give everything- a thorough testing , weve- made it the underlying rendering engine- for our standalone , - drag and drop email template builder. - The templates you generate have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all major email clients- and are- mobile ready- out of the box . Once weve exterminated- the last few bugs and built out- the- docs , we plan on releasing that project on its own . <p> In the meantime , you can create- just about any email layout today with our email template builder and use it however you like . You can export the HTML to edit- it - by hand and use it in your projects . You can- render and send templates via our Email Templates API- or use- Klaviyo or another- email service- to send it . <p> Create any combination of rows and column , automatically optimized for mobile . <p> Up next , were going to discuss CSS inliners why they 're crucial- for email and what features- they- need to ensure- they preserve your contents layout- across mobile and web based clients . Oh , and if you want updates on " Mailstrap , " keep an eye on this blog , well be announcing more soon . 
@@96020649 @220649/ <h> Conversion Tracking <h> Conversion Tracking <p> For each campaign and flow email sent , Klaviyo automatically tracks conversions . A conversion is defined as a recipient opening an email- and then taking another action ( such as placing an order ) - within the conversion period . <p> By default , the conversion period is 5- days , but this setting can be adjusted in your- account 's email settings . <p> For example , if someone opened your weekly newsletter and then made a purchase later that day , a conversion would be recorded for that email . There are a few important notes about conversion tracking : <p> Conversion tracking uses a last touch attribution model , meaning only the last email someone opened or clicked is credited with a conversion <p> Conversions are only tracked if someone opens or clicks an email ; conversions are not tracked if someone receives an email but does n't engage with it <p> The conversion period you set is important -- when an email is received , the conversion period starts , but a conversion is only counted if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order ) ; if your conversion period is 5 days , and someone opens an email 10 days after receiving it and places an order , the conversion wo n't be- attributed to the email <h> Why does Klaviyo track conversions in this way ? <p> Conversion tracking that relies on pixels can be unreliable . For example , if someone reads an email on their phone but makes a purchase later from their home laptop , conversion tracking that relies on pixel tracking would miss that conversion . Klaviyo does not use pixels , so the conversion analytics are more accurate . Instead , Klaviyo calculates conversions based on data directly from a built-in integration or our API. - <p> You also do not need to decide in advance which metric you want to focus on for conversion tracking . While most other platforms only track revenue conversions , Klaviyo automatically computes conversion analytics for all metrics in your account . <p> An ecommerce business , for example , will likely focus on the number of purchases that occurred as a direct result of an email . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one product page or started a checkout after receiving an email , you can view this conversion data as well . This allows you to compare the impact of different campaigns across different performance standards . <h> Open and Click Tracking <p> Klaviyo tracks open events by placing a tiny , invisible pixel image at the bottom of every email . When an email is opened by the recipient , we record this invisible pixel ( web beacon ) as " viewed " and mark the email as opened . This method of open tracking is the industry standard . Because of this , it is possible ( in rare cases ) for a recipient to " click " and email without " opening " it , if they click a link before the email loads completely . <p> Klaviyo tracks click activity by adding unique tracking information to each URL . This is why , when hovering over a link in a Klaviyo email , you may see the URL begin with the following : - LONG ... <p> If you see multiple opens or clicks attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwarded the email to someone else , or that they simply opened/clicked the email multiple times . <h> Email to Website Tracking <p> When you add the Klaviyo web tracking snippet to your site , we are only able to track these events for " known browsers . " There are a few different ways we will be able to identify a site visitor for web tracking purposes : <p> When you have email to website tracking enabled- and have Klaviyo 's main web tracking snippet on your website , Klaviyo will be able to identify and cookie individuals that click through a Klaviyo email and then end up browsing your website <p> When someone has , at some point , subscribed/opted-in through a Klaviyo form , our web tracking code will cookie this person at time of opt-in <p> You can toggle on and off Klaviyo 's ability to track email to website activity in your account 's email settings : <p> We add an additional parameter to all URLs in your email to track activity . This is the ke parameter . The unique encoded value here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the user that clicked through the URL . <p> This parameter is automatically appended and will not impact the load times of your URLs nor break any URLs based on its placement . <h> Klaviyo and Google Analytics <p> Why Klaviyo 's conversion data might not match Google Analytics ? - Because Google Analytics uses pixel tracking while Klaviyo uses data directly from your database , it 's likely the analytics between both services wo n't align . Here are a few commons scenarios where Google Analytics and other pixel-based tracking systems will not record a conversion : <p> A subscriber receives an email , reads it , does not click on a link , but goes to your store and makes a purchase . Google Analytics does n't know they read your email , but Klaviyo does . <p> A subscriber receives an email , reads it , clicks on a link from their phone . They wait until later to complete their purchase and they complete the purchase from their laptop instead of their phone . In this case , Google Analytics does not record a conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not on their laptop . Klaviyo tracks the conversion by stitching together the customer 's activity and noticing which email they read before making their purchase . <p> Because of this fundamental difference , we recommend deferring to Klaviyo 's conversion analytics . If you feel Klaviyo 's conversion period is too generous , you can update it on the- account settings- page . <p> It is also important to note that Google Analytics will count a conversion anytime someone clicks an email and then goes to make a purchase -- there is no " conversion period " here . Our conversion tracking , on the other hand , uses a last touch attribution model . This means only the last email someone opened or clicked is credited with a conversion . The last open or click must be within your established conversion period to count . <h> Appending UTM Variables to Emails <p> When creating a campaign or flow in Klaviyo , you can check the- Add Google Analytics tracking to links- box to have Klaviyo add the following UTM variables to your email . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - listorsegmentname <p> utmcampaign : - campaignname- ( campaignid ) <p> For flows : <p> utmmedium : - email <p> utmsource : - flowname <p> utmcampaign : - flowemailname- ( flowemailid ) <p> For example , if you have a flow called- Welcome Series- and the first email is named- Intro to our Brand- and the flow email I 'd is- ABCDEF , the following UTM variables would be added to links : <p> utmmedium : - email <p> utmsource : - Welcome Series <p> utmcampaign : - Intro to our Brand ( ABCDEF ) <p> Keep in mind that in Google Analytics , all of the UTM variables will be lowercased automatically .

If you 're following our list growth best practices , odds are your list is growing pretty quickly too , which is great ! The thing is , the faster your list grows , the easier it is for your contacts to become disorganized . When you add a number of different lists and segments to the mix , things can get out of hand quickly . Follow these three steps to make sure your email list stays neat and tidy . <h> 1 . Periodically Clean Your Email List <p> Spring cleaning does n't just mean dusting off the top of your bookshelf or power-washing your driveway . Your email list is constantly in a state of flux people subscribe and unsubscribe every day ( if you 're marketing properly , one happens more frequently than the other ) . Plus , not all the email addresses you accrue are going to be valid , and the larger your email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . <p> Every six months or so , you should create a segment of subscribers who have n't opened one of your emails within six months of signing up and have n't made a purchase . Frequently emailing subscribers who are n't opening your emails increases your risk of being marked as spam , since some email clients , like Gmail , learn to filter emails into the spam folder based on whether or not an individual typically opens emails from this sender . <p> These inactive subscribers should be removed from your active mailing list and given special attention . If you keep sending them emails they are n't opening , you risk having them unsubscribe altogether . Try using a win-back flow to re-engage these subscribers . <p> To learn more about the logistics of cleaning your email list , check out our list cleaning doc . <h> 2 . Remove Suppressed Subscribers from Your Segments <p> Suppressed subscribers are subscribers who have unsubscribed or hard bounced , usually because their email address is invalid . In all of the segments you send to , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't send to suppressed contacts to minimize your risk of spam complaints , removing suppressed subscribers from your segments will give you a more accurate headcount of who 's getting your emails. - <h> 3 . Use Folders to Keep Your Lists and Segments Organized <p> As you become more sophisticated in your email marketing strategy , you 'll start to accumulate a large number of lists and segments . Some may be one-off segments that you only sent one campaign to , but odds are you reuse the same few segments frequently . <p> Organizing segments and sub-segments into folders based on their purpose will help you keep them straight . For example , you may have your master newsletter list , a master newsletter segment that excludes your suppressed subscribers , a daily newsletter segment based on your subscribers ' preferences , and so on . You can easily have upwards of five segments for the same purpose , so keep them organized using folders . <h> Conclusion <p> A healthy email list requires a little bit of maintenance . Now that spring has sprung , take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and segments . Make sure you 're not sending to people who are n't interested or do n't want to receive your emails , since this will increase the chances of these people unsubscribing ( or worse , marking you as spam ) . While this organization will take some time upfront , it will make life easier for you in the long run . 47562 @qwx907562 <p> People join my list from a klavio form .

Brand-Focused Abandoned Cart Emails <p> Marissa Petteruti January 12 , 2016 <p> Abandoned carts are by and large the largest drivers of revenue for our customers . Weve posted some stats on abandoned carts already , but , to refresh your memory , the average Klaviyo makes $6.50 per abandoned cart email . While the purpose of an abandoned cart may seem straightforward , - these- emails- are more than just a platform to persuade customers to buy products they 've already indicated interest in . Customers open abandoned carts- we 've recorded average open rates of 65-70% and click rates of 7-12% , which email marketers will recognize as far above the percentages of an average campaign . So , what content makes up a successful abandoned cart email ? <p> While you should certainly include images and product names , quantities , and maybe brief descriptions , there are two main tones your abandoned cart emails can take : product-focused or brand-focused . <p> Product-Focused Abandoned Cart <p> A product-focused abandoned cart email is exactly what it sounds like . The primary focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-and-center in the email . Include a navigation bar similar or equivalent to the one you use on your main site in case customers would like to browse other products ( in the event that they actually did lose interest in their cart ) , but make sure that the abandoned items are at the top of the email and before the scroll . A strong call to action is also an essential component , since you should make it- incredibly easy for your customers continue the checkout process . <p> Along with images , you should include quantity , color , size , and any other relevant details . Typically , abandoned carts also display individual item and total prices directly in the email , but you may choose to only include the price on the official checkout page . One advantage to displaying prices directly in the email is that you can clearly highlight any potential discounts or deals , like free shipping . <p> You should view the remainder of the email as an opportunity to upsell or cross-sell related or similar products . Product recommendations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to include a contact link , so customers can get in touch with your support team if they have any questions regarding shipping , pricing , or other product details . <p> Brand-Focused Abandoned Cart <p> A brand-focused abandoned cart email is less clearly defined , and can take several different forms . Some do n't even display the items a shopper has left in his or her cart , but instead focus on brand philosophy and simply include a link back to the cart webpage . Others place a primary focus on support , and include a contact link in the forefront of the email and display the abandoned items further down on the page . <p> Whether or not this approach is appropriate for your business can be somewhat dependent on your industry if you are selling something that you anticipate your customers might have questions about prior to purchase ( a motorcycle , for example ) , putting a support link at the top of your email will facilitate the sales process . <p> Conclusion <p> Depending on how many abandoned cart emails you choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . If you choose to send two , for example , you can make the first one product-focused and the second one brand-focused , with a sense of urgency . You can convey- a sense of urgency with a subject line like , " Your cart is about to expire , " or " Only 2 days left for free shipping . " While it- may be tempting to incentivize customers with a discount or coupon- code , be wary of this technique- repeat customers may wise up and deliberately leave items in their carts to get a discount . <p> Soon , we will be releasing an ebook that offers a comprehensive guide to abandoned cart best practices , so stay tuned ! 47562 @qwx907562

The first step to adding external content to an email in Klaviyo is defining a web feed . A custom web feed is a URL you specify that contains the data for the content you want to add to your emails . Before sending an email , Klaviyo makes an HTTP request to the URL and fetches the data . The content of the web feed is then available for use in your email . <p> The power of web feeds is that they allow you to use a single template , but update the content used to render that template , so each email or campaign is different per send or even per recipient . <p> The most common use of this Web Feed feature is auto-populating campaign emails with recent posts from your blog. - <h> Note <p> Please note that Klaviyo 's custom web feed feature is only available for campaigns currently . It is not possible to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Adding a Custom Web Feed <p> To add a web feed , navigate to the- Data Feeds tab. - If you have n't added a data feed before , you 'll see a screen like this : <p> Click- Add Web Feed . <p> You need to populate the following fields : <p> Feed Name : - the identifier you- use in your template to access the feed contents . Give your feed a short descriptive name . We recommend naming feeds either in camel case ( e.g. " MyDataFeed " ) or all uppercase with spaces replaced by underscores ( e.g. " MYDATAFEED " ) . For example , if you were adding a data feed of popular tourist attractions , you could name your feed " **25;433;TOOLONG " or " **25;460;TOOLONG . " <p> Request Method : - specifies the HTTP method that will be used to request your feed . We generally recommend GET , but you can also specify POST . <p> Content Type : - specifies the format of the feed . The supported types are JSON and XML . We recommend using JSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be converted to JSON . <p> Once you 've filled out all the fields , click- Add Data Feed . <p> Klaviyo validates your feed and shows any potential errors . Once validated you see your feed in Klaviyo and it 's ready to be used in emails . <h> Previewing your Web Feed <p> It 's useful to preview a web feed before adding it to an email . To do this , click the Edit dropdown menu and select- Preview . <p> On the next page , you 'll see a preview of the content in your feed . If your feed is a JSON array , we 'll automatically parse and show each row individually . If it 's anything else , most likely a JSON dictionary , we 'll show the entire dictionary . <p> If you are actively developing your feed , you can use the- Refresh Feed- button to pull the latest version of your feed . The preview page for a feed shows the entire feed . If your feed is large , it can take several seconds to display the contents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents , it 's time to use it in a campaign . <h> Using a Web Feed in a Campaign <p> First , create a new email campaign . Once you 've selected a template and are editing the email body , you can add one or more feeds to your campaign . In the footer of the email editor , click the- Data Feeds- link . Select the web feed- you want to include in- your campaign . <h> Note <p> Klaviyo will fetch each feed once per campaign send , and store the returned content . Even if you 're sending to thousands of recipients , Klaviyo wo n't make thousands of requests to your servers . <h> Populating Feed Content in your Template <p> JSON Array <p> In our example web feed , we have an array of locations where each entry includes a name , description and image . After a feed is added to a campaign , it 's available through the- feeds variable . <p> For example , for the JSON feed above , we can now reference or output the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> **29;487;TOOLONG <p> Let 's run through an example where we iterate over all entries in the array , displaying certain variables . We 'll use the PopularTouristLocations feed as an example here , and iterate over Name and Description . <p> Step One : - Insert a new Text Block <p> Step Two : - Turn on " Repeat Block " Feature for Text Block <p> To do this , click on the small hamburger- icon in the upper right-hand corner of the text block . <p> For the- Repeat For field , insert : feeds.YOUR FEED <p> For the- Item Alias field , insert : item <p> Make sure to toggle this feature from OFF to ON before clicking- Save .

Klaviyo 's new click maps will show you which links your customers clicked most often , and help you visualize how they interacted with your campaigns . On the composition side of campaign sending , our new plain text editing feature will ensure that all of your emails are formatted exactly the way you want them . <p> Click Maps <p> Understanding how people respond to your campaigns is a key step in optimizing them , especially if your emails containing leading links to your products , website , etc . Our new click maps will display the concentration of traffic for each link in your emails , which will help you understand your- recipients ' mindsets as they scrolled through the email . Once you go to the Link Activity ' tab of your campaign , you will be able to view clicks in a table or visual format . The table displays clicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports and will clearly outline the number of clicks per link . <p> Our visual click maps , on the other hand , put these reports into context and are super intuitive , since they display the exact email you sent to your customers . When you hover over a link , you 'll be able to see the URL and the percentage of total clicks each link represents . <p> If you have two separate links leading to the same URL , we will aggregate the percentage of total clicks . Let 's take a look at our email from last week : <p> As you can see here , both the image and Read More ' button linked to the same URL , so they each represent 99% of the aggregate clicks . <p> Determining which links are most popular will allow you to edit the content and layout of your emails accordingly . For example , if the links towards the top of the page are clicked most frequently , you can try running an A/B test to see what changes might lead to more clicks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate the links towards the top of the page , and another in which you simply shorten the entire email . Once you see how they perform , you can alter the rest of your campaigns accordingly . <p> Plain Text Editing <p> Now that you 'll have the ability to edit the plain text of your emails before you send them , you can be absolutely positive that your text , images , and other content are laid out exactly as you 'd like . You 'll see this option on the review page before you send your campaign , under HTML Email . ' Simply select Edit ' and you 'll be brought to a page where you can alter the format of your campaign .

@@96020691 @220691/ <h> 4 Tips to Improve your eCommerce Abandoned Cart Emails <p> edhallen February 26 , 2013 <p> With many estimates saying that 50% of shopping carts are abandoned before purchases are completed , we believe that sending email follow-ups to customers who leave your store before their purchase is complete is a requirement of any eCommerce email marketer . <p> Here are some tips for getting started : <h> 1 . - Use Abandoned Carts to address why customers are n't buying <p> Your abandoned cart emails are your chance to reach out to customers and convince them to buy " so one of the best things you can do is to think like your customer and address the concerns that may have kept them from buying . <p> - For example , take this email from Best Buy : - - <p> Rather than highlighting products immediately , they focus on : <p> Help topics : in case the customer needed assistance <p> Store Pickup : In case the customer turned away because they wanted items sooner <p> Price Match : In case the customer was worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large Free Shipping image in the banner in case the customer was worried about shipping costs <p> You 'll probably want to address different concerns of your store " maybe it 's fit , maybe it 's better understanding the product , or maybe it 's price. - Either way , think like the customer and knock down those barriers keeping them from purchasing. - <h> 2. - Be helpful " not just sales-focused <p> Across abandoned cart emails that work well , a key theme we see is striking the right tone . Focus on being helpful and providing value to your potential customer " after all , at the end of the day , what 's good for your customer should be good for you too . <p> As an example , take this email from William-Sonoma . Most of the text in the email focuses either A. ) on saying thank you and B. ) on offering to help. - The surrounding pictures highlight other reasons to purchase , but this combination strikes a great balance . <p> Another great example is in the Best Buy email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying thank you . <h> 3. - Work up to a discount <p> While discounts are nearly always appreciated by your customers , they do n't have to be the first step for your abandoned cart emails " especially because a large number of the reasons customers abandon their cart have nothing to do with price . <p> A good solution is to make your abandoned carts emails a 2-3 email series that starts with just a reminder to have customers come back , and then a few days later sends a small discount or free shipping offer if they have n't yet come back and purchased . <p> Additionally , we 'd also recommend you be careful with discounts so customers do n't get used to them . One way to do this is to use a few conditions to control who gets the discount emails . For example : <p> Only send discounts to a particular customer once <p> Only send discounts to first-time purchasers and mention the fact that it 's because it 's their first purchase- <h> 4. - Highlight other products <p> Another great tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This accomplishes two things : <p> Showing the customer additional products they might want that might convince them add additional items to the purchase and complete their order <p> Showing the customer related products to what 's in the cart in case the initial product was n't exactly the right fit <p> As an example , this abandoned cart email from Sears focuses on the alternatives to what 's in the cart " and highlights that they are the top-sellers . <p> Most importantly , get started ! Klaviyos email marketing platform makes abandoned carts ( and all of your eCommerce emails ) easy to setup and effective and shows you the real impact you 're having on purchases .

@@96020701 @220701/ <p> The next step could be opening up a physical store . After all , about 95% of purchases are still completed offline , and offering your product in a physical setting could be a change to reach a new audience . While new sales opportunities- like this are always exciting , they do n't  come without risks . Rent costs , supplying the inventory , - and the idea of competing with major retailers can all be pretty intimidating to say the least . Luckily , - its ok to have a fear of commitment <h> What Are Pop-Up Shops ? <p> Pop-up shops are temporary store-fronts that companies set up to generate buzz and sales . A few examples of pop-up shop spaces include : <p> " Shops within shops " , or taking over sections of larger stores that have similar audiences <p> Art galleris <p> Mall kiosks <p> Festivals , fairs , and concerts <p> Farmers markets <p> Vacant street level retail space ( you may be able to get a short term lease ) <p> Pop-up shops allow you to see how offline sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pocket , you can go into- long term strategies regarding brick and mortars with more ease . <h> How to- Select the Kind of Pop-Up Shop You Will Do <p> How you select your pop-up shop location boils down to three things : your goals , the location , and the spaces features . <p> Your goals - What are you trying to do with this little experiment ? <p> Are you launching a brand ? <p> Are you announcing a new product ? <p> Are you simply testing a new sales channel with your existing product ? <p> Are you offering a sample sale ? <p> Once you define exactly what you are doing with this physical retail space , then you can narrow down what the idea space would look like from there . <p> Location - The next thing to consider is location . Think about what your target audience needs in a location . If you sell to moms who may be shopping with children , close proximity to parking is ideal . <p> Features - Next , think about other features you want in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms ? If you sell- hand soaps , your customers will need a sink where they can try them out . <h> How to Market Your Pop-Up Shop <p> Its- important to keep your message specific , - consistent , and to deliver it in a multi-channel way. - From social media , to advertising , to PR , all of these- marketing channels should be used cohesively to reinforce- what you are trying to say . <h> Your Pop-Up Shop PR Strategy <p> Local media outlets like Racked and Wicked Local- cover pop-up shops all of the time . In addition , bloggers may be willing to cover your pop-up shop or come pay a visit. - Some good places to find bloggers that may be interested in covering your pop-up shop include : <p> In addition to finding general influencers in your topic , finding local bloggers is especially important . Just about every city has a local bloggers group of some sort . You can find this- by Googling- " city name AND bloggers. " - The benefit of getting in touch with someone local is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers are in your area , those readers are more likely to stop by your pop-up shop . Therefore you 'll get much more than simply page views from your media coverage . <h> Your Pop-Up Shop Social Media Strategy <p> Facebook and Twitter - The local ad targeting capabilities of Facebook and Twitter- let- you promote your pop-up shop in a focused way . To track the conversion rates of those campaigns , you can share a Facebook-only or Twitter-only coupon- code with those followers for them to redeem in store . Count up the sales from specifically those coupon codes , and you can see how those ads converted into sales . <p> In addition to ad targeting on Facebook , Facebook events are another way- for gathering local customers . However , I 'd proceed with caution . This could just be me , but- with all of the birthday party events and clumsy " I lost- my phone and need your number ! " invitations over the years , I think Facebook events are- losing their luster . <p> Instagram- Instagram is highly visual , highly targeted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel for promoting- your pop-up shop . <p> Create a series of posts leading up to the launch of your pop-up shop . They can serve as a " count down " to the big launch day . Tag each post with local hashtags ( the name of your city , the name of the pop-ups street ) to- catch the attention of people in your area and draw in relevant interest . You can also expect that your customers will see your pop-up shop getting set up as they are out and about . This will spark curiosity and they- will want to Instagram photos of it . Encourage them to- share the great news by giving them a hashtag to post with . Promoting the hashtag with physical signage is a simple way to do this . <h> Your Pop-Up Shop Email Strategy <p> Your pop-up shop is a unique promotion that you may not have done before as an eCommerce store owner because it- is contingent upon location . In addition , you still get to apply some of the best segmentation practices to these emails for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my advice for the launch would be to think about your audience and messages in these categories : <p> Group 1 Local- subscribers- who have bought before. - Your message to this customer segment is to- invite them to come check out the pop-up shop . This engaged customer group is also ideal- for VIP access to a pop-up shop launch party . <p> Group 2 Local subscribers who have n't bought from you yet. - Your message to this customer group should focus on a product they 've shown interest in before ( via product pageview or email open ) and the opportunity to " come check it out in person " at the pop-up shop . <p> Group 2 Not-local subscribers- who have frequently engaged with you : - People who have bought from you before , viewed your products , and opened your emails will still be interested to hear about the pop-up shop and your companys general progress . They may also- be interested in promoting it for you . To entice these recipients to share your great news , you- could create a- pre-filled Tweet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout the pop-up shops run , you 'll want to continually use email to promote the store and keep it top of mind for these three groups . Regularly reach out and encourage them to visit and share news about the new location . Share interesting content , like photos from the launch party , to add life to the campaigns . <h> Wrapping Up <p> A pop-up shop is a fresh and exciting sales channel , but the same marketing best practices still apply when it comes to driving traffic to it . Segment your customers into smaller cohorts so you can offer more specific and relevant messages , and most importantly , test what you do so you see what approach works best for your company . <p> I think this is a great idea . I own a meeting space and I just introduced this as a service especially after the summer art fairs are gone , I think artists needs a place to sell their art around Christmas when people are buying for their loved ones .

But for eCommerce businesses , choosing a fulfillment partner is one of the most important and difficult decisions to make . After all , the chosen fulfillment company will be responsible for receiving , storing , picking , packing , and shipping your product to customers . <p> Essentially , the fulfillment company is responsible for ensuring that the value created by your marketing team , web developers , product engineers/procurement team , and customer service representatives , - is actually delivered to your consumers in the expected condition , as fast as possible , without any flaws . <p> Finding the partner that 's going to not only bolster your business- but grow with you and even add value requires some serious consideration .

Well , you need to do that with your third-party logistics ( 3PL ) provider , too . Start with- KPIs , or key performance indicators . These will help you evaluate the performance of their service . <p> There are several factors that can be measured as KPIs , and they should be measured through logs . Logs tell you everything about the storage , packing , handling , and shipping , and can be configured through a barcode scanning system or timestamps . <p> Talk to your 3PL about what kind of tracking system they have in place . If they do n't have one , run the other way . <p> Tracking your 3PL 's KPIs is insurance for you , so you can track how quickly and efficiently they 're getting your products out the door . If they do n't have a tracking system in place- or refuse to give you that information , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works on time and efficiently will happily give you access to whatever you need to evaluate how well they 're doing their job . <h> Meet your 3PL partners and visit their facility <p> A boardroom meeting is n't enough . It 's important- to visit the actual facility where your products are going to be shipped . See how they run their business before you hand over yours . <p> While the technology they have in place is important , visiting the facility will give you a sense of their standard operating procedure . Pay attention not only to how workers are managed- but if they 're incentivized to be more accurate and efficient . These are the people who care for your product " they should be treated ( and trained ) well . You should also pay close attention to the systems they have in place and the overall efficiency of those systems . <p> Do the workers look like they 're getting packages out the door quickly , but maybe not picked accurately ? Is the warehouse clean and organized ? These are important questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that note , I- always suggest making a surprise visit to the facility you 're considering .

The 3PL should welcome you with open arms , showing you around the facility and explaining what your product will go through as they get it out the door for shipping . <h> Ask if they are prepared for the worst-case scenario <p> I 'm sure you have a plan for the worst-case scenario happening to your business .

How many levels ? <p> Is there an internal IT department ? <p> Or is there an external IT department ( that can cause delays ) ? <h> Ask about their ability to scale up <p> When shopping for a logistics partner , you need to look ahead . In the long term , and possibly even the near future , your business is going to grow . <p> So , will your 3PL be able to handle it ? Do they have the capacity to scale and provide your business with everything it needs to handle that growth ? What ecommerce fulfillment guarantees do they offer ? <p> Not only that , you need to consider the seasonality of your product and bubbles around the holidays . How does your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing you need when business is booming is to be slowed down by a 3PL that just ca n't keep up . So , ask them these questions : <p> If our SKUs expand , what happens ? <p> How do you handle seasonal , or periodic , increases in scale ? <p> Do you have a predetermined , scalable workforce to handle extra packaging ? <p> What does that include ? Off-hour shifts ? Weekend shifts ? <h> The don'ts <h> Do n't choose a 3PL because it 's close to you <p> Having a logistics partner near you is n't necessarily an advantage . Because while your business might be located in Miami , your customers could be all over the country . If you choose a 3PL that 's close to you and not your customers , chances are it 's going to cost your logistics partner a whole lot more to ship to your customers nationwide . <p> 3PLs negotiate great prices with shipping companies for you , so take advantage of that . If your customer base is nationwide , choose a 3PL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . On the flipside , if your customer base is generally on the East Coast , you should consider a 3PL there . <h> Do n't be afraid to ask for a trial period <p> Sometimes the best way to judge something is to just give it a try . So , do n't jump into a contract ; instead , ask for a test drive . <p> This is a great solution if you 're on the fence or trying to decide between a couple of 3PLs . Chances are , a fulfillment company with a great track record is actually going to be happy to try to win over your business with a trial . <p> If you go for a free trial , also be sure to get your measurable KPI 's , so that , at the end , you can really evaluate all aspects of the partnership and make sure it 's a good fit . <h> Do n't lock yourself into a long-term contract , ever ! <p> You 're looking for a partner , but you do n't have to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? <p> Even if you find a 3PL that you love and go on to work together for years , you should n't bind yourself to a long , overarching contract at any point . <p> Over time , you might realize that you need a 3PL that has greater agility to handle your growth , or maybe that your current 3PL is just not running its operation the same . By opting for short-term and renewable contracts , you always have a way out if your business grows or the situation changes . <p> Plus , along the way , you should continually keep track of your KPI 's to evaluate your business partnership . If things go awry and there 's no solution in sight , you wo n't have to worry about sticking around in a situation that 's hurting your business . <h> Do n't put price over value <p> Everybody wants a good deal , but you need to look at a 3PL as an investment . More often than not , a low logistics price means you 're cutting back on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , you have to ask them how they got so low . <p> Is their price low because they 're not implementing the technology that ensures accurate picking ?

I 've written at length about abandoned carts and why every ecommerce company should send them . They are a hugely productive way to drive revenue , and brands often see an ROI of $5 to $10 per abandoned cart email sent . If you 're using Shopify as your ecommerce platform , these flows are automatically set up for you . <p> That said , you may want to make some changes to these emails before you start sending them . Instead of starting from scratch , edit or clone and edit Klaviyos pre-built abandoned cart flow. - <p> Abandoned cart flows are- only sent to shoppers who have added items to their carts , but not purchased them . So , this flow is triggered by a shopper taking the action Checkout Started . In order to narrow this group of people to only those who have n't purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has or has n't done . <p> Only people who have Placed Order zero times since starting this flow are included .

First , choose when you would like to send your first abandoned cart email . We recommend sending it after 2-4 hours . <p> Next , decide how you would like your abandoned cart emails to look .

Having worked in business intelligence for six years , he nails one of the most common problems I saw ( and still see ) with the majority of web analytics / business intelligence software in the world today : they give you lots of numbers , but at the end of the day they do n't tell you what to do and just lead to lots of debate . The story of James Lind and scurvy has some important nuggets for software and Ecommerce companies . <p> Test your Ideas : Scurvy and the First Clinical Trial <p> In 1747 , James Lind was a Scottish physician in the Royal Navy on a ship where 12 sailors were infected with scurvy. - He had theories about the cause of scurvy ( he thought proteins in the the body were decaying ) and hypothesized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what he did next " namely , he broke the 12 sailors into 6 groups of two and gave each group a different treatment . <p> He tried six treatments : <p> A daily quart of cider ( the traditional remedy ) <p> Sulfuric acid droplets <p> Six spoonfuls of Vinegar <p> Half a pint of seawater <p> Spicy paste and barley water <p> Two oranges and one lemon <p> The oranges and the lemons worked " not because Lind 's hypothesis was right , but because scurvy is caused by a Vitamin C deficiency ( as an aside , eating oranges and lemons sounds a lot more pleasant than his other hypotheses ) . By most accounts , this was the birth of the modern medical clinical trial that most nearly all drug research is based on . <p> 3 Lessons for Identifying your Oranges and Lemons <p> While this experiment is hardly revolutionary today , carefully controlled experiments have dramatically advanced medicine over the last 200 years . While the web has started to take note , web businesses can learn a tremendous amount from medical trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment : <p> Your ideas are n't always good ones ( even if backed up by data ) " but if you try them out and measure them , you 'll suddenly have actionable metrics to either implement them ( if they were right ) or to stop debating them ( if they were wrong ) . - Lind 's theory about acid was way off-base " but he still discovered the right action to take to cure survy for thousands of sailors . In short " stop debating , and start testing . <p> You need a control to compare results with . Lind did two smart things to make sure he could attribute the improvement in scurvy to the oranges and lemons . First , he did n't give all the patients the same treatment ( so he could tell when one group was noticeably improving over another ) . Second , he only implemented a single treatment on each group " so he was confident it was indeed the orange and lemon " and not living conditions , sunlight , meals , exercise , etc. - In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher chance of generating results you trust . Good options are A/B testing , cohort analysis and broader experimentation on price , offer , marketing approach , etc . A personal favorite article of mine is this piece by Josh Porter on cohort analysis . <p> Agree to believe in the experiment outcome before you run it . When Lind published his results , it took the Royal Navy another 48 years to start provisioning lemon juice to all sailors to prevent scurvy . This delay speaks to a crucial lesson : running experiments is useless if you do n't follow the results , even if you do n't like them or they go against what you thought you knew . To that end , agree on the methodology ahead of time and talk through the next steps of each outcome of the experiment . The goal should be taking action " not just learning . <p> Taking Action <p> Let 's come back to the vanity vs actionable metrics for a second . When we implement an idea , we have a tendency to want to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics ( overall site traffic , engagement rate of users this month , average purchase amount , number of people using a feature , etc ) , we are at risk of reading the result we want to see ( by attributing broader growth or seasonal trends to our action ) . <p> However " if we experiment , we then have the actionable metrics we need to implement . The more disciplined you get about this process , the more nimble you can be , the happier your customers are , and the less pointless debate you 'll have to engage in . Go forth and test !

Instagrams hashtag support and follow features make it simple to connect with relevant influencers and conversations , so you can find your current and potential customers on the social network and fight through the noise . <p> Of course , like any social network , there are right ways to use- Instagram- and ways you can royally screw it up . <p> In this post , - well show you how you can effectively use Instagram to build a huge following , engage your followers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building Your Following <p> First things first before you incorporate Instagram into your email strategy , you need an audience .

Just like with Facebook and Twitter , hashtags are searchable tags to draw up relevant content related to peoples interests . <p> To get ideas about hashtags you should use , check out tagsforlikes.com . They list out popular hashtags by category . For example , here are the most popular- coffee-related hashtags on Instagram right now : <p> Get really specific about your hashtag strategy . Its almost the same way you think about your keyword strategy for your website . Think not only about general hashtags for your company , but also about product specific ones and other keywords that matter to your business . <p> Say for instance that you sell coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hashtags like this : <p> Branded hashtags #mycompanyname <p> Product hashtags #coffee #coffeebeans #lightroast #darkroast <p> Other hashtags - #organic #fairtrade <p> here 's a tip : If you missed out on these hashtags the first time- you posted your content , its okay .

These kinds of people may be willing to feature your product or at least give it a try for a small fee even as low as $20. - Offering a coupon code for them to share with their followers could increase your chances of getting featured , and itll also be a great opportunity to prompt sharing of the content like organizing a giveaway through a blogger , for example , and entering followers in the contest if they share the post . <h> Incorporating Instagram With Your Email Marketing <p> On its own , the aforementioned ideas on growing your Instagram following are a great start . But to truly make an impact on your eCommerce stores sales , let 's think of ways you can tie this social channel in with your email marketing . <h> 1 ) Request UGC through email <p> UGC stands for user-generated content . It basically is content that your customers provide , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can install- a user-generated content plugin on your site like the- Social Photos App- or- Olapic , which shows Instagram photos of customers with your products on your product pages . Because these photos show off real customers with your products , it adds social proof to your pages and will boost conversions. - To get this started , do an a segmented email campaign based on customers ' past product purchases . Come up with hashtags for five or six of your most popular products , and identify customer email lists for each one of those products . Email those customers and encourage them to share Instagram photos of themselves with the product hashtags for a chance to be featured on the site and maybe even a discount . <h> 2 ) Run a contest and announce it over email <p> Take advantage of hashtags and peoples desire to share through an Instagram contest . Come up with a hashtag for a product you are willing to do a giveaway of , and encourage people to share on Instagram with that hashtag to enter the contest . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great way to create a consistent experience across social channels is to universally use your brand name as a hashtag . Since Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram all support hashtags , this works . Now , one caveat here is that if you chose your brand name more for SEO purposes ( redballetflats.com ) or something there may be a lot of noise on " your brands " hashtag . So in that case , you 'll need to check . But otherwise , using your brands name as a consistent tag across channels makes it simple for people to find you . <p> Jewelry retailer Gemvara does this , and as part of their nurturing for new subscribers , they invite potential customers to find them on social media . <p> This is not only a good Instagram strategy , but just a generally great social media strategy . In this day and age it may be obvious that you would have a social media account , but because there is so much noise , your subscribers may need an extra nudge or reminder to go find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to keep in mind when it comes to Instagram is this : Just creating an account and posting pretty things and existing is not enough . You need to think strategically about how you are going to get that content in front of people . What hashtags will you use ? What people will you proactively engage with ? How will you get your current subscribers to also engage with you on Instagram ? Everything you do needs to be cross-functional like that . It sounds like a lot of work , but with a well-thought-out strategy , there is a huge opportunity for brand recognition with this new platform . 
@@96020709 @220709/ <h> Why every ecommerce store should use web tracking <p> Marissa Petteruti March 21 , 2016 <p> Web tracking is an incredibly useful tool for ecommerce stores because it allows marketers to gather data on how subscribers interact with their website . If you do n't already have web tracking enabled for your ecommerce store , you should set it up to deliver more targeted emails to your subscribers . <h> How Web Tracking Works <p> The process of setting up web tracking is specific to your particular ecommerce platform , so how you will set up web tracking for your store varies . Klaviyo has documentation on how to set up web tracking for Shopify and for BigCommerce , but the majority of large ecommerce stores support web tracking , with the exception of Volusion . <p> In almost all cases , setting up web tracking simply requires you to insert a snippet of code into the HTML of your website . Then , you can begin gathering data on how your subscribers interact with your website . <p> One thing to note is that you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their activity on your site . In other words , you ca n't track visitors who have never given you their email address , either through a newsletter signup , purchase , or other method . <h> Use Cases <p> Web tracking allows you to take either a broad or very specific approach in targeting customers . You can trigger emails based on more general metrics , like whether or not a subscriber has been active on your site , or you can hone in on subscribers who have viewed a particular product . <p> BroadTracking whether or not a subscriber has been active on your site is useful when determining their level of interest in your brand . For instance , you can segment your winback emails based on whether or not a customer has been active on your website in the past X amount of time . Customers who have been active on your site but have n't purchased in a while may only need a slight nudge towards their next purchase , like a discount code or even just a glimpse of your trending products . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subscriber has viewed . If you have a subscriber who only views products in the men 's category , for example , you can add them to your men 's newsletter segment to send them more relevant emails . <p> SpecificYou can trigger an email or a series of emails based on a particular product a subscriber has viewed . In practice , this can translate to sending browse abandonment emails , which are similar to abandoned carts and will display the product a subscriber has viewed . <p> You can also trigger a more general series of emails based on a product a subscriber has viewed . If a subscriber has viewed a brown pair of shoes , for instance , you can upsell them by sending an email displaying five or more similar pairs . <h> Conclusion <p> Web tracking is incredibly useful for sending tailored emails to your subscribers and , if possible , every ecommerce store should have it enabled . Segment or trigger emails based on whether or not a subscriber has been active- on your website , or a specific product theyve viewed. - 47562 @qwx907562

There are several ways you can incentivize new subscribers to make their first purchase , but they all boil down to offering something of value . Below , I 'll outline five ways you can give new subscribers the push they need towards their first purchase . <h> 1 . Offer a Discount <p> This is the most common way ecommerce companies incentivize new subscribers to purchase in their welcome series . Often , this discount is in the form of a coupon code , but you could also offer a fixed amount or percent off of the first purchase . Whenever you offer a discount , it 's important to include a sense of urgency in the email . <p> In your welcome series , include a limited time discount . If your welcome series spans a week , for example , make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first email and remind subscribers of this expiration date in subsequent emails. <h> 2 . Offer Exclusive Content <p> Offer new subscribers something exclusive with their first purchase . This could be a gift , an ebook or lookbook , or some other gated material . The key is to understand your audience and be able to provide something that they will find valuable . If you sell makeup , for instance , including a small sample of one of your bestselling products could be a great way to incentivize new subscribers to purchase . <h> 3 . Facilitate the Process <p> You want to make it as easy as possible for customers to make their first purchase . Offering free shipping for first-time customers can be a great final push to get new subscribers to buy . You should also include FAQ links and a way to contact customer support in case any new subscribers need more information or would like to reach you . By providing great customer support at the first point of contact , you build customer loyalty . <h> 4 . Put Your Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or free shipping . If yours does n't , it 's essential that you make your products irresistible . Be sure to curate a selection of your bestselling or trending products . Leverage social proof and include reviews or testimonials to convince new subscribers that they 're missing out if they do n't make a purchase . <h> 5 . Personalize <p> Do you know where your new subscribers are coming from ? Do you have several different signup methods on your site ? If so , you should have different welcome series triggered by this information . Know the page a subscriber signed up on should inform the content you include in your welcome email . For example , if they signed up on a men 's product page , you should show them men 's products in your welcome email , and vice versa . <p> Gated , personalized content , like tips on using a particular product , are also a great way to incentivize new subscribers to purchase . <h> Conclusion <p> Be careful with mixing and matching these methods if you 're offering new subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer free shipping , too . Make sure you understand your subscribers and are able to offer them something they would find valuable . While discounts are universally appealing , you can get creative with personalized offers based on your specific product catalog or how a subscriber signed up . 47562 @qwx907562 
@@96020716 @220716/ <h> Keep Buyers Engaged Post-Purchase <p> Marissa Petteruti July 29 , 2016 <p> Finding the right email cadence post-purchase can be daunting . How do you establish enough communication to be top-of-mind without being a pest ? Most marketers are guilty of over communicating with their customers . A 2015 study by TechnologyAdvice reports that 43% of the people they surveyed feel they are receiving too many marketing emails . At the same time , you want to make sure you 're not under emailing your customers either . So , how do you find a balance ? <p> Below we 'll dive into the best practices for establishing a great post-purchase rapport with your customers . The fact is , moderating your email frequency is n't as important as providing relevant content . <h> Understand the Emails You 're Sending <p> Keeping a record of every email you send is crucial . A great place to start is by listing all your flows and campaigns . Start by mapping out your active flows in a table like the one below : <p> Next , it 's important to consider the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these : <p> Is a customer also subscribed to your newsletter ? <p> Did they recently sign up ? If so , are they receiving a welcome series ? <p> If a customer makes a purchase and abandons a cart the next day , will they be added to two separate flows ? <p> Asking these kinds of questions lets- you troubleshoot the issue of overlapping emails , which can lead to customers receiving too much email in one- day . These emails can be- unrelated , which creates an overwhelming and disjointed experience . <p> Once you 've mapped out your overlap , its time to put yourself in your customers shoes . To get a better look at how your customers might experience overlapping email , let 's look at a tale of two customers . <p> On day one , both Phil and Dan make a purchase through your online store . Two days after purchasing , Dan viewed an item on your site and abandoned a cart . Phil , on the other hand , has n't interacted with your brand since his initial purchase. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails both Dan and Phil are receiving : <h> Dan <h> Phil <p> Wow , Dan is receiving over six times the number of emails Phil is , even though he purchased a product on the same day ! <p> After your three-email post-purchase series ends , Phil wo n't receive another email from you until he qualifies for your win-back series in- six months . Unless , of course , he takes an action in the meantime ( signs up for your newsletter , abandons a cart , etc . ) . Your challenge is clear : you need to figure our how to stop overwhelming Dan with emails and stay in touch with Phil . <h> Use Exclusions to Stop Over Sending <p> You can avoid over sending by adding exclusions to your flows once you have all your emails mapped out . This will guarantee that you are not over-sending . This means excluding customers who are on your newsletter list or are receiving another series besides your post-purchase emails . <h> Stay Relevant by Segmenting Your Post-Purchase Flow <p> An easy way to prevent customers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another post-purchase flow specifically for customers who are n't receiving any other emails . These emails should be sent one to three months after a customer makes a purchase , before they start receiving a win-back series . <p> The content of these post-purchase engagement emails should correlate directly with the product a customer bought . <p> For example , let 's say you have a third customer , Evan Clover . Like Phil , he purchased- a product and did n't take any action on your site afterward . Evan bought a watch and Phil bought a pair of sneakers . Even though they demonstrated the same post-purchase behavior , they should not receive the same post-purchase emails since they did n't buy the same product . <p> There are a number of ways you can segment based on the particular products Evan and Phil bought , as well as the categories they bought from . You might include dynamic product recommendations in your post-purchase series , or you could include trending or bestselling products from the categories they purchased from. - You can also use prior purchase behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan has purchased but Phil is a repeat customer , you can tailor your message to reflect that you appreciate Phil 's continued business or add him to a VIP program . <h> Bottom Line <p> Finding the right cadence to your post-purchase email communication does n't have to be rocket science . <p> Follow these steps to manage the process : <p> Map out all of your campaigns and flows <p> Investigate different customer experiences post-purchase <p> Set up exclusions <p> Segment post-purchase flows <p> At the end of the day , the frequency of the emails you send is less important than how relevant they are to your customers . 47562 @qwx907562

You can filter and target Ordered Product events based on the following criteria : <p> $value : - Value of the item <p> ProductId : The custom I 'd of a product in your WooCommerce store , e.g. , 1321 <p> SKU : The SKU of the product in your store , e.g. , REDMEDIUMTSHIRT <p> Name : The name of a product in your store , e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item ordered <p> Categories : List of categories <h> Customer properties <p> In addition to the metrics above that- Klaviyo syncs from WooCommerce , there are also custom properties that are added to each Klaviyo profile . You can use these properties in segments and in flows . Here are the properties that are automatically synced from WooCommerce : <p> Email , first name , last name and location information : These built-in Klaviyo fields are automatically synced based on a customer's- billing address when available <h> Install Klaviyo Product- Tracking <p> If you 'd like to- set up a Browse Abandonment flow or build segments based on product browsing- data , add the Klaviyo product tracking snippet to your product page template . This snippet captures event tracking for a " Viewed Product " metric . <h> Note <p> The location of your product page template will vary depending on- your WordPress installation . We have found that most customers have succes adding this snippet to their single-product or single-post pages . The basic idea is to have this code appear on every one of your product pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables ( e.g. $Title = $product-&gt; gettitle() ; ) These variables- may be different for your theme . The important part is that product fields are dynamically rendered based on which product page you 're viewing .

Send to an Engaged List <p> The fast way to improve your deliverability is by sending to an engaged list . Most major email clients track how recipients engage with emails from your domain how many emails are marked as spam , how many are openedyou get the idea . <p> They then use this information to determine whether your emails are qualify as spam . Having lots of uninterested people on your list will only hurt your efforts to reach those that actually do want to receive your emails . <p> To do this , you 'll want to regularly clean your list . Best practice suggest doing so every 3-6 months . An example would be to get rid of the people who have n't interacted with your email in over a year . <p> One of the best ways to keep your list clean is by making sure your content is always relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ List <p> Rather than just blasting your entire list with the same messages and promotion , try segmenting your list . Not only will this improve the metrics ISPs look at , you 'll probably see a nice boost in sales . <h> 3 . Use a Double Opt-In <p> As you grow your subscriber list , it is best practice to have all new subscribers confirm their email addresses when they first opt-in . <p> This process known as double opt-in helps you grow your list while also minimizing abuse and preventing the accumulation of invalid or mistyped emails. <h> 4 . Strike a Balance Between Images &amp; Text <p> Your emails should contain at least 500 text characters in order to avoid spam filters . If you 're struggling to find the right words or hit that 500 character mark , consider including contact information , legal disclaimers , or company address in fine print at the bottom of your email . <p> You should also include alternate text for all your images , so subscribers can read a description of each image if your images do n't load properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Keep Learning <p> Interested in getting more tips and advice like this ?

@@96020734 @220734/ <h> When to Send Your Welcome Series <p> Marissa Petteruti April 11 , 2016 <p> The timing of your welcome series emails depends primarily on two factors : how many emails there are in your series , and your industry . We recommend ecommerce companies send three initial welcome emails , but for non-ecommerce brands three emails may not be enough to adequately onboard new subscribers . To determine how many welcome series emails are right for your business , A/B test the number of emails you send . You can also A/B test the timing of your welcome series to see what converts the best . To start , - here are our best practices : <h> First Email <p> Regardless of your industry , your first email should be sent immediately after a new subscriber signs up . If you use a double opt-in method , your first email should be sent immediately after they confirm their subscription . The reason for sending your initial welcome series email immediately is simple : the moment someone decides to sign up to your email list is when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to provide them with any information that might lead them to purchase , and you want to do so as soon as possible . The content of your welcome emails should facilitate the jobs of both your sales and customer support teams , so be sure to include both product and logistical information in this email . <h> Second Email <p> Your second email should be sent 1 day after a subscriber signs up . This is n't too soon after the first email that you will be pestering new subscribers , but it 's soon enough that your company will still be fresh in their minds . <p> One important thing to note is that , if a subscriber makes a purchase after the first welcome series email and before the second , they should be opted out of further welcome series emails . You should also be implementing a post-purchase email series and you may also send a daily newsletter , which means customers who purchased and are still part of your welcome series may be receiving three or more emails a day . To avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series flow once they make a purchase . <h> Third Email <p> Your third email should be sent 2 days after a subscriber signs up . Sending one welcome series email for three consecutive days is especially useful if you send a daily newsletter , since you 'll acclimate new subscribers to your mailing frequency . The content of these emails should be sequential , too , and flow logically . <p> Again , be sensitive to how many emails a customer may be receiving and do n't continue to send welcome series emails to customers who have already made a purchase . <p> If a subscriber has n't purchased after this third , final email , you may choose to add them to a separate flow aimed at getting them to purchase . This flow should email subscribers less frequently than your welcome series email . Try sending the first email 30 days after a subscriber has signed up . <h> Non-Ecommerce <p> For non-ecommerce companies , your welcome series ' main goal may not be to get customers to purchase a particular product . Instead , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software company , for instance , you 'll want to anticipate any concerns new customers might have and provide answers . If you 're a non-profit , you may be more interested in introducing new subscribers to your organization . <p> Odds are , you wo n't be able to pack all the information you want to cover into your initial welcome series email . You should spread onboarding information out into separate , digestible emails so customer are n't overwhelmed with too much new information . <p> For this reason , restricting yourself to three welcome series emails is n't necessary send as many emails as you think your customers need , but give them the choice to opt out of further welcome series emails . Some customers might not feel that they need any extra information , so you do n't want to send them irrelevant emails . <p> As for timing , you should follow the same model for ecommerce and send your welcome series emails sequentially , once a day . You can also filter your flow based on actions a customer has or has n't taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , welcome series emails have open rates of over 50% , which is much higher than a typical newsletter campaign . Take advantage of this opportunity to connect with your new subscribers by anticipating their needs and providing them with information that will enrich their experience with your brand . 47562 @qwx907562

@@96020738 @220738/ <p> Building relationships with your website visitors and turning them into customers is the goal of every online store . And , of course , building an email list of people with a newsletter sign up on your website is a great way to grow those relationships . Nothing new there . But getting those people to sign up can sometimes be trickier than you 'd think . <p> And that 's where it can be difficult to balance encouraging people to sign up and being a little , or in some cases way , too aggressive . The risk is you 'll turn potential customers off who might have otherwise become customers . And once someone leaves , they 're likely gone forever . The simplest example of a tactic that 's pushing the limits- is when a website ask you to take a survey or join an email list when you first hit their home page . For some visitors , its actually what they want . They might be familiar with that brand or business and did n't  know they could subscribe for announcements and special deals . But for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Without going into- the pros and cons of those techniques , I want to point out there are plenty of other ways to increase sign ups with little or no risk or upsetting people . They only require a few minutes and can help improve conversions dramatically. - Here are seven of them we 've seen work well : <p> 1 . If your sign up form is " below the fold , " move it up the page so people can find it . This seems obvious , - but a lot of websites- put their newsletter sign up in the footer and forget about it. - Not many people are going to get all the way to the bottom of the page and thatll hurt conversions . <p> How do I join your email list ? <p> 2 . Improve the call to action next to your sign up form.If your sign up just says " Newsletter Sign Up " or " Subscribe , " you 're probably like 95% of other websites . But what is someone subscribing to ? What 's in it for them ? Be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your emails whether- its special offers , new product announcements or just something funny . <p> 3 . Make your sign up- visually prominent. - This one is easy and can have a big effect. - Use a contrasting color for the sign up button so it stands out . Also , increase the size of the subscribe button . The larger the button , the easier people think- it is to click and the easier signing up seems . Thats psychology at work . <p> 4 . Offer some immediate gratification- for signing up.Its much more satisfying- when you take an action and get an immediate reward . That reward could be a new subscriber discount or it could be exclusive content about your hottest products. - You can also vary the reward based on who signs up by offering a slightly larger- discount for people who are n't  customers yet versus those that are so the emails people receive are super personal . <p> 5 . Instead of a pop up that blocks the entire page , try- a " slide out " sign up.Slide outs ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the page after someone has been on the page for a few seconds- or when they scroll down . These are great because their less obtrusive- but still- catch peoples attention . Theyre- also nice because they are triggered by- a visitor doing something . Rather than being harassed , its almost like a reward . <p> A flyout sign up grabs someones attention without forcing them to immediately decide to sign up . <p> 6 . Be upfront about how often you 'll be sending email.Joining an email list is a form of commitment . But what exactly is someone committing to ? There 's a big difference between receiving an email every day or two and once a month . What should someone expect ? Even better , give them the option to choose- how often to receive emails- after they subscribe on- a- preferences page . <p> 7 . Use different sign up messaging on different pages.Different- areas- of your website attract people for different reasons . If someones browsing- new items , - your sign up should say " Get New Product Updates " while someone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Be the First Know About Special Offers . " <p> So , want to increase newsletter sign ups ? Give those ideas a try and let us know what works best for you .

Anyone who has done this kind of email marketing knows how time consuming this approach is . If you 're spending time on one thing , you 're skipping another . Additionally , the data shows that less frequent emails net higher open rates and click through rates. - With these things in mind , one has to wonder why are we doing all these emails ? <p> In this post , well help you think differently about your email marketing program and offer alternatives to the daily grind . So before you get started cranking out another daily email , consider these approaches instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Abandoned Cart Emails <p> The average eCommerce site has a 73% shopping cart abandonment rate . This is n't a mark of bad websites or poor check-out experiences ( although those do n't  help ) , rather , its a sign of the times . Consumers- shop around before they make a purchase online . Your product is likely one of many- in- the running . Your abandoned shopping cart is a sign that they are still mulling the decision over . <p> So if you are n't  already doing abandoned cart emails , its time to start . <p> Here are a few things you can offer in abandoned cart emails to nudge consumers to make a purchase : <p> Personal style consultations ( for fashion ) . Show how someone would wear the product as part of an outfit . <p> The opportunity to see the product in person ( great for fashion but also for big-ticket purchases , like furniture or cars ) . <p> Customer support information . Offer a way to ask product questions ( great for electronics or auto parts ) . <p> Discounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may avoid buying from you unless something is on sale . <p> Remember : If you 're only competing on price , you 're competing against Amazon . That 's going to be tough . <p> You have to offer other unique qualities and services to convince a customer to make a purchase . Try to- only offer discounts to abandoned carts of new customers . Rely more on your brand value , product quality , and customer loyalty to drive repeat purchases from existing customers . <h> 2 ) Win-Back Campaigns <p> A smart email segmentation strategy- is to separate recent purchasers from those who have n't shopped on your site in the past six months or so . <p> If they 've purchased before but havent been back in a while , its not necessarily because they do n't  like you ! With so much noise out there , they may have just forgotten about you . Or , they may not know about new products that you 're selling , and they may think that first item they bought from you last year is really all that you offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event in Klaviyo , all it takes is a few clicks to create a list based on who completed that event within a set time period . <p> Then , as for the content of those emails , consider these campaigns : <p> Offer a discount. - I know , I know . I just got done saying discounts are a bad idea . But since consumers are so discount-driven these days , a few dollars off could be just the incentive an old customer needs to click on your email and get back to your site . To discount the smart way , combine it with a sense of urgency and timebox the coupon code for just a few days . <p> Tell them about new products. - Focus is great for new online stores , but- if you eventually expand beyond that first product line , you need to make sure people know about it . Do n't  assume they 've seen a news article or your Tweets about it . Reinforce the news with an email send , and it may inspire them to go back to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Pageview-Based Campaigns <p> Similar to how you would set up a " purchase " event for abandoned cart nurturing , you can also set up " pageview " events to- send emails to customers based on the products they browse on your site . Marketing to consumers in this way allows you to create email campaigns that are really product specific . <p> Here are a few things you can do in pageview-based campaigns : <p> Answer common questions about that product <p> Show product reviews <p> Recommend similar products <p> ( Yes , here we go again ) offer discounts that make sense for that products price point <p> Basically , a lot of the same stuff you would do in an abandoned cart nurturing campaign can be done when retargeting someone based on their view of a product . <p> There 's one thing to keep in mind . <p> This may be obvious , but its worth stating that doing this for every- product pageview could get a little hectic . Repeat product views are a stronger indicator of consumer interest that a one-off click . Considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Set Up Retargeting <p> Its remarkably easy to set up retargeting on- Adroll or Retargeter . Since you 're retargeting your own visitors , its less confusing than other forms of advertising , which require you to know- the demographics- and search phrases you 're going after . <p> Even though you 're not doing audience targeting like you do with Facebook or LinkedIn , you can still get granular . Marketers- can do product specific retargeting and include images of the product a customer browsed or left in the cart in the advertising . <h> 5 ) Create Content <p> The video , photo series , or blog post you create today will pay off dividends for months to come . Time invested here never goes to waste , so long as you know how to re-package the content you create for every marketing channel . <p> For example , the video you create today can be transitioned into a 15-second snippet for Instagram and a six second Vine video for Twitter. - Behind-the-scenes photos from the shoot can be shared on Facebook , Instagram , or Twitter . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send . <p> Basically , the upfront effort of producing content can translate into many more great marketing assets , including your next newsletter . <h> What Does All This Mean ? <p> Its easy to get into the- daily- grind- of marketing .

So , it 's important that you make it as simple as possible for new subscribers to be added to your list . These five signup methods will ensure that you 're reaching as many people as possible . <h> 1 . Embedded Footer or Header Signup <p> Your company 's website should have an embedded signup area in its header , footer , or both . Potential subscribers will naturally look for a signup box at either the top or bottom of the page , so this will facilitate the signup process for all those who wish to subscribe . <h> 2 . Modal or Fly-Out <p> Modal , also called popup , and fly-out signup areas are a more proactive method of getting people to subscribe to your newsletter list . Modal signups are the more aggressive of the two , since they appear in the center of the page and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modal form . Fly-outs are more discreet , and typically appear in the lower left corner of a webpage . <p> Both modal and fly-out signup forms can be triggered by a certain action . There are three common actions that can trigger these signup forms : <p> Exit intent a modal or fly-out signup form will prompt a website visitor to subscribe to your email list when a he or she attempts to navigate away from a particular page <p> Amount of time on page a modal or fly-out signup form will be triggered when someone is on a webpage for X amount of time <p> Scroll a modal or fly-out signup form will be triggered when someone scrolls to a particular point on a webpage ( i.e. halfway down ) <h> 3 . Checkout Page <p> Image via S1L.org <p> When a customer is ready to make a purchase , include a checkbox that will automatically sign them up for your email list . You can also create segments based on this information , since signing up for your email list while making a purchase indicates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media <p> You can also include a signup form in your social media accounts . Facebook 's Pages allow for signup tabs , and Twitter Cards allow Twitter users to sign up for your email list by pre-filling out their contact information based on their Twitter account . <h> 5 . In-person or Online Event <p> You can also collect email addresses at in-person or online events , so long as you have an Excel file or CSV to import into your email service provider . Often , webinars will automatically generate a CSV of all the attendees . While it may seem dated , it 's still common for companies to have new subscribers sign up on paper at in-person events , but it 's straightforward- enough to transcribe this information into a spreadsheet . 47562 @qwx907562 <p> Showing 2 comments <p> Kenneth ConnellMarch 29 , 2016 <p> I want to set up a separate welcome series for person who sign-up in person versus people who sign up through my website .

With easy to use eCommerce website platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce , design tools like Canva , and talent marketplaces like Odesk and Dribbble , there 's no excuse not to have a great looking site in this day and age . <p> However , anyone who has set up an online store knows that all of these resources do n't  replace having a solid vision for your brand and what your store will look like . <p> To inspire your online stores design ( or maybe just the facelift ) here are 8- web design trends you should take a look at . <h> 1 ) Video <p> Attention spans are shorter than ever , which means your brand positioning and pitch needs to be tight .

The parallax effect has been around for a while , but- just lately its been becoming more popular . <h> - 3 ) - Slide-Out Menus <p> For some people , navigation bars are too cluttered . As we gravitate more and more towards simplicity , slide-out menu bars are an extension of that trend. - Users can access the menu by toggling to the top or side of the screen . Slide-out- menus are especially great for mobile web designs , since- space can be an issue with those . <p> For an example , take a look at Squarespaces site , which uses a slide-out menu . <h> 4 ) Quirky Fonts <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times New Roman have come and gone . More and more , designers are opting for slight variations on these classics and for unique fonts , as seen by the rise of Proxima Nova . <p> Additionally , throwbacks to vintage design are becoming more and more popular . <p> You probably recognize the inspiration from these areas in a lot of site designs : <p> Vintage Book Covers <p> Vintage Soap Labels <p> Cigarette Boxes <p> Circus Posters <h> 5 ) Flat Design <p> iOS 7 brought in the era of flat design in which we said a heartfelt goodbye to gradients . Fitbits site design was clearly inspired by this desire for flat design . <h> 6 ) " Cards " <p> More and more websites are embracing tiled Pinterest-like layouts that are photo-friendly and fun to scroll through . <h> 7 ) Hand-Drawn Illustrations <p> Hand-drawn illustrations have been popular for a while , but with the rise in iconography and vintage design , theyve only become that much more popular . As a bridal brand , Twigs &amp; Honeys hand-drawn illustrations reinforce the whimsical element to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From website content to social media creative , photography is one of the best places to invest in your marketing these days .

Heres what he found : <p> Upworthy headlines adopt a higher-status compared to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to the content will be . ( " This video will shock you ! " " When you see this it will BLOW YOUR MIND ! " ) - We humans care a lot about social status , so when someone adopts a higher status to you without justification , we resist . For example , youve probably heard someone complain about a co-worker who was promoted because of being a suck up rather than because of actual skills. - Most interesting , - studies suggest that it 's actually the- lowest-status people who react most negatively- to someone adopting a higher-status . If you are comfortable with your- social status- you can brush off- attempts to reduce it and wont feel inferior . But those who already do feel inferior get upset . So , in a way , sharing this content is a way of showing how comfortable you are with your social status . <h> Curiosity <p> Psychologists are stillcuriousabout curiosity . But psychologists have some theories , including George Loewenstein at Carnegie Mellon . What we know so far is that like other human needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like eating , is satisfying. - Loewensteins research also outlines five curiosity triggers that alert people to what 's known as the " curiosity gap " or entices them to find out more . <p> Questions or riddles <p> Unknown resolutions <p> Violated expectations <p> Access to information known by others <p> Reminders of something forgotten <p> If you look at Upworthy headlines , you 'll notice that each one of them lines up with one of these triggers . You can see why you just ca n't help but click ! <h> How They Do It <p> I did a little bit of digging into their process and here 's what I found . <h> They write 25 headlines . <p> Upworthy writes 25 headlines for each piece of content . They do this because thinking of so many variations forces you think outside of the box and come up with strange ideas . This Quora thread includes some key strategies- from their process : <p> Tell a story in your headline , but do n't  give it all away . <p> If you 've got some heroes and villains , play them off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want to share it . Moms are the fastest growing demographic on social media , so you want to keep them engaged . <p> Talk like a human . People like human conversation . <p> Do n't  oversell . ( According to them they are trying to tone it down . ) <p> Do n't  be shrill , judgy , or hostile . <h> They test 2 different headlines . <p> Upworthy has a propriety system for doing this , but they actually run an A/B test for two separate headlines at the same time for the first 15 minutes that the content is published and promoted to Facebook . When a winner is discovered , they redirect the " loser " URL to the winner . <h> What This Means for Your Subject Lines <p> My one big takeaway is that this boils down to deciding what is a priority for your company and what your company is going to be the best in the world at . Upworthy made headlines a priority because they need clicks on those headlines to generate pageviews and ad revenue . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through email , its in your interest to view your email subject lines with a similar sense of priority . The time investment is at least worth a shot , as your emails- could be- be driving more email revenue if it was something you gave more thought to .

Think of ways to spark curiosity in your subscribers without overselling of offending . <p> Test multiple versions of your headlines . Run a subject line test for each email campaign that you send . <p> These are simple tips , its just about taking the time to do them for each campaign . <p> What do you think of Upworthys headlines ?

@@96020750 @220750/ <p> That 's all fine and well , if your email newsletter list is fewer than 100 people , were looking at some pretty small numbers despite the optimizations . <p> We need more posts about how to drive massive growth on your email list , so that 's what were trying to tackle today . Here are three big ideas for how you can increase your email list size or build it from the ground up . <h> 1 . Referral Programs <p> Referral marketing is essentially word-of-mouth marketing . But , businesses can use certain strategies to incentivize customers to spread the word about their companies . This is great for email acquisition . <p> One of the best recent examples of a referral marketing program for driving email acquisition that Ive seen is from Harrys . They gathered 100,000 emails in a week ( seriously ) using a referral marketing campaign . <p> The post describes the step-by-step process for coming up with the concept of the campaign , it includes the email copy they used , and they even give away- the code for their landing pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though so get cozy and grab a snack . <p> In case you want just the gist , here are five things you need to know about this awesome campaign . <p> 1 ) - Credible referrals are the best introductions . This inspired the campaign . <p> The idea for the campaign- was built around the- belief that the best- way to be introduced to a- new company was through a credible referral . <p> 2 ) They ( A LOT ) of met people in person , and that 's how they got the first hundred or so- emails . <p> Before the launch , the founders met with basically anyone and everyone- who would listen to them talk about Harry 's . Even if those people were not- necessarily interested in razors , they- tried to interest them in the company story . From these meetings , they grew a- list of about 100 people before the launch. - Essentially , the referral campaign was created to better help- those- people share the excitement of the company launch . <p> 3 ) - If users shared the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went viral . <p> To explain this one , you have to be familiar with the campaign design . <p> The user interface of the campaign was pretty simple . It was a- two-page microsite. - The first page was a splash page . As you can see below , it has a great design , a clear call to action , and a place where people could put in their emails . <p> The next page was the referral piece . <p> It had a shareable link- to the splash page- that was coded specifically for each user for better tracking . The page had share buttons for Twitter , Facebook , and email sharing . <p> here 's the kicker : By sharing the link with friends , users- could earn free product from Harrys . The more friends that signed up through shared links , the more products that user earned . <p> 4 ) They made sharing as easy as possible . <p> Clicking the Twitter , Facebook , and email icons on the landing page pulled up a dialogue box with a pre-populated message . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Their message was- Excited for @harrys to launch . I 'm going to be #shaving for free . " Then , they had a shortened link- back the campaign site . <p> These are some things they kept in mind when coming up with their message : <p> Make it simple <p> Do n't  make it too sales-y . Make it something that people would actually share . <p> Be a little mysterious . The point is to get people to click the campaign link . <p> Include a mention of the- company or product <p> Include a link to- the campaign ( duh ) <p> 5 ) They leveraged their army of 12 employees . <p> Harrys had a team of 12 employees to help them seed this- campaign to friends and family through email and social media . And when I say " friends and family " , I mean all- of their Gmail contacts . They did not hold back on their outreach for this campaign . <p> If you 're going to do something like this , its important to be prepared to handle the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the post , Jeff Raider ( Harrys founder ) mentions that the real work began when they had to get razors to everyone who participated in the campaign . Its a good problem to have , of course , but still a huge problem if you are not prepared for it . This is just something to think about before deploying a campaign like this . <h> 2 . Newsletter- Ad Buys <p> Publishers are monetizing their newsletters by selling ad inventory in their emails , and it spells major opportunity for marketers . <p> Going Through An Ad Exchange <p> You can work with an ad exchange like Live Intent- to get your ads placed in email newsletters and get your company in front of tens of thousands of potential subscribers . <p> here 's an example of how ads like this can work for email acquisition . Homegoods retailer Joss and Main had an ad placed in Real Simple magazines newsletter . <p> Real Simple is a great audience for them . Real Simple talks- about stuff related to Joss and Mains products home decorating , organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main had a blog , youd probably expect it to be a lot like Real Simple Magazine . The ad- feels natural there . <p> When you click through the ad , you 're let to an email acquisition page on the Joss and Main site . <p> Even though the Joss and Main site is a gated site to begin with , this appears to be a landing page built specifically for this campaign to make it extra easy to measure the acquisition ROI of these campaigns . <p> Brands Offer Ad Space Too <p> here 's another interesting idea to consider : Nowadays , brands are publishers , too . Some companies , like Learnvest , actually sell ad space on their blogs or in their newsletters . If there is a company whose content you like that you think you 'd like to collaborate with , see if they offer advertising opportunities like this . Whoever runs business development may have some answers , or may be willing to set up some kind of partnership either paid or free . <h> 3 . Contests <p> Contests are a great way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I offer this suggestion with a word of caution , though . These subscribers may be more likely to unsubscribe soon after the contest is over because they are most interested in signing up for your list for the free giveaways . However , if you go into these contests with a clear nurturing plan for these new subscribers , you will be able to retain the majority of them and the contest will still be well worth your time . <p> One of the best tools out there for online giveaways is Rafflecopter . Rafflecopter creates embeddable widgets that publishers can place in blog posts to run giveaways . <p> Heres what they look like : <p> - <p> You can set the rules to be any number of things leaving a blog comment , sharing a blog post , or , yes , subscribing to an email list . The publisher widgets are great to use if you want to partner with a blogger for a campaign . Or , - if you have a well-trafficked blog of your own , you can use it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafflecopter also offers- Facebook contest tools- to help you grow both your page ( through " like gating " ) and your email list . <p> Rafflecopter is n't free its $59.99 a month , or $599 if paid annually. - Its something to keep in mind , although , its right in the ballpark of what itd cost for other acquisition channels . <p> What other ideas do you have for building massive email lists ? Let us know in the comments . <p> Love Rafflecopter , solid bunch out of Australia . The fee is minimal considering how effortlessly it is to launch a giveaway/raffle/contest . Amazon also offers a lightweight giveaway program , but it is nowhere near as robust as RaffleCopter , in the actual giveaway management , but on the other hand they handle the shipping of the item , and after all , it is free to run as opposed to 59 per mo or 599 per yr. 
@@96020751 @220751/ <h> How to Use a Background Image in Your Email Templates <p> Marissa Petteruti May 10 , 2016 <p> Using background images in your email templates can add dimension and character to your emails . While neutral , one-color backgrounds are more conventional , image backgrounds are a great way to help you establish your brand 's personality , so long as they are in line with how you format your company 's website . There are two main approaches you can take to using images as your background , which I 'll outline below . <h> Patterns <p> Patterned image backgrounds can make an otherwise boring background pop . Just remember that you should use patterns for your email background , not your content background . Using a pattern as your content background will be distracting and make the text of your email difficult to decipher , so avoid this practice . Also remember to set the image as repeating , so the pattern spreads across the entire email background . <p> When choosing a background for your email , you will first have to decide whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which you choose should depend on your company 's website . If your site is made up of mostly neutral colors , a subtle pattern that incorporates this color scheme can liven your email templates . However , you should n't use a colorful , flashy pattern , since it is n't on-brand . The inverse is true if your site uses primarily bright , bold colors . The key is to adhere to your company 's branding if you do n't use patterns on your site , you can still use a pattern that incorporates your brand 's colors in your email templates . <p> There a several sites that offer free patterned images that you can use in your email templates . Here are some of my favorites : <p> Alternatively , you can find a number of patterns on paid stock photo sites , like iStock . <h> Photos or Illustrations <p> Photos or illustrations are different from patterns in that they are not repeating . As such , they are a bit trickier to format for your email templates . If you do n't format them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fully obscured by the content area of your email . To use a photo or illustration in your email templates , you will first have to edit the original image to make sure it fits the dimensions of your email template . <p> Start with the image you would like to use . Companies often use images that interact with the content of their email in some way for example , a pair of hands might the text or a puppy might peer out from behind the content background . <p> How you format your image will depend on the dimensions of your email . We recommend that your content width is between 500-700px . In the example below , our email width is 600px . Using a photo editor of your choice ( we recommend either Photoshop or Gimp ) , change the dimensions of the original image to fit your email template . It may require some trial and error to get your image placement exactly how you 'd like it . <p> The original image below is 200 x 300px .

You can choose from any combination of left/right top/center alignment . You can also specify whether or not you would like the image to repeat ( which would make it more like a pattern ) . In general , the image should not repeat unless you 'd like it to be tiled . <p> You will also want to make sure the background color of your email matches the background of your image . In my case , the image background background was white , so it was simple to find the hex code to match the email background . If you 're not sure what the background color of your image is , use this handy color picker tool for Google Chrome .

@@96020752 @220752/ <h> Unique Coupon Code Generation <h> Upload Your Own- Coupon Codes to Klaviyo <p> There are a few- ways to add coupon codes into Klaviyo . <p> Create and use a single code for everyone ( easiest option ) For small stores or for certain discounts , you may just want to paste the code straight into the email content being used . If you 're worried about the code getting spread , you can change it every couple of months . <p> The first step would be to create a coupon code in your ecommerce platform . To use that in Klaviyo , simply copy/paste the code into your email template. - <p> Use a customized code for each personThe best way to make sure codes are n't reused is to give each person their own code . There are two ways to do this on your own with Klaviyo : <p> Non-TechnicalFirst , create- a list of everyone who will be getting the coupon , then export that list of emails to a CSV . Next , create coupon codes for each person in your ecommerce platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a list of emails in one column ( labeled " Email " ) and a list of coupon codes next to each person 's email in the second column ( with a unique label for the code ) . Upload this new file- into Klaviyo as a new list . Once that list is loaded , the coupon code property will be assigned to each person 's profile in Klaviyo as a custom property . - Use the coupon by using person property tags . For example , if you 're coupon column was called " Winter 2015 coupon " , in an email template you could use personlookup : " Winter 2015 coupon " <p> Technical ( Advanced ) - Alternatively , you can dynamically add coupon codes for each person via the Klaviyo API . To do this , create a unique discount code on your end , assign that coupon code to a person using Klaviyo 's People API , then segment on these codes within Klaviyo. - For more advanced use cases , it is also possible to add coupon codes to each person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Klaviyo does n't let you paste in a list of codes that are n't yet assigned to people - you have to assign them to a person when they are added to Klaviyo . This means you ca n't send unique codes in triggered emails when the recipients are not known in advance ( i.e. no uploaded unique coupon codes for those who have abandoned their carts , etc . ) <h> Set Up Coupon / Discount Code Reminders <p> A great use of Klaviyo 's automated flows- is to automatically follow-up with people who have n't used a coupon code to remind them about it . Follow these steps to add coupons to a flow : <p> Add an additional email to the same flow that was triggered to give out the initial coupon , but set this additional email to go out a few days later. - <p> Add an Additional Filter to this new email that checks whether or not that person has placed an order that used that discount code . Only allow this follow up email to send if someone has n't yet placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shopify and Magento <p> For Shopify and Magento stores , Klaviyo has the ability to pull in specific coupon codes being used on each purchase . <p> This feature let 's you easily create a dynamic segment of everyone who used a particular coupon code . <p> Create a new segment and name it " Used a coupon " . <p> Select What someone has done ( or not done ) from the dropdown . <p> Select the Placed Order event and then click- the Add Filter option to specify the discount codes to select . <p> This is a great way to understand if coupons are getting forwarded on to others , shared among friends , etc . <h> Note <p> If you are using a custom platform or a platform like Volusion , BigCommerce , Symphony , or others , you may also be able to pull coupon information . Use the Add Filter option to see if a " Coupon " or " Discount Codes " option appears. - 
@@96020753 @220753/ <h> A Warning about Customer Lifetime Value <p> edhallen October 2 , 2012 <p> The deep dark secret of nearly all analysis or metrics is that 99% of people will tell you they are a good idea , about 10% of people are actually looking at them , and about 10% of those are actually using them to significantly change their decision-making . This does n't change the fact that they are a great idea , it just means you need to be really careful not to waste your time . <p> Customer Lifetime Value <p> Customer Lifetime Value is a concept taught in countless marketing classrooms and is simple to grasp " it 's fundamentally the total value that a customer will spend with a business over their full life as a customer . What makes Customer Lifetime Value powerful is the realization that customers have relationships with businesses " so when we acquire a new customer , we 're actually acquiring all the purchases they 'll make with us over time . And the same goes when we lose them . <p> That sounds great " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lifetime Value is inherently a good idea ( and the right way to think about things ) , you run into two problems when you try to use it to make decisions : <p> It 's backward looking. - Because you 're trying to figure out not what a customer 's value is today , but to predict what it 'll be over the next several years , you usually end up trying to factor in multiple years of past performance , or you end up trying to predict it off of a cohort analysis or regression model . <p> It 's complicated . The reason we use metrics and analysis is to be able to evaluate decisions we are making " in basic form , you do X , you get Y.- For this to work well , you need to have a ton of faith in Y and you need to be able to see it quickly. - Because customer lifetime value is a prediction , we 're likely to spend more time trying to understand it , calculating it or debating it. - Think back to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Alternative Approach <p> Now , while trying to predict Customer Lifetime Value will remain crucial for some decisions , there 's an alternative approach : <p> Try ideas often <p> Observe the impact on clear metrics <p> Measure those customers over time to understand long-term impacts <p> Let 's take an example . Say you are debating whether to send lapsed customers a discount offer to entice them to come back . If you take a subset of those customers and try it out , you 'll quickly know the answer to questions you could only speculate about before : <p> How many customers come back ? More than would have otherwise ? <p> How much do they spend ? On what ? <p> Do they come back again over the coming months ? <p> Customer Lifetime Value is an important reminder that we need to focus on the complete customer relationship over time " but as with all analytics , you need to make sure that your work gets translated into action . <p> Klaviyo let 's you quickly implement and measure the impact of customer lifecycle marketing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Do n't  agree ? Think about it . Let 's say you 're using key shopping events like product purchases and abandoned carts to trigger emails . You 're segmenting email subscribers based on their transaction history , website behavior , and demographic profile . You even make it a habit to check in on your performance and A/B test often . <p> Content still matters a lot . One of the biggest obstacles to email content creation is the time it takes to come up with a great idea and turn it into a clever , compelling piece of content . We want to make sure that all Klaviyo users have time to spend on the things that matter . That 's why we 've released a couple of updates that will help our customers make the process of creating great content easier and faster than ever . <h> Announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content for your emails , chances are that somewhere along the way you 're putting in a lot of quality time cutting and pasting . And cloning and editing past emails . <p> - <p> It 's infuriating . <p> - <p> You no doubt want to reuse several email components across many campaigns and flows . But you 're forced to recreate them over and over again . Not cool . <p> - <p> If you 're lucky enough not to relate to the experience , let 's walk through some examples : <p> 2 ) You might want to build a special promotional call-out for a new product launch that uses the same background color , dimensions , and dynamic content across campaigns . <p> - <p> 3 ) Or , maybe you use intricate table blocks to pull in dynamic content for your abandoned cart , browse abandonment , and order confirmation emails . You need the same layout and the same logic across emails in several flows . <p> - <p> As a general rule , drag and drop editors will force you to set up those blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new email . That 's why your copy and paste game is on point if you 're an email designer or marketer . <p> And , of course , if there are multiple elements that you want to reuse , you 're probably resigned to cloning the email and editing the duplicate . That can open a whole can of worms around editing the wrong version . <p> - <p> Well , we 're bucking the trend and declaring a new day for content creation . CTRL+C , be gone . Cloning emails ? Laughable . Now , Klaviyo makes it easy for you to save important components into custom , reusable content blocks . <p> - <p> And for all the email designers out there , now you can get that perfect three column layout with precise padding between each column saved as a standard block . Ditto for that table you built out to pixel perfect precision . <p> - <p> Simply create it once and then click the star icon in the Klaviyo Template Editor to save the content block . It will instantly be available as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . <p> Using unique social media blocks for your footers ? No sweat . Save them once , and your layout and custom Facebook , Instagram , and Twitter images will all be available for all your other templates . <p> - <p> Go ahead " - clapping is an acceptable response here . <h> Direct access to template builder from flows <p> One of the promises we make to Klaviyo users is that we 'll get them up and running faster than any other ecommerce email automation software out there . <p> - <p> There are a couple of ways we do that . <p> - <p> First , we let people sign up for free and check out every single feature without paying . Our ecommerce platform integrations are more comprehensive but also way easier to deploy . <p> - <p> Second , we prebuilt entire email flows for things like abandoned cart series and other email flows based on best practices for timing , number of emails in the series , and content . All you need to do to launch those flows is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's already pretty fast to go from not having all your core ecommerce email flows set up to sending abandoned carts , welcome series , and winbacks . It took one recent user only 12 minutes to go from simply viewing the flows section in Klaviyo to setting their first flow in motion . <p> But 12 minutes is n't good enough . Especially when we noticed how often our users go back and forth between configuring their email flows and customizing their content . <p> - <p> We 've made it easier than ever to edit the content in your flows. - Instead of toggling between the flows section and the template editor when you want to make changes or create content for multiple emails in a series , now you can see all the emails in the series in the editor itself. - You can even jump between emails in different flows . <p> Voil+ . Getting an abandoned cart series " - or any other email flow " - live just got faster ! <p> Faster email content creation = more time for everything else <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reusable , saved blocks and the ability to toggle between templates in a flow series means more time you can spend growing your ecommerce business .

One thing you guys need to add is the ability to update a saved block and have it update all the email templates/flows that are currently using it . here 's a basic use example : let 's say my business phone number or address has changed .

@@96020759 @220759/ <h> Campaign Did n't Send to Full List <h> Overview <p> When you review a sent campaign 's results , you may notice that your campaign did not send to your complete list/segment . <p> Depending on whether your campaign was sent to a- list- or a segment , there are several reasons that might cause this behavior . <h> Removal of Globally Suppressed Contacts <p> If you have the Global Unsubscribe feature enabled and- someone becomes globally suppressed , this person is not- automatically removed from all the lists he/she has subscribed to . In order for someone to be globally suppressed , he/she must unsubscribe from a flow email or a campaign email sent to a segment . <p> This suppressed person 's existing subscriptions will remain intact , but the suppressed tag will ensure that this person does n't receive any emails moving forward . If someone reaches out asking to opt back in , you can remove the suppressed tag and this person will begin receiving the same emails as before -- this person wo n't have to worry about re-subscribing . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's possible that 5% of those people are actually globally suppressed . If you send a campaign to this newsletter list , Klaviyo will automatically skip all suppressed users and you 'll notice that only 475 emails were successfully sent . <p> To test this out , use Klaviyo 's Segment Builder to view- a cross-section of your list that is suppressed . This segment should include- the following two conditions : <h> Learn more <h> Recipient Activity : Skipped Recipients <p> As a starting point , navigate to the campaign 's overview- report. - The left-hand area- below the graph has summary information- for the sent campaign. - <p> This gray box displays the subject , from email , list or segment the campaign was sent to , and the date/time the campaign was sent . There is also a section for People Skipped that groups people into key buckets based on why they were skipped . <p> If your campaign has Smart Sending enabled , this section will show you how many people were skipped because they received another email too recently . People also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email address . <p> Here are the key reasons why someone may not have received your campaign email despite being on the send list : <p> User Has Marked an Email as SpamIf someone complains that an email from you is spam , he/she wo n't receive any more emails from you to keep your email deliverability strong . <p> Emails to User Have Hard BouncedIf an email to someone- hard bounces ( this happens most often when the email address is invalid ) he/she wo n't receive any more emails from you to keep your email deliverability strong . <p> User Has an Invalid EmailIf someone is on your send list , but his/her- email address proves- to be invalid , your email will not be successfully delivered . <p> Smart SendingIf- certain people have- already received another email within your established Smart Sending- Period , and Smart Sending is enabled for your campaign , they will be skipped . <p> If you navigate to the- Recipient Activity- tab , and click on the- Other- dropdown , you can also view activity around skipped recipients. - <h> Scheduled Campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send at a future date/time , you will see an option to determine recipients based on members of your list at send time instead of right now . <p> When you schedule a campaign , we take a snapshot of the list or segment you 've selected . When scheduling a campaign that wo n't be sent for several days or weeks , it 's likely that this target list may grow or shrink during the scheduled period . <p> If enabled , this option will prompt Klaviyo to take a- new- snapshot of your target list or segment right before the scheduled campaign sends . This will ensure you 're sending to an up-to-date list or segment . If this option is not- enabled your campaign will send to the snapshot captured at the- time- you scheduled the email . 
@@96020764 @220764/ <h> Personalize Flow Emails with Dynamic Data <h> Overview <p> After you integrate Klaviyo with an another third-party tool or service , Klaviyo will begin tracking certain metrics through the integration . For many integrations , we track event data based on how and when people are engaging with your business through the integrated service . <p> When Klaviyo records an event through your integration -- such as Checkout Started , Placed Order , or Made Contribution -- we also capture pertinent information related to the event . For example , for order-related events , we capture relevant order data . This includes all items in the order , images , and other details related to each item . <p> Personalization and event variables make it easy to leverage this data to send your customers more tailored and relevant emails . <p> For example , when a customer begins to check out , Klaviyo will track a Checkout Started event . If this customer then leaves their cart behind , you can configure an abandoned cart flow to send one or more emails to the customer until he/she revisits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart emails can feature images of the exact items a customer left behind and a link back to the customer 's own cart . <p> To populate an email with details from an event , you can insert event variables- that will dynamically populate for each recipient . <p> The rest of this guide will explain where to find the event variables- available for use in a given email , and how to leverage these variables in your emails where possible . <h> How to use Event Variables <p> You can only access and use event variables- in a flow email when the flow itself is triggered by an event . If a flow is triggered by a list or segment , it wo n't be possible to use event variables- in your emails . You also wo n't be able to use event variables in campaign emails . <p> To find the different event variables- you can use in a given template , click- Preview within the template 's main- Edit Content- window . When you click to preview your flow email , a window will appear that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see the window populated with an example recent event that corresponds with the flow 's trigger . For example , for an Abandoned Cart flow email , the preview window will show a recent Started Checkout event . <p> This event preview window will show all of the data available for that particular event metric . Here , you can click on any line of data and reveal the variable associated with it . The variable will appear within a gray box at the bottom of the window . <p> In the above example , I clicked on the entry 0- for variable Items . This revealed the corresponding variable event.Items.0 . <p> The syntax for different event variables- will be specific to your event metric and your integration . In order to understand which variables are available for each event and the syntax for each , scroll through all of the data you see in the preview window for a specific flow email and click on different entries. - <p> When there are multiple entries under one umbrella property ( like multiple items in an order ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0 " at the end ( or potentially in the middle ) and the next item will have a " 1 " and so on . This is called an array . Each entry in the array is numbered starting with " 0 " as the first entry . By using an array , we can capture one property ( such as Collections , or Items ) but capture multiple values for that one property where each value can be identified individually. - <p> In the example below , you will see there are two items in the preview order : <h> The Block Repeat Feature <p> This feature allows you to insert a single block that will automatically repeat itself and iterate over all entries within a property array . <p> To turn on this feature for a given block , click the- icon at the very top of a block , next to- Save Changes . <p> When you click this icon , a small window will pop up that prompts you to specify a property to loop over ( i.e. repeat ) as well as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example above , you see that we have event.Items.0 and event.Items.1 . The property variable itself- is- event.Items , and we want to loop over this variable so that both event.Items.0 and event.Items.1 will populate . <p> In this example , the Repeat For variable is- event.Items . <p> We can then assign this an alias -- let 's assign the alias as- item. - Then we can say , loop over every item in event.Items . <p> After clicking to turn the block ON , and clicking- Save , you will see the icon change to dark blue . <p> You can then insert the variable alias item into your template and click save . When you preview your template , you will see that all value entries in the array will populate as the specified variable is looped over . <h> Building a Dynamic Table <p> If you want to create a more complex block featuring dynamic content that loops over all entries for a single variable , you can create a Dynamic Table . The Dynamic Table will allow you to create a table of information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Product Review / Cross Sell flows that Klaviyo may have provided out-of-the-box for you already contain emails with dynamic tables configured . Now that you 're more familiar with- Event Variables- in general , you can learn how to create a Dynamic Table yourself . <p> Step One : - Create a Dynamic Table <p> To create a Dynamic Table , drag over a- Table Block- and click over to- Rows . Here , you can toggle the block from- Static- to- Dynamic . <p> Step Two : - Establish a Data Source for Dynamic Table <p> The data source- will prompt for a- Row Collection- field and then a- Row Alias- that you can use . <p> - <p> The- Row Collection- field will prompt for the variable you want to repeat . Applying the same example we used for the section above , this variable would be event.Items. - The- Row Alias- would similarly be- item . <p> The image above in this section shows- event.extra.lineitems- as the variable to loop over . In the gif below , you can see that this variable is the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By setting- event.extra.lineitems- as the variable to loop over , we can then use item.vendor- and- item.title- in our template without having to worry about the more complex syntax of the full variable . <p> Step Three : - Inserting Variables into Table <p> Next , you 'll need to populate your table with the variables of your choice . You can find these variables when previewing your email ( as explained above ) . Remember : instead of copying the variable exactly , be sure to use the- Row Alias- you established along with your data source . <p> You will find this image link variable the same way you 'd find any other variable : in the Preview Email window <p> Below , you will see where I found and clicked on the image link variable . What you see underlined in green is our- Data Source. - What you see underlined in red is the variable value we can use along with our alias . <p> The full variable is : - **25;609;TOOLONG <p> Since we want to iterate over ALL product images , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take out the " 0 " that identifies a specific item . <p> The variable we insert is thus : - item.product.images.src <p> To insert an image link variable , you will use the- Placeholder Image option to insert this variable. -

DVF shares sales with email subscribers several days before promoting them on social media channels or anywhere else . <p> The clear benefit here , as any shopper knows , is that you get first dibs on sale items . <p> Usually , - the sales rack is a picked over selection of sizes and prints . Thats awesome- if you 're extra- tall and/or look great in more eclectic items . But for those who seek out the most popular sizes and styles , its not ideal . These early access emails ensure I get access to the best selection , so its a great reason to be a DVF subscriber . <p> How to make this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promotion of your sales . Create a marketing editorial calendar to help you plan out what days you share information exclusively with subscribers and what days you share information with the rest of the universe . This can be done in a Google spreadsheet , or even through a task management tool like Trello or Asana. <h> 2 ) - Gemvaras Guest Curators <p> The survey revealed that 61% of respondents wanted " detailed product information " on product pages , otherwise , they would n't convert . Additionally , nearly 39% of respondents wanted to see multiple images of products on product pages . <p> What these survey responses really show is that if consumers can not pick up , touch , and feel your product , they need as much information about it as possible via the website . When it comes to fashion , this is particularly true of how to " style " new pieces . <p> The feature- guest curators- on the email newsletter , who- show how various pieces of jewelry fit together , and how they can become a part of an outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion icon does n't  hurt . <p> Getting this kind of product information and style inspiration in their emails is a clear value add to me as a subscriber . <p> How to make this work for you : <p> Work with the- influencers in your industry. - - Leverage those relationships for great email content that teaches subscribers more about your product . <h> 3 ) The White Houses Thorough Content <p> I 'm the kind of person who loves to do my own research when it comes to politics . I like to get a lot of different perspectives . <p> Also , there are some lesser-known initiatives that do n't  get coverage in the era of 24-hour news stations , who seem to repeat each other and focus on a few stories at a time . <p> As a White House subscriber , I feel like I 'm getting information I do n't  get elsewhere , and I can see it from their point of view . It helps me compare that information to other research I do , and therefore develop- my own perspective on what 's going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> The White House emails are lengthy letters full of information , and often , numbers . The call to action is usually to share the email on social media or forward it to a friend , but regardless of whether I click through and do that or not , I get all the value I want just by reading the email . <p> This is especially great for mobile , where at least 50% of email is opened . I get all the information I want right in the email . I do n't  have to click through the email and wait for my browser load ( which can be slower on mobile ) to read a blog post or watch a video . All I have to do is read the email . <p> How to make this work for you : <p> Re-think the actions you want people to take from your emails . Is it always necessary to- push them to make a purchase ? Do they always need to click through to your site ? Or , for some emails , can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use other emails to direct them to shop ? <p> There are no straight answers , its something you will have to test for your company . <p> What other companies do you feel do a great job at incentivizing email subscriptions ?

@@96020770 @220770/ <h> Getting Started with Flows <p> Klaviyo flows allow- you to trigger an email or series- of emails based on- when- someone joins a list , is added to a segment , or takes an action -- such as making a purchase or abandoning a cart . Our flows have advanced- triggering , segmenting , scheduling , and design features in one place so you can send- emails that your customers will love and will help grow your business . <p> When you integrate your ecommerce and other data into Klaviyo , - we automatically add- popular flows to your account . Once you customize these flows , you can start sending them right away . Here are a few examples of popular flows : <p> A new subscriber welcome series flow to introduce subscribers to your brand and convert them into first-time customers <p> An abandoned cart flow to convert would-be customers that is customizable based on items in someone 's cart and whether they 're already a customer <p> A post-purchase flow to thank new customers and- let them know about related products they might be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back customizable based on the products- they 've purchased and how many purchases they 've made <p> In this article , you 'll learn about flows and how they fit into- email marketing. - <h> Definitions <p> If you 're new to email automation , it will help to define a few common terms we use when talking about flows . <p> FlowAn email or series of emails sent to a profile based on a trigger and , optionally , filtered based on specific profile or trigger details . <p> Flow EmailAn individual email in a flow . Each flow email- has- an email template and settings that can be personalized to each profile- and trigger . Unlike campaigns where emails are sent in batch , flows emails are sent to profiles one at a time . <p> TriggerA- catalyst event or activity that causes the sequence of emails to start . For example , - when someone makes a purchase or when someone subscribes to a list . <p> EventA specific occurrence of a profile taking an action. - Every metric in Klaviyo is- a timeline of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when an- event occurs , it will trigger the flow . Each email can be targeted and customized based on the event that triggered it . This is what sets off an action-based flow . <p> QueueA list of profiles waiting to receive a flow email . When a flow is triggered , a profile- is added to the queue- for each- email in that flow and remains there until it 's time to- send . <h> What Can Flows Do <p> Every email you send should be relevant and engaging to the person receiving it . Two of the best ways to increase the relevance- of your emails is to time them based on actions your customers take and use information about their activity- to personalize- each email 's content. - With flows , you can automate both of these techniques . <p> Compared to campaigns , flows do n't require constantly developing new content and , because they 're tied to customer behavior , they have higher greater engagement and ROI. - Many businesses use flows to substantially increase- their- sales and- grow faster and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it better . <h> Types of Flow Triggers <p> Every flow has a trigger that causes profiles to be queued for each flow email in- the flow . There are three- types of flow triggers : <p> Metric or Action- BasedTrigger based on metric events . All- metrics can be used as a trigger except the Received Email metric. - - <p> Subscribed to a ListTrigger when someone subscribes or is added to a list . <p> Added to a SegmentTrigger when someone is added to a segment . This is not frequently used . Instead , it is usually preferable to- trigger a flow based on a metric so you can use the triggering event to customize the email 's content . <h> Klaviyo 's Default Flows <p> When you integrate an ecommerce or nonprofit platform with Klaviyo , we will provide different best practice flows for you out-of-the-box . <p> After configuring your core integrations in Klaviyo's- Setup Wizard , you can navigate to the- Flows- tab- in your account . Here , you will see any best practice flows we have pre-populated in your account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggested layout and example text . Most of these templates will also be configured to pull in relevant dynamic personalized content through your integration. - <h> Note <h> Create a New Flow <p> To create a new flow , click on the- Flows- tab in your account 's main navigation sidebar and then click the- Create Flow- button . <p> Giving your flow a name is the first step . Be sure to use a name that will explain the flow 's purpose for easy reference . The name of your flow should be easily understood by you and your team -- when you start to segment further in Klaviyo , the number of flows can add up quickly . It 's also important to remember each flow 's purpose to avoid sending the same email from two separate flows . For example , a flow being sent to people who subscribe to a list could be called a " Welcome Series " flow , or a flow to customers who have n't ordered recently could be called a " Win-Back " flow . <p> The second step is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core options here : Subscribes to a List , - Added to a Segment , - or- Takes an Action . <p> After selecting- Subscribes to a List- or- Added to a Segment , you will be prompted to select a list or segment name and then see options to restrict further who gets emails from your flow . After selecting- Takes an Action , you will be prompted to select an action metric to trigger the flow . You will then have the opportunity to add one or more filters to that action. - <h> Learn more <h> Adding Emails to a New Flow <p> After you create a new flow , select a trigger , and add any desired trigger and/or flow filters , you will be taken to the main configuration page for your flow . Here , you can add emails to your autoresponder by clicking- Add Email to Flow : <h> Scheduling a Flow Email <p> When you click- Add Email to Flow , you will first need to establish the timing for your new email. - <p> Someone will always get queued up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow ( whether that means getting added to a list , placing an order , visiting your website etc . ) . By adjusting the timing of each flow email , you can control whether someone gets an email immediately after taking the trigger action ( i.e. a welcome email immediately after subscribing ) or after an established period of time ( i.e. a win-back email 120 days after placing an order ) . - <p> You can schedule an email to send after any number of hours or days . To send an email immediately , use " 0 hours . " <p> You can set the timing of an email to be less than an hour by changing the timing to 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and so on hours ( where 0.5 hours is equal to 30 min . ) For example , if you schedule an email with a delay of 0.3 hours , your email will send after 18 minutes . The smallest decimal we support is 0.1 , and we always round to the nearest tenths place . <p> If you schedule an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then be given the option to pick the exact time and timezone . If you establish a specific send time , we will first wait the full amount of days selected and- then- send at the scheduled time . <p> For example , if you schedule an email to send after 2 days at 1 PM , and someone gets added to the flow at 4 PM , the email will wait 2 full days ( 48 hours ) and then send the next time it is 1 PM . This means , depending on when someone is added to the flow , an email triggered to send " after 2 days at 1PM " may actually send closer to 3 full days later . <p> After you schedule a flow email , you can always adjust the timing by clicking the small clock icon on the flow email 's timing tab . Keep in mind that updating a flow email 's timing will not impact any already-scheduled emails . The updated timing will only impact newly scheduled emails moving forward. - <h> Configuring Flow Email Content <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step is to configure their content . Click on the blue- Configure Email- link- to update your email 's sender information , the subject of the email , and add content . You can also access these settings by clicking the- Manage- dropdown for a flow email , and selecting- Edit . <p> Editing the content of a flow has the same options as editing the content of a campaign. - <p> There are four options based on how you want to create content : <p> Rich HTML / Drag &amp; DropOur WYSIWYG ( what you see is what you get ) template editor will automatically optimize your email for mobile and makes it easy to create complex email layouts that will look great on all email clients <p> Text Based / SimpleIf you 'd like to send a text only email , choose this option ; this is a good option for sending an email that looks like it came directly from you rather than your organization <p> Use Template from LibraryIf you 've already created a- base template , - newsletter template- or- snack template- this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Klaviyo template library <p> HTML EditorOnly use this option if you have your own HTML email template you 're importing , or are interested in- designing a custom HTML template from scratch <h> The Flow Email Status <p> For each email in your flow , you 'll see a colored icon with a paper airplane inside of it . This icon signals the flow email 's status . <p> There are three email status options : - Draft , Manual , - and- Live . <p> DraftThis means you 're still building the email and nobody will get queued up or receive the email <p> ManualThis means that the email is- active in your flow , but no emails will- trigger automatically at send time ; while we 'll queue up people to receive the email , you will need to manually review and send all scheduled emails- <p> LiveThis means- the email is active in your flow and is sending automatically <p> When a flow email is set to manual , you will see all ready-to-review-and-send emails in a- Needs Review- section within the analytics snapshot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of an email from manual to live , any emails in the Needs Review section will continue to remain there until manually reviewed and handled -- these emails will not- automatically send when the email 's status switches to live . <p> If you have a flow where one or more emails are scheduled to send after a given amount of time , you will also notice a- Waiting- section within the analytics snapshot to the right of the email . <h> Trigger Filters &amp; Flow Filters <p> Everyone captured by the initial trigger ( i.e. Checkout Started ) will be queued up to enter the flow . All trigger filters and flow filters will be applied at this time : <p> If someone fails the trigger and/or flow filters at this time , they will be filtered out and will not be queued up for any flow emails <p> Everyone that passed the trigger and flow filters ( initially ) will enter the flow and be queued up for all emails at this time <p> When each email is scheduled to send , however , Klaviyo will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero times since starting this flow ) and skip anyone that fails your filters . This is why you may see people queued up for your flow in Waiting that you know should n't be .

All subscribers will be queued up to receive emails at the same time , regardless of when they entered the list or segment . That means that someone who was added to a list one year ago and someone who was added to that same list yesterday will be scheduled to receive emails at the same time . <p> Example : Back-populating a flow triggered by an event- If I placed an order 3 weeks ago and a flow email is scheduled to send 5 days after someone places an order , I wo n't get queued up to receive this flow email when the flow is back-populated . This is because it 's already been 3 weeks ( i.e. I already missed the 5-day mark when this email would have sent to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , when you back-populate this flow , I- will- get queued up to receive the email . I will get scheduled to receive this email in 2 days ( i.e. at the 5-day mark for me ) . <p> When a flow triggered by a list or segment is back-populated , we will retroactively schedule all emails relative to when you click back-populate . We will not schedule emails based on the date each person was added to your list or segment . <p> Example : Back-populating a flow triggered by subscribers/additions to a list or segment- Let 's say you have a flow that is triggered by new subscribers to your newsletter list . You have your first flow email scheduled to send immediately , and a second flow email scheduled to send after 3 days . You also have 200 people already on your newsletter list when you finish creating this flow and turn it live . If you click back-populate , all 200 people will receive Email #1 immediately and will get scheduled to receive Email #2 in 3 days . <h> Adding New Emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn your flow emails live , you may later wish to add more emails to your flow . <p> If you add a new email to the start of your flow- and turn it live , it will only be sent to new emails addresses going forward . Those that have already entered your flow will not retroactively be queued up for this new email. - <p> The same would be true if you added a new email to the end of your flow -- only new people entering your flow would get queued up for the full flow series including- this- new email. - This is because scheduling for all emails in a flow happens the moment someone enters the flow. - Those already in a flow will not get scheduled for a newly added email , even if the new email added to the end of your flow . <p> If you add an email to the end of a flow that is triggered by an event , you can back-populate the flow ( see section above ) to make sure those recently added to the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back-populate a flow triggered by an event , we will retroactively schedule emails relative to when each event took place and when each email in the flow is configured to send . This does not work for flows triggered by new additions to a list or segment . <h> Flow Analytics <p> To review the analytics for a given flow email , click anywhere within the- Analytics ( Last 30 Days ) - snapshot to the right of the email. - <p> In the- Overview- tab , you will be able to view all relevant metrics around your email 's performance .

@@96020772 @220772/ <h> Flow Triggers and Filters <h> Flow Trigger <p> A flow can be triggered when someone takes an action that is tracked by Klaviyo , or when someone is added to a list or segment . When a user meets the trigger you set , they will enter your flow at that time. - <p> Here is a list of the three different types of triggers and when they might be used : <p> Subscribes to a listIf you have a signup form(s)- or a subscribe page on your website , you likely have all new subscribers getting added to a specific list in Klaviyo . Using this Subscribes to a list- trigger , you can ensure every new subscriber gets queued up for a specific flow . For example , you can use a welcome series flow to send a thank you email to someone once they sign up for your newsletter list . <p> Added to a segmentSegments are defined by a set of conditions , and will thus grow as new people meet the conditions and shrink when certain people no longer do ; - triggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a segment will allow you to ensure everyone meeting a certain set of conditions will get queued up for this flow . This can be useful for when you want to use multiple actions to trigger a flow . Keep in mind , however , that even if someone exits a segment when they do n't meet the condition anymore and then enters the segment again a later date- -- segment-triggered flows can not be sent to the same person more than once . So segment-triggered flows can not be used to automate order-related follow up emails or any other emails you might want someone to receive more than once . <p> Takes an actionThis trigger option allows you to queue up people for a flow based on an action they have taken ; this action- can be any activity captured through an integration ( i.e. started a checkout , placed an order , filled out a form ) . For example , an abandoned cart flow would trigger off the action Checkout Started , with an added trigger filter to restrict the flow only to those that have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to List- or- Added to a Segment , you will be prompted to select a list or segment name and then see options to restrict further who gets emails from your flow . <p> After selecting- Takes an Action , you will be prompted to select an action metric to trigger the flow . You will then have the opportunity to add one or more filters to that action. - <h> Setting Trigger Filters <p> A trigger filter is useful for grabbing only certain events for your trigger metric . If you want to create a thank you flow that is targeted only to customers that have purchased a specific product , you can specify Only certain events should trigger this flow- and establish that the flow should only trigger when the order placed includes this specific product . <p> This allows you to tailor different flows to send different emails to people who , for example , buy a red t-shirt versus those who buy a blue t-shirt , or to people whose orders are a certain size or value . There are many different trigger filters for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get applied as someone enters a flow . <h> Setting Flow Filters <p> Abandoned carts flows , for example , are built on the action metric Checkout Started . The behavior we want to target , however , is when a customer starts a checkout and then abandons the process . This means we have to add a flow filter to target this specific behavior . The flow filter we need here is : Has placed order zero times since starting this flow . This will make sure that people only receive a flow email after they started a checkout but did not go on to place an order . You can use multiple filters here if you 'd like - the example below features a flow that would only send to people that have not placed an order since starting the flow and live in the United States . <p> Here are a few examples of how flow filters can help you level up your automated emails to get highly targeted and personalized : <p> For a welcome series , have Email #1 only send to subscribers that opted-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abandoned cart flow , create separate flows for products that are particularly popular , or for certain categories of products - this way , you can customize these emails to maximize their conversion potential <p> For a win-back flow , you can send a " big spender " version of your win-back series to customers that placed an order above a certain amount , or customize win-back flows based on the category of products purchased <p> For a new customer thank you flow , this is a great opportunity to thank your customers in different ways based on what they bought/how much they spent -- you can create different thank you flows based on any information you know about your customers , such as their gender , location etc . <h> Setting an Additional Filter for a Single Flow Email <p> Adding additional filters to an email within a flow allows you to tailor specific emails after a person has set off a broader trigger . For example , you may want everyone to receive the first email in your welcome series after they sign up , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting the flow to receive the fifth email . Additional filters allow you to narrow your audience . <p> First , click on the flow email and navigate to the- Review- tab . Here , you will see a section labeled- Additional Filters . <p> If you click- Edit- here , you will see a window pop up . This is where you can configure and apply additional filters that will be specific to the email you have selected . <p> Let 's say you have a flow that sends to customers several weeks after their first purchase , encouraging them to order again . Your first email might have the subject line , " We Missed You . " This email may provide a discount code or some other incentive to convince your customer to come back . <p> As you add additional emails to this flow , you may want to consider sending certain messages only to those that have failed to open a prior message . This is a great way to resend a great offer- or partially recycle a great design- until you grab the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one condition : - <p> What someone has done ( or not done ) &gt; has Opened Email zero times over all time- &gt; where Subject equals - <h> Should I use AND or OR when adding filter conditions ? <p> Using the- OR- connector between a sequence of flow filter conditions will make a filter more- inclusive . We will check each condition in the sequence individually -- if Joe meets one condition in the sequence but does not meet another , Joe will still be included in your flow . <p> In the following example , anyone that placed an order in the last 30 days OR was active on site in the last 30 days will get included : <p> Using the- AND- connector between conditions will make a flow filter more- exclusive . We will check each condition separated by AND individually , but each condition must evaluate to true in order for someone to get included . If Joe meets one condition but does n't meet another , Joe will be excluded from your flow . <p> In the following example , only those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were active on site in the last 30 days will get included : <h> When are Flow Filters Applied ? <p> The way a flow works , everyone captured by the initial trigger ( i.e. Checkout Started ) will be queued up to enter the flow . All trigger filters AND flow filters will be applied at this time as well , however : <p> If someone fails the trigger and/or flow filters at this time , they will get filtered out and will not get queued up for any flow emails <p> Everyone that passed the trigger and flow filters ( initially ) will enter the flow and get queued up for all emails at this time <p> When each email is scheduled to send , however , Klaviyo will apply your flow filters- again- ( i.e. has Placed Order zero times since starting this flow ) and skip anyone that fails your filters . This is why you may see people queued up for your flow in Waiting that you know should n't receive the flow 's emails . Flow filters will always get applied again right before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Activity for a flow email , by clicking on- Analytics ( Last 30 Days ) - &gt;- Recipient Activity , you will see the number of total recipients . If you click on the Other- drop-down , you will see the number of individuals falling into the Skipped : Fails Flow Filters bucket . This shows you those that entered the flow but failed the flow filters at email send time .

Many different factors come into play , including ( but not limited to ) recipient engagement , DNS records , and , as I will discuss in this post , individual email domains . An email domain refers to the service a recipient uses to access their email " for example , Gmail , Yahoo , Outlook , Hotmail , etc . Deliverability often varies by which email domain a recipient is using . No email marketer wants their campaigns ending up in the spam folder , so it 's important that you take note of how your emails are performing by domain and , if need be , alter your strategy accordingly . <h> Assess Deliverability by Email Domain <p> For tips on how to assess your email deliverability overall , check out this post from SendGrid . To assess deliverability by individual domain , you can navigate to the Advanced Reports tab when analyzing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to see the open , click , and bounce rates for a particular campaign broken down by email domain . <p> Most often , open rates are used as the metric to measure the deliverability of a campaign . If you see an open rate below 10% , this may indicate that your emails are going to recipients ' spam folders for a particular domain . <h> Segment Your List by Email Domain <p> If you do notice that a particular email domain has far lower open rates than the others , you can hone in on this domain and take steps to improve your deliverability . Namely , you can segment out email addresses using this domain and treat them differently . <p> Let 's say you notice that you have an open rate of 5% for the Gmail email addresses on your master list , but the open rates for the other domains are above 10% . Create one segment using the parameters below : <p> Then , determine who in this list is engaged . One way you can measure engagement is by including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 30 days and have been added to the list over 30 days ago . <p> Once you 've done this , you can target the remainder of Gmail users by creating a segment of those who have opened an email zero times in the past 30 days and have been added to the list over 30 days ago . Try reactivating these contacts back by sending them a winback series , or test sending frequency to see if you can boost open rates . To reach those who have signed up in the past 30 days , create a third segment . <p> Next , create another segment that will replace your initial master list using the parameters below : <p> These recipients can be treated the same way you treated your initial master list . <h> Conclusion <p> List cleaning is an essential part of maintaining good email deliverability , but sometimes deliverability can vary by email domain .

@@96020796 @220796/ <h> Create an Abandoned Cart Flow <h> Overview <p> One of the most valuable emails for any ecommerce business is the cart reminder or abandoned cart email . Why ? It 's simple : someone was interested in buying from your store , clicked to add an item to his/her cart , entered in shipping information but then stopped . <p> There are a lot of reasons this could happen . This person may not have their credit card in front of them , perhaps the checkout process was too complicated , or maybe he/she wants to look around a bit more before placing- an order . While there are a lot of reasons why people leave mid-checkout , most often it 's not because they 're no longer interested in the product . <p> After you integrate your ecommerce store with Klaviyo , you 'll find several " best practice " flows- ready and waiting your account . You will not see these flows if you have n't integrated an ecommerce platform . <p> Customizing and activating these pre-built flows is a first step to getting started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install the Magento Extension before leveraging our abandoned cart flow , as the Extension is what allows- Klaviyo to receive data whenever someone starts a checkout . For most other ecommerce platforms , after enabling Klaviyo 's built-in integration , you should see Started Checkout data populating in your account . This guide will walk through how to review and customize the abandoned cart flow that you will find pre-populated in your account . <h> How the Abandoned Cart Flow Works <p> Klaviyo 's abandoned cart flow- works by tracking : <p> Whenever someone begins the checkout process <p> Whether or not each person continues on to- complete- the checkout process and place- an order <p> If someone starts but does n't complete the checkout process , this is considered an abandoned cart . This- functionality can be understood by looking closely at how this flow 's trigger and flow filter are- configured : <p> Those that did place an order after- entering this flow- will be skipped by the flow completely . This is because they will fail the flow 's Has Placed Order zero times since starting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email in your flow , Klaviyo will check the flow 's filter before each individual email is sent out so that if someone goes back to complete his/her purchase after Email 1 , this person wo n't get any other- emails in your series . <p> If someone abandons the checkout process and never goes back to complete the process , he/she will get all emails in your abandoned cart series . <h> Customize Klaviyo 's Pre-Built Abandoned Cart Flow <p> We provide an abandoned cart flow for you out-of-the-box that contains two emails that are almost ready to go -- all you need to do is customize them to match your branding. - <p> For an abandoned cart flow , - we recommend sending at least two emails : <p> Email #1 should send between one and four hours after someone starts the checkout process if he/she does n't complete the process <p> Email #2 should send one to two days later as another reminder if someone still has not gone back to complete the checkout process <p> To customize our pre-built- flow templates , - click into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the from label , reply-to email , and if you 'd like , the subject line of each email . <p> Next , you can click- Edit Content . If- you completed the Setup Wizard , your logo , colors , and fonts will already be applied to these flow emails . If you did n't complete this step , you can edit your logo , colors , and fonts within each email itself , - but then you will have to do this for all emails individually one-by-one . <p> The provided abandoned cart email- templates will contain a suggested layout and example text , but you can edit these emails however you 'd like . A few notes : <p> Header ImageIf you adjust your template 's header image , we recommend selecting an image that 's at most 600px wide and no more than 300px tall . <p> Template StyleYou can click on the Styles- icon in the left sidebar to update styles , such as the background color and link color for your email. - <p> Navigation LinksAbandoned cart templates also come pre-built with navigation links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they link to the correct page of your site . <p> Preheader TextYou will want to update the preview text at the top of the email . This is what will show up in someone 's inbox next to the subject before they open your email . <p> When you 're done editing and customizing your templates , you should also preview what your email looks like to make sure you are happy with the result . <h> Learn more <h> Best Practices <h> Timing <p> When scheduling- your abandoned cart emails , keep in mind that people first enter- this flow when they start their checkout . If you schedule an abandoned cart email to send immediately , this means someone will get the email immediately after starting checkout . You want to give your customers some time to complete the checkout process on their own before you start sending reminders . <h> Targeting <p> You can further hone your audience by creating separate abandoned cart flows for separate purposes . For example , you may want to target customers and non-customers differently . <h> Learn more <h> Purchasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by purchaser vs. non-purchaser , one of your abandoned cart flows should send to customers and the other should send to non-customers . The reason you might want to do this is to offer a discount to non-purchasers to encourage them to buy their first product . Repeat customers , on the other hand , may not need a discount incentive to buy . <p> You 'll want to edit the flow filters as follows : <p> Purchasers <p> - <p> Non-Purchasers <h> International vs . Domestic <p> Often , ecommerce stores are able to offer certain perks , like free shipping , to domestic customers . If your store is able to do this , you may want to make this explicit in your abandoned cart emails . To target based on- whether a recipient is international or domestic , - you 'll want to add a- Properties about someone filter that specifies a recipient 's location. - <p> DomesticYou 'll notice that this flow filter that includes the condition- Country is not set . This is to ensure that recipients who you do n't have location data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prefer your default email be sent to international customers , you can add this condition to your international abandoned cart flow instead . <p> - <p> International <h> Cart- Value <p> Targeting based on cart value will give you the opportunity to message those with high-value items in their cart differently . For example , you may want to offer a discount or other incentive to recipients with a cart value greater than $50 . To ensure that recipients with high-value carts do n't receive two abandoned cart emails from you at the same time , you 'll have to build a low-value abandoned cart flow , too , to capture the rest of your audience . <p> High-Value Cart <p> - <p> Low-Value Cart <h> Cart Size <p> Cart size is similar to cart value . You may want to offer a discount to only those who have more than a certain number of items in their cart -- let 's say three items . <p> More Than 3 Items <p> - <p> 3 Items or- Fewer <h> Product Type <p> Depending on your ecommerce integration , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to their cart or the category/collection the product belongs to . For instance , you may want to message men and women differently. - <p> Men <p> - <p> Women <p> - <p> NeitherIf you sell items that are n't in the Men 's or Women 's collections , you 'll want to make sure these shoppers receive abandoned cart emails , too .

What gives ? If you 're following our list growth best practices , odds are you wo n't face this dilemma . That said , however , maintaining a healthy email list- and unsubscribe reduction , while related , are not one and the same . So , here are six tips to reduce your unsubscribe rates : <p> Segment , Segment , Segment <p> Segmentation is your strongest defense against unsubscribes . When building your signup forms , consider allowing new subscribers to choose the frequency at which they 'd like to receive emails . Using this information , create weekly , bi-weekly , and monthly newsletter segments to ensure that you 're not overwhelming your subscribers . You can also allow subscribers to choose what type content they 'd like to receive ( newsletters , product releases , men 's vs. women 's products , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Be Consistent <p> Along with allowing your subscribers to choose the frequency of the emails they receive , you should make sure they know when they 're going to be receiving them . If someone chooses to subscribe to your weekly newsletter , they should be receiving emails on the same day every week , and at the same time ( Tuesdays at 11:00 AM , for example ) . When collecting email addresses , you can even allow subscribers to choose what time of day they 'd prefer to receive emails and use Klaviyo 's Send by Timezone feature to make good on your promise . <p> But first , one thing you should n't do : do n't hide your unsubscribe link . If recipients ca n't find where to go to unsubscribe , they might just mark your email as spam , which is much worse . While your unsubscribe link should be somewhere clear and visible at the bottom of the page , however , you should n't make it one-click-easy to unsubscribe , per se . On the unsubscribe page , include an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fence about unsubscribing . <p> Nothing motivates people like FOMO ( fear of missing out ) . If your subscribers are going to lose access to exclusive sales or information by unsubscribing , they 're going to be much less likely to do so . Some companies , like Huckberry and Rue La La , put their entire websites behind an email wall to really drive this point home . <p> Make Sure Your Emails Are Easy to Read <p> And by easy to read , we mean responsive with fast load times . People are impatient , and no one wants to sit at his or her computer for upwards of 15 seconds waiting for an email to load . To ensure that your emails do n't load too slowly , do n't include huge images and test them out beforehand . Similarly , use an email testing service like Litmus to make sure your emails look great across all ISPs and devices . <p> Survey Those Who 've Unsubscribed <p> Sometimes , there 's just nothing you can do . By surveying those whove unsubscribed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to remedy them . If people complain about the frequency of your emails , for instance , make it more explicit that they can alter this by including a link to the email preferences page at the bottom of all of your emails instead of just your initial signup confirmation email . <p> Unsubscribe links are also a great opportunity to get creative with- fun- copy , like the above example from Chubbies .

But email is still one of the best- strategies- eCommerce marketers can use to increase sales , and drip campaigns are an essential component of your email toolbox . <p> Usually when we think about drip email campaigns , we think about new nurturing subscribers or cold contacts and getting them to make that first purchase . However , - we should re-imagine drip campaigns as not only a tool to drive the first sale , but also a way to cross-sell , up-sell , and retain your customers . <p> In this post well dive into the role of drip campaigns for these three use- cases , plus provide some basic tips for setting your drip campaigns up . <h> What Are- Drip Campaigns ? <p> Drip campaigns , also sometimes known as lead nurturing , are typically a series of emails delivered on a set schedule with the goal of- educating subscribers and moving them- down the sales funnel toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists based on when people joined your email lists and what activities they have taken with your company . <p> The one key benefit of drip campaigns is obvious : - you boost sales ! - But there are less tangible advantages to using drip campaigns in your email marketing strategy : <p> Drip campaigns keep- your brand top of mind . <p> Drip campaigns educate people about your product , increasing the chances they will tell others about it if it comes up in conversation . <p> Drip campaigns make- your company more visible to potential customers , even when they 're not on your site . This increases the overall likelihood these subscribers will buy , even if its not directly through email campaigns . <p> Drip campaigns are easy to measure . You can track opens , clicks , and unsubscribes . Using an email marketing solution likely Klaviyo , you can dial down individual actions from specific subscribers and see how each drip campaign impacted that subscribers choice to make a purchase . Drip campaigns- provide- a lot of intelligence- that you can use to fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What to Consider- When Setting up a Drip Campaign <p> Before you set up your drip campaigns , - you need to keep a few things in mind : <h> Get your content in line <p> Everything is integrated these days , from your social media creative to your blog posts to your email marketing . You should coordinate with your content teams about what content you need for each audience so you have the right site content , - product- guides , videos , and blog posts to link to in your drip campaigns . A good drip email provides something more than a 20% discount to the recipient . It educates or entertains in some way , so you 'll need the right assets in order to do that . Plan ahead and think this part through . <h> Send emails on the right schedule <p> A general rule of thumb is that you should start with a higher frequency when someone first subscribes because that is when someone is most engaged with you . This way you are in their inbox as a reminder every day and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust , brand identity , and credibility has been established , you can take it down a notch to every other day or once a week . From there , you 'll want to optimize things like the time of day and day of week you send your emails . <h> Start with these customer segments <p> You should set up your subscriber segments based on on-site actions . Some good segments to start with would be- subscribers who have made a purchase before and those who havent. - Then , to get more granular , you want to segment even further and separate- subscribers who have made a purchase recently ( like in the past six months ) and subscribers who have not made a purchase recently . While these are a good starting point , your business model may lend itself to some other segments like in-store customers vs. online purchasers . <h> 3 Drip Campaign Ideas <p> As mentioned , usually drip campaigns are only thought of as ways to engage new subscribers and warm them up until they are ready to purchase . In the eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists with discount offers until they- finally break down and buy something one day . Drip nurturing can go beyond that , as exemplified in these three strategies : <h> 1 ) - Use drip campaigns to up-sell <p> Create a drip nurturing track that will get your current customers thinking about a more advanced version of your product. - In terms of content , you can share- case studies , customer stories , or examples that show off advanced use cases . Buyers guides or videos may also work well as content that will allow you to educate your customers about the product and help them see the value of a more sophisticated model . This type of drip campaign is best to share with engaged customer who buy from you frequently . <h> 2 ) Use drip campaigns to cross-sell <p> Cross-selling simply means to recommend products to current customers that complement the products they have already purchased from you . Amazon is a master of the cross-sell , as they constantly feature related items in every possible area of their site . To achieve an effective cross-selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on past purchases and try to identify patterns did many customers that bought X also buy Y ? If so , target customers that bought X but did not buy Y with a recommendation to purchase Y be that a buyers guide , product video , customer testimonial , or a simple product recommendation email . <h> 3 ) Use drip campaigns to improve customer retention <p> Do n't  let your customers get comfortable. - A few weeks or months after a customer- has purchased your product , they 've probably gotten comfortable with the basic functionality . They may- stop looking for ways to get more out of it or even forget they own it. - Do n't  let this happen . Roll your customers into drip campaigns that educate them on the advanced uses of your product and keep them wanting more . <h> Wrapping Up <p> Good drip campaigns vary- from industry to industry , but one truth remains : good content sent at the right time to the right person with the intention of reinforcing the right message is what works . <p> What the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the comments !

@@96020802 @220802/ <h> Adding a Countdown Timer to Your Emails <p> Marissa Petteruti November 24 , 2015 <p> As we discussed in our last blog post and in our webinar last week , creating a sense of urgency is an absolutely crucial step in making a successful Black Friday campaign . That said , there 's no better way to foster the sense that sales are fleeting and products are flying off the shelves than a countdown clock . <p> So , how do you create one and- add it to your emails ? Adding a countdown timer to your emails can get pretty technical , but it does n't  have to . <h> How to Make a Countdown Clock <p> Essentially , there are two ways you can display a countdown clock in your emails : you can use HTML to code one , or you can create a GIF file . <p> The simplest way is to create a GIF that counts down to your specified date or time . If you 've spent any extended period of time on the internet , you 're probably already somewhat familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means you can create a countdown sequence by changing one aspect of the image at a time . Think of it as a sort of stop motion film " as long as the background does n't change , the GIF will move seamlessly between images . In the example above , I only- changed the numbers on the clock . You can also add other animations to the GIF , like changes in color or images . We wrote a post on GIFs in ecommerce emails last year , so check it out if you 're looking for inspiration . There are many online tools to help you create GIFs " gifmaker.me is what we used to make ours . <p> Using Photoshop or any other type of image editor , it 's easy to create the sequence of images you 'd like to use . Then , all you have to do is upload these images to a site like gifmaker.me to create your own GIF . You can also convert- a video into a GIF using a tool like Blog GIF . <p> Alternatively , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web Design has some snippets of code that you can copy into your emails . <h> How to Use GIFs in Your Black Friday Campaigns <p> You can add a GIF in exactly the same way you would insert an image using Klaviyos image- uploading tool . A countdown clock would be especially effective in the final email leading up to the start of sales , with an hour or so left on the clock . <p> GIFs are also a great way to display different colors or variations of products . So , if you 're running a sale featuring an item in several colors or styles , GIFs can effectively get your message across without the need for several redundant images . GIFs can also be used to showcase the features of a certain product , like K-Ways- water-resistant jacket- below . <h> Facts to Keep in Mind <p> GIFs are awesome , but too many in one email can be flashy and distracting . It 's best to keep their use limited to one ( or two max , if you 're using something simple , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear in mind is that GIFs will automatically reset when a recipient leaves the page , and will remain constant no matter when a recipient opens the email " if you send the email at 11:00 PM with a countdown for one hour and a recipient opens the email at 11:30 PM , the clock will still read one hour . <p> And lastly , earlier versions of Outlook ( 2007 , 2010 , and 2013 ) do n't support GIFs ; these domains will simply display the first fame in the GIF , so make sure its an image- that can stand alone . <p> Are you going to use a countdown clock in your Black Friday emails ?

You 're probably also always searching for ways to facilitate the campaign drafting- process , which is why I 've put together five tips to help you hit send on your daily newsletters . <h> 1 . Set Aside Time to Flesh Out Newsletter Templates <p> You may have several different templates that you alternate from day to day , which presents a problem if you simply clone the campaign from the previous day , since the template layout may not be right . While it 's a time investment upfront , taking an hour or two to perfect two to three different newsletter templates will save you a ton of time in the long run . If you already have several campaigns that you like , save them as templates. <h> 2 . Give Your Campaigns Descriptive Names <p> If you alternate newsletter templates from day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one template from another 3-10-2016 Newsletter ( A ) , 3-11-2016 Newsletter ( B ) , for example . That way , you can clone the correct campaign in a pinch if you have n't made it a template . Likewise , if you made a significant change to your template in one of your campaigns that you think you may want to reuse , indicate this in the title . <h> 3 . Keep Your Images Organized <p> When you 're working quickly , it 's incredibly easy to become disorganized and save all the images you need for your daily newsletter to your desktop . Avoid this practice . Files will start to accumulate , and eventually you 'll have to sift through hundreds of images to find the right one . Store your images in different folders for each campaign , and give your images descriptive titles so you can search for them easily . <h> 4 . Send Yourself a Test Newsletter First <p> There are several reasons you should send yourself a test email before sending it to your entire campaign , but they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry . Since your preheader text is usually subtle and in a smaller font than the rest of your email , it can be easy to miss , especially if it 's been carried over from cloning a previous campaign . If you send yourself a test email , it will be immediately obvious in the inbox preview if you 've overlooked your preheader text . <p> Secondly , sending yourself a test email will allow you to determine if your links are correct . Again , this is especially important if you 're working off of a cloned campaign , as some of the links may be broken or outdated . Click all images , buttons , and other links to make sure they lead back to where they 're supposed to . <h> 5 . Adapt Copy from Other Sources <p> When you 're drafting your newsletter , odds are the content corresponds directly with either a page on your site , a blog post , or something similar . Instead of starting from scratch , adapt the copy in your email from one of these sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , provide a short summary of what the post is about , but do n't give everything away .

Short Intro with Strong Call to Action <p> The first email in your welcome series should be sent immediately after a new subscriber signs up and should encourage recipients to take an action . Whether this be visiting a specific page on your website or logging in , your call to action should be unmistakeable . As with any email , you should include your call to action above the fold . What differentiates this email from other emails , though , is that you should only include one call to action in the entire email , otherwise you risk distracting from its main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decipher what exactly you want your subscribers to do after subscribing for your newsletter . Depending on your particular business , this may mean : <p> Viewing a particular collection on your website <p> Viewing the bestsellers on your website <p> Viewing trending products on your website <p> Viewing an informational page on your website <p> Once you decide this , you can make your call to action clear and impossible to miss . <h> 2 . Hero Image with 5 Most Popular Products <p> Since your welcome series is sent to new subscribers , you wo n't have much behavioral data on them ( yet ! ) . Because of this , you ca n't show them a highly curated selection of products , as you might with a repeat buyer . Maximize the chances that new subscribers will see something they like by showing them your five most popular products . Make sure each photo links back to the product page on your website , and consider including a call to action alongside each product . <p> Social proof is a strong motivator for subscribers who have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimonials for one or more of these most popular products . If you do n't  want to include these directly in the email , you can include links to your social media instead , so new subscribers can see how your brand interacts with its customers . <h> 3 . Gallery Email with Next 5 Most Popular Products <p> Your third email should be laid out the same the second , but display five new products . These can either be your next five most popular products , which will eliminate any overlap with the previous email , or five trending products . Which you choose should depend on how many products you sell if you have an extensive product selection , showing your top ten products in your welcome series will be more effective than if you only sell a narrow range of products . <h> Conclusion <p> For ecommerce brands , its incredibly important that your welcome series feature your top selling or trending products . Because new subscribers come with a lack of behavioral data , broaden your net by showing them products that your other customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews , testimonials , and social links can also add validity to your bestselling products . 47562 @qwx907562

This box often appears with the text , " Subscribe to our Newsletter " on the payment page of the checkout process . <p> From Shopify : <p> During the checkout process , customers have the option of receiving email updates from your store . By selecting Keep me updated -- I want to receive occasional emails about new products , promotions and other news , customers will be added to the Accepts Marketing group and you can email them with store updates , newsletters , and discounts . <p> Klaviyo can sync the Accepts Marketing value for each contact when it 's available through the Shopify integration ; this value will either be True or False if it is assigned <p> Klaviyo can also automatically sync customers- added to this " Accepts Marketing group " to a specific Klaviyo subscriber list <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group " during checkout , Klaviyo will only subscribe the shopper to a specific Klaviyo list if that shopper actually completes- the checkout process ( i.e. becomes a customer ) . <p> Shopify will add someone to the- " Accepts Marketing group " even if they only begin a checkout when you have the " Subscribe to Newsletter " box checked by default -- Klaviyo will not automatically subscribe these cart abandoners to a Klaviyo list , even though they may have been added to the- " Accepts Marketing group " in Shopify . This is because it 's unlikely the shopper knew the box was checked and likely does not expect- to be subscribed . Klaviyo will also not automatically subscribe shoppers- who Accept Marketing upon account creation . <h> Preliminary Considerations <p> Before you begin to sync Shopify Accepts Marketing users to a Klaviyo subscriber list , there is one- key thing- to consider : whether or not your " Subscribe to our Newsletter " box during checkout is checked by default . <p> Let 's consider the following situation : a shopper is browsing your site and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to checkout , but second-guesses the purchase and stops . If she made it- to the payment page and your- " Subscribe to Newsletter " box there was- pre-checked , she is now signed up to receive your regular newsletter communications- despite never having consciously opted-in . <p> Two reasons why this is not a good thing : <p> Not a great experience -- the shopper will likely- unsubscribe or ignore- these emails until they start to filter to spam . Either way , - you 've lost your chance to cultivate her as a customer with relevant and targeted emails . <p> While it may be tempting to keep this box checked by default to watch your list grow quickly , it 's important to remember that- quality over quantity matters. - By growing lists of engaged subscribers and focusing on the quality of your leads over quantity , you 're setting yourself up for strong email deliverability and higher conversion rates . <h> Update the Accept Marketings Setting in Klaviyo <p> Navigate to your account's- Integrations tab and click on Shopify .

If you would like us to adjust this setting for your account , please contact success@klaviyo.com . <h> Accepts Marketing as a Dynamic Value <p> As you look to grow your subscriber list through Shopify's- " Subscribe to Newsletter " box at checkout , - keep in mind that the Accepts Marketing property exists independent of whether or not someone separately subscribes to receive emails through a sign-up form. - <p> This means that someone could elect- not- to check the marketing box upon checkout , but then decide to subscribe to your mailing list separately through a sign-up form .

With that in mind , here are- a couple of Kickstarter marketing tips and lessons learned- from successful Kickstarter campaigns . <h> 1 . Make sure you are a good fit for Kickstarter . <p> When you hear- about the Reading Rainbow Kickstarter getting $5 million or that Potato Salad Kickstarter getting $55k and you ca n't help but think there 's a place for you there . <p> When budgeting , you want to account for costs like rewards for backers and paying Kickstarter , who takes a 5% cut . There are also additional credit card processing fees and tax fees you need to include in your calculations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you hit your goal before your campaign is up , you have a chance to email your backers and rally them- for " stretch goals . " <p> This could be a good way to expand your products first run in some way like by offering extra colors or styles . Set a specific stretch goal , and email supporters to let them know exactly what you 'll do with the money if you 're able to raise it . <h> 7 . Tell the story people will understand , not the story you want to tell . <p> Brand positioning can be the- hardest thing in the world for founders , inventors , and artists . <p> You have this idea in your head . Then you have to explain- what 's in your head in ways thatll make sense to those who do n't  have that context . <p> This means you have to peel back the layers of your elevator pitch ( which is likely ten minutes long ) and get to the core of your idea . <p> What is it that you do ? Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is it different ? <p> Before you launch your Kickstarter , test- your story on third parties who will give you frank feedback and let you know if it all makes sense . <p> Worry less about being in " stealth mode " or that someone will take your idea . Worry more about whether or not people will understand what you are doing- and if they will care . <h> 8 . Offer good rewards . <p> The- most popular pledge amount on Kickstarter is $25 , while the pledge average ( for big and small pledges ) rings in at just $70 . <p> Make sure the affordable rewards- do n't  run out too fast , or you risk losing potential backers who ca n't afford the more expensive offers . <p> " During my first campaign , in addition to having a YogoMat as a reward , I also offered other yoga accessories and T-shirts . Backers loved the YogoMat but were not excited about the additional reward items . Finding them too numerous and distracting , they overwhelmingly selected only YogoMats as rewards . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and multiple YogoMats. - As for what to write about for each reward and the Kickstarter " story , " I learned simple is best . In my initial campaign I went way overboard with too much background . I discovered more than three to five lines of straightforward content is too much text to expect someone to quickly read and digest . And when they get overwhelmed , they miss the core message . " <h> 10 . Remember that you are n't  asking for donations . <p> You are selling a product . This is n't a charity . <p> Most people will not pledge- $50 for a DVD that will sell for $10. - You need to- design your rewards and price points so you can hit your goal , while giving your fans the best deal . <h> 11. - Hit 20% as soon as possible . <p> According to Kickstarter , this is the crucial tipping point . 10 percent of projects never receive a single pledge , but- 80 percent of projects that raise more than 20 percent of their goal end up being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress and react to the data . <p> What 's that they say about the best laid plans ? <p> There are- best practices in marketing that are kind of just common sense , and you can rely on those to get you started . But to prioritize , optimize , and get the absolute best results possible , you need to dig into the data and react to it . And sometimes , those plans get thrown out the window . <p> How does that apply to your Kickstarter campaign ? - Take a look at this simple tip from Kickstarter expert Clay Hebert , as reported in the 4-Hour Work Week . <p> If you put a " + " at the end of a- Bit.ly link , you get statistics about referral traffic for that link . You can use this data to see where your Kickstarter page is getting traffic from , and focus your marketing efforts accordingly . <p> Somas campaign was a couple of years ago , but at the time they were seeing a ton of traffic from Facebook , blogs , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook community and coverage in the blogs , since they knew if they did those things they could get featured on Kickstarter. <h> 13 .

@@96020825 @220825/ <h> Automated Email Best Practices Quarterly Contribution Flow <p> Phil Weltman April 21 , 2016 <p> Communicating the right number of times after somebody makes a contribution can have a big impact on their long term support . Sending too many emails can drive higher unsubscribe rates , making it very difficult to engage and raise money from those people in the future . On the other hand , not communicating enough can hurt your supporter engagement and might lead to your supporters deciding your work is not important because they become uniformed . <p> Deciding on when to send is a tough question that does n't necessarily have a right answer . There are strategies you can use however , to engage your supporters consistently over time to maintain your relationship with them . One of the tools you can use to do that is a Quarterly Contribution Flow . <h> What is a Flow ? <p> Similar to a drip campaign , a flow is a series of emails triggered by actions your supporter takes . For example , you could send an automated thank you note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone join a list . <h> The Quarterly Contribution Flow <p> The Quarterly Contribution Flow ( QCF ) is a triggered email that goes out 90 days after someone has contributed . This allows you to engage your donor every quarter , but never right after a donation was made so you are n't over-communicating . <p> The content that goes into your QCF is just as important as the timing . The goal is to provide new and interesting content , for example key recent accomplishments ( Klaviyo has a built-in template for this setup to provide multiple updates ) . Give them a brief description of what you 've been up to with a link to find out more . Help them make the connection between how their past contributions have made an impact and have directly helped the cause you 're working towards . <p> Finally , you should include a call to action . Ask for an additional contribution and suggest a contribution amount that is 5%-15% larger than their last ( depending on the size of their last donation ) . - To learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over time you should see the QCF push your repeat donation rate and average donation size up , - both things that can help you meet your fundraising goals . <h> Conclusion <p> Reaching out to each supporter at the right time with relevant content should be one of your top priorities and can be accomplished with the Quarterly Contribution Flow . Adding the QCF to your email strategy will help you add some consistent messaging that will help you increase your repeat rate and drive up your average donation size . <p> Phil is on the marketing team here at Klaviyo .

@@96020827 @220827/ <h> Integrate a Custom Ecommerce Cart or Platform <h> Overview <p> If you 've built your own ecommerce solution or are using a platform we do n't support yet , you can integrate with Klaviyo using our JavaScript and server side APIs . Keep in mind that any event can be implemented , but we strongly recommend the following buckets : <p> Orders and Order Items - purchase events and the items that comprise those purchases . <h> Note <p> Keep in mind that the detailed data you send to Klaviyo along with website , purchase , and checkout events will determine how you can filter and segment these events in Klaviyo . To understand how data must be structured so that key event details are available for segmentation , check out this guide . <h> Website Activity <p> To track website activity , - find your public API key by navigating to Account &gt; Settings &gt; API Keys. - Your public key is six characters long . Add the following snippet of code to your main store template so it 's included on all pages . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag . <p> Depending on the types of templates you use for your website , the % if user.isloggedin % and user.email - syntax may be different . Using the template language available , you want to check if the person viewing the current page is logged in . If so , you should output their email and name , if available . If you do n't have name information , remove those two lines and the trailing comma after the email " $email " line . <h> Viewed Product <p> If you 'd like to set up a browse- abandonment flow or build segments based on product browsing- data , you 'll need to add JavaScript event tracking for a Viewed Product metric . On your product page template , add the following snippet : <p> The snippet above uses the placeholder syntax , which may need to be altered for your platform . The important part is that product fields are dynamically rendered based on which product page you 're viewing . <p> When you add Klaviyo web tracking to your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " known browsers " -- i.e. browsers that have visited and engaged at least once before . There are two key ways we are able to identify a site visitor for web tracking purposes : <p> If someone has , at some point , clicked through a Klaviyo email to your website <p> If someone has , at some point , subscribed/opted-in through a Klaviyo form <p> Klaviyo will not track anonymous browsers. - After Viewed Product web tracking has been configured for your site , this data will begin populating in your Klaviyo account as known visitors browse your product pages . <h> Checkout Started <p> Checkout data is important if you 'd like to send abandoned cart emails . When someone starts the checkout process , you 'll send Klaviyo an event indicating he/she- started checking out . The best place to trigger this event is when someone visits the checkout page and they 've " identified " themselves by either logging in or entering an email address . <p> To start , let 's assume someone is logged in . In that case , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website activity tracking we set up above , so all you need to do is make a track call like the one below . <p> The Checkout Started event looks very similar to the Placed Order event , except that the " event " is different . You 'll want to make sure you include all the details of the line items so your abandoned cart emails can be customized to include pictures and links to all products in someone 's cart . It 's probably easiest to format the JSON data in the checkout page template where you can access to the cart contents , but other ways of getting the data will work as well . Here 's an example track call using our previous order example : <h> Orders and Order Items <p> To track orders and order details , after an order is placed , you- should make a track call to our server-side API . The API requires making an HTTP request with a JSON and base64 encoded payload . Check to see if you can use one of Klaviyo 's language libraries , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the built-in libraries for the language you 're using to encode your requests . <h> Note <p> It is a good practice to send your historical order data to enhance your ability to segment off that data and improve- historical accuracy in revenue tracking . <p> You 'll want to send order data to Klaviyo in one of two ways : real-time or in batch . <p> Real-time : - You 'll make requests as soon as an order is placed <p> Batch : - You should write a script that will run at least once an hour that makes one track request for each order in the last time period <p> It 's important to send this data at least once an hour if you 'll be sending abandoned cart emails 2-4 hours after someone starts checking out . If you 'll be sending them even sooner , e.g. 30 minutes after someone starts checking out , you 'll need to send order data in real-time or at least every 20 minutes . <p> For each order , we recommend you send two types of events : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event for each line item called Ordered Product . <p> As an example , if you were running a bookstore and John Smith placed an order for Winnie the Pooh and a Charles Dickens ' Tale of Two Cities , you would make the below track for Placed Order : <p> $eventid is a special property which uniquely identifies this event in case you send it to Klaviyo twice ; the value should be the order I 'd from your database <p> $value is a special property that allows Klaviyo to track revenue ; this should be the total price of the order <p> The " Items " array should contain one dictionary for each line item ; if the quantity for a line item is greater than one , the " Row Total " should be the " Item Price " multiplied by the quantity <p> Product URL and Image URL are optional , but we recommend them in case you want to send post-purchase emails highlighting previous purchases <p> For example , if you wanted to send a " Please write us a review " follow-up , displaying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it more likely for your customers to follow through <p> The " time " should be a UNIX- timestamp of the order date and time <p> The " brand " and " categories " fields are optional ( if you do n't have them ) <p> Then for each line item , you should make track call for an Ordered Product event , as well : <p> Note there are two calls , one for each line item . Most of the data is the same as the " Items " - array from the Placed Order event . <p> $eventid in this case should be a unique identifier for the line item for that order . It 's common to do that by combining the order I 'd and the SKU or product I 'd together . In this case we combined them with an underscore . If you have an order item I 'd for each line item , you could use that as well . <p> $value is the " Row Total " from the previous track call and is the total price of that line item . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it will allow you to find people who have purchased products from specific categories . This is useful when you have new products and want to send campaigns to people who might be interested in similar products . We recommend that " Product Categories " represents the entire category hierarchy for that product so you can find customers who 've purchased from narrow as well as broad categories . <p> If you have " Brand " or other attributes about products you might want to use for targeting later , include those as additional key-value pairs in the properties dictionary . In our example , it might make sense to include an " Author " property so we can let customers know about new books from that author or recommend other books by the same author in the future . <p> At this point , you 're tracking the most important order data . If your cart also tracks when orders are fulfilled or shipped , we recommend also sending a Fulfilled Order event . The track call for that event should look the same as the Ordered Product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled or shipped . This event is useful for doing post-purchase follow-ups which are more coordinated with when someone receives their package . For example , you can send a " How are you liking your PRODUCT ? " email two weeks after someone 's order has been fulfilled if you know all your orders ship in 7-10 days . <h> Check that Your Custom Integration is Working <p> The first thing to check is whether or not Klaviyo is receiving events correctly . To do this , you can- log into your Klaviyo account and click on the Metrics tab . This tab will show all the different events ( or metrics ) syncing into your Klaviyo account . You should see the following metrics here : Placed Order , Ordered Product , and Started Checkout . You may also see a metric for Active on Site . If you do , that means we 've received at least one event for each of those metrics . <p> Next , for each metric , click on the Activity Feed icon to view a list of the most recent events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics you 're expecting in Klaviyo , here are a few things to consider : <p> The Placed Order and Checkout Started metrics wo n't show up until someone has placed an order or checked out , respectively

They do this as part of a Kickstarter campaign , because the email input thingy came as part of the CMS template , or because the email service provider- was a cheap app to tack on to their Shopify or BigCommerce store . <p> From there , the shop owners- approach to email marketing is n't really a formal one. - Either they a ) totally ignore that list and let it collect dust or b ) hit it every day or week with the same exact newsletter content to every single subscriber . <p> They do this for a few months or years and do n't  see a ton of revenue from it , but continue to " do email marketing " because they think its something they " should be doing . " <p> I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its understandable . Youve got your hands full as an eCommerce shop owner . But as you mature beyond these early stages , you will approach a time- when it makes sense to reconsider your scrappy customer communication approach and commit to an email- strategy upgrade . <p> Not sure if you 're at that point ? Here are a few- signs- to watch out for . <h> 1 ) Youve hit a plateau . <p> When you first launch , you 're the- pretty new girl at school . The publics curiosity around shiny new objects can spark a ton of press , social media interest , and initial sales- from early adopters . <p> Then you come down from that high and have a reality check . <p> You realize that to expand beyond the early adopter crowd , you have to put in a little more work. - - Mainstream consumers need a little more convincing before they click " buy . " They need more product information , brand credibility , or monetary incentives ( read : sales ) . - Advertising , PR , - blogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these folks to the door . Email , however , - is the ultimate way to nurture them with these messages and get them to convert . <p> How the right email program can help : - A segmented email strategy- would help a lot in this- scenario . You need to split up your list and separate the newbies from the subscribers who have bought from you before . Then , you need to market to them accordingly . To make this happen you need an email system that syncs with your subscribers real on-site behavior and let 's you automatically build lists based on that behavior. <h> 2 ) Youve expanded your product line . <p> Imagine this hypothetical situation : A company starts out by selling one product . They do really well- with that . So , to build- off of this success , they expand into more products and organically bring in a fresh crowd- of customers interested in that new thing . Sales still do n't  seem to be quite where they should be , though. - A quick survey reveals that- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new stuff . <p> This situation actually is n't so hypothetical at all . Its a very similar to what happened to our customer , Holstee , when they expanded their product offerings beyond their trademark Manifesto posters into other collectables , like the- Holstee wallet . <p> Holstee had a natural opportunity to reach out to these early customers who had only bought the Manifesto poster . They set up campaigns to do just that , - and- strong open rates- ( &gt;40% ) and very high click-through rates ( &gt;30% ) on those sends . They saw- a significant direct impact on revenue , as well . While a high number of recipients opened and clicked right away , purchases often occurred across multiple sessions . <p> You have to evolve your product line so that your brand does n't  grow stale , but you also have to bring your customers with you on that journey . If your analytics show you that your first-time buyers havent been back to the site in a while , it could very well be that they do n't  know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email program can help : - To- execute on a campaign like Holstee , you want- to use a program that offers an API and allows you to send historical data to its system so you can start these campaigns when you are ready for them. - Similar to the first example , segmentation and personalization of your campaigns becomes important as your company grows , as - your product lines and customer personas grow more diverse , and as your marketing becomes more complex . <h> 3 ) You hired your first marketer . <p> Well , obviously , as a marketer the first thing I have to say- - is congrats ! Were a fun bunch to have in the office . = <p> Now , on to the serious stuff . <p> Like every employee at a startup , this first marketing hire- should be ready to wear many hats. - Whether or not you- think you were hired to own a particular area of marketing , it quickly becomes part of your role . That 's partially the nature of startups , but its also because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case in point : If you run a blog , who owns setting up blog newsletter subscriptions and sending out those emails ? - Boom . Gotcha . You , dear blogger , are suddenly doing email marketing , too . ) <p> How the right email program can help : - There are a few things to keep in mind here . <p> First , you want a program- that 's easy to use . You need a program that- offers a lot of- technical capabilities , but is also- understandable- for non-technical employees . Yes , todays marketers are certainly more technical than ever before . However , quite frankly , that technical skill is typically basic HTML , CSS , Photoshop , MySQL , and sweet Excel formulas not APIs or coding email templates from the ground up . <p> Be realistic . Invest in a program that offers the right features for everyone on the team . Your- email program should make it easy to create templates ( a drag-and-drop template builder goes a long way ) , build lists , and find metrics . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have a system- that can- handle your product nurture emails ( if there 's an app component to your business ) , blog subscriptions , marketing nurture emails , and transactional emails all in one place . With limited time and budget , you do n't  want to scramble between various email service providers and have to organize your lists in several different places .

You can also dive into your current form code and explore the following common issues : <p> 1. - Each line of the JavaScript call needs a comma after it except the last line . If you 're missing a comma , this will cause a- syntax error and the form wo n't submit on the same page . If you have a comma after the last line of code , this will also cause a syntax error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I 'd specified in the JavaScript snippet ( or you 're missing the JavaScript snippet completely ) . Note in the example below that the form I 'd is the same as the I 'd in the JavaScript , with a- - # in front . The I 'd in the JavaScript must include a- # . For example , - - #emailsubscribe - will work , but- emailsubscribe will not . This snippet is required for your form to submit . <h> Form Fields or Button Do n't Disappear on Submit <p> If you're- trying to hide sections of your form after it 's submitted , they must be wrapped with a- div- element with either the klaviyofieldgroup or klaviyoformactions class . Also make sure you 're using the hideformonsuccess option. - For example : <h> General Issues <p> 1. - Form is n't working as expected because- there are multiple forms with the same I 'd on a page . This can happen if you use Klaviyo 's form builder and add more than one default form without updating the form 's I 'd . To fix this issue , change the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JavaScript . Run a search for all Klaviyo form code on your site if you 're concerned there may be conflicting form code- ( or partial form code ) with the same I 'd . <p> 2. - Success message does n't appear after form is submitted. - Your form needs to include a div with the class of successmessage . This is where Klaviyo will put the success message after a form is submitted and it 's the element Klaviyo will show after a successful submission . <p> 3. - Form does n't redirect to the correct URL- after it 's submitted. - Make sure that there is an- http : //- in front of the URL in the success setting . <p> 4. - Form submits , but no one is being added to the list. - If your list has double opt-in enabled , new subscribers will receive an email after opting in that prompts them to confirm their email address . Only after a new subscriber confirms his/her email address will this person be added to your list . If you 're testing out a new form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double opt-in enabled , you will not see these email addresses added to your list .

To this end , make sure your message is clear and your email is to the point . <p> Branded : Your stores experience online should be matched in the email . By giving customers a common experience , you further reinforce the look and feel of your brand in their mind , as well as making it very easy for them to know who the email is from and what its about . <p> Attractive : You have limited chances each year to interact with your customers . Its worth taking the effort to make your best impression . <h> Step 1 : Add your Logo to the top <p> As a first step , add your logo at the top of the email by clicking the default white box . If you have a logo with an invisible background , use that . If you do n't yet have a logo , you can just put your store name in clean large text at the top . <p> The goal is to carry over the same look and feel of your online store , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also has the benefit of immediately telling the customer who the email is from . <h> Step 2 : Make the Email Personal , Helpful , and Simple <p> If you 're using an existing template , you 'll notice that the text is already populated for the basic shipping information. - You 'll also see lots of other text like shippingaddress.name " this is what 's replaced with the shipping information once you send the email . <p> For most emails you send to customers , a few tips that we 've seen work well : <p> Be personal : Your emails should reflect your brand and personality , so do n't hesitate to use a more casual tone . <p> Be helpful : Because there is a real person on the other end of these emails , you should offer people the help they need. - Include an email address or a phone number if people need help with something . <p> Be simple : If you 're sending an order confirmation , make sure the email has all the information the customer will need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , so take advantage of the opportunity to make a good impression . <h> Step 3 : Take advantage of the opportunity <p> Given that you 're already sending customers an email , consider taking advantage of the opportunity to add any other message to customers . <p> Some ideas : <p> Add social media link buttons <p> Add a picture of new products in your store with a link back to them <p> Add a special discount code for customers who make their second purchase within 30 days <p> Encourage people who order to refer a friend <p> To do this , you can add new sections to your email using the drag and drop interface : <p> For example , if you wanted to add a link to your Facebook or Twitter account , you can drag over the Button Bar , then choose the buttons you want to add : <h> Step 4 : Preview your Email <p> Once you 've created the email you want , you can preview the end result by clicking Preview on the left . <p> You 'll then have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the email sent to you . <p> Over time , we 're also going to add the ability to preview your emails with the actual order data from your store. - Hook your store up to Klaviyo here and we 'll let you know when that 's ready . We 're also some new free reports and tools that it 'll give you access too . <h> Step 5 : Load Templates into Shopify <p> Once you 've finished your template , you can follow these instructions to add the new templates back into Shopify . <p> If you need any help or run into any issues , do n't hesitate to email us at support@klaviyo.com and we 'll do our best to get back to you right away . <p> We 'd also love it if you checked out Klaviyo 's full email marketing solution " here 's a feature tour and a video showing you how it works .

@@96020852 @220852/ <h> Feature Launch : Product Recommendations <p> Marissa Petteruti September 1 , 2015 <p> Today , we have a big announcement : were launching automatic , dynamic product recommendations . - Klaviyo will generate a set of recommendations based on what customers have purchased and insert them into your emails . That 's it. - No third-party software , no complicated setup . Recommendation algorithms can be complex , but adding recommendations to emails should be easy . Now that you can easily- add products to- your emails to enable individualized recommendations , you only need to check a box and those products will be filtered and sorted based on each recipients purchasing behavior . Best of all , product recommendations are enabled on all Klaviyo accounts . <p> For all users on Shopify , this feature will be available immediately . It will be available later this week for- Magento , WooCommerce , Bigcommerce , and Spree , and its coming soon for users on other platforms or custom platforms . <p> Why product recommendations are a big deal <p> If you 've ever shopped at Amazon , odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product recommendations a core part of their marketing strategy , and now you can do the same . Emails that adapt to individual customers ' profiles are more effective , both in terms of clicks and money spent . Therefore , it 's only natural that emails containing customized product recommendations based on individuals ' unique shopping history and patterns will be more effective " the more personalization , the better , and these recommendations will get you one large step closer to perfectly matching your emails to your customers ' needs and interests . <p> Until now , product recommendations have required either a significant engineering investment , the purchase of third-party tools , or have been limited to extremely basic recommendations . Klaviyo changes the game by making recommendations easy-to-use , technologically sophisticated , and customizable from user to user . <p> How product recommendations work <p> Depending on your store 's needs or preferences , you can choose what information drives the product recommendations your customers receive . Previously , we offered two product feeds which displayed recommendations based on your trending and bestselling products , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature builds its results by using each customers purchasing behavior , comparing it with every other customers behavior , and finding customers with similar interests to rank products . <p> Like product feeds , you can filter product recommendations by category or collection , so that only items within a certain category are displayed . This will allow you to even further narrow the selection of products that are shown to your customers . Additionally , as with product feeds , customers will not be shown products they 've already purchased . <p> What makes our product recommendations different <p> Product recommendations are built right into Klaviyo , which means you do n't need to invest in third-party products or meddle with integrations . If you 're new to Klaviyo , simply create an account and you 'll be able to start using our product recommendations feature immediately . The setup wizard will prompt you to choose which product feed- you 'd like to use . If you 're already a Klaviyo user , just login , go to the Data Feeds ' tab , and edit your product feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run multiple feeds at once , so you 're not locked into just one option . Once you 're using the email content editor , you can edit your product feed to include personalized recommendations within the feed you 've chosen . <p> Ways to use product recommendations <p> Like product feeds , product recommendations can be included in virtually any type of email . Incorporating recommendations into a newsletter could be a great way to maximize the airtime of these products , if you will , since businesses tend to distribute newsletters frequently .

Klaviyo- will break down deliverability performance by email domain , email client , and country . This data will allow you to analyze how your campaigns are performing across several different categories , and give you insight into how your customers are viewing and interacting with your emails . <p> What are Delivery Reports ? Our deliverability reports will track deliverability performance by Internet service provider . Because we divided reports into these three categories , you 'll be able to easily identify commonalities amongst users . If you 're studying your performance by email domain report and there is an unusually high bounce rate amongst gmail.com users , for example , you 'll be able to tell and take steps to rectify the issue . To view these reports , simply click the Advanced Reports ' tab in your campaign overview ( shown above ) . <p> Performance by Email Domain <p> Email performance by domain outlines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yahoo.com , etc . We track send rate , bounce rate , open rate , click-through rate , and conversion metric ( which in this case is Placed Order , ' but will vary from user to user ) . As we mentioned in the previous example , this information could alert you to discrepancies in your emails across domains , or simply give you insight into which domain your customers are most likely to use . Say the majority of your customers use gmail.com " given this knowledge , you may choose to invest in Google Ads , since you know many of your customers are frequently exposed to this site . <p> Performance by Email Client <p> Performance by email client will allow you to track open rates by your customers ' email providers , web browsers , and devices . Like the performance by domain reports , performance by client reports will reveal any unusual discrepancies . <p> Analyzing the difference in open rate across mobile and desktop platforms is especially useful . If , as is the case in the above example , a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should pay special attention to ensuring that your emails are mobile-ready . Luckily , Klaviyo 's email template editor makes it incredibly easy to create responsive emails and preview them for mobile devices . Simply switch to the mobile view to see how your emails will appear . <p> Performance by Country <p> While the description is somewhat self-explanatory , being able to determine open rates by country is an important piece of understanding your customer base . Once you know where the majority of your customers are , you can effectively market to your target audience . <p> Up Next You can look forward to even more campaign reports in the very near future . Soon , we 'll have visual click maps that will show you how many clicks each of the links in your emails accumulates for any given campaign .

@@96020859 @220859/ <h> Custom CSS , JavaScript , and HTML in Klaviyo <h> Klaviyo Does Not Support JavaScript Emails <p> Most email clients ( Gmail , Hotmail , Yahoo , etc. ) view JavaScript in emails as a security threat . This is because scripts can hide malicious content . As a result , these major email clients block scripts in emails entirely . Given the inherent security threat associated with JavaScipt in emails- and the lack of support for such scripts by most major email clients , any added scripts will automatically be removed . <h> Klaviyo Does Not Support Embedded Forms or Videos <p> Klaviyo does not support embedded forms , widgets , or videos in templates . This is because our testing shows that these types of features do not reliably render across all major email clients . Similar to JavaScript snippets , most email clients view these elements as a security threat and strip them out of emails altogether . <h> Learn more <h> Custom HTML and CSS Elements <p> Certain HTML and CSS elements used to make emails interactive are not currently supported . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gmail by using certain CSS attribute selectors , you may see your template trigger an error in Klaviyo . <p> Klaviyo does not currently support certain operators ( like ) in email templates .

@@96020861 @220861/ <h> Use Buttons in an Email to Collect Information About Your Recipients <h> Overview <p> In Klaviyo , you can use links or buttons within an email to automatically collect information from your email recipients . For example : <p> In your newsletter campaigns , add buttons that let users specify how many times a week they want to receive emails from you <p> In a thank you email to a new customer , prompt the recipient to update profile details such as gender <p> In a winback email , prompt a customer to choose the category of products they are most interested in learning more about <p> In order to leverage this feature , you will first need to configure your Manage Preferences pages -- you may want to only update the preferences page for a particular list , or also update the preferences page for your default email forms . <p> This guide will explain how to configure a- preferences page to collect the information from customers/subscribers , and then detail how to build email templates that include linked buttons for data collection . <h> Configure Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the data you want to collect to your preferences pages : <p> If you plan to insert these data collection buttons in a behavior-triggered flow email , or in a campaign email that is sent to a segment , you will want to update the preferences page within the Default Email Forms tab in your account <p> If you plan to insert these data collection buttons into a list or segment-triggered flow email , or in a campaign email that is sent to a list , you will need to update the preferences page for a specific list <p> If you want to collect the same standard information from all of your contacts , we recommend making all of your preferences pages consistent . This way , when someone clicks to manage their preferences , they will have the chance to share all potentially useful information about themselves with you . You , in turn , can then leverage this information to further personalize and target your emails . <p> For preferences pages attached to a list , you will need to add fields to your list 's subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences page . When someone first signs up , you will want to collect as much information at signup as possible since some subscribers may never decide to update their preferences . <p> You will want these exact same fields on your preferences page , however , so contacts have a way to keep any set preferences up-to-date . We automatically link these pages for you . This means that any fields you 'd like to appear on your preferences page have to be added directly to the list 's subscribe page . There is no " Add Field " section on the preferences page itself . <p> - <p> If you are editing the preferences page for your Default Email Forms tab , however , you will be able to add fields to this form directly . <h> Create Data Collection Links or Buttons in Your Email <p> At this point , you 've already identified the information you want to collect and added the appropriate fields to your preferences pages . The next step is to add buttons or links to the email template that you plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or links , but when you first drag them into your template , you wo n't add a link URL. - <p> - <p> Rather than a URL , you 'll add specific tags in the Link URL box that specify which value the link will be tied to . These look like this : <p> Use preferencelink when there is only one option , e.g. , radio buttons . This is best used for collection fields like gender or an age bracket . The preferencelink tag assumes the property is a string ( i.e. not a list ) . <p> Use multipreferencelink when there are multiple options , e.g. , checkboxes . This is best used for collection fields that prompt the user to select from a list of preferences . The multipreferencelink tag assumes the property is an array/list <p> For the above example , we would use % preferencelink ' Gender ' ' Male ' % for the " Male " button and % preferencelink ' Gender ' ' Female ' % for the " Female " button. - <p> When someone clicks a data collection button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value this person select will be immediately stored in Klaviyo and populated on his/her Klaviyo profile <p> The contact will immediately be taken to their Manage Preferences page with the updated field highlighted so they can confirm <p> In addition to providing confirmation that the field has been updated , this has the added advantage of also prompting the subscriber to submit more information after reviewing your full preferences page . <h> Using Data in Emails <p> Once you 've started to collect data from your emails , you then use it in your emails. - This data is stored just like a regular customer property , and can be used to : - <p> Create segments that use these properties as conditions in the definition ; for example , you can create a segment of your newsletter list that only includes those with a daily email preference <p> Split flows by different properties ; for example , you could have a female-only- winback and a male- only winback if you collect gender information <p> Personalize emails using this data ; for example , if you prompt someone in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , you can then insert this property variable into a follow-up email configured so each recipient will receive a message that says , " We 've recorded your favorite food as !

From start to finish , it should take between 30-60 minutes to go through the entire guide . <h> Before You Start <p> If you 're using Magento , Shopify , BigCommerce or other popular carts , Klaviyo has an integration pre-built . Before you go any further , make sure you check the list of integrations to see if Klaviyo can automatically connect to your cart . <h> Initial considerations <p> When someone starts and finishes the checkout process , you 'll need to send Klaviyo an event indicating that the checkout has begun . There are two ways to do either from a web page when someone starts checking out or in your cart 's code . Sending events from your cart 's code is more reliable , so it 's recommended . Whichever way you choose , you 'll use the Analytics API . If you end up sending it from a customer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkout is considered started when a customer has items in their cart and is either logged in or enters their contact information . At that point you will send Klaviyo a " Started Checkout " event . <p> A checkout is considered finished or complete when a customer submits their order . Depending on the payment methods you accept , this may or may not mean a customer has actually paid , although typically an order is not confirmed until payment has been authorized . Once the order has been placed , you will send Klaviyo a " Placed Order " or " Finished Checkout " event . <p> Before we get into the details , here are few things to consider : <p> How many steps are in your checkout process ? If you collect a customer 's contact and payment information at the same time , you wo n't be able to send abandoned cart emails . If your checkout process is a single step , consider breaking it into multiple steps . <h> Question to think about <p> How many steps are in your checkout process ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , you wo n't be able to send abandoned cart emails .

If you do n't have one , you can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URL .

When someone starts the checkout process by giving you their email and contact information , you will send this data to Klaviyo . <p> If you 're tracking checkouts from the checkout page in JavaScript , once someone fills out their contact information and you 've validated it , " identify " the customer first and then " track " the checkout .

You can control how many hours or day after a checkout is started you want to reach out and what kind of incentive or discount you want to offer them . <p> Klaviyo also comes with pre-built abandoned cart templates that make it easy to create great looking and compelling emails that include descriptions and images of what 's in someone 's cart .

But online , you might have a chance to win someone back . <p> Enter the abandoned cart email . ( We prefer to call them " cart reminders " at Klaviyo , but more on that in a bit. ) - A lot of people have mixed feelings about them. - There are plenty of people who do n't  checkout because they werent quite ready , but probably do want to buy. - After all , they- added- something to their cart , started- the checkout process and- then suddenly stopped . <p> So sending them an email makes- sense , but it can also feel a little , for lack of a better word , sleazy . You 're pushing someone to buy- and you 're not sure whether you 're being helpful or seeming too- aggressive . <h> Why You send Abandoned Cart Emails <p> At Klaviyo , we- believe you should have one goal when you send email : delight your recipients . Because if you make people happy , not only will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passionate customers who- advocate for- your business . <p> How does this philosophy jive with the abandoned cart email ? Seems a bit contradictory , right ? <p> Let 's go back to- the mall example . Imagine you 're walking out and an employee- walks over and says , " Hey ! Saw you were leaving . Sure you did n't  want to buy that shirt you were looking at ? " - Probably not going to win you over . <p> Alright , really corny . But you smiled , did n't  you ? And now if she said , " Hey , thanks for coming in today . If you 're still interested in that shirt , were here . " Now you 're thinking a bit more . Whatever reason led you to walk away before , you 're giving it a second thought . Why ? Because she made you smile . She delighted you . <p> This is a great strategy and the facts back it up . The New Yorks Times bestseller- Buyology- by Martin Lindstrom- summarizes years of research he conducted about what causes people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study , " which found that a smile from a salesperson leads to more sales . That- probably is n't surprising , but it turned out to be one the- major influencers of purchasing behavior . <p> So here 's a crazy idea , make your abandoned cart email funny . Make it something people will chuckle at . This is why we prefer to call these types of emails cart reminders instead of abandoned cart emails . The important part is n't that someone " abandoned " their cart . The main focus shouldnt- be on you recouping something that was- abandoned . The important part- is that your customers have given you a chance to build a relationship by sending a reminder . Even if they 're not interested in that purchase , you 're leaving them with a positive feeling towards your brand which might pay off right then or down the road . <p> Or , if you prefer a- dollars and cents view of abandoned- cart emails , they- increase- sales . But that does n't  need to be the focus . Leaving potential- customers with a smile can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideas to make your abandoned cart funny <p> Most abandoned cart emails include a table- of the items in your cart with pictures and a link to go back to your cart . By itself , that email can seem like a naked sales pitch . You can change that- by adding a funny picture and caption above that content . By changing the first thing people see when they open your email , the entire tone of the email changes . here 's an example : <p> If you 're not sure what type of image- to- use , here are three themes- to give you some ideas : <p> Shocked expressions. - Finding images of shocked- expressions is pretty easy and theyre- eye catching . The- caption for- your image- can be something simple , such as " Wait ! Where did- you go ? " Or , if you want to be more creative , you can lead with an overly dramatic sentence and then follow it up with a completely sober one . For example , " Noooooo ! ! ! Do n't  leave us here ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Do n't  worry , were not actually crazy . We just wanted to remind you about your order in case you 're still interested . " <p> Cute sadness . Think- big cartoon-ish , doe eyes. - The kind of image that evokes a sense of vulnerability and makes someone want to go " awwww. " - Animals , especially small or young ones , are always a crowd pleaser . The caption could read , " This little guy is sad you left , " or , " He looks like he might just cry . " <p> Absurd . And lastly , you could throw a complete curve ball and lead- with an image- that seems unrelated to your business . You know those OldSpiceads ? Something like that. - For example , maybe- you think the reason someone did n't  finish checking out is because they were captured by pirates while lying on the beach . You could have a picture of a- pirate- ship- with a caption- that reads , " We noticed you left. - Did pirates take you hostage while you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert business- name- Armada to save you . " <p> With that in mind , give it a try . If you 're not sending abandoned cart or cart reminder emails now , you 've got a good reason to do it . Itll help you build relationships with customers as well as increase sales . If you 're already sending these emails , give this strategy a try . Youll be surprised how- email engagement- and sales- jump . 
@@96020873 @220873/ <p> Our new feature this week " product feeds " will allow you to automatically display your trending or bestselling products in any email to personalize emails in minutes and drive more email revenue . Whether you 're following up a first time buyer 's purchase with an automated email highlighting your bestsellers or including your trending products in your newsletter each week , product feeds add dynamic content to your emails that both increases conversion rates and engages your recipients . <p> Product feeds will automatically- exclude items that customers have already purchased , too , so recipients will feel like you have deliberately selected products just for them . This part of the feature launches Thursday , but any feeds you set up now will exclude past- purchases as soon as its launched . From order- confirmation emails to newsletters to win-back campaigns , product feeds make every email you send better . <p> How Product Feeds- work <p> Klaviyo 's product feeds will populate your emails based on one of two options : overall product popularity or trending product popularity . Once you choose a ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each product . You can also customize how many products are displayed per email , with a maximum of nine . To narrow down which products are shown , you can filter results by category ( or collection , if you 're using Shopify ) , so only the most popular or trending products in a certain category will be shown . For example , if you 're an online department store and you 're sending an email about shirts , but shoes are your most popular product , you can filter your feed to include only shirts . <p> For example , take the email above put together for Ministry of Supply . The set of images automatically excludes the coat a customer purchased previously , as well as the sale category you- chose to leave out . - After that customization , - it shows just the set of products you- want your customer to see , prioritized in the right order . <p> Once the feed is created , the order is chosen , and youve- selected which categories to include and exclude , the block of products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email editor . Klaviyo takes care of the rest . That 's it " no- code , no complicated queries , no HTML . Everything is running within minutes . <p> To start , product feeds will be immediately available for stores using Shopify , Magento , WooCommerce , Bigcommerce , and Spree , but they 'll be made available for stores on other platforms or on custom platforms soon . <p> When to use Product Feeds <p> Our goal in creating this feature is to make it easy to send more targeted and personalized emails , while simultaneously saving you time . <p> Bestselling products make it easy to send order follow-ups that feature popular products " you may also decide to filter to by the category someone has already purchased from , to ensure that the suggestions are as relevant as possible . Whether you 're setting up a new , triggered email that goes out 7 days after a purchase to recommend another product , or just improving your current newsletters , a block of bestselling products quickly adds dynamic content . <p> Trending products are defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many situations in which you may decide to use this feature " to account for seasonality , for example . Let 's use the same example of the online department store . If December is approaching and the weather is getting colder , you can set your filter to include only winter coats . These feeds might already be somewhat self-selecting due to the fact that they 're trending products " i.e. you might not need to use a filter for only winter coats to be displayed . However , if , come January , you 're having a sale on winter coats , a filter would be a great tool to ensure that only sale items are included among the trending products in your emails . It 's also the perfect way to display new , popular products that have n't been on the market long enough to fit into the bestselling category . <p> The email real estate for these product feeds is practically unlimited , but one great place to include them would be your order confirmation emails . Order confirmation emails , by definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in your products and a willingness to buy " therefore , it makes a lot of sense to show them other products they might also like . Whether you set these feeds to display products by all-time popularity or by trending popularity , they 'll automatically update over time , too , so you wo n't have to manually revise them . <p> Another huge advantage of these feeds is that they wo n't display products your customers have already purchased . This way , your customers will receive truly personalized suggestions and wo n't be repeatedly bombarded with products they already have . <p> How to use Product Feeds <p> The main step in getting started with product feeds is configuring your feed preferences . If you click your Data Feeds ' tab , you 'll see a new option called Add Product Feed . ' When you go to this page , you can input your settings . You will see an unweighted ' option , which means the products displayed in the feed will be randomly selected . <p> Product feeds will be shown as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would with a text , image , or other block , simply drag the product feed block into your email draft . You will be able to edit this block 's content , layout , etc. , like the others , and can choose how many products you would like to display . <p> You 'll see image placeholders , but there 's no need to fill them in " Klaviyo will take care of the rest based on your settings . After you take two minutes to configure your feed settings in the Data Feeds ' tab , the only time you 'll need to spend inserting these feeds into your emails is the second it takes to drag the feed block into the template . <p> The Value of Personalization <p> The ability to automatically add popular and trending items to your emails drives higher email conversion and makes it easy to keep your emails engaging . Doing this yourself- would mean spending time in spreadsheets and manually including products " not to mention you would have no way to automatically remove the products someone had bought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store data through deep integrations , product feeds would either be impossible , involve expensive third party tools or , in the case of some enterprise sending platforms , take a ton of configuration . <p> Product feeds in Klaviyo are just the first step in automatically creating more personalized emails with just the click of a button . In the coming weeks , we 'll be releasing another feature " product recommendations " that will completely revolutionize every email you send . <p> Which type of product feed do you think you 'll use the most ? Is there another feed you 'd like us to add ?

Yes , Klaviyo will not recommend products that are out of stock . <p> CaseyApril 9 , 2016 <p> I would like to add a feed in my shipping confirmation email . Is there a way to have the items in the feed come from a collection that the customer purchased from ? <p> Marissa PetterutiApril 11 , 2016 <p> Hi Casey you could do this by creating a separate shipping confirmation email for each collection . So , you would have a flow triggered by the purchase of X product , and in this email you would select a product feed that contains only items from the corresponding collection . We do n't  currently dynamically select which feed to use in your emails , but I 'll put in an enhancement request for this !

@@96020878 @220878/ <p> Its an interesting company for sure , and one that definitely recognizes the importance of data and email to drive revenue . Sign up for the site yourself and you 'll certainly see how they use email to nudge you to make a purchase . <p> In this post , well dissect their strategy - so you can learn what they are doing and apply their methods- to your own site . <h> 1 ) Track Everything That Happens On Your Site <p> So much for serendipity . Nothing on Amazon.com is left up to chance . <p> Every product recommendation , every product category , and every advertisement is tailored to you based on account information and past browsing and purchase behavior . <p> What 's interesting is how upfront Amazon is about its data collection . They actually encourage customers to participate in the process . <p> In your account management settings , you can review- your recommendations and rate them . By doing this , you train- Amazons algorithm by providing it with more information , so it can offer you better recommendations and so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works . <p> Key lesson : Track what your customers do on your site and send that data back to your email service provider . If you use a platform like Klaviyo , you can leverage these on-site events to set up drip campaigns and nurture customers towards conversion based on products they have expressed interest in. <h> 2 ) Offer a Consistent Experience <p> " Stay on-brand . " <p> That seems like obvious , elementary , marketing advice , right ? <p> But if you look at how similar Amazon.com looks to Amazon.coms emails , you notice a similar style in most of the emails . <p> The emails follow the theme of the site : Recommendations , product collections , product categories . <p> Call to action buttons have similar styles in the email and on the site . <p> The email header looks like the site navigation , and clicking on it leads you to the site . <p> They use my name a lot . Its always in the top right hand corner of the website , and here it is in the email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why does this matter ? Well , a consistent experience breeds familiarity and trust . That makes you a ) More likely to buy and b ) More likely to participate in data collection that will generate more targeted recommendations , and hence , make you buy more in the future . <p> Key lesson : - Test the click-through rate and revenue from email templates that closely resemble your website . This approach may work for you too . <h> 3 ) Encourage Product Reviews <p> Research shows- that 61% of customers read eCommerce product reviews before making a purchase , so including them on your site could be quite helpful in driving conversions . <p> Now , let 's be realistic . The most likely customers who will come back to leave a review on their own are the unhappy ones . <p> To bring out the positive reviews , you 'll need to do a little work and encourage reviews proactively . <p> Amazon does this- quite well . <p> First , they send me emails that encourage me to rate my purchases . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate number of stars , I 'm lead to a- simple page on the- site where that rating has been pulled in for that particular item . This page also lists out my other recent purchases , which makes it simple for me to rate and review those purchases , too . <p> There is nothing else on this page other than my recent purchases , the ratings stars , and little boxes for writing reviews . <p> It is- so- simple . Since there are only four or five items listed , I know itll only take me a couple of seconds to do this . <p> Key lesson : Want your customers to leave reviews ? - Make it stupid simple to leave reviews . Not that I necessarily owe Amazon anything , but I think I 'd just feel like a lazy person if I did n't  do something that took only two seconds to do . Its almost a matter of pride. - If you can think of providing experiences that are- that- simple for your customers , you 're golden . <h> 4 ) - Retain Subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for some- use cases . Take blogs for example . Its pretty straight-forward in that case. - Either you want the content or you do n't  . <p> eCommerce is a little different . <p> I may want to hear about your- seasonal- promotions , just not your- weekly- promotions . <p> But if you only offer me one all-or-nothing subscription option , then I 'll probably just unsubscribe . <p> Given this reality , Amazon- is wise to offer options for managing your email preferences . They make it simple to control the frequency of your emails and organize your subscriptions , but they also make the " Unsubscribe from All " choice a very clear and easy one to make if that 's what you really want to do . <p> Key lesson : - Put yourself in your customers shoes . Is your email subscription an " all or nothing " situation , or do you have something that can be subscribed to in a more granular way ? - Try to think of ways you can offer your subscribers subscription management alternatives that do n't  include straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked a lot about email subject lines on the blog before . In each post , - we 've offered consistent advice : Entice a sense of urgency . <p> I still stand by that advice . But it seems like everyone applies it- via hyperbole ( " BEST SALE EVER " ) , exclamation points , uppercase text , and general obnoxiousness . <p> Amazon , however , takes a- more subtle- approach . One of my favorite ways that they do this is by positioning their discounts as truly exclusive offers . <p> Brands seem to throw around the word " exclusive " around for every sale . <p> However , something about this offer from Amazon in the example below- did- feel tailored to me . <p> Granted , they probably did this for every Prime member . In that case , this would n't be- much different than any other " card members only " offer from a retailer . However , the way this email was positioned did feel very exclusive , and- that makes me want to take action . <p> Key Lesson : - Think- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that matches the price point and brand of your product. - In some cases , messaging the promotion as a- flash sale- will provoke people to take action . Other times , messaging it as an " exclusive offer " - works better . <h> Recap <p> What 's the biggest thing you can learn from Amazon ? <p> Sweat the small stuff . <p> They know that people remember the details , so Amazon relentlessly analyzes , crafts , and optimizes every single piece of the customer experience to drive more revenue . That 's probably the most interesting thing about their process and the greatest lesson of all . <p> What things do you like about Amazons marketing ? What do you think can be improved ?

@@96020880 @220880/ <h> Feature Launch : Browse Abandonment Flow <p> This week , Klaviyo is excited to announce the launch of a new , best-practice automated email flow : the Browse Abandonment flow . <p> Online sales are forecast to grow 14.4% in the U.S. and 16.7% in Europe in 2016 . With more and more shoppers browsing online instead of at physical retail stores , converting site traffic into revenue has never been more important for ecommerce shops . Klaviyo 's new Browse Abandonment flow is designed to help with just that . Browse abandonment emails are similar to abandoned cart emails , but are triggered when an identifiable shopper- visits a product page and does not start or complete a checkout . A shopper- does n't  have to add an item to his/her cart to trigger this flow- a- shopper- only needs to- view an item and move on . <p> The Browse Abandonment flow feature in Klaviyo is currently available for the following ecommerce platforms : <p> Shopify <p> BigCommerce <p> Magento <h> Viewed Product Tracking <p> In order to leverage Klaviyo 's Browse Abandonment flow , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For Shopify and BigCommerce stores , Klaviyo 's Setup Wizard has a Web Tracking step that will walk you through this process . If you did not complete this step initially , you can go back to the Setup Wizard at any time- by navigating to Account - &gt; Setup Wizard . For more detailed instructions on how to- install our Web Tracking snippets , click here if you 're a Shopify store , and click here if you 're a BigCommerce store . <p> For Magento stores , Viewed Product tracking was introduced with our latest update to the Klaviyo Magento Extension ( Version 1.4.0 ) . To begin tracking product browsing behavior , all you need to do is download the latest extension zip file . <p> After Viewed Product web tracking has been configured for your store , you should see Viewed Product event data begin populating in your Klaviyo account as known visitors browse your product pages . <p> Keep in mind that when you add Klaviyo web tracking to your website , we are only able to track the browsing activity of " known visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before . There are two key ways Klaviyo is- able to identify a site visitor for web tracking purposes : <p> If someone has , at some point , clicked through a Klaviyo email to your website <p> If someone has , at some point , subscribed/opted-in through a Klaviyo form <h> Get the Browse Abandonment Flow <p> If your Klaviyo account is currently integrated with Shopify , BigCommerce , or Magento , and the Browse Abandonment flow was not pre-populated in your account , you can now add it- from the Browse Ideas section of your account 's Flows tab . <p> This flow will come with a pre-built Browse Abandonment email template that is designed to dynamically populate with information about the product viewed ( the item 's image , name , and price ) . <p> To configure a Browse Abandonment flow on your own , you just need to create a new flow with the trigger action : Viewed Product . <p> You can then add a filter such as , " has Placed Order zero times since starting this flow AND has Checkout Started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ensure that your Browse Abandonment emails only send to those who viewed a product but never started- checkout or completed the purchase . Add the filter , " has Checkout Started zero times since starting this flow " in order to differentiate this flow from your Abandoned Cart series . <p> You can add more- filters to your Browse Abandonment flow if you 'd like to target different types of browsing behavior . A few examples of customized Browse Abandonment flows : <p> When someone views a product and has Received Email from flow zero times in the last X days. - If you are concerned that frequent browsers might receive too many Browse Abandonment emails , you can add this filter to- limit how often someone will get an email from this flow . Leaving Smart Sending ON for all Browse Abandonment emails is also a best practice . <p> When someone views a product and has Placed Order zero times over all time . This filter allows you to target people that have never purchased before and might be new to your brand . You may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount code or promotional offer in your flow email . <p> When someone views a product and has Placed Order at least once over all time . This filter is the inverse of the example above . If you target browsers that have never purchased before in one flow , you will also want to target customers who- are re-visiting your site to potentially buy again through a separate flow . You may not want to include a discount offer here , since these customers have already taken the leap to buy and are back again to browse on their own . This is a great opportunity , however , to add content that will build brand loyalty ( think personal touches ! ) . <p> When someone views a product and has Viewed Product at least Z times since starting this flow . This filter allows you to target those who- are spending a bit of time on your site viewing different products . Adding this filter means as someone begins to browse , the first X number of products viewed will not trigger this flow . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your- flow email , and the email can be configured to show the last item the recipient viewed . <p> When someone views a product and that product is X. You can create separate Browse Abandonment flows for those browsing certain items . Let 's say , for example , you want to create a special discount offer for those browsing a more expensive item on your site .

@@96020886 @220886/ <h> Why ranking on Amazon breaks regular SEO rules <p> However , if you 're migrating to Amazon from your own site , ranking on Amazon requires a conscious shift away from traditional SEO tactics . <p> While Amazon SEO is all about getting your pages to rank above others in search , its considerably different from Google and other search engines . Even if you are familiar with traditional SEO , you 'll still have to learn how Amazons algorithm works to be successful . <p> For example , Google uses external factors such as links , social signals , site authority , and site history in their ranking algorithm . Amazons ranking algorithm is purely based on internal factors like sales , titles , keywords in the search term field , and product availability . <p> Unlike Google , where you can focus on building backlinks and relevant keywords across the site , Amazon ranks your products on a product-by-product basis , not on your entire store . Instead , you must focus on building sales , quality content , and converting visitors to boost your ranking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are in the middle of launching an Amazon seller account , you have to understand how and why Amazon ranks products to make it to the first page . <h> A conversion based approach <p> Amazons primary difference from Google is their algorithm . Google uses more than 200 ranking factors , Amazon primarily cares about conversion . The more people who click on a product and go on to make a purchase , the higher Amazon will rank you . <p> Amazon wants to make sales , and if your product converts , it will rank . <h> QID <p> Amazon tracks which products you click on and whether you buy them using the QID , which shows up in your URL as soon as you click on an item . QID tracks what you click on , what you searched to get to that product , and if you make a purchase . <p> This is then used in Amazon ranking because it shows search relevance and conversion , which allows Amazon to predict if someone will purchase a product if it shows up under a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an item and then click on your product , but eventually buy something else , your product ranking will drop . If they click on your product and buy your product , your product ranking will improve for that search term . <h> Sales <p> Because Amazons ultimately wants to make sales , the more sales you make , the higher you will rank . Products that sell more are consistently ranked higher , even if they are not optimized or rated as well . Amazon reviews your sales over time and ranks products that have the most sales for their lifetime on the marketplace . <p> Amazon also uses something like Googles bounce rate . If the customer hits the back button and goes to another search result , it negatively affects your ranking . However , while Google is concerned about quality of experience , Amazon is concerned about relevance . <h> Pay-to-play <p> While ranking products with more sales first makes sense from a marketplace perspective , it does have a drawback for Amazon sellers . This is similar to how traditional search engines rank sites that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary ranking signals , it 's more extreme . <p> Amazons " sales velocity " is the rate of product sales within a specific timeframe . The faster your products sell , the better their velocity and the better Amazon ranks them . As a new seller , you cant greatly improve sales velocity without using Amazon Sponsored Products because you wont rank . <p> If you cant afford to use PPC to boost sales to improve seller velocity and improve your ranking , you will have to rely on a high demand for your products to create it organically , which is n't always successful . This is especially true if you have a lot of marketplace competition . <h> Designed for relevance <p> Again , Amazons wants to help you sell products so they make money . This gives you an advantage over Google , which simply does not care if you sell anything . <p> For this reason , Amazon offers several tools designed to improve relevance so that you improve your conversion . <h> Reviews <p> Reviews are actively used in ranking . More reviews will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , you need an average rating of 3 stars or higher to rank . Amazon wants to know that customers will be happy with their purchase . Reviews function similarly to social signals from Google for Amazon search . But they are only collected from the product listing , which makes the whole process much simpler . Your primary goal is to get reviews and to keep them as positive as possible , thereby boosting ranking and conversion . <h> Stock <p> Amazon actively ranks you based on stock . If you sell out , your ranking will drop . Take steps to prevent stock-out events , which will hurt your SEO . <h> Conversion <p> The better your conversion rate , the more Amazon will rank you for that search term . Where Google allows you to use synonyms of non-relevant keywords to rank your products , Amazon actively punishes you for it . If you have too many clicks without purchases , your ranking will drop for that search term . Because Amazon uses conversion as a primary ranking factor , its important to focus heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . <h> Search term fields <p> Amazon allows you to fill out 5 search term fields to tell them what your product is , and how it should be found . It is in your best interest to use all 5 and to make them as relevant as possible . <h> Category <p> Much of Amazon search is conducted using category searches , which you can use to your advantage by ensuring that your product category is as specific as possible . <p> Amazon actively works to request the information they need to rank you for relevant product searches . This is vastly different from Google and Bing . Both want you to present information to your customers which they , of course , will verify . <h> Amazon SEO that works <p> Ranking on Amazon means understanding how Amazons ranking works , optimizing your titles and pages for search , and working to provide a quality experience and to drive sales . At the end of the day , Amazon only cares about making money and providing a quality experience for the customer , so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally . <h> PPC <p> Using Amazons Sponsored Products program can help you to drive sales and increase your seller velocity which will boost your overall ranking . However , you should handle conversion optimization first and during your PPC campaigns to boost sales and conversion from clicks . <h> Use great titles <p> Titles are one of the most important ranking factors on Amazon because they are the first thing that the customer sees other than the image . If you 're accustomed to writing titles for regular search engines , you 'll have to change your tactics for Amazon . Unlike Google , Amazon searches titles using individual words not search phrases , which means that repeating words and including different variations of phrases ( Coffee Maker , Coffee Machine ) is a waste of time and space . <p> Use each word once <p> Research your options and check which words top-selling competitors are using <p> Your product can come up under any combination of terms in your title <p> Use descriptors ( 4GB RAM , cotton , etc . ) <p> Address pain points from other products ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor on an item , list yours with " odor free " in the title . <p> Write for the customer first . The title should make sense . <h> Use images <p> You already know that you should use high-quality images to meet Amazons guidelines , but they can be an important part of your ranking . While most search engines rank images using keywords and metadata , Amazon does not . However , they do greatly boost your conversion to indirectly improve ranking . <h> Max out product descriptions <p> Product descriptions and bullet points are not included in Amazon search , but they are used for conversion . Because conversion optimization is a large part of Amazon SEO , you should use them to offer as much helpful information as you can . The more questions you can answer about the product on the listing , the more easily your prospective customer will make the decision to purchase . This is similar to Google in that Google also ranks for helpful content . But , conversion is your priority . <h> Fill out all keyword fields <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found for . However , you should approach this as an auxiliary to your product title . Individual words in the product title , seller name , and brand are automatically included in your keywords , and repeating them will waste your keyword space . Instead , use unique terms that you find through Amazon search- or your keyword tools . <h> Research <p> While you should be using keyword research tools , Amazon typically offers you a lot of information that you can use to optimize your products . For example , by typing your keywords into Amazon Search , you will see the top searched keywords for what you are typing . Or , by visiting the top selling products in your niche you can see : <p> Their title keywords <p> Their bullet points <p> Images <p> Keyword density ( what are they talking about on the page ) <p> Reviews ( what do people like , what do they dislike , what are pain points , what did they want , what did they get , etc . ) <p> All this information can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your own products- because you know what people are looking for , what they are likely to be wary of , and what to say to boost conversion . <h> A/B Test <p> Its important to continue to test your product titles , description , and bullet points over time to improve your conversion . Making small changes and testing the results can help you to boost your conversion rate a great deal , especially if you test results and work to offer a better experience for buyers at the same time . With better conversion , your product ranking will naturally improve . <p> Amazons search algorithm is very different from Googles because their biggest concerns are conversion , sales , and customer satisfaction . This means that your primary goal is to integrate conversion optimization rather than keyword optimization , use Amazon Sponsored Products to boost your sales velocity- and to ensure that your titles and keyword areas are optimized for your product . <p> Making the switch from Google to Amazon can seem daunting at first , but Amazons search algorithm is simpler , more product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@96020903 @220903/ <h> Template Tags and Variable Syntax <h> Overview <p> When creating email templates , there are a few different ways to customize content so your emails look great and are relevant to your recipients . <p> Klaviyo provides certain template variables that you can use to personalize email content . The most commonly used variables are personalization variable , which allow you to dynamically include information about your email recipient . For example , their name , email address , or custom properties you 've stored about the person . <p> Similarly , you can also populate flow emails with event variables . When your flow is triggered by customer behavior or an event , you can dynamically populate your emails with information from this event . This is how you can send emails to customers that feature items abandoned in a cart , recently purchased items , etc . <p> You can also use different template tags that will produce important links or information . These tags are useful when you want to insert unsubscribe links , share links , dates and more . Other tags allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are met or allow you to create loops to iterate over content . <p> % managepreferences % % webview % <p> Update preferences View in your browser <p> Finally , Klaviyo uses template filters that are used together with template variables to provide additional functionality . This includes accessing custom properties for recipients , default values , and additional formatting options . <h> Learn more <h> Personalization Variables- <p> Because Klaviyo focuses on people and what they 're up to , personalization is built into Klaviyo 's core and making emails more relevant to reach recipient is easy . There are a number of different variables you can use : <p> For any variable , you can add a - default filter to provide a placeholder if there is no variable available to pull in : <p> Hi- firstnamedefault : ' there ' <p> Hi there- - - - - - - - <h> Custom Properties <p> If you 've added extra properties to individual contacts in Klaviyo , you can use them as dynamic content in an email with the person variable and the lookup filter . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case someone does n't have the custom property you 're trying to use by including the default filter . <h> Event Variables- <h> Learn more <p> For flows triggered by an event ( Checkout Started , Placed Order , - etc. ) , you can use this event information within the email template . <p> For example , when a flow is triggered by the Placed Order- event , you can thank someone for their purchase and reference the specific item they bought . Klaviyo automatically stores detailed event information for you so that you can use the appropriate variable to add dynamic event content . The information captured is specific to each metric . <p> When you preview a flow email , you will see all the available properties for that event in the event dialog window that pops up . <p> If you click on a line of data in the preview window , a small bar will appear at the bottom of the window . This bar will populate with the variable tag that corresponds with the line of data you clicked . You can copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are interested in looping through several values for a property ( for example , populating a list of all items in a purchase ) , consider using the block repeat feature . <p> For example : <p> If you 're sending events to Klaviyo via the API , all of the properties for a given event are available through the event variable and lookup filter . <p> Thanks for your purchase of $ eventlookup : ' totalprice ' . <p> Thanks for your purchase of $29.00 . <p> How do you like your new eventlookup : ' Items Purchased ' ? <p> - How do you like your new blue suede shoes ? <p> - <h> Unsubscribe , Manage Preferences , Web View <p> List and campaign tags allow recipients to manage their subscription preferences and view your campaign in their browser . <h> Unsubscribe <p> Klaviyo requires an unsubscribe link in all campaigns . To include an unsubscribe link , you can use the unsubscribe tag . By default , the link will have the text " Unsubscribe . " If you want to customize the text in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to customize the text . If you need even more control , there is also a tag that provides only the URL for the unsubscribe link . <p> This is a fancy &lt;a href= " % unsubscribelink % " **25;744;TOOLONG link . <p> This is a fancy unsubscribe link . <p> When a recipient clicks the unsubscribe link , they 're taken to a page to confirm their unsubscribe request . You can see everyone who has unsubscribed in the People section of Klaviyo . <h> Manage Preferences <p> For standard lists , you can create a preferences page and customize it to match your brand . This allows recipients to update their preferences . To include a link to this page for each recipient , use the manage preferences tag . If you need more control , there is also a version that just provides the URL . <h> Web View <p> To give recipients a link to a web page that has your campaign , you can use the web view tag . Like the unsubscribe tag , if you need more control , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % webview % <p> View in Your Browser <p> Ca n't see this email ? % webview ' Open in your browser ' % . <p> Ca n't see this email ? - Open in your browser . <p> This is a fancy &lt;a href= " % webviewlink % " &gt;web view&lt;/a&gt; - link . <p> This is a fancy web view link. - <h> Date Tags- <p> Date tags give you a quick way to insert the the day a campaign is sent into an email . The date is in the timezone of your account. - <p> Current Day of Month <p> % currentday % <p> ex. - The current day of the month is 5 . <p> Current Day of Week <p> % currentweekday % <p> ex .

Your birthday is on Oct. 14,1985 , 8 p.m . <h> Conditional Tags <p> Conditional tags allow you to conditionally include content in your campaigns . They give you powerful controls for personalizing your campaigns to each individual recipient and , if your campaign is an autoresponder triggered by what someone did , include information from that event. - <h> If-Else Blocks <p> " If-else " blocks allow- you to control the content someone receives in an email based on a variable 's value . <p> % if personlookup : ' Interested in Dogs ?

If it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> For Blocks <p> " For " blocks allow you to iterate over each item in a variable that 's storing a list and render them individually . <h> Basic Filters- <p> Filters allow you to modify how a variable is displayed . You 'll notice they go directly after a variable . The variable and filter should be separated with a pipe character ( ) . Some filters take an argument . In these cases , after the filter use a colon ( : ) and then surround the argument with quotes . <p> Below are some common use cases and examples : <p> Lookup Filter <p> personlookup : ' Birthday ' <p> Default Filter <p> - firstnamedefault : ' friend ' <p> This filter is used to specify a default in case a variable does n't have a value . This is useful as a placeholder when you do n't always have the information you want to use , e.g. someone 's name . ( Django ) <p> Split- Filter <p> producttypesplit : ' - ' lookup:0 - - - - - - - - - <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a zero-indexed array based on the value you pass . For example , if you have a property with the value " Shirt - Large , " large is the " lookup:0 " value . <p> To format the date of an event variable add the filter : LONG ... <p> When using this date filter , you can change the format of how the date appears by referring to this guide . <h> floatadd <p> You can use this filter like the " add " filter , but instead of forcing everything to integers , it 'll keep the decimal points and do the addition . <h> floatformat <p> In addition to all the filters above , Klaviyo supports most of the filters used by the Django template language . As an example of one of the filters included , the floatformat filter allows you to format numbers .

@@96020906 @220906/ <h> 4 Ways to Segment Your Fundraising List <p> Phil Weltman April 19 , 2016 <p> When you communicate with your supporters , you want to treat them like- individuals , not like- one group . Mass mailing the same message to your entire list will- make you seem generic and impersonal . Learning about the traits and behavior of each supporter will allow you to segment based on those traits and send the right content at the right time and , most importantly , to the right people . <p> In this post , I will discuss four ways to segment your list to effectively increase supporter engagement . <h> 1 . First-Time Donors <p> First impressions are essential to- developing relationships , and that 's exactly what you want to do with new supporters : develop a relationship . A strong relationship will result in an active supporter . Using a dynamic segment to capture the moment your supporter first gives will allow you to reach that person at the right time with the right content . It 's with this great first impression that will turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about what you can do with First-Time Donors check out some of our other blog posts : <h> 2 . Recurring Donors <p> Everybody knows that these donors are critical to your fundraising efforts . They have committed to giving over a long period of time . Letting them know how much their loyalty means to you and your organization is really important . Since they 've already committed to contributing on a regular basis , they should n't get every fundraising email . - You can use this segment to exclude- recurring donors from your large fundraising newsletters . <h> 3 . Segment Based on Donation Size <p> Donation size segments mean different things to different organizations . Most organizations think about their donor groups as large and small donors , but there are other donation size segments you should be considering . <p> Small donors : I usually consider a small donor to be someone who has donated less than $50 at a time . If they 've given a small amount , that usually means that they want to be engaged , but may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks about other ways they can support your organization may be much more worthwhile than just asking for more money ( volunteering , attending an event , telling a friend , etc ) . <p> Medium donors : Medium donors are those who maybe give between $100-$500 , often annually at a gala or during your end of year fundraising drive . These donors are the ones that you should try to convert into recurring donors . They make up a big portion of your total contribution dollars and getting them to commit on a monthly or quarterly basis can help you create a more stable revenue stream . <p> Large donors : You want to keep your large donors happy and engaged . Thank them personally , with a phone call , direct email , or an in-person meeting . Make sure they know that their support is critical to your mission , but also treat their inbox with respect . They do n't need every fundraising email . Keep them updated and informed , but give them their space. - - - <h> 4 . Segment Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as important as knowing who has . If a past contributor has n't given or engaged for 60 or 90 days , send them a personalized email thanking them for their past contribution while letting them know what a second donation can do to help your cause . There might be a reason for why they been disengaged . Maybe ask why , or see if there is anything they are particularly interested in . <p> On the other hand , knowing who gives often can help you convert regular repeat donors into recurring donors . If a supporter have given multiple times in the past couple months , you 'll know in your repeat donor segment . Then you can move forward with a campaign to convert those repeat donors to recurring donors . <h> Conclusion <p> Segmentation is very important , but it should n't be difficult . Using your donation and email data to dynamically segment your list of supporters should be straight forward and take just a few minutes . You should be able to focus on what to say to them rather than spending time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an email platform that facilitates this . <p> Phil is on the marketing team here at Klaviyo .

@@96020909 @220909/ <h> How to Email Smart , Not Hard <p> People get excited about a marketing channel and they go at it full force , pounding people with marketing messages . <p> This is certainly true with email . <p> Folks see initial success with discounts and newsletters , so they hit- their lists with emails- until- open rates plateau , click-through rates dwindle , and unsubscribes gradually add up . <p> Not to mention , its a lot more expensive to email this way . Time is money . If someone on your team is spending all of that time putting together daily newsletters , they are n't  spending time on something else . Plus , paying to email people who are n't  buying things through those newsletters is a waste of cash . <p> Sound familiar ? If so , its time to work- smart , not hard , when it comes to your email marketing . <p> here 's how . <h> 1 ) Email subscribers- because of things they do , not just because they exist . <p> According to Experian , transactional emails have substantially higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious explanation : People are expecting these emails . <p> I requested my password to be reset you 're sending me a link I can click to go do that- its simple . <p> These emails are based on actions that the customer took on the website . They are personalized and familiar , and meet people where they are in the buying journey rather than sending out a mass email that- is n't as relevant . <p> Imagine an email offering product recommendations based on a customers past purchase or an email- that- re-engages a- customer that- has not made a purchase recently . This- is the kind of reasoning your emails- should be based- on , - not just the fact that the customer subscribed to the list . <h> 2 ) Automate your email marketing by personalizing it . <p> Let your email service provider do the work for you . <p> Set up your campaigns- so people get automatically rolled into- workflows based on the actions they take on the site . Use auto-responders- to send messages to those lists. - Let- behavioral data " write the campaign- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products to customize email content . Rather than getting caught up in over-the-top templates and design , invest time in setting up data tracking . This will help you personalize your emails and pay dividends in the long run , far longer than a one-off pretty campaign . <h> 3 ) Repeat yourself . <p> Consistency is important for your marketing campaigns . It reinforces your messages and makes a lasting impression . <p> The editorial content you develop for blog posts and social media can be repackaged for email newsletters . <p> here 's an example- from Kate Spade . They shared this content , which educates customers on different ways to wear one of their dresses , on their- Facebook page as well as through email . <p> Here it is on the Facebook page : <p> Here is the email creative : <h> 4 ) Kick people off your list . <p> Ouch , right ? Well , hear me out . <p> You do n't  want to waste your time emailing people who do n't  want to open your emails or click-through to buy anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list volume . So if those emails are n't  returning revenue for you , you want to part ways . If you can even make- the same amount of money by emailing five people as you were by emailing ten , - thats- working smart . <p> I liked this email from Jive Software .

@@96020914 @220914/ <h> Create a Browse Abandonment Flow <h> Overview <p> Browse abandonment emails are similar to abandoned cart emails , but are triggered when an identifiable browser visits a product page and does not start or complete a checkout " a visitor does n't have to add an item to his/her cart to trigger this flow , all a site visitor has to do is view an item and move on. - <p> Visiting a product page does n't quite indicate the same level of interest as adding an item to a shopping cart and beginning the checkout process , so we recommend making your browse abandonment flow emails a " lighter touchpoint " than your abandoned cart flow. - <h> Note <p> Currently , browse abandonment flows are only available for Shopify , Magento , BigCommerce , Spree , WooCommerce , and custom carts . <h> Configure Viewed Product Web Tracking <p> Browse abandonment flows are triggered by the Viewed Product- metric . This flow thus requires Viewed Product tracking to be enabled on your website . <h> For Shopify and BigCommerce Stores <p> When you first set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two web tracking code snippets : home page tracking and Viewed Product- tracking . <p> If you did not complete this step initially , you can go back to the Setup Wizard now by navigating to Account- &gt; Setup Wizard <h> Note <p> Need help installing our web tracking snippets after checking out the Setup Wizard ? Click here if you 're a Shopify store , and click here if you 're a BigCommerce store . <h> For Magento Stores <p> Viewed Product tracking for Magento stores was introduced in early 2016 with an update to the Klaviyo Magento Extension ( Version 1.4.0 ) . To begin tracking product browsing behavior , all you need to do is download the latest extension zipfile . <h> Monitor the Viewed Product Metric <h> Note <p> When you add web tracking to your site , we are only able to track the browsing activity of " known browsers , " i.e. browsers who have visited and engaged at least once before . There are two key ways we are able to identify a site visitor : if someone has clicked through a Klaviyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opted-in through a Klaviyo form . We will not track anonymous browsers . <p> To check on this metric , click into your account 's Dashboard- and navigate to the Activity Feed- tab . Here , you will see a dropdown labeled Showing Feed for . Adjust this dropdown to filter for the metric Viewed Product . After Viewed Product web tracking has been configured for your site , viewed product- data should begin populating in your account as known visitors browse your product pages . <p> If there is no data available , test the metric out yourself by browsing your website and clicking around to view different products . You should see this data begin to flow into Klaviyo. - <h> Get the Klaviyo Browse Abandonment Flow <p> If your account is currently integrated with Shopify , BigCommerce , or Magento- and the browse abandonment flow was not pre-populated in your account , you can grab this flow now from the Browse Ideas- section of your Flows tab . <p> This flow will come with a pre-built browse abandonment email template that is designed to dynamically populate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , name , and price ) . <h> Build Your Own Browse Abandonment Flow <p> To configure a browse abandonment flow on your own , you just need to create a new flow with the triggering action- Viewed Product . <p> You can then add a filter such as , has Placed Order zero times since starting this flow AND has Checkout Started zero times since starting this flow . This filter will ensure that your browse abandonment emails only send to those who viewed a product but then never continued onward to start a checkout or complete a purchase . We recommend adding the filter , has Checkout Started zero times since starting this flow- in order to differentiate this flow from your abandoned cart flow . <h> Build a Dynamic Browse Abandonment Email <p> If you 've configured your own flow and want to build an email template that pulls in information about the product someone viewed , follow these instructions : <p> Drag- a- split block- into your template . <p> Adjust column 1 to display as an Image <p> Adjust column 2 to display as Text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image , and insert event.ImageURL as the placeholder . <p> For column 2 , add event.Name where you 'd like to insert the product 's name , and event.Price where you want to insert the product 's price. - Make sure to click Save Changes. - Preview your email and you should see dynamic product data populate into the placeholder variables . <h> Best Practices <p> There are a few different types of audiences you can target with your custom browse abandonment emails , including : - <p> Someone views a product and has received email from flow zero times in the last X daysIf you 're worried that frequent browsers might receive too many browse abandonment emails , you can add this filter to limit how often someone will get an email from this flow . Leaving smart sending on- for all browse abandonment emails is also a good idea . <p> Someone views a product ... and has placed order equals zero over all timeThis filter allows you to target people that have never purchased before and might be new to your brand . You may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a discount code or promotional offer in your flow email . <p> Someone views a product ... and has placed order at least once over all timeThis filter is the inverse of the example above -- if you target browsers that have never purchased before in one flow , you will also want to target customers that are re-visiting your site to potentially buy again through a separate flow . You may not want to include a discount offer here , since these customers have already taken the leap to buy and are back again to browse on their own. - <p> Someone views a product and has viewed product at least Z times since starting this flowThis filter allows you to target those that are spending a bit of time on your site viewing different products . Adding this filter means as someone begins to browse , the first X number of products viewed will not trigger this flow -- only after Z number of items are viewed will someone receive your flow email , and the email can be configured to show the last item the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Product XThis filter allows you to create special offers for those browsing a specific item . Let 's say you want to share a special discount for those browsing a more expensive item on your site . You can target those browsing certain items by adding a trigger filter for the specific item you 'd like to target . <p> You can also create separate browse abandonment flows based on factors about your recipients . This can include : <p> Purchasers vs . Non-Purchasers <p> Domestic vs . International <p> Product Type or Category <p> By targeting these groups differently , you 're able to provide a more relevant experience for each recipient . <h> Purchasers vs . Non-Purchasers <p> Tailoring your browse abandonment flows based on whether or not someone has previously bought from you can be a great way to prompt recipients to make their first purchase . For example , you might want to offer an incentive to those who have never bought from you before. - <p> You can use flow filters to differentiate between the two : <p> Purchasers <h> - <p> Non-Purchasers : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer certain perks , like free shipping , only to domestic customers . If you would like to message these groups differently , you can edit the flow filters as follows : <p> DomesticThis flow contains an OR filter to capture those who may not have a location set on their profile . This way , they 'll still receive a browse abandonment email . <p> - <p> International <h> Product Type or Category <p> You may want to tailor your browse abandonment flow based on which items shoppers viewed . For example , you may want to use different messaging in emails sent to those who view men 's versus women 's products . To message those who view items that are n't in either of these categories , you 'll have to create a third browse abandonment flow .

You can use our drag and drop email template creator and preview tools to create a beautiful email , while personalizing content with product images and descriptions . <h> Schedule the Autoresponder <p> Once you 've inserted the email template , just specify when you want the abandoned cart email to go out . In the example below , the abandoned cart will be sent out two hours after the item was initially added to the cart " assuming that the customer has n't purchased in the meantime . <p> Once it 's setup , you just flip the on switch , and it 'll start running . <h> Track the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your emails .

Click on the Manage Flow dropdown in the header and click Back-Populate Flow Recipients . <p> The- back-populate feature- allows you to queue- people for one or more- flow emails retroactively . This is useful after- you create a flow with emails scheduled in the future that would 've been queued had the flow existed earlier . <p> For example , when you create customer a re-engagement flow , you probably do n't want to wait 60- or 120- days for customers start receiving emails . Back-populating a flow will find customers who placed an order months ago and queue them for emails as soon as the next day . <p> Who is queued when you back-populate a flow- depends on whether your flow trigger is a metric , list or segment and the sending status of your- flow emails . <p> Emails will only be queued for flow emails whose sending status is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flow is Back-Populated <p> For flows triggered by a list or- segment , everyone in the list or segment who has not been queued for- that email will be queued . <p> Each person will be queued as if they had been added to the list or segment the day you click Back-Populate , not relative to the date they were added to the list . <p> For example , if a flow sends an email after 30 days and someone subscribed on January 1 , - back-populating the flow on March 1 would schedule them to receive that email on March 31 . If a different person subscribed on- January 15 , they would also be scheduled to receive the email on March 31 . <h> How an Event-Based Flow is Back-Populated <p> For flows triggered by an event ( for example , - Placed Order ) , emails will be queued relative when a recipient triggered a flow , and only for people- who would be scheduled to- receive that email within the time parameters of the flow . Because- emails that are past due are n't sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , if a flow is triggered by someone placing an order and sends an email after 30 days , - back-populating the flow on January- 1 would schedule emails for anyone who placed an order between December 2 and- January 1 . If someone placed an order on December 3 , they would- be scheduled to receive an email on January 2 . If another customer placed an order on December 31 , they would be scheduled to receive an email on January 30 . <p> This latter example illustrates why using the back-populate feature with flows that span several months is so powerful . You do n't need to wait- a long time for the flow to start sending . In fact , you can create your flow and start sending emails the same day or the next day based on historical behaviors . <p> It is common to back-populate a flow more than once if you add another email to a flow and want to ensure that everyone already queued up is scheduled to receive the new email . No one will be scheduled to receive the same email more than once .
