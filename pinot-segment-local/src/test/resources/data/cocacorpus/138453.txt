@@22319607 @2319607/ <p> In our Science &amp; Transition classes students will ask questions of themselves , research and gather data , form &amp; test hypothesis , and analyse new data in order to gain new understanding and knowledge . Gone are the days of reading a lesson in a text book and completing " review " questions . So too are gone the days of using technology simply for the sake of saying " We did it online " . Instead , our students will learn to think and reason through the steps required to gain that new understanding . Articles and text will be examined and experiments conducted . Not conducted however merely for the experience or the pleasure of the act , but instead , and most importantly , to arrive at an outcome that students walked through each step of the way . Not an outcome of predesigned success , but an outcome of cause &amp; effect , comparisons &amp; contradictions , and of examples and explanations . Like never before , our students will begin to become comfortable evaluating their own knowledge , they will think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express the ideas that confirmed , challenged and surprised them along the path of discovery . <p> My name is Michael Genovese .

Lead is most dangerous for pregnant women , infants , and children under 6 years of age . It can cause damage to the brain and kidneys , and can interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body . Exposure to high levels of lead during pregnancy contributes to low birth weight and developmental delays in infants . <p> In young children , lead exposure can lower IQ levels , affect hearing , reduce attention span , and hurt school performance . At very high levels , lead can even cause brain damage . Adults with kidney problems and high blood pressure can be affected by low levels of lead more than healthy adults . <p> How Lead Enters our Water <p> Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom occurs naturally in water supplies like groundwater , rivers and lakes . Lead enters drinking water primarily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of materials containing lead in the water distribution system and in building plumbing . These materials include lead-based solder used to join copper pipe , brass , and chrome-plated brass faucets . In 1986 , Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2% lead , and restricted the lead content of faucets , pipes and other plumbing materials . However , even the lead in plumbing materials meeting these new requirements is subject to corrosion . When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead for several hours or more , the lead may dissolve into the drinking water . This means the first water drawn from the tap in the morning may contain fairly high levels of lead . <p> Lead in Drinking Water <p> Lead in drinking water , although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning can significantly increase a persons total lead exposure , particularly the exposure of children under the age of 6 .
