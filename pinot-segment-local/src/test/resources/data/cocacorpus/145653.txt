The following appeared in an announcement issued by the publisher of The Mercury , a weekly newspaper . " Since a competing lower-priced newspaper , The Bugle , was started five years ago , The Mercurys circulation has declined by 10,000 readers . The best way to get more people to read The Mercury is to reduce its price below that of The Bugle , at least until circulation increases to former levels . The increased circulation of The Mercury will attract more businesses to buy advertising space in the paper . " Discuss how well reasoned . . . Etc . <p> The announcement concludes that the best option for increasing Mercury 's circulation to former levels is to lower its price below that of its competitor , The Bugle . This conclusion is based on the fact that since The Bugle was introduced , circulation has declined substantially . This argument is not convincing as the author has made some questionable assumptions that may or may not be true , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the circulation has declined are unknown , this may not have been related to the introduction of the Bugle at a lower price . Furthermore price is not the only factor taken into consideration by readers when deciding which paper to buy . Finally , the goal of the Mercury is to attract more business to buy advertising space and increased circulation is not necessarily the best way to achieve this goal . <p> First of all , the fact that the Mercury has lost 10,000 readers since The Bugle first appeared on the market five years ago implies nothing . Other factors may have contributed to this decline . For example , it would be correct to say that for the last five years , or more , the information revolution has changed the way that people access information . More and more people are becoming Internet literate and perceive it as a source of free and easily accessible information . News is readily available on the Internet , leading readers away from traditional forms of news such as newspapers . There is no indication in the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bugle . If so , then it will be apparent that factors , other than The Bugle , have contributed to the poor performance of the paper . <p> Furthermore , the author did not rule out other factors that caused the decreasing circulation . Price may not be the only factor influencing readers whether or not to read a certain newspaper . Consider the following situation . The Bugle is a tabloid newspaper while the Mercury is aimed at a more educated audience . Lowering the price , although this may result in a slight increase in readers , may not attract those readers who prefer tabloid newspapers . This invalidates the assumption that lowering the price of The Mercury will allow circulation to return to former levels . <p> Finally , the newspapers wishes to achieve its ultimate goal of attracting more business , and as a result increasing profits , to buy advertising space it needs to take into consideration the other factors that entice a business to advertise with a newspaper . The newspaper 's audience is an obvious example . An educated audience will attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise at a high price . To lower the price of the newspaper , and in turn risk changing the type of readers that buy the paper , will affect the number , and type , of businesses that are willing to advertise . <p> In sum , the authors conclusions can not be drawn from the data that has been provided . The Mercury may not be losing readers as a direct result of the introduction of The Bugle . Lowering its price , to below that of The Bugle , may not increase the circulation of The Mercury to former levels or help the paper to achieve its goals of attracting more business to buy advertising space and thus increasing revenues .

The following appeared as part of an annual report sent to stockholders by Olympic Foods , a processor of frozen foods . " Over time , the costs of processing go down because as organizations learn how to do things better , they become more efficient . In color film processing , for example , the cost of a 3-by-5-inch print fell from 50 cents for five-day service in 1970 to 20 cents for one-day service in 1984 . The same principle applies to the processing of food . And since Olympic Foods will soon celebrate its twenty-fifth birthday , we can expect that our long experience will enable us to minimize costs and thus maximize profits . " <p> The author concluded that with long experience of 25 years , Olympic foods will be able to maximize profits and minimize costs because the processing cost has gone down in color film industry . The line of reasoning is that the same approach in film processing industry should be applicable to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is not necessary that same thing would happen to food industry . It depends upon many other factors . <p> Firstly , the argument assumed that the color film industry is similar to food industry . One must not forget that an Olympic food is an industry for frozen foods or perishable products . These products require fast transportation and special equipments in order to keep fresh or the entire stock will get junked . These requirements can claim substantial costs and it is very likely that they can never be cut . One the other hand , color film is a consumer product which stays much longer and is not perishable . Therefore , it is possible that the cost-cutting approach is not applicable to the food industry . <p> Secondly , the author failed to address other factors that are important to a companys success . It is well known that in the long run maximization of profits occurs due to low cost of production . But its not the only factor they consider . Other factors such as demand for the product , selling price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into consideration . Today , buyers become the king in the market . If other companies products are available at lower price with same quality or at similar price with higher quality , then people do n't  buy the Olympics product . Therefore , if most consumers choose other companies products , then the objects of higher profits and lower cost ca n't be attained . <p> Finally , the speaker did not include any information on Olympic management approach . Rather , it just mentioned the long experience of 25 years in food industry . While there is rough correlation between long experience and ability to maximize profit , it is not always the case . If the Olympic fails to accumulate valuable management experience , such as time-consuming strategic alliance , learning from failure , etc , then Olympic long experience will not enable it to minimize costs and thus maximize profits <p> In sum , the argument is not compelling because it omitted many other factors that must be addressed in order to make proper conclusion . If the author has considered the difference between color film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the argument would be more convincing .

This argument is somewhat persuasive but not convincing for the following two reasons . <p> First , lower-than-average unemployment rate seems attractive to job applicants , but actually not good for corporations . Because of the lower than average unemployment rate in Helios , companies that should recruit large numbers of employees would not find Helios a great place .

" People who use the artificial sweetener aspartame are better off consuming sugar , since aspartame can actually contribute to weight gain rather than weight loss . For example , high levels of aspartame have been shown to trigger a craving for food by depleting the brain of a chemical that registers satiety , or the sense of being full . Furthermore , studies suggest that sugars , if consumed after at least 45 minutes of continuous exercise , actually enhance the bodys ability to burn fat . Consequently , those who drink aspartame-sweetened juices after exercise will also lose this calorie-burning benefit .

If you scored well on whatever graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fact as well . Keep in mind that graduate admissions committees want assurance that you will be a successful student . If you have had relevant experiences , you may mention them here , too . Some graduate programs such as applied sociology or social work or resource development , etc. look for evidence that you have already sought out ways to translate your academic background into practical , professionally oriented applications . In short , this paragraph should assure the graduate admissions committee that you have matured during your undergraduate years , that your intellectual and professional interests have taken shape , and that you have begun a conscientious progress toward professional development . <p> In this example format , the third paragraph will be a description of your professional goals . ( This paragraph and the next , however , could be reversed . ) Though your letter takes the general shape of a summary of your interests and background , it also builds an argument for your admission to a particular graduate program . The logic of this argument runs this way : I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in this work as my profession ; and I believe that the necessary , most logical way to assure me of success in this profession is to earn this graduate degree . This paragraph describes what you know about the professional careers to which this course of graduate study may lead . Generally , people who pursue graduate degrees tend toward any of four professional occupations : academic , public service , private industry , or self-employment ( i.e. , writers , lawyers , physicians , etc . ) . Though you do not have to commit yourself to one career only , you are best served by presenting to the admissions committee as specific as ideas as possible about what you intend to do with their degree . If you know that you would eventually like to be a business consultant specializing in labor market analysis , say so . Such a statement indicates to the committee that you are goal oriented , that you are capable of identifying what you want and of developing a systematic means to attain it . This paragraph , in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an applicant with a purpose . <p> The fourth paragraph , which describes what you intend to study in graduate school , should tighten your argument . Now that you have made clear your interests , background , and professional goals , you must make the case that the best way for you to bridge your undergraduate years and your successful performance as a professional is to study what this particular graduate program offers . Be as specific as you can . Learn what courses this graduate program offers . Identify its faculty members and what research they are conducting . Know the program 's reputation , its strengths and its weaknesses . Your undergraduate professors can be of very great assistance in this regard . If , say , you are interested in pursuing advanced work in cognitive psychology , your application will not be most appropriately sent to a department that is trying to make its name in **25;0;TOOLONG behavior . As you describe your reasons for applying to this particular program try to link your interest with what you know is available through that program and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it encourages practicum experience , something you want , say so . If some of your undergraduate texts or assignments have utilized materials produced by that program , say so . Offer suggestions about combinations of courses or faculty advisors that you think might be especially imaginative or productive . This paragraph , thus , accomplishes two ends : you place this graduate program in the continuum of your own professional development and you demonstrate that you have applied to it as the result of an informed , reflective selection process of your own . Your personal statement should close with a brief summary of your background and goals , again just a sentence or two . This last statement reaffirms both your preparation and your confidence that your choice of this graduate program is right .

" On average , middle-aged consumers devote 39 percent of their retail expenditure to department store products and services , while for younger consumers the average is only 25 percent . Since the number of middle-aged people will increase dramatically within the next decade , department stores can expect retail sales to increase significantly during that period . Furthermore , to take advantage of the trend , these stores should begin to replace some of those products intended to attract the younger consumer with products intended to attract the middle-aged consumer . " Discuss how well reasoned . . . Etc . <p> The speaker concluded that department stores should replace some of their products intended to attract the younger consumer with those intended to attract the middle-aged consumer . The argument is based on the following two facts : 1 ) the middle-age consumers devote more percent of their retail expenditure to department store than do younger consumers ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next decade . The above argument omits some paramount items that must be involved in the reasoning process ; therefore , it does not constitute a logical argument in favor of the conclusion and it certainly is not persuasive and sound . <p> First , it is questionable that middle-aged consumers will increase greatly within the next decade . According to the above argument , one can not get the conclusion that the middle-aged consumers will increase during the next decade . The population of the present young people should be presented . If now the number of younger people surpasses the number of middle-aged people greatly , then one can get the above conclusion . If not , the conclusion is wrong . The above article gives its reader the impression that middle-aged customers will increase just because the young people will become middle-aged patronages in ten years . So , it is illogical . <p> Second , the author assumes that the average expenditure to department store products and service of middle-aged customers is greater than those of young ones . In fact , young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the author wants to convince others that the opposite is right , he must present related information or data collected in some surveys . <p> In summary , the article leaves out the paramount issues mentioned above .

Both the damage to the River Bridge , which connects Atticus to Hartley , and the traffic problems we have long experienced on the bridge were actually caused 20 years ago by Durant . After all , he is the one who approved the construction of the bridge . If he had approved a wider and better-designed bridge , on which approximately the same amount of public money would have been spent , none of the damage or problems would have occurred . Instead , the River Bridge has deteriorated far more rapidly over the past 20 years than has the much longer Derby Bridge up the river . Even though the winters have been severe in the past several years , this is no excuse for the negligence and wastefulness of Durant . " <p> The author of this letter concludes in his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atticus because he is at fault for damage that has occurred over a twenty-year time span to the River Bridge . The author also blames Mayor Durant for long-time traffic problems on the bridge , stating that Durant actually caused these problems twenty years before because he approved the construction of the bridge and did not approve a wider and better-designed bridge . The arguer may have a personal vendetta against Mayor Durant but the elements stated in the argument do not support such an accusation . <p> First of all , the author squarely places blame on Mayor Durant for the simple act of approving the construction of the bridge . There is no evidence presented that merely approving the building of the bridge had anything whatsoever to do with the damage that has occurred or the traffic problems on the bridge . It is entirely possible that Mr. Durant simply approved the idea of constructing the bridge and not the design of the bridge or the contractor that built it . Simply approving the construction of the bridge does not in and of itself cause damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , the arguer concludes that if Mayor Durant had approved a wider and better-designed bridge that there would be no damage or traffic problems , an argument for which there is no basis of proof offered . It is a well-known fact that bridges are subject to deterioration , particularly over a period of twenty years , no matter how well designed they may be . The author also fails to offer any supporting evidence to show that a more durable bridge with fewer traffic problems could have been built for approximately the same amount of public money . It seems likely that a wider bridge would have more damage problems rather than fewer , and probably would have cost more as well , whether public or private funds were used . <p> Furthermore , the arguer mentions that the River Bridge has deteriorated much more rapidly than the much longer Derby Bridge up the river . This groundless argument fails to take into account other possible reasons for the discrepancy in the deterioration of the two bridges such as traffic loads , location and other environmental variables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected from the elements and rarely used by heavy truck traffic , for example . The author gives no basis for a direct comparison between the two bridges other than his or her personal opinion . <p> Finally , the letter writer refers to the " negligence and wastefulness " of Mayor Durant . The only action cited by the author is the approval of the bridge in the first place , which proves neither neglect nor wasting of anything . The sentence itself contains a non sequitur - firstly discussing the severe winters of the past several years , and then accusing Mr. Durant of waste and neglect . This accusation is unwarranted as well as unsupported in the author 's argument . <p> In summary , the author simply makes groundless accusations without providing any real support for his or her argument . To make the argument convincing , the author would have to provide evidence that Mayor Durant approved a faulty bridge design or an unqualified construction company that caused the bridge 's damage and traffic problems . The author should have also provided supporting details that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary and directly caused by Mayor Durant 's decision to use inadequate construction materials or a poor design .

The best others can do is give you some things to think about , and some information upon which to base your decision . You need to make an informed decision , which means you should acquire as much information as possible about law school and especially about law practice before making your career decision . <p> The following is my two cents ' worth . This list is drawn from my personal and professional experiences as an undergraduate , law student , lawyer , professor , and pre-law advisor . I believe it to be fairly representative of the views of undergraduate pre-law advisors generally . <h> The WRONG Reasons to Go to Law School <p> I 'm a liberal arts major , and I do n't know what else to do with my degree . <p> My parents want me to go . <p> I have always wanted to go to law school/be a lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's intellectually stimulating . <p> I want to change the world . <p> I like to argue/debate . <p> Everyone else in my family is a lawyer . <p> I did well on the LSAT , so why not ? <p> I want to make a lot of money . <p> Law school is so versatile . I can use it for something else , like business or politics . <h> The RIGHT Reasons to Go to Law School <p> I want to be a lawyer . ( If you do n't know what that means , go find out ! ) <p> The mistake many students make is that they focus on law school instead of on careers in law . Law school can be a fun , intellectually challenging endeavor . It can also help you to please your parents and to postpone your career decision making for a few more years .

You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take and pass the state bar exam before you can call yourself a lawyer , and you 'll need to gain experience before you 'll be comfortable with that label . <p> Since law school prepares you to be a lawyer , you will need to find out as much as possible about what being a lawyer is all about before you decide to go to law school . That means at least the following : ( 1 ) Talk to lawyers . Ask them if they like their jobs , and why . Find out what they do , and what they like and dislike about their daily activities . Find out if they are happy or stressed , challenged , or bored . Ask them whether they 'd do it again .

Both Helen Keller and I share one thing in common , that is , we adhere to the same spirit of perseverance and self-perfection . Nevertheless , there is one essential difference . What Helen Keller was trying to do was to overcome her physical predicaments and constraints so that she could behave and do things like a normal person . Being a normal person , I would like to tap my potential to the fullest possible extent so that I can achieve academic and professional excellence necessary for becoming an elite of the emerging young generation . The rapidly growing Chinese economy seems to be providing us with an unprecedented opportunity to our personal fulfillment . Under such circumstances , what we should do is to become fully prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep waters . As a matter of fact , I have already been making some of the most important preparations for my ambitious undertaking in the future . <p> I completed my undergraduate education from 1998 to 2002 in the specialty of marketing at the Business Administration Department of Institute of XX . Although the Institute is by no means the most prestigious one in China , I have been one of the best students in this Institute . Drawing inspirations from Einsteins assertion that diligence accounts for 99% of a persons success , I have endeavored to prove this doctrine through my concrete action . At the very outset of my undergraduate program , I decided that I must make maximum use of all the educational resources available to improve and perfect my knowledge . By the time I graduated , I proved that my undergraduate life was a very rewarding one , embodied in my satisfactory academic performance , important extracurricular activities , a spate of honors and awards , well-developed personal qualities , and recruitment by my Alma Mater . <p> As part of my personal development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic performance . By the time I became a junior , I was ranked top three in my class . My diligence , sound analytical ability and strong interest in my chosen specialty , all those factors contributed to my sustained scholastic success . Marketing is a subject that encompasses knowledge in economics , management , psychology and other disciplines . This interdisciplinary nature of marketing , plus the challenges of creative thinking that it poses to its learner , helped to strengthen my interest in it as I delved deeper into this subject . As a result , I managed to achieve quite satisfactory scores in all the core coursesBusiness Psychology , Marketing , International Marketing , Modern Enterprise Management , Public Relations , Market Survey and Prediction , etc . Meanwhile , benefiting from the systematic and rigorous training in economics and management , I have considerably enhanced my analytical skills , which gradually permitted me to grasp the essence of the matter amidst apparently complicated business issues . I also started to reflect on some basis but specific problems in our economy , such as " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds top 500 ? " <p> During my undergraduate program , my academic commitment did not in the least affect my extensive extracurricular involvements . On the contrary , those involvements served to develop my management capacity , interpersonal communication and teamwork . I was a journalist of our Institutes Journalism Association , reporting on major campus events . I was the chief debater of our Departments Debate Team and by working closely with my tem members , we won the first prize in our Institute for two consecutive years . My other extracurricular positions included assistant director of the Study Department of the Students Union , director of the Social Practice Department of the Institutes Students Union , and a member of the Institutes Students Committee . One thing that should be stressed is that , as director of the Social Practice Department , I successfully launched the final match of Miss Network in XX Province , which was part of XX The match , designed to popularize Internet knowledge and show the charm of the learned women students , produced quite a local sensation . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major challenges .

As far as I am concerned , this challenging profession is what I am most interested in , one which can allow me to apply my knowledge and expertise to face challenges . With Chinas reform toward the market economy , a large number of big enterprises have been created , but over the past two decades , no Chinese enterprise can be found in the worlds top 500 . An important factor is that we lack true entrepreneurs and effective ideas of modern strategic marketing and management . This situation calls for well-trained business administrators with international perspectives . An important purpose of your MBA education is to provide systematic theoretical support for solving various business problems while equipping future enterprise administrators with all the necessary managerial skills . In addition , I am deeply fascinated by your MBA programs competitive and international character . In my proposed program , I will continue to focus on marketing , with special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds top enterprises . It is my conviction that , against the background of economic globalization , an international education can give me far more than the mere knowledge and skills of business administration . <p> As a necessary foundation for my prospective MBA program , I will have accumulated two years of work experience ( from 2002 to 2004 ) . Upon completing my undergraduate program , due to my distinguished performance in academic , extracurricular and moral conduct , I was recruited by my Alma Mater to take up a teaching position as a teaching assistant while concomitantly serving as student councilor . For more than one year by now , I have been managing more than 700 students in an entire grade in XX . <p> Although my responsibilities are not those typical of an enterprise , I have derived much pleasure of successful management in ensuring the smooth operation of student life and activities , in addition to promoting my sense of responsibility and managerial expertise .

What this University really attracts me is that your university attaches great importance to group research and small-class education whereby students are allowed to collaborate with senior professors to undertake various interesting projects . I believe that this highly interactive and competitive educational model will be very appropriate for me in that it can fully draw out my potential in business management and lay a firm foundation for me to become a business management elite in China .

" <p> Sample MBA Essay 2 <p> As a professional who graduated from Electrical Engineering Department of Tongji University , I would like to apply for MBA program at your esteemed university . Through this program , I expect to develop myself into an ideal brand of professional with interdisciplinary knowledge , with knowledge both in management and in a particular technical field of specialization . <p> This determination is the result of my work experience during the past decade . When I first worked at a HongKong company ( 10 DASCOM ) to undertake software development , I experienced the advantages of teamwork . Later , I worked as manager of a sub-project of software development at Suzhou ZhongHao Electronics Company . I became increasingly conscious of the importance of management . I came to discover that in terms of software development , China lacks sound project management and software engineering . During this period , I conducted some practices according to the requirements of software engineering . The result was surprisingnot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the products was also significantly improved . The number of bugs in the software was greatly reduced . This result significantly aroused my enthusiasm to apply software engineering to the later-phase software development . <p> Since 1995 , I have been working at Suzhou Broadcast &amp; Television Information Network Co. , Ltd , a larger-scale company compared to my previous working units . I was wholly devoted to the overall programming of several information systems such as that of charging and office , editing management system . My dedicated efforts finally elevated the comprehensive administration of internal affairs of the company to a higher computer-aided level . After designated as the permanent deputy director of the Office of Technology , I was in full charge of technological planning and complementation in all the aspects . One year later , in virtue of my outstanding work performance , I was promoted to manager of the Department of Technological Development . During my tenure of office , I undertook the construction of new-generation CATV network , which was the largest project in the companys history with a long-term cycle and a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this project from the very beginning till it was put into operation , and conducted a series of preparatory tasks , including investigation and study , planning , designing and marketing , which led to the accumulation of my abundant experience . <p> In 2000 , I was mainly engaged in the projects of Digital TV and Access Network , which aimed at providing the users with digital TV and high-speed online services . Since these projects directly affected all the departments in the company , their successful completion could greatly enhance the organizational and managerial abilities of each department . When dealing with the new knowledge required by these projects , I proceeded it from two sides : on one hand , I tried to upgrade my own knowledge structure ; on the other hand , I made every endeavor to cultivate and train the talented personnel , recruiting the talents we were in urgent need of and simultaneously training all the already existing technicians . Special efforts were also made to promote the communication and exchange of views between them and implant the concept of market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an elite technical team . As a reward for my excellent fulfillment of my duty , I was appointed as deputy general engineer in 2001 . For several consecutive years in my work , I was awarded the prize of Excellent Worker and Excellent Academic Pacesetter . Apart from that , I issued many articles on the collected works for the companys exclusive use . <p> I should ascribe my outstanding achievements in management to my specialty , electrical and electronic technology . Tongji University , one of the top and most prestigious universities in China , enabled me to lay a solid foundation in professional knowledge . My interest was in computer , and I self-studied most of the compulsory courses for students majored in computer by every possible means . I became the computer genius in my department . Though my overall undergraduate GPA was not very high , my consummate computer skills offset this defect and contributed a lot to my later work performance . <p> My graduation design was Application of Image Processing in the Assembly Line , and I dealt with the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical literature and pondering deeply over it , I ventured to change the framework fixed by the supervisor , and successfully rendered a perfect and novel plan . I was then highly appraised by my supervisor with my bachelor thesis rated Excellent . <p> I began my graduate program in Electrical and Information in 1999 at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics . With in-depth understanding of the great importance of management science , I reckon I am in urgent want of an overall and systematic study of Management . Pursuing further studies abroad could enable me to grasp the most advanced knowledge of management , have a direct contact with western culture , concepts and way of thinking , and widen my breadth of vision . I showed keen interest in every facet of Management , particularly Tactical Management . The primary goal of my plan was to found a solid theoretic base , including management of business affairs , tactical management , technical management , risk control , and management of human resources . If I could successfully master all the knowledge in the field of management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into practice all I have learned . <p> Edinburgh University is one of the six largest and most prestigious universities with time-honored history in UK . What most fascinats me is its excellent tradition , grave and down-to-earth intellectual atmosphere . My long-cherished dream in my life is to study in a top university like this . Its MBA program enjoys a great reputation in the world . In terms of pedagogical resources , academic achievements , and other conditions , Edinburgh University can be ranked first-class in every aspect . Thus I am determined to devote myself to studies and practice there , and keep myself abreast with the latest developments in my chosen field . Upon completing my degree program , I will return to China to serve my country . Though the road to my academic pursuit in a foreign country is not so smooth and beset with challenges , I am fully convinced that I have already been well prepared and qualified for meeting these challenges with great courage and confidence .

You know that the same information can be read and interpreted differently by different people or under different circumstances . Thus you task now is to persuade the admission committee that you and their program make a perfect match . To do that you continuously show your strong interest in the program , your particular interest in the research done by some of the professors , explain your strengths and contributions that you can make to the program , etc . This is the main topic of the following . <p> Okay , so you 've sent your applications in , and you know you got them there , they are complete and being considered . ( If you are not sure about the lot of your application materials , e-mail the secretary ! ) <p> Now what ? <p> This is where many graduate applicants fall into the fateful mode of thinking , sit down and wait politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , wo n't it be great if any one of them accepts me ? " Yes , it 's true , many people get accepted exactly this way . In fact , probably the vast majority do . Few people think to act differently , but those few can greatly enhance their chances of being admitted and being admitted to better universities compared to their applications alone . You can and should be one of those few ( unless your application is absolutely outstandingly brilliant , e.g. you 're about to get Nobel Prize , your father is about to donate huge sum to the chosen U , etc . ) . <p> The following are some suggestions which have been previously used by other applicants and which you can try to implement . You do n't need to do all of these choose whatever feels right for you . <p> Call/E-mail To Inquire : Unless you received a postcard stating that everything in your file was completed , you should call the admissions offices to make sure that there are no lingering problems with your application packet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . ) . Phone calls are usually more effective , but most Russians use e-mail and it is also fine . <p> Call/E-mail Politely Again : It is okay ( and even good ) to make one or two brief calls ( send one or two e-mails ) to the admissions offices , gently reminding them of your continuing interest in the program . You can contact either the secretary or the head of the admission committee or both . Ask about the current status of your application , emphasize your interest in the program , if you want you might ask about the number of applications received , or how many acceptance/denial letters have already gone out , or other such things . <p> Send an E-mail or a Letter : Unorthodox but surprisingly low-risk strategy is the idea of contacting graduate programs after applications have been sent . Perhaps you worry that you have created a mistaken impression of your interests or strengths , or fear that successive denials threaten your chances for admission at all . For whatever reason , you may decide to send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reacquaint them with you . Tell them if they 're #1 ( of course , you can tell it to all of them ) or let them know that you 've just received a fellowship , submitted a paper for publication , won a contest , etc . Whatever the source , the purpose is to separate you from the crowd , increase familiarity with your name , and demonstrate your particular interest and knowledge of their program -- all worthwhile causes . <p> Recommenders ' Aid : If one of your recommenders happen to know certain faculty members or be an alumnus/a of the University in question or have some friends or connections to this University , he/she may be able to aid your application in a personal way . This approach works really well in practice , the only difficulty is to find such recommenders . <p> Contacting professors at the universities in which you are interested is an important part of graduate school admissions . Though an Average applicant never would have considered this , it is an extraordinarily valuable experience . Many positive things will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the application process as essentially interpersonal , not impersonal as it most often is viewed . <p> As a practical matter , you probably should contact at least one professor at each school to which you are applying . This is quite a lot of letters , but after the first is completed the rest will flow relatively easily . <p> First , do your homework . Check through the web-sites and brochures of all the schools you are seriously considering . Using the faculty listings and research interests as a guide , check whom might you be especially interested in working with , or under . Even if this professor does not end up being your advisor , you will have engaged an important collegial relationship , and gained useful information as well . Certainly it wo n't kill you to be wrong about whom to choose , but you might as well be right . <p> As far as the letter itself , you will first need to explain who you are . Do n't begin by apologize for writing or being interested in their program ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember professors are interested in admitting good students into the program especially if they end up in their lab . Discuss professors ' research interests and why you are particularly interested in their lab ; the more specific you can be , the better . You 'll probably also want to know whether they would be available as an advisor next year , or some such thing pertinent to your case . Send a copy of your statement of purpose and rn++sumn++ : it will readily introduce you to them without having to come right out and say how great you are , and will allow them to judge your qualifications for the program . <p> Not all of the professors will return your letter . Understand that these are busy people and no one gets awards or recognition or higher pay for responding promptly to prospective graduate students . When you do get a response , be happy . This is a momentous opportunity to gauge your candidacy and to correct any mistaken impressions . If they loved your credentials , thank them ; or if , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more positive aspects . You can then choose either to continue the correspondence , or wrap it up and let them know how much you appreciate their help . Whichever it is , you now have someone on the faculty who at very least will recognize your name . And if you 've contacted the faculty member before submitting your application you got a name to mention in your personal statement , indicating both your enduring interest in the program and the maturity of your decision to apply . And you probably understand the school or department a little better . It was an effort well spent . <p> Send An Additional Recommendation : Now we are getting into some more serious measures . While it is generally wise to stay within the proscribed limits as far as recommendations and essay lengths are concerned , you may decide that your application could use a little lift and that , with a certain amount of tact , you might help it by sending along an additional recommendation . Tell them , for instance , that you originally had intended to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were sending it along now whether they would/could use it or not . Of course , this is only one possible scenario , but your general strategy is clear : show an abiding interest in their program , offer additional resources for their decision-making , and subtly provide another reason for them to learn your name . Slightly risky , yes , but not much . The worst they can do is not read the recommendation , and you will have openly recognized that option unassumingly . This is not a conventional strategy , but it is indicative of the opportunity to be both creative and persistent in your efforts . <p> Rejection with Suggestion : If you have friends or acquaintances who have been admitted to some of the universities you have applied to ( but have not been admitted yet ) and these people are not going to accept those offers . Ask them in their rejection letter to mention your name as a possible good candidate with qualifications similar to theirs . They can send the letter to the secretary and/or better to the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You probably have some friends already studying at the universities in which you are applying . Ask them to go to the head of the admission committee ( or to the member of the committee ) and discuss your candidature . They can ask about the current status of your application , say that they worked with you closely at MIPT and say some good things about you . Not all of your friend will be comfortable or willing to do that but some people will easily agree to this idea . I have used it during my application process in 1997 , I can not say that this particular approach worked but all approaches combined have definitely worked : - ) <p> Visit Schools : If you happen to be in US at this time ( very unlikely , but it does happen to some people ) , use your chance to visit the institutions you are most interested in . This is the perfect time to travel , they 're currently looking over your application , and meeting each other now may be just the thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have . Moreover , by making your name and face familiar to them , you will gain a qualitative advantage over other candidates . The more familiar they are with you , and the more they connect that name to a living , breathing person , the better off you are . Caution : if you think that for some reason you are not as bright as your application , do n't use this approach , you 'd be better off communicating by phone and e-mail . <p> It 's sort of good news . You 're on the wait list . At least you were n't rejected . Now what do you do ? <p> Well , you can do nothing and hope for the best . Or you can try to improve your chances of receiving a letter of acceptance . You have little to lose and much to gain . <p> Here are some suggestions to improve your chances of moving onto the accepted list : <p> I suggest you write an email , no more than one page long , containing as much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's program .

@@42231178 @2231178/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> How to Get into Medical School : Getting into Medical School <p> Getting into medical school is very difficult these days , especially if you plan on matriculating upon graduating from college . What follows are some helpful steps to improve your chances of getting in . <p> STEP 1 : Are you qualified ? <p> Are your GPA and MCAT scores adequate ? The average medical school applicant 's GPA and MCAT scores are 3.5 and 27 , respectively . The average medical school matriculant has a GPA and MCAT scores of 3.7 and 30 , respectively . If you 're numbers fall significantly below these ( e.g. , GPA &lt; 3.3 and MCAT &lt; 25 ) chances are you will NOT even get an interview , much less get into medical school . If you are below average , save your time/money and improve your credentials before applying . <p> Do you have significant volunteer and research experiences ? Most medical schools expect applicants to have significant volunteer and research work ; in fact , some expect you to have published something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor will a long list of superficial extracurricular activities . You must demonstrate to the committee that you have accomplished something meaningful . <p> Have you completed the necessary pre-medical coursework ? Almost every medical school requires the following courses , and though not explicitly stated , expect you to have obtained an A in each of them : Introduction to Biology ( two semesters ) , General Chemistry ( two semesters ) , Organic Chemistry ( two semesters ) , and Physics ( two semesters ) . A significant number of schools also require 4-6 courses in the humanities ( e.g. , English , History , Philosophy , etc. ) , and a few require a year of calculus . You should always determine a school 's requirements before you apply . <p> STEP 2 : Taking the MCAT <p> What is the MCAT ? The MCAT is a daylong , standardized test that tests your knowledge in a wide variety of subjects . The test is broken down into four sections . The first is Verbal Reasoning ( 65 questions in 85 minutes ) which is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second is Biological Sciences ( 77 questions in 100 minutes ) which covers biology courses and organic chemistry . The third is Physical Sciences ( 77 questions in 100 minutes ) which covers physics and general chemistry . The fourth is the Writing Sample ( 2 essay questions in 60 minutes ) which asks you to write an essay on two very broad statements . <p> When do I take the test ? The MCAT should be completed in the spring of your junior year ( April ) , or during the summer ( August ) at the latest , otherwise , you will not be able to enter medical school directly after college . Both dates have their advantages and disadvantages . Taking the test in April allows you to obtain your scores by June and begin the application process sooner ; however , you may not have sufficient time to study for the test because of your college coursework . Taking the test in August gives you more time to prepare , but your scores ( needed to complete the application process ) wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first MCAT , do not retake until you have fully mastered the material . Medical schools believe that those students who have consistently poor grades on the MCAT will also do poorly on the USMLE ( a national , standardized test given to medical school students which must be passed in order for graduation from medical school ) . Registration materials are available in the biology secretary 's office ; the registration deadline for the April test is in early March , and the deadline for the August test is in early July . The cost of the MCAT is $170.00 . <p> How do I prepare for the test ? You have three choices : ( a ) do n't prepare and try to " wing " it , ( b ) go to the bookstore , get a MCAT study book , and prepare by yourself , or ( c ) take a Kaplan or Princeton prep-class . The first option is certainly not recommended . The MCAT is a very difficult testthe majority ( 95% ) of the questions are analytic , and tied to several paragraphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are diligent in their studies and already have a basic understanding of science material . Prep-books are usually 700-1000 pages long and every page is completely filled with crucial information ; remember that the publishers are trying to cover all of organic chemistry , general chemistry , physics , biology , and reading comprehension in one book ! If you want to do well , you should begin studying this material ( 3-6 hrs/wk ) at least two months before the test . The cost of prep-books is $50-100 . The third option is for those who think they need some basic assistance in studying , or for those who do n't require basic assistance but want to score very high on the MCAT . Taking a prep-class means more timeNOT lesspreparing for the MCAT . In addition to doing all of the necessary studying you must do in option #2 , you have to go to prep-classes ( 6 hrs/wk ) , and take supplementary practice tests and quizzes ( 2 hrs/wk ) . If you take a prep-class and do n't make use of the prep-classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than if you pursued option #2 . The cost of prep-courses is $1000-2000 . Again , regardless of which option you decide to choose , you should begin studying 3-6 hrs/wk at least two months before the test . <p> STEP 3 : Researching Schools <p> How many medical schools are there ? There are 122 allopathic ( MD ) medical schools in the US , 3 in Puerto Rico , and 16 in Canada . There are also 19 osteopathic ( DO ) medical schools in the US . <p> How many schools should I apply to ? Assuming you are an average applicant ( i.e. , GPA = 3.5 and MCAT = 27 ) your probability of being accepted to a particular medical school is 1-2% . The more schools you apply to , the better your chances of being accepted . If you are average , it is recommended that you apply to 10-15 schools . ( If you are below average and still want to apply , 20+ schools is best . ) <p> Where should I apply ? You 're the only person that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , you must do a significant amount of research on the medical schools . It is recommended that you purchase the Medical School Admission Requirements ( MSAR ) which provides a large amount of information on all medical schoolsthe information in this book comes from the medical schools themselves . The book can be purchased from most bookstores at a cost of $25.00 . <p> What should I look for in a school ? You should become familiar with a school 's general information , curriculum , admissions requirements ( pre-med. coursework ) , selection factors ( GPA/MCAT scores ) , tuition , financial aid , application/acceptance policies , and reputation . Do NOT rely on the US News and World Report " top medical school " list as primary information . <p> Where can I get all of this information ? The following web-sites should provide you with a great deal of information : ( a ) Association of American Medical Colleges , ( b ) American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine , ( c ) American Medical Association , ( d ) Kaplan Medical , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Library of Medicine , ( g ) Medical School Web Pages , <p> STEP 4 : Narrowing Down Your List <p> I have done all of the research , but my list is still too long . How do I narrow my choices ? As we shall see later , due to time constraints , as well as money and effort , you should not apply to more than 25 medical schools . To narrow down your list of choices , compare ( in greater detail ) the schools ' competitiveness , cost , organization of preclinical years , primary care/specialty focuses , innovative educational approaches ( problem-based learning , etc. ) , student evaluation and grading , United States Medical Licensing Examination ( USMLE ) Policies , special programs and opportunities ( international internships , etc. ) , affiliated teaching hospitals , geographic location , campus safety and housing , and proximity to family/friends . <p> STEP 5 : The Primary ( AMCAS ) Application <p> What is the AMCAS Application ? The American Medical College Application Service ( AMCAS ) provides a standardized primary application service for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do not accept the AMCAS have their own individual applications . ( Note : If you are interested in osteopathic schools , you must instead complete an AACOMAS Application . ) Starting in the year 2001 , the AMCAS and AACOMAS must be completed electronically ( by computer ) . You download software from a website , complete the application on your computer , save it to disk , and then send the disk to AMCAS/AACOMAS . The software for the AMCAS-E and AACOMAS-E can be downloaded from , and , respectively . <p> When should I begin filling-out my AMCAS Application ? The AMCAS becomes available in April for the class entering in the fall of the following year . AMCAS begins accepting applications on June 1 . Before your application is complete , AMCAS must receive an official transcript from every college you have attended ; AMCAS begins accepting transcripts on March 15 . You can verify if AMCAS has received your materials via telephone . You should complete the AMCAS as early as possible , and submit it no later than mid-September ( otherwise , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming you have correctly filled in all application information , it takes AMCAS about one month to process your application and send it to the medical schools . Medical schools differ in their deadlines for receiving the AMCAS ; they require it by October 15 , November 15 , or December 15 , depending on the school . <p> Why should I apply early ? First , medical schools require your AMCAS Application , MCAT scores , letters of recommendation ( and sometimes other things ) before they consider your application ; if any of these materials is not sent , they wo n't even look at your applicationso get your AMCAS in early ! Second , most schools have a " rolling admissions system " in which those who apply first get the first interviews , and consequently , will be granted admission before other applicants . If you send in your application late , the school may have already accepted a large number of people , reducing your chances of getting in . Third ( assuming you will get an interview ) , in the early interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season , you may find yourself as part of a herd of intervieweesthe admissions committee will have less time to look at your application , and it will be harder to stick out of the crowd . Fourth , admissions committees usually meet once per month to review applications ; if you submit your application early , it may be brought before the committee five or six times which increases your chances of getting in . <p> What are the components of the AMCAS ? The AMCAS consists of three main sections : ( a ) General Information ( education , work , activities , and honors ) , ( b ) Personal Statement ( one page ) , and ( c ) Course work and GPA calculations . <p> What are some tips in completing the AMCAS ? General Information : Space in this section is very limited . Avoid trying to mention all of your activities and stick to those that are medically-related and significant . Also , always list the information in descending order of priority . Remember that medical schools often try to verify if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that you are trying to deceive them , your application will be rejected and a notice will be sent to all other medical schools regarding your dishonesty . Personal Statement : Initially , this is your only chance to show the admissions committee your personality . Though there is no single , correct way to complete this section , avoid the following : re-listing your activities/honors , being too creative , delving into controversial topics , and making apologies/excuses for bad grades or a lack of accomplishments . Also , do not come down with the " Mother Theresa Syndrome " in which you fill your essay with generalized , vague statements such as " I want to heal the world , " and make sure your spelling and grammar are correct ! Lastly , be truthfulthough there is nothing wrong with bending the truth ! Coursework and GPA calculations : You are required to enter every class you took in college/grad school , the credits , and the grades received . You should get a copy of your transcript(s) and be familiar with your college 's grading system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMCAS grades . Be very careful in this section ; it is far from explanatory and difficult to comprehend . Any mistake in this section could cause AMCAS to return the application and request you to correct it ( which could cause you to miss many AMCAS deadlines ) , or , if the mistakes are not caught by AMCAS , could result in your application being terminated by the medical schools themselves . Remember that the burden is always on you to meet deadlines and provide accurate information ; do not expect others to do this for you . <p> How much will all of this cost ? About $30-40 per school . <p> STEP 6 : Letters of Recommendation <p> How important are letters of recommendation ? They are very important , and are one of the " big four " things the admissions committee refers to when reviewing your file ( the other three are GPA/MCAT scores , primary/secondary applications , and the interview ) . <p> How many letters do I need ? Most schools require only a committee letter written by the faculty of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request form for this letter ) . However , some schools accept additional , supplementary letters , whereas others do not . Do not send additional letters to schools that do n't want them ; the letters will be thrown out and/or your application may be rejected ( there is nothing worse than an applicant who ca n't follow simple directions ) . These supplemental letters can come from LONG ... supervisor , or from faculty outside your major department . You should always waive your right to see the letters . <p> When must I submit these letters ? Most medical schools do not require letters of recommendation until they send you a secondary application ; so you should have all letters on-hand by late-October . <p> STEP 7 : Secondary Applications <p> What are secondary applications ? A secondary application is additional application materials ( sent by an individual medical school ) which must be completed and returned to them ( usually within two weeks ) to continue the application process . <p> Who gets secondary applications ? Some medical schools send secondaries to all candidates who submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Generally , 50-75% of the applicant pool gets a secondary . Some schools ( e.g. , Boston University and some New Jersey State Schools ) do not require secondaries at all ! <p> What do the secondaries entail ? They can vary from very demanding to easy . Generally , you are required to complete 3-4 additional essays on a wide range of topics , re-print your completed pre-medical coursework/grades , and provide more detailed biographical information . Remember that secondaries are very important in the application processa poor secondary shows that you have little interest in the school and a stellar secondary demonstrates your enthusiasm for the school . If you want to make a good impression on the committee , you should spend a great deal of time on your secondary application ( use a typewriter to fill-in the application ) . <p> How much do secondaries cost ? Generally , you must pay $50-100 per secondary . <p> I 've been accepted to a medical school(s) ; what do I do ? You will have about two weeks to respond to a school 's offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their class for you does not force you to go to that particular school . In fact , you can hold multiple acceptances simultaneously ( i.e. , you can reserve a seat in more than one school ) . If you get accepted by a school which you decide against attending , withdraw your application promptly ; if you do n't , you 'll be depriving someone else of their chance to attend medical school . <p> How long do I have before I must to definitively make up my mind ? You can hold multiple acceptances until May 1 ; after that time , you must withdraw your application from all schools but one . If you do not adhere to this policy , the schools will most likely retract their offers of acceptance , and you wo n't be going anywhere . <p> I got wait-listed ; what does this mean ? The school has not accepted you , but has not rejected you either ; in essence , you 're in medical school limbo . Your chance of getting into medical school if wait-listed is between 1-25% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wait-listed , you 'll know by the end of May whether you 've been accepted , but the school may tell you the day before classes begin ! <p> I was rejected by everyone ; what do I do now ? Sometimes the best candidates are rejected for no apparent reason . You can take time off to get more medically-related work/volunteer experiences , or you can go to graduate school and obtain a Masters Degree/Ph.D. , then reapply when your credentials are stronger . DO NOT reapply until you have significantly improved your credentials ; most schools have a policy of accepting a maximum of 2-3 applications from the same candidate . Also , be prepared to resubmit a new AMCAS application , secondary applications , and new letters of recommendation ( note that some medical schools will allow you to use parts of your original application when applying for a second time ) . <p> STEP 10 : Post-acceptance Plans/Financial Aid <p> I know where I 'm going to medical school , what now ? Now you must start looking for an apartment/condo ( many schools do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional financial-aid information needed to complete your request for aid . ( Note that your FAFSA should be renewed by mid-February to be considered for Federal assistance . You should complete the FAFSA even if you have not yet been accepted to medical school by this time . ) Since every medical school 's financial aid policy is different , you must contact individual schools for more detailed financial information . Note that 99% of aid received is in the form of loans , many of which have interest rates attached to them . The average amount borrowed by medical school students is $75,000-150,000 and the average indebtedness of medical school students is $150,000-300,000 ( this higher figure is due to the compounding of interest ) .

Unfortunately , we ca n't do that . The interviewer may include questions about your subject knowledge that we can not anticipate , nor would we have space to list them . The current interview trend places more emphasis on behavioral questions , questions that ask how you have faced certain issues to determine how you will react in similar situations . We have included some of those , but our best advice is to have examples from past experience that demonstrate the skills you included on your resume . Questions you can ask are included at the end of this page . <p> Your Qualifications Q. Tell me about yourself.A . This is not an autobiographical question . Focus on why you would like this job and how you have prepared yourself experientially and academically . <p> Q. Why should we hire you ? A. Similar to #1 . Focus on what your particular contribution will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . We all bring something unique . Q. How have your education and employment prepared you for this position ? A. See #1 . Q. Do you think your grades are an accurate indication of what you have learned in college ? A. If you do n't , give examples to illustrate your answerQ . Tell me about one of your failures and what you learned from it.A . Be honest but do n't bare your soul : this is not a counseling session ! Demonstrate that you can use failure to achieve future success . Q. What do you think it takes to be successful in a company like ours ? A. Reading the company 's job announcement or web page should help answer this question . If you can talk to an employee of the company beforehand , that would be a wonderful way to find out . Career fairs are excellent for this reason . Q. What qualifications should a successful manager ( sales person , engineer , etc. ) possess ? A. Read an occupational description then tie that to your own skills . Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? least ? Why ? A. For the best , use examples you know relate to the job for which you are applying . For the least , focus on job tasks that you knew were necessary and performed well , but were routine , unpleasant , or required little involvement . Do n't criticize your supervisor or employer . Q. Describe your strongest communication skills.A . Describe means give an example.Remember , listening is a communication skill also . Q. Think about a large task you organized . Describe the steps you followed.A . You can use either a work or school-related project to illustrate . Be specific . Q. Do you consider yourself a leader ? Why ? A. Give an example from your participation in group projects , volunteer situations , clubs , athletics , or your work situation . Q. Describe your managerial ( sales , engineering , etc. ) skills.A . Refer to question #8 . Q. Are you creative ? A. Again , give an example . Creativity is not just drawing , dancing , acting , or playing music . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be innovative in solving things . Q. What are your greatest strengths ? A. Tailor your answer to the job . For instance , if one of your strengths is leadership and you are applying for a sales job , show how your motivational skills work in both situations , or how you hope to reach a regional manager 's spot in a few years . Q. What is your greatest weakness ? A. Everyone has weaknesses , but avoid red flags and show how you have turned your weakness into a positive . Anger , for instance , is a red flag . Remember weaknesses are the flip side of strengths . Faulty time management may be the flip side of concentration and dedication . Procrastination may be the result of wanting to consider all the information and make an informed decision . Downplay the negative and play up the positive . Q. Tell me about your customer service experience.A . Tell how and where you acquired the experience and give an example to show your dedication and success . Q. Do you enjoy routine ? Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like eating , going to work , etc . After that , it depends on you . Choose a job that fits your needs . If you pretty much hate routine , do n't apply for a job that has a lot , like inside claims adjusting . Q. How do you prioritize your work to meet deadlines ? A. Give an example to demonstrate how you have done this . Pulling an all-nighter is not a good answer . Planning ahead , keeping lists are good . Q. If you have a customer in front of you , a client on the phone , and a boss who wants to see you , what do you do ? A. To answer this well , you need to know the company 's policy . If you do n't know how that company would do it , say that you would find out , but give an example from a past experience to demonstrate your ability to stay calm , juggle tasks , and set priorities . Q. Tell me about your computer experience.A . If you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are taking to gain more . Enthusiasm and willingness to learn are key . Q. Why did you leave your last job ? A. Opportunity for advancement , finding work to fit your skills , moving , downsizing , changing careers are all legitimate answers . If you were fired or hated your job , do not bad-mouth the job , the company , or your supervisor . Talk about the positive first , then the lack of communication and what you learned from it that has improved your performance and outlook . Great people fail often , but they use failure to learn and improve their performance . <p> Your Style and Personality Q. How would your friends ( or teacher or supervisor ) describe you ? A. Keep it honest and positive . Remember this is not necessarily how you would describe yourself . Your friends may see your fun and quirks while your supervisor might see your dedication and adaptability . <p> Q. What motivates your best work ? A. Consider the job . If you need praise or excitement or deadlines , not all jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your biggest weakness as a manager or leader ? A. Think about what a manager 's responsibilities are , like motivating employees , delegating tasks , setting goals , hiring , firing , preparing budgets , etc . Which do you like least ? Why ? What have you done to improve your performance.Q . How do you keep track of things you need to do ? A. You are on your own . Most answers will work , except saying that you just remember everything . Q. Would you rather write a report or give it verbally ? Why ? A. State your preference , but indicate your comfort with either approach as the situation warrants . Knowing the job requirements will assist with this question . Many jobs require both skills . Your Interest and Commitment Q. Why are you interested in working for our company ? A. Your research into the company will pay off when answering this question . You can talk about their approach to training , their goals for the future , their success or reputation , but be able to back up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company 's success . Q. Why did you choose your major ? A. If possible , talk about how you perceived your major would increase your skills and further your career goals . If you selected a major because you liked the subject matter and did n't have a clue how that would further your career , you can indicate that , but talk about how the skills you learned apply to the job for which you are interviewing . If you changed majors more than once and ended with one you did n't think was right for you or if you were influenced by someone else 's preference , talk about what you learned about yourself from that situation and how it will help you make better decisions in the future . Q. If you had to choose a school or major again , what would you change ? A. Most answers are appropriate , but avoid negativity or blaming the school , teachers , town , etc . Talk about what you learned from the experience if you do not feel one of these was perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Employers are interested in people who have a commitment to life-long learning , but may not support your education plans if they are not related to the goals of the organization . Tie your own goals in with those of the employer . Unless you are applying for a temporary position , it is inappropriate to mention that you plan to work for a year then attend graduate school . Q. How do you feel about travel or relocation ? A. Knowing the job requirements will help you avoid the wrong answer . For instance , most management positions require both . Some sales and most consulting positions require extensive travel , but may allow you to return home at night , while others require significant time away from home . You can ask what the travel requirements are if you have not been able to determine them ahead of time . Q. How do you deal with stress ? A. Your skills in organization and prioritization of tasks , your willingness to request your supervisor 's assistance with establishing priorities , or ability to stay calm in pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention activities you engage in that help reduce stress , such as running , walking , working out , etc . You can mention boxing , but not punching someone out ; karate , but not fighting in a cage or being a member of a fight club ; dancing , but not exotic dancing . Q. What area of this position would be the most difficult for you ? A. Again , knowing the requirements is essential to answering this question . Answer truthfully , but indicate your reasons along with your willingness to perform the difficult task and how your approach to it will help minimize the difficulty . Q. How long do you plan to stay with us ? A. As long as you can grow and contribute to the goals of the organization . <p> Q. Tell me about an accomplishment from the past year that you are the most proud of ? Why ? A. Focus on work-related . You can use a personal example if related in some way to the job description . <p> Q. Give me an example of a time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come up with an example , remember that your own dedicated job performance has saved your employer time and money . Now develop a STAR statement.Q . Please describe a situation where you used your creativity to solve a problem.A . Creativity might be related to graphic design , engineering , marketing , or anything . It is your ability to think outside the box and you can use examples from work , homework , class , or your private life to illustrate the point.Q . Tell me about a time when you went the extra mile to help a customer.A . If you have not been involved with customer service directly , think about what you have done that affected a customer and develop a situation from that.Q . Describe a situation where you have gathered and analyzed facts to arrive at a decision.A . It is O.K. to use educational experience if you do not have a work-related example . Q. Give me an example of a problem you have had with a team member , co-worker , or employee and how you resolved it.A . Talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a caring , problem-solving approach , is the first step . Discussing it with your team members or a supervisor , as applicable , is next . Get to resolution , whether it was a reprimand , expulsion from the group , firing , your agreement with that person 's point of view , or the person 's change of behavior . Q. Give me an example of a high-pressure situation you have faced this past year and how you resolved it.A . Your skills in organization and prioritization of tasks , your willingness to request your supervisor 's assistance with establishing priorities , or ability to stay calm in pressure situations , are all appropriate to mention if applicable . Q. Describe a situation in which you used persuasion to convince someone to see things your way . A. Since most of us use persuasion skills often , try to think of a work or group-related activity where you used it . Describe the situation , tell what you did , and describe the result . Q. Give me an example of a time when you set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Again , work-related is best , but a goal you set personally will work , too . Q. Give me an example of a time when you tried to accomplish something and failed . A. Remember , at the end of your story , talk about the positive things you learned from the experience and what you would do differently if given the same situation . Q. Tell me about a time that successfully dealt with a person when that person did not like you or vice versa . A. We do n't have to like everyone to get along or get results , but we do have to respect them to do so . Understanding what motivates a person also helps get results . Q. Give me an example of a time that you showed initiative and took the lead . A. Remember the STAR statement . Q. Tell me about an experience when you dealt with an upset customer or co-worker . A. Emphasize the skills you have that that helped you with this . Q. Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leadership . Three components of successful delegation are assigning tasks to people that they have the skills to perform , granting them the authority to carry out the tasks , and creating a climate of responsibility . It does not mean dumping a task you do not want on someone and never checking on the progress . Your example should include why you selected the project that you delegated . Q. Give me an example of a time when you motivated someone . A. How did you find out what motivated that person ? How did you use that to accomplish positive results ? Q. Tell me about a time when you had to make an unpopular decision . A. What was the situation ? What was the unpopular decision ? Why was it unpopular ? Why did you have to make it ? Did the people understand why you had to make it ? How did it turn out ? Q. Tell me about a time when you used your fact-finding skills to solve a problem . A. Be sure to talk about which fact-finding skills you used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and putting it back together , etc . <p> Questions You Can Ask - a partial list Remember , you are expected to find out as much about the company as possible before the interview , but you may not have been able to find the answers to these questions , or you may need clarification . <p> Q. What are your expectations for the person you hire ? Q. Which specific skills are necessary to succeed in this job ? Q. How do my skills , experience and education differ from those of the ideal candidate ? Q. What level of input would I have in determining my objectives and deadlines ? Q. What kinds of projects might I be working on ? Q. Why do you like working for this company ? Q. What level of client contact should I expect ? Q. Would you describe the typical training program ? Q.

What are your policies regarding continuing education for employees ? Q. Is there a tuition reimbursement policy ? Q. Would there be an increase in salary after completion of a higher degree ?

( Do not leave the interview without knowing the answer to this question ) . <p> Illegal Questions It would be great if all interviewers avoided questions which they should not ask , questions about your race , color , religion , national origin , ancestry , medical condition , physical handicap , marital status , and age . Unfortunately , they do not . Often they ask these questions because they are untrained and they are concerned about a job-related aspect . The tactful thing to do would be to answer their intent rather than the question . If the question is really offensive to you and seems to indicate a pattern of impropriety , you can indicate that the questions are inappropriate to determine your potential as an employee and walk out . Of course , you will not receive a job offer in that case , but that is probably all right with you . Assuming the question is well-intentioned , but ignorant , what do you do ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asked one of these questions . If you do n't want to confront the interviewer , you can just answer the question . There are other options , however . <p> Following are some questions and possible answers . Use your own words and style when deciding how to answer . <p> If the interviewer asks your age , it is usually because you are older and he or she is concerned that you will not adapt to change well or be enthusiastic . <p> A. You can say that you are a few years above legal age ( which might be humorous if you are well above ) , but you are enthusiastic about the job and bring a positive attitude and adaptable nature ( tactful ) , or you can answer that the question is illegal or inappropriate and you prefer not to answer it ( assertive , but may hurt your chance for the job ) . <p> If the interviewer asks about your marital status of if you have children , it is often because of concern that you will get married and leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job requires travel or relocation , or that you will miss work because of sick children or child care problems . <p> A. You can state that marriage or children will not interfere with your ability and willingness to give 100% to the job ( tactful ) or that you prefer not to answer personal questions but would be happy to address job-related concerns ( assertive ) . <p> If the interviewer asks about your national origin , it is usually because they are concerned you might not be authorized to work or because they have noticed you speak with an accent or have said you have bilingual skills . They may be trying to be friendly in an inappropriate way . <p> A. You can either answer that you are authorized to work and are confident you will make a positive contribution to the company or that you need an employer to sponsor you , but are confident that your contribution will be well worth it because of your skills and dedication ( tactful ) . You can also ask how the question relates to the job requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your health or disability , it is usually because of concern that you will miss work or will not be able to perform the required tasks . <p> A. If you have an obvious physical disability , you can answer that you have everything you need to perform the job well above expectations , or that with a small , inexpensive adjustment to the work environment , you will be the most productive member of their team and promote a positive image for the company . Health is a confidential matter between you and the doctor , so you can ask if there are physical requirements for the job that you can address . <p> If the interviewer asks about your religion , he or she will usually do it by asking if there are any days you can not work or by asking about your non-work or extracurricular activities . <p> A. You can reply that you are there will be no trouble with your ability to fulfill the work requirements ( tactful ) or you can ask how the question is related to the job requirements ( assertive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been arrested or used illegal drugs , you can reply that you have never been convicted of a felony and your employers have always considered you to be hard-working and trustworthy ( tactful ) , or you can say that you understand that employers can ask if you have ever had a felony conviction if it is related to job performance , but you do n't understand the relevance of the question in these circumstances ( assertive ) .

@@42231181 @2231181/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Architecture <p> People once asked me : " Why did you choose architecture ? " I could n't give a simple answer for that . Maybe it was because I like painting and construction since childhood . I also earnestly yearn to create beautiful things on my own and architecture can satisfy my imagination in space , materials , and color . My born interest in this sector is also because of my parents , who are both structural engineer and electrical engineer , influencing me gradually and unconsciously since I was a kid and giving me perceptual knowledge in the field . After my five-year study in the Department of Architecture , and one-year work experience in architectural design , I ask myself this same question . The result is that aside from the factors mentioned above , what really makes me choose architecture is its intrinsic appeal , which is just like the maxim written inside the building of the Department of Architecture : " Architecture is the combination of art and technology . " <p> Perhaps when a person is engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , instead he would feel motivated and have an enriching experience . Five years ' academic study in the School of Architecture and Arts of University of XX transformed my instinctive excitement and imagination about architecture into systematic knowledge and comprehensive understanding . This transformation , first of all , lies in my skills in the fine arts . Differing from my previous mere interest in fine arts , the study of architecture makes me begin to ponder on how to draw using aesthetic elements from fine arts such as color , lighting and composition to apply to architecture . I was so dedicated to such brainstorming and imagination that I would always work around the clock in the studio for days on end . Secondly , the study of basic architectural courses , such as architectural structure , mechanics and materials science , makes me realize that architecture not only gives importance on aesthetics , but also on the more essential functionality and practicality . In that process , I realized that architecture is not only an art , but also more importantly a sort of technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architecture , that is , architecture is also part of other cultures - it is subject to other cultures ' influence , and at the same time it influences other cultures . <p> Because of my childhood architectural background , coupled with my lasting keen interest in architecture , I gained excellent achievements in the major courses of my college study , ranked top three in the class , and also received first prize scholarships and many other scholarships for five consecutive years . Besides , owing to my understanding of architecture , I am not satisfied with mere textbook knowledge . I believe architecture is not only a skill but also , more importantly , a combination of creativity and imagination . An excellent architecture designer needs not only solid architectural skills and knowledge , but also needs nourishment from fine arts , materials science , engineering and culture . For that purpose , I read quite extensively , understood the architectural history of different countries - especially European architectural history , learnt from works of modern and contemporary architectural masterpieces , and gained insights on their design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge I have gained from these efforts heightens my interests and my desire for creation . <p> I had the opportunity to put to practice this desire for creation during the last stage of my college study . During the second semester of my fourth year , I interned with XX for half a year where I participated in the environmental design of the XX astronomical station and the conceptual design of the Phoenix Residential Complex in XX . These experiences gave me insights into the relationship between a building 's space and its functionality , as well as architectural design 's feasibility , which is an important factor to consider when designing . <p> After graduating in 2002 , I worked with an excellent architectural design institute , engaging in architectural design . In the meantime , I participated in the conceptual design and design drafts of the janitors room , the main machine hall of XX Company Ltd . I was also responsible for the design of the drafts of the multi-purpose hall in XX , XX and the renovation design of the XX Archives of the XX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted as an exception from draftsmen to designer , and I later got the assistant engineer certificate in a short period of time . <p> The design experiences from these projects made me very interested in creatively applying materials in projects . Meanwhile , I also continuously learned new ideas in architecture from different countries , and especially saw a lot of design drawings of overseas architectural masters . All these experiences have a great impact on me , sparking my intention of studying abroad to learn more in-depth contemporary international architectural conceptions . I especially aspire to get to know in more detail modern western architectural history in the hopes of forming my own architectural conceptions . <p> Besides this , another intense desire of mine is to comprehensively learn the relationship between architecture and culture , and through the study of western architecture , to determine China 's own architectural style . China once boasted of a developed ancient architecture , while its modern architecture loses the characteristics of its indigenous culture , a great deal of architecture lingers merely on the stage of rough and superficial imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architectural design conception with characteristics of China 's traditional culture after extensively absorbing modern architectural theories and technologies . That is what I yearn to do and also what I believe I can make .

I am a senior professor specialized in the field of criminology for over 30 years , and have once pursued advanced studies in the University of Leicester in Great Britain . As the dean of the Department of Public Security at the University of Public Security , I have a close understanding of Mr. Zhang 's academic capability . <p> It was at the period of freshmen 's military training that Mr. Muller Zhang first drew my attention . For all the arduous and exhausting military training , he continued to self-study at his spare time after conscientiously completing all the assigned training tasks .

Mr. Zhang has a powerful ability of self-study , which enabled him to grasp what I taught within a short time , and put forward his own viewpoints after he consulted and finished reading a vast literature written in English with good combination of domestic research findings . Thus , he has enlarged his scope of knowledge and improved his ability to analyze and solve practical problems to a greater extent . He could always come up with novel ideas which were greatly appreciated and highly commended . Mr. Zhang is exceedingly interested in criminology , spending most of his spare time studying the specialized books in the library . Moreover , his proficient English was of great help for him to self-study those books in the original related to his professional knowledge . His industry finally brought about a series of honors to him , consecutively receiving scholarships of first and second prizes . One point deserves merit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , marvelous leadership , a keen teamwork spirit and an excellent and harmonious relationship with people around him . <p> The idea of pursuing advanced studies abroad sprung up to him at his third academic year .

Thus it is important and necessary that he pursue further studies abroad so as to broaden his horizon and enlarge his scope of knowledge . He is yearning for his pursuing his graduate studies in the specialty of crime , deviance and control at the London School of Economics and Political School ( LSE ) . My full support of him , in a way , has helped him to confirm his decision and redouble his continuous efforts to make his dreams a reality .

I have full confidence in that he will surely acquit himself splendidly and make his own contributions in this field with his meticulous attitude in scientific studies and his persevering and enterprising spirit .

@@42231185 @2231185/ 9336 @qwx419336 <h> GMAT Test <h> Sample Response to GMAT AWA Argument Questions <p> 8 . The following appeared in the editorial section of a corporate newsletter . " The common notion that workers are generally apathetic about management issues is false , or at least outdated : a recently published survey indicates that 79 percent of the nearly 1,200 workers who responded to survey questionnaires expressed a high level of interest in the topics of corporate restructuring and redesign of benefits programs . " Discuss how well reasoned . . . Etc . <p> In this argument , the arguer claims that workers are becoming more and more enthusiastic about management issues . To substantiate this conclusion , the arguer provides the result of a survey , which point out that more than half of the workers asked were considerably interested in the topics of certain corp9orate programs , While this argument has several merits , there are some logical errors that seriously undermine the reasoning . <p> In the first place , the procedure of the sampling is unclear . With different views on management issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worked in the same department , however , the results of the survey would be unreliable . In addition , the arguer must provide a more detailed process of the questionnaire . <p> In the second place , no evidence is offered to indicate that most of the other workers take the same level of interest in those programs as the ones asked , for the reason that the 1,200 workers are not representative of all of the workers . Hence , the arguer must present much more data such as the total number of worker . <p> Last but not least , the arguer makes a hasty generalization about the types of issues that the workers are interested in . It is entirely possible , for example , that most of the 1,200 workers were concerned about only the corporate restructuring and redesign of benefits programs and still apathetic about other issues . If so n the survey on which the argument relies would lack credulity and therefore would not lend strong support to the argument . <p> In conclusion , the arguer fails to demonstrate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidify the argument , the arguer must present more concrete information about the procedure and many other samples of the survey . Furthermore , the arguer would have to provide a clearer definition of management issues so that the workers might have more choices when answering the questions of the survey . 
@@42231186 @2231186/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Public Policy Study <p> I was born in the city of Guangzhou , the provincial capital of Canton--an area often called the " frontier " of China 's economic reform and marketization . The economic and social development of the area has taken place in such pace that it radically transforms the living conditions , the environment , the culture , and perhaps more than anything else , people 's way of thinking . No longer victims of ignorance and self-isolation , people of Canton view the outside world with great curiosity and openness . <p> I remember that ever since I was in high school , I paid rapt attention to the social changes and government policy-making that were to shape the country 's future . Many debates took place between me and my classmates , and it often brought us to euphoria or regret and sorrow , as we watched the events taking their many unexpected turns to unfold . <p> But it was not until I entered ZhongShan University ( one of the top institutions for higher learning in China ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not known before--its rich theory , complex logic , and the sheer brilliance of its insights and arguments . During my student years , I became acquainted with some professors of the department who had been studying at Harvard and other American universities , and their professional ability and personal charisma impressed me immensely . From them I came to know that I can achieve a deeper understanding of China 's past and present by broadening my theoretical and cultural perspective . I also began to see not only the importance of Political Science , but also its challenge and excitement . <p> It was , however , an accidental event that prompted me to take Public Policy as my area of focus . An organizer of a student " social practice " activity , I came to a community school operated exclusively for children of migrant workers , who could not enter regular schools because of their " alien " status--an experience I will never forget . The contrast between the school 's facilities with those of ordinary city schools shocked me . In the clear eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept asking myself what I could do for these children , not just the one hundred or more in front of me , but millions and millions more like them . It is only through the development of the social welfare system and appropriate government policy that the disadvantaged may be helped and protected , and all children may have an equal opportunity to education and success . Since then , I have been fully determined to devote myself to the cause of public service and social welfare . <p> I am fully convinced that Public Policy Study is vital to any modern society . It shapes our understanding of our social systems and responsibilities , and informs government legislation and policy-making . The great attraction of a career in public policy research lies in that it will allow me to play a part in the planning and the building of a future society of our country , which is not only richer , but better . Public Policy is also an area of study noted for its practical value . It addresses to concrete economic and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract theoretical and ideological disputes , which I sometimes find discouraging . One of the reasons for me to pursue advanced education abroad is to attain a fuller knowledge of the public policies and their specific principles and applications in the United States and other industrial countries . They tell us what a country could experience in the process of industrialization , and give new meanings to the concepts of public interests and social policy . They are , as I see it , an asset to mankind . <p> Government policy study as an academic discipline was started in China in the 1980 's ; systematic study of public policy was even more recent . In China 's steady transition from a state-controlled system to a market-oriented economy , new social issues continue to emerge , calling for close investigation and serious research . While great progress and improvement are being made , many in adverse situations are also left stranded and helpless . The need for the development of an adequate social security system and welfare service has never been so urgent . <p> I believe that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult problems , my strong sense of social responsibility , and , above all , my boundless enthusiasm for the cause of public service , will enable me to succeed in pursuing an advanced degree in my chosen field in the United States . And from this , I am sure , my country and my people will benefit . As Karl Marx says , man strives for things that matter to him . In saying so , I believe , he means not only material things , but also the spiritual and the ideal . It is in the behalf of social justice and public well-being that I will strive , for the rest of my life .

@@42231189 @2231189/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Questions and Answers for Recommendation Letters <p> What is the purpose of the Recommendation Letter ? Recommendation letters are letters written by professors who know you , assessing you capacity to meet the requirements of a program you are applying for . They 're supposed to help decision-makers to get a better picture of your potential . The most helpful letters come from teachers who have had considerable contact with you , especially in non-classroom setting such as research labs . <p> What information should be included in the Recommendation Letter ? A letter of recommendation is a detailed discussion , from a faculty member , of the personal qualities , accomplishments , and experiences that make you unique and perfect for the programs to which you 've applied . A well written letter of recommendation provides admissions committees with information that is n't found elsewhere in the application . It should be written with the understanding that what makes a student 's application packet stand out from the others is not only grades and accomplishments , but the specifics of what the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selection committees normally weed out mediocre application packets before focusing on the excellent ones . This means that a brief letter with phrases like " good student " and " hard worker " that are n't substantiated with examples will get tossed aside in favor of the detailed letter that does n't just tell but shows how qualified the student is . <p> Most committees look not only for what the student has already done but what he or she has the potential to accomplish . Addressing potential may take a little more time than discussing past deeds , but it may give the student the edge over other applicants . See General Outline of the Recommendation Letter for more details . <p> Who should I ask for the Letter of Recommendation ? The best kind of letter is from someone who has been involved with you professionally . This person should know you and your work well and have a high opinion of you . Good choices include : * The person who is supervising research on your part , such as your current or former scientific advisor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab with at least PhD ( = " kandidat nauk " ) * Your " seminarist " ( and possibly also lecturer ) with whom you have/had frequent interactions * The Dean or the Vice-dean of your department <p> A letter from an employer can be useful if the job was related to the field to which you are applying , and the letter comments on your accomplishments of specific duties , your aptitude for this type of work and so on . Otherwise , such letters are usually not helpful . <p> Is it important for my recommender to be well-known person ? It is much to your advantage if your recommender is a well-known person in his field especially if members of the admission committee know his name . Just remember the general letter from the famous person who had little interaction with you and can just say that you are a good student but give no specifics of your joint research or other activities is no good . In this case you 'd better off with the recommendation from somebody less famous but well acquainted with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> How many Letters of Recommendation do I need ? Most universities will ask you for 3 Recommendation Letters , rarely 2 or 4 . Check with the particular department for details . As a rule you can submit 3 Recommendation Letters to all the programs . <p> How long should the Letter of Recommendation be ? The optimum length is between 2/3 of a page and one page . If the Recommendation Letter is shorter the admission committee might assume that recommender lacks enthusiasm . <p> Do I write the letter myself or do I ask the professor to do that ? In Russia most students write their Letters of Recommendation themselves . This is mostly due to fact that the recommenders do n't know English well enough to write recommendation and do not know the format in which they are expected to write recommendation ( They are used to writing " harakteristiki " , which are quite different from Letters of Recommendation ) . Some recommenders would choose to write in Russian and ask you to translate it in the appropriate form in English . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations on their own were when either recommenders were Americans or Europeans or they were Russians closely affiliated with American research institutions . <p> Some advice on Writing your own Recommendation Letter . <p> Is it possible that the admission committee will contact the recommender ? It is possible but quite unlikely situation . The only cases I know when the recommenders were contacted is when the recommenders were quite famous people and their recommendations were too good to be true . In this case the admission committee might send the letter or e-mail or call ( whichever information is provided on the recommendation ) asking whether this person really gave this recommendation . Also , there is no need to provide the e-mail address on the recommendation letter if you do n't want to . In my case , my recommenders have been contacted only ones by MIT ( after I have been admitted ) with the thank you letter for providing useful information . 
@@42231190 @2231190/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for International &amp; Comparative Law <p> As a 21-year-old girl , I have heretofore devoted my life-consuming efforts to two essential tasksthe playing of the violin and the study of law , both of which I love and wish to perfect . With more than ten years efforts of practicing , I have reached Grade 10 , the highest level for a non-professional violinist . The greatest benefit of my musical dedication is that it has permitted me a heightened experience of the beauty of harmony and lead me to believe that harmony and order are also the two ideal conditions that human societies should aspire for . For the realization of such an ideal , I am prepared to dedicate equally persistent efforts that I devote to the violin playing . This constitutes the underlying emotional motive that I chose law as my specialty when undertaking my undergraduate program . It is also this emotional ideal that guided me throughout my study efforts during the 4-year undergraduate program at the International Economic Law School of Shanghai International Studies University . It is still this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced degree program in International and Comparative Law ( LLM ) . My objective is to develop myself into an accomplished lawyer versed in international law through your highly respected degree program . The foundation that I have established through my past academic training makes me confident that I am pursuing a worthy objective on the right track . <p> To some extent , the LLM degree program in International and Comparative Law that I am applying for is an extension of my undergraduate program in International Economic Law . On the other hand , my interest in comparative legal systems is also related to my undergraduate experience of doing a course project on studying British and American contract laws and comparing it with that of China . This experience of doing in-depth research on different systems of contract law not only reinforced my already serious interest in law as a whole , but also deepened my understanding of specifically British and American laws ( especially contract laws ) and the differences between the Continental Legal System and the Anglo-American Legal System pertaining to contract laws . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in and potentially capable of undertaking theoretical analysis in comparative law studies . It is precisely based on this important experience that I are qualified for embarking on advanced studies in international and comparative law . <p> Another contributing factor to this major decision-making on my part is the fact that , at the time when I was learning International Trade Law and British and American Trade Law , China was concluding its final-stage negotiation and joined the WTO . I immediately realized that those two courses would be of special importance because they were closely associated with what was happening and what will happen in the economic life of China . The valuable knowledge they impart would be extensively applied and prove immeasurably useful to our country . As China becomes increasingly integrated into the international community , there calls for a large number of scholars and practitioners of international trade law . This bred in me the determination to become an international jurist who specializes in the arbitration of international trade disputes and other trade disputes under the WTO framework . In the summer of 2002 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mckenzie International Law Firm Ho Chi Minh Office and this experience proved crucial in reaffirming this determination . <p> My internship at Baker &amp; Mckenzie International Law Firm Ho Chi Minh Office is by far my most memorable part of legal practice , which I sure will produce a far-reaching impact on my future career development . In the course of this internship , I not only experienced how legal processes were actually operated but also developed a profound understanding of Vietnams legal system and of the WTO rules . I was made responsible for translating the materials for the Vietnam Department of Baker &amp; Mckenzie and preparing the Memo for the Dell Company for its business development in Vietnam . I collaborated with a colleague to write an investigatory report for Frederick Burke , one of Baker &amp; Mckenzies international partners , concerning the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement and provided detailed exegeses for the report . In addition , I attended the Seminar on Seminar on Vietnam-US . BTA Arbitration and the Seminar on US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement ( BTA ) and Its Impact on Vietnamese Fruit Exporters launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given me all the necessary background for undertaking comparative law studies ( focusing on Vietnam law , Chinese law , and American law ) . I also benefited importantly from working under senior lawyers with international experiences and I evolved the secret wish that one day I might be able to work the way they do . This led to a clearer vision of my course of future career development . <p> To be a jurist , especially to be an international jurist , means to choose a career in which one has to constantly challenge his or her limitations and to keep improving his or her professional qualities . On account of this fact , I have made full use of my time and energy to satiate myself in the quest for knowledge , to make the most out of my undergraduate education . I am familiar with all the major western classics in law , including the more recent works such as Richard A Posners Economic Analysis of Law and The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theories . In addition to doing good coursework , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted with great enthusiasm . Therefore , my undergraduate program has been as rewarding as it is multifaceted , consisting of important achievements in coursework , research , social practice , project internship , charity involvements , part-time jobs , as well as various hobbies . Especially worth mention is the prize-winning treatise that I submitted on the occasion of Law Treatise Contest of Shanghai International Studies University . Entitled To Preserve or Not to Preserve , That is the QuestionThe Evolution of British and American Consideration System in Historical Perspective , my treatise was evaluated and commented as " displaying considerable originality in perspectives , thought-provocative , raising challenging issues for Chinas reform in its contract law apart from presenting penetrating views into the British and American consideration system and its necessary reform . " It was published in the Journal of the Law SchoolVoice of Law . Another fact that should be pointed out is that Shanghai International Studies University , formerly Shanghai Foreign Language Institute , attached paramount importance to the study of English language . My English proficiency allowed me to deal with international legal services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my internship at Baker &amp; Mckenzie . I also have some English teaching experience . I taught preparatory IELTS courses in the Shanghai Branch School of Singaporean Orchard Language College . In this regard , I should be competent for a TA position . <p> In my future program , I would like to proceed according to this plan . First I would concentrate on the study of American law and learn methodologies in doing comparative legal studies . After laying this foundation , I would focus on comparative studies of American and Asian laws ( particularly Chinese and Vietnam laws ) . In the second stage of my LLM program , in connection with international trade law , I will concentrate on International Organization , International Investment Law , European Union Law , WTO Legal Framework , Competition Law , International Trade Regulations &amp; Customs , WTO Disputes Resolution , General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs , and the domestic legal reforms of China and Vietnam after WTO entry . I would also like to do some internship in which I expect to experience American legal practices directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will select a particular subject that may become the focus of my dissertation , a subject that offers creative perspectives . After completing LLM program , I will seek employment at an international law office in China where I work as an international jurist specializing in dispute resolution related to WTO rules . Apart from that , I will also be interested in teaching at a law school in one of Chinas prestigious universities . <p> The trend of global economic integration is irreversible . In this globalization process , many new legal problems will arise . The ultimate objective of globalization is that it can benefit all participants in this process through cooperation . The sad fact is that the global economic order can not be always as perfect and as idealized as we wish . Nevertheless , that is precisely what legal practitioners are meant for . They make efforts to help the world get infinitely close to the harmonious and ordered state that I aspire for .

@@42231192 @2231192/ <h> What Should You Do to Follow up an Interview <p> Almost immediately after an interview , you should write a thank-you letter to the interviewer(s) . You can use e-mail to do this , but sending a letter or card is more thoughtful . <p> If more than one person was involved in interviewing , sending a note to each one would be awesome . Remembering names of people we have met briefly in an interview situation is beyond most of us . However , if you jot down their names on your notepad , request a business card at the interview , or call the office and request names , your effort will be worth it . Since so few people do this , you will really be memorable . If you can not obtain their names , send a letter to the head interviewer and address it to the that person and the interview panel . <p> Thank-you letters should express gratitude for the interview opportunity , particular attention or kindness shown to you , assistance provided , or other experience that provided a memorable occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course ! ) . <p> Reconfirm your interest in working for the company and indicate that you hope to hear positive news soon . <p> You can make your thank-you letter work harder than that . If you feel you did n't provide a complete or totally correct answer to a question in the interview , you can use your letter to clarify your response or to show that you cared enough to seek more information . Do n't attempt to clarify more than one or two points , or you could talk yourself out of a job ! Restate the contribution that you can make to the company . <p> Following Up <p> If you do not hear from the interviewer by the time he or she indicated , or within a reasonable amount of time from your interview - two weeks or so , you should call or e-mail the interviewer to inquire about the status of their selection process . <p> If a decision has not yet been made , ask the interviewer when he or she believes it will be made . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interview outcome before making a decision , tell the interviewer . It may speed up the process . <p> If a decision has been made and you are selected , congratulations ! If you were not selected , try to find out what the interviewer would recommend to you that could improve your chances at your next interview . This is a non-threatening way of trying to discover why you were not selected , but it will also help you in future interviews . <p> Many organizations rely on second , or even third interviews , to make hiring decisions . If you are chosen for a second interview , indicate your pleasure at being selected . Ask what the format will be for the second round . If you do not already have an idea , you can ask what the salary range is for the position before deciding whether to go further . Most companies that offer second interviews are very competitive with their salary offers anyway , so you do n't need to ask unless it is really important to you . Wait to discuss salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang up before discovering the name and title of the interviewer , where and when the interview will take place , and what the travel arrangements are . <p> Second interviews are required by employers who use the first interview as more of an introduction to see if you will fit as part of their team . The second interview , then , will probably be more in-depth . It may include more job-related questions , hands-on experiences , and/or meeting with more than one person . Be yourself , your best self , and you will ultimately have a positive experience . <p> The best thing about second interviews is that it usually provides you the opportunity to view the organization in action and to meet some of the people with whom you will be working . <p> Remember , you are trying to decide an important part of your future . Is this an organization with which you will feel comfortable and which offers you the opportunities you seek ? Observation can provide a large part of the answer .

I disagree with this statement . Firstly , individual nations have been driven to adopt energy conservation initiatives without international leadership ; they will be motivated to do this simply to preserve energy for the benefit of their nation . Furthermore , often international leadership and worldwide cooperation fail to influence the entire world to conserve energy . Therefore , it is not unrealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and international leadership and worldwide cooperation is not always required . <p> Factors other than international leadership or world cooperation have driven individual nations to conserve energy . For example , most nations in Europe develop and use automobiles that are highly energy efficient . This is not the case worldwide . Such nations are motivated to conserve energy purely for the benefit of their own nation as they recognize that the earths resources are limited and must be conserved for future generations . Energy efficient transport in such nations is not just limited to automobiles but public transport as well . The governments and society in these individual nations have chosen to find ways to conserve energy , which proves that it is not unrealistic to expect the sacrifices necessary to conserve energy . <p> Although the goals of international energy conservations and other environmental initiatives are to encourage all nations of the world to conserve the earths resources , they often fail in reaching their objectives .

In turn , Australia refuses to sign the treaty unless all developed nations are involved , its view being that it will be unable to remain competitive if its energy consumption is limited whilst its competitors will not have such impositions placed on them . McDonalds is an example of a food chain , with franchises in many countries that strives to conserve energy . It has adopted the use of energy saving lights and has tested , only in the United States , 5 advanced energy saving restaurants . Although , this is a great accomplishment for energy conservation , this has not led franchises within other countries to follow suit .

In order to ensure that all those years of schooling and other experiences will pay off in the job hunt , even before contacting employers , one must learn the art of resume writing . ( See What Does a Resume Look like ? ) <p> Your Resume Should Be : <p> A concise and factual presentation of your credentials <p> Focused on your education , accomplishments , strengths , employment history and goals <p> A good resume is brief and concise , typed neatly in block form with no errors . It must be easy to read . When preparing your resume , cover the following points ( resume outline ) : <p> 1 . Limit yourself to one page only . As a rule , two page resumes are acceptable when you have over ten years of experience . Employers prefer to read only one page . <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the best letter quality printer available . Have an offset printer make copies or use a good , clean duplicating or photocopying machine . Do not mimeograph your resume ! <p> 3 . Type or print it on 8 " X 11 " plain white bond paper in block form . Avoid erasable bond - it smudges . Use 1 inch margins on both sides and 1/2 to 1 inch margins on the top and bottom of the page . Double space between each section of the resume . <p> Resumes may be written in various formats , several are outlined below . Also listed are a few skills you may have acquired along the way . The paragraphs below will give you a brief description of a chronological format and skill based , functional format , as well as steps on creating a resume . <p> Chronological resumes document work experience and education in chronological order , with the most recent dates first . Major categories are : Work Experience , Education , Professional Affiliations , and Awards . This format is generally used by candidates applying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are staying in the same field . This type of resume is best used when your job history reflects growth , when prior employment has been with a prestigious employer , and you want to emphasize that work experience , or when a prior job title may be considered impressive to the reader . This format may not be the most appropriate to use when your job history is irregular , you are changing careers , you have changed employment frequently , or you have little employment history . ( Chronological Resume Sample ) <p> Functional resumes intend to highlight your specific skills and accomplishments which have been demonstrated through specific work related achievements . Note that your skills do not necessarily have to be presented in the order in which they were accomplished ; list them by order of importance as they relate to the job for which you are applying . Major categories are : Technical Abilities ( skills ) , Work History , Education , and Professional Affiliations . This format is best used when you want to change careers , when you are returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth has not been good , or when you believe extended work experience is not needed or desired for the job for which you are making application . The functional resume should be avoided in traditional fields such as teaching or government or when continuous growth is important to demonstrate . ( Sample Functional Resume ) <p> Combination Chronological/Functional resume is being used increasingly by candidates to highlight special accomplishments while giving employment history in chronological order . The combination resume also seems to be popular with employment offices . Major categories are : Professional Objectives , Education , Honors , Work Experience , and Summary . ( Combination Resume Example ) <p> The Cover Letter should amplify points that you may or may not have covered in your resume ; it serves as your introduction to an organization . It should be brief and informative . Several things should be addressed ( Cover Letter Checklist ) : <p> Explain why you are writing to the organization . Whenever possible , the letter should be addressed to a specific person . with the full name and title . Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This person could be the Chief Operating Officer , the Human Resources Director , or one of the line managers . ( How to Write Cover Letter ) <p> If responding to an advertisement , give the date of the ad , the publication in which the ad was run , and the title of the position for which you are enclosing an application . Analyze your skills , acquired both on the job and in volunteer work , and make every effort to match your skills with those emphasized in the ad . <p> If sending an unsolicited resume , make every effort to explore the goals of the organization , its regular and continuing job needs , and the climate of the organization to permit you to match your accomplishments with the goals and objectives of the organization . <p> In closing , express a desire to arrange a time for an interview and state that you will telephone to request a time for an appointment .

Now you wait , and wait , and wait . The winter and early spring can be a stressful time . Some students deal with the stress by tuning out the law schools completely ; other students pester the law schools with phone calls enquiring about their status . Neither of these approaches is ideal , and they can , in fact , be downright detrimental . So as you wait , take the following advice : <p> Be sure that your applications for admission and your applications for financial aid are complete . A law school will not review your file until all of the information is received and your file is deemed complete . You can check the status of your transcripts , LSAT score , and letters of recommendation by consulting the LSAC web site . LSAC will tell you the date each piece of information was sent out ( usually electronically ) to your law schools . Once LSAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good idea to call the law school to verify that your application is complete . Do not call every day , and do not be a pest . Do not expect instantaneous serviceafter all , your application materials are arriving with hundreds of others , and they all need to be organized by the admissions committee staff . ( Thus , if you figure your application will take 2 days in the mail , do not call the third day to verify its arrival . Be sensible about processing and turnaround times . ) Once you have confirmed that your application is complete , STOP CALLING . <p> Believe it or not , parents are calling the law schools in increasing numbers to check on their child 's chance of admission and the status of the decision making process . This is a bad idea , and not at all helpful to you . Similarly , parents call the law schools with questions about how to complete financial aid paperwork . UGH ! As a general rule , your parents or guardians should not be contacting the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old to have your parents doing your applications for you . If they have questions , you should get the answers for them . <p> Maintain your dignity , and treat folks with respect . Do not call the law schools every day , or every week . Do not sound desperate or impatient . Do not yell at admissions staff . It 's rude . Moreover , as a practical matter , you never know who is picking up the phone in the admissions officedo n't assume it 's a work-study student or secretarial staff . Admissions folks often make notes when applicants call to complain , and complaining does not endear you to them . You need to handle your stress ; do not take it out on the law schools , or anyone else for that matter . <h> Acceptance ! <p> If you are accepted to one or more schools , congratulations ! Youve made it . Now you need to select your school and plan for your attendance . This is a good time to visit the schools , if you have n't already , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , compare financial aid packages . If one is more generous than another , you could call the other law schools financial aid offices to ask if they might be able to do a bit better , pointing out that you really want to go there , but XYZ school offered you more money . ( This strategy probably works best when XYZ law school is higher ranked than the school you want to attend . ) If you try to negotiate for a better financial aid package , be sure to ( 1 ) be very polite and diplomatic , not demanding ; ( 2 ) remember that it might work , but probably wo n't , so do n't  get your hopes up . <p> Once you are accepted , you will have to pay a seat deposit to hold your place in the class . Usually the seat deposits are due in May ; May 1st or 15th is the most typical date . What if you have n't heard from all of your schools by then ? You need to decide whether you want to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens all of the timepaying a seat deposit simply to hold your place while you wait for other schools is another predictable expense of the application process . <p> If you have been accepted into the law school of your choice , you have pretty much reached the end of the application process . You should work closely with the law school during the summer to ensure a smooth transition . Finding housing near the school will probably be a priority for you , since many law schools have inadequate on-campus housing for graduate students . <h> Deferment <p> A deferment is a request to a particular school to put off your enrollment for a year . Usually an admitted student asks for a deferment if something unexpected has occurred in his/her life , such as a death in the family or , more positively , a new travel or job opportunity that is too good to pass up . Generally , working to save money for school is not the best reason to request a deferment , but lately law schools have had so many applicants that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferment should be considered a contract with the one law school you have chosen to attend . You CAN NOT use your deferment year to reapply to other schools . The law school has promised to save a seat for you next year in exchange for your promise that you will attend . Law schools take these mutual promises very seriously , and become quite angry if students ignore their deferment responsibilities to shop around at other law schools . Sometimes a law school will even report to other schools that the student has received a deferment and is , essentially , violating its terms . That being said , if you are willing to commit to a law school , requesting a deferment is a straightforward process , and law schools are usually willing to accommodate these requests . Warning : The downside to requesting a deferment is that you almost always lose your existing financial aid package and have no guarantee of another one . Be sure to discuss your financial aid package , and the prospects for being re-awarded aid , before you make a final decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  work out this time . Now you need to decide how badly you want a legal career . You can always reapply . If you choose to reapply , you will NOT be at a disadvantage because you were rejected in the past . The personnel on most law school admissions committees tends to change every year , so you will probably have a new person reading your file . Even if the committee does not change , the members wont remember you from that stack of thousands of applications they read the year before . <p> Should you take the LSAT again to raise your score ? Take another look at the LSAT section of this CD . Basically , I do not recommend retaking the LSAT unless you are convinced that you can do better . Instead of retaking the LSAT , you might want to reconsider the schools to which you applied : were they too competitive for you ? Were you a bit unrealistic in your choices ? Are there other schools that might be happy to admit you with your existing GPA and LSAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your application ? I do not recommend obtaining a graduate degree unless you really want a graduate degree . Do not pursue an additional degree just to make yourself look better to law schools . Youd be better off spending the same amount of time working at a law firm , or in some other legal environment , where you will gain relevant experience about your chosen career . This experience will be much more important to the admissions committee than another degree . <p> If you really want to go to law school , you need to understand that sometimes a dream deferred is a dream realized . It never ceases to amaze me that students with their hearts set on law school totally give up if they are rejected the first time around . If you give up , you will never go to law school . If you defer this dream you may , in fact , be successful someday . To improve your chances of success the next time , you should seriously consider waiting a year or more if you are a college senior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class is 26 these days , and all of the evidence points to this age going up , not down . Law schools want mature folks with some distance from college who have worked in the real world and thoughtfully reflected on their career choice . If this is not you , then perhaps waiting a bit would be wise . <h> Waitlisted ? ! <p> If you are waitlisted , you are with a select group of applicants who are qualified to be admitted , and will be admitted if spots open up . Each law school has its own approach to the waitlist . Some schools rank folksyou might be , say , number 15 on the waitlist . Many schools rank folks by quartileyou might be one of the top 25 on the waitlist , but no student is ranked within that quartile . Sometimes the law school will tell you where you fall on the waitlist ; sometimes it wo n't . <p> If you are waitlisted , you will be asked by the law school if you wish to remain on the list . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real downside to sitting on the waitlist . You may be sitting for a long time , so being patient and being flexible with your plans would help . ( I got off the waitlist at the University of Virginia School of Law in the first week of August , just 3 weeks before school started . That was fine by me , because Virginia was worth the wait . I showed up in Charlottesville with no place to live , knowing no one , but eager to start my law school career . ) <p> If you decide to remain on the waitlist , DO NOT call the law school every other day to see how much progress you are making toward admission . If you want to be proactive , ask a faculty member or employer to write a short letter of recommendation to the admissions committee to augment your file . Sometimes a pre-law advisor will make a phone call on your behalf , too . If you have any additional information to add to your file , you might wish to do so , because waitlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish yourself from others on the list . A good example of additional information for graduating seniors would be an updated transcript that shows outstanding spring semester grades . Send it along with a short cover letter confirming your interest in the school , and noting your accomplishment . Do not sound desperate when you send additional information ; be professional . Also , do not paper the law school with tons of additional informationbe selective , and be patient . <p> It is very hard to predict how many applicants will be taken off of the waitlist at any given school . Spots open up when accepted students decide not to attend . Typically , accepted students drop out after they have been accepted to another law school that they want more . For example , if someone gets off the waitlist at Harvard and decides to go , his or her spot at the University of Minnesota will open up . The person who takes that spot at the U , in turn , will leave open a spot at Hamline . In short , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitlists all summer , which in turn causes other students to move off of waitlists , and so on . <p> Just a few years ago , it was not uncommon to have significant movement off of the law schools waitlists . In the past three years , however , the crush of applications plus the bad economy has resulted in students committing to law schools early on and actually keeping those commitments . Some schools had no movement at all off the waitlist during the summers of 2002 and 2003. 2004 was not much better . However , the summer of 2005 showed movement off of waitlists , even at the top schools ! Hopefully this trend will continue . <p> If you are REALLY flexible about your law school plans , you might want to show up at the school on enrollment day . Its the ultimate last-ditch attempt to get off the waitlist , but it occasionally does work . Two persons were admitted to my entering class off of the waitlist on enrollment day , simply because two spots opened up when two admitted students failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform the law school when he/she decides not to attend , but sometimes they do n't  . If you are lucky , you might be in the right place at the right time when this happens , and snag a spot . If you do this , be sure to inform the law school in advance and on the day of enrollment that you are there and are ready , willing , and able to start immediately . Good luck !

@@42231202 @2231202/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Education <p> The genesis of my intense interest in education , an interest which has now evolved into an aspiration and a pursuit for a career in the field , happened during my undergraduate studies . A Basic Training Program delivered by the graduates from Yale University ( as part of an exchange program ) changed my understanding of education and , together with it , the course of my life . Those graduate students were young , vigorous , and highly intelligent , demonstrating impressive teaching expertise . In particular , I was fascinated by their original and unique teaching methodology . I came to realize that education should be dominated by advanced concepts , assisted by effective teaching strategies , both of which are vitally important for bringing out a greater social role from education . Education represents for me a field in which I can achieve satisfying personal development . <p> Out of my love of teaching and with distinguished undergraduate performance , I chose to work , upon graduation , as a teacher at the Department of English of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my teaching practice , I attach significant importance to modifying the monotonous conventional English teaching strategies widely employed by the generation of my teachers . I introduced original English movies , classroom debates , mini-plays and other forms of teaching into my classroom to change the conventional passivity in the students ' acquisition of English knowledge . In addition , I endeavor to gain insights into the student ' learning psychology from in-class and off-class communications with them so as to bring something new for each lesson . Frankly , I should attribute all my creativities to the enlightenments that I received from the Basic Training Program and from the self-study of many Western works on education that I read under the influence of the Program . <p> Out of my four-year teaching career , I have developed a heartfelt love for this profession . For my professional dedication and for my innovative teaching , I have been awarded a succession of honors that endow me with a strong sense of pride and achievement . Those honors include highest prizes for many pedagogical contests of young teachers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodied in the publication of a series of English textbooks like An Introductory Course of English Grammar for College Students and Reading , Writing and Translation Skills for Students of English Majors . I participated in the construction of the " Question Database of National Band IV English Proficiency Test of College Students Majoring in English " and have been invited to mark the English test papers of the National University Entrance Examination and the National Band IV &amp; VI English Proficiency Test of College Students Majoring in English . In addition , I was responsible for organizing the First English Speech Contest for College Students of Hubei Province and the participants from my university won second prize under my direction . <p> Nevertheless , as I delve deeper into my work , I have become increasingly aware that the status quo of Chinese education has much to be desired . The relatively backward education concepts and teaching methodologies have made it inevitable that Chinese education as a whole remains out of pace with the overall international education development . On the macro level , the existing Chinese education theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education has made considerable headway in China , it essentially remains another form of test-oriented education instead of becoming the true Internet education in the Western sense . On the personal level , I have encountered some practical problems in my teaching experience and although I can find ready solutions to some of them by consulting relevant works by Western educators , I am convinced that the most serious problems can be worked out only via a more systematic study program . Under such circumstances , to pursue an advanced degree in education becomes a necessary condition for me if I were to seek further , more fruitful breakthroughs in my future teaching career and in my research in educational methodology . <p> In the rapidly developing 21st century , conventional mode of education , like most other aspects of social life , has come under great impact in terms of its concepts and its strategies . The pursuit for higher levels of educational development has largely transformed the educational value orientation of the general public . The educational model that is centered on the cognitive and intellectual instruction has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivation of well-developed personality and to the ontological status of the individual in education . Such issues as the internal studies of education science , scientific decision-making in education , and meta-education have also been increasingly emphasized upon . There have also been innovations in educational research methodology . The tendency has been to combine modern technology with humanistic research categories and with naturalistic research categories , and to organically integrate qualitative descriptions with quantitative descriptions . It is also important to carry out educational experimentations in which educational predictions are complemented by educational feedbacks . Both the complexity of education and the complexity of human individuals have made the comprehensive application of diverse educational approaches necessary . Those new horizons are what fascinate me . <p> The reason why I apply for the University of Massachusetts at Amberst is that it is the first state university with a time-honored history . The School of Education in this university is quite prominent among its counterparts in the field . I am particularly attracted by the School 's powerful pedagogical resource , vibrant intellectual atmosphere and a comprehensive curriculum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology or Educational Psychology , both of which enjoy unparalleled academic reputation in the world . My application for Instructional Technology is motivated by my strong interest in the application of modern science and technology , especially the information technology represented by the Internet , in the field of education and in the nature of a series of revolutionary changes resulting thereof . Instructional Technology is a new discipline that has emerged as a result of the rapid development of modern communication technology since the late 20th century . It has tremendous potential for development and commercial application . <p> As for my motive in selecting Educational Psychology as another possible area of specialization in my degree program , it is my long-cherished interest that primarily counts . On the other hand , all the accomplished educators since the 1960 's have been well-versed in psychology . Almost every important new educational theory is derived psychological findings in one way or another so that educational psychology has subsequently developed into a fundamental subject for the science of education . The tendency in the 21st century is to emphasize on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology will be attached greater importance . In Instructional Technology , I would like to focus on the following studies : how to improve educational efficiency by applying research results from natural sciences and engineering technology ; how to explore the combination and coordination of pedagogical contents and to improve teaching methodology by exploiting the theoretical findings from psychology and educational science concerning the process of teaching and learning . In Educational Psychology , I will concentrate on applied cognition and development , creative education , personality structure and individual differences and other related subjects . <p> For me , to pursue an advanced degree in education in the United States is not so much a challenge as an opportunity . At present , major reforms are being introduced into virtually every important aspect of Chinese society . The field of education especially calls for comprehensive reforms . The United States occupies an absolutely leading position in the present-day world in education . It is my conviction that , in the United States , advanced educational theories , technologies and information will facilitate me immensely in the achievement of remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional in the field of education . This will not only bring my patriotic fervor into reality but also make my life more meaningful and rewarding . 
@@42231203 @2231203/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> How to Write a Business Letter - Sample and Tips <p> A business letter is a formal means of communication between two people , a person and a corporation , or two corporations . Business letters differ from personal letters because they follow very strictly set rules for composition . Many people are intimidated by the prospect of writing to strict guidelines , however business letters are nothing to be afraid of . They are too useful a tool to be stigmatized by the public . <p> Before you begin writing , answer the following questions : <p> 1 . What is my purpose in writing this letter/memo/report ? 2 . What does my reader want or need to know to understand my message ? 3 . Have I answered important questions and provided the necessary information for the reader ? 4 . Did I accomplish my purpose ? 5 . Have I included boring , confusing , or distracting information ? 6 . What do I want the reader to do when he or she is done reading this ? 7 . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included all the information necessary for the reader to take this action ? <p> DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS LETTER <p> A business letter serves the main purpose of communication between two companies , or it is a method to talk to different people within a business . <p> PURPOSE OF A BUSINESS LETTER <p> The purpose for business writings is to inform readers of information you want to get across or possibly persuade the readers to do something . <p> THE 7 C ' s OF BUSINESS WRITING <p> Most problems with business letters are they are either hard to understand or very long and drawn out . One solution that many writers use to correct this problem is to double check the writing to make sure it follows the seven C 's of business writing . The seven C 's are : <p> Clear <p> Concise <p> Correct <p> Courteous <p> Conversational <p> Convincing <p> Complete <p> If you as a writer are able to effectively do all or part of these seven guidelines , then your paper will be on its way to being a good business letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing you need to make sure of when writing a business plan is to make sure that you are not wasting the readers time . There are two questions to make sure that you are not wasting their time and they are , " why am I writing " and " what do I want to achieve . " If you are able to answer theses two questions then , then you writing will be a third of what it would have been if you as a writer just sat down and started to write . It is a good thing that your letter is short because that way you are getting straight to the point of what you want you readers to know . <p> COMMON TYPES OF BUSINESS LETTERS <p> There are many different types of business letters that a person can write to achieve different things . The key to writing a letter that will achieve what you want is to know what type of letter you are writing . The different types of letters are : acknowledgement , adjustment , complaint , inquiry , order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter is meant to thank the reader for something they did for you in the office . It could simply be saying thanks for receiving something the reader sent or maybe thanking them for their help with something . This type of letter is not required in a business environment , but it is appreciated . <p> Adjustment Letter = This letter should be used in response to a written complaint against someone or something . The purpose of it is to inform the reader that actions are being taken against the wrong doing as well as it serves as a legal document acknowledging the complaint . <p> Complaint Letter = The complaint letter is much like the adjustment letter except no wrong doing as taken place . Instead , this letter is just to let the reader know that an error as been found and needs to be corrected as soon as possible . Once again , this letter is a legal document letting the reader know that something is being done to correct the problem . <p> Inquiry Letter = An inquiry letter is written as a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by someone . The object of the inquiry letter is to get the object or material requested in the letter . <p> Order Letter = Order letters are exactly as they sound , they are used to order material that is running low and will be needed soon . This type of letter is commonly known as a PO ( purchase order ) . This letter is also a legal document showing a transaction between a business and a vendor . <p> Response Letter = A response letter is also exactly how it sounds . It is a letter written in response to another letter received by someone . The objective of this type of letter is to fulfill the request made by the person you are writing this letter to . <p> BUSINESS WRITING CHECKLIST <p> Once you have completed your business letter , there is a checklist that you can go through in order to make sure you letter is up to par . The basic idea of the checklist is to make sure the letter is : short , simple , strong , and sincere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these qualities , then there is a good chance you have written an effective business letter . 
@@42231204 @2231204/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Information Technology <p> My purpose in writing this essay is to impress upon you my very carefully considered professional , as well as personal , reasons for applying to your school and , thereby , to convince you of my likely superior future value to the field should you admit me to your excellent school . I am applying for admission to the Ph.D . Program in Management Science at M.I.T. with a concentration in Information Technologies ( I.T. ) . <p> I have always believed that education in itself is the most satisfying pursuit , a value instilled by my mother , herself a teacher for many years . Along the way I have learned to focus that value and match it closely to my increasing experience and desire to work on the current , most advanced issues in my field . <p> I have two reasons for making the decision to apply for Ph.D . study . First , I want to become a professor in order to do advanced research in my field . Secondly , I want to develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these types of activities , research and mentoring , have already given me substantial satisfaction . <p> I am choosing to apply to schools in a foreign country for admission to a Ph.D . program in order to benefit from those programs and those scholars in my particular chosen field and to receive guidance in the advanced research that I want to pursue . <p> The chosen program of study in I.T . requires professors who can teach and supervise research in these areas . This field at that level is little developed in my own country ( China ) . It is not a part of most university business school programs and it is seldom applied in practice . If I eventually want to work in China and have a role in developing this field there myself , I feel that it would be wise to learn theory and best practice from the experts . A second very important reason for choosing to study abroad is the opportunity to actively research any ideas and issues that naturally arise during the academic period . The close relationship and even joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available but far superior in the U.S.A. <p> I have decided that the Sloan School of Management is the school where I would have the best opportunity to pursue my objectives , receive the best guidance and benefit the most . First , the entire Universitys focus on bridging the gap between the academic program and industry by joining research skills with issues of practicing managers reflects my own devotion to implementing my ideas with practical advances . During my course of study , I would hope to work with Dr. Wanda J. Orlikowski whose own work in I.T . I greatly admire . I specifically want to know more about information flows and resource management and , ultimately , how managers evaluate that information in decision-making systems in different environments . Then I want to go on to work on developing technical support for real-time decision making . <p> There are several sources for my keen interest . One source is my past work experience in the computer industry , beginning in China as salesman , then starting my own business in network design and installation , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-class computer company in the U.S.A. I have a solid six years of experience in this field . It also should be said that some of my questions in this specialized topic specifically have come out of my experiences in two very different cultures . Traveling this career path has included education in both China and the U.S.A. and understanding the different approaches to management . Then a third source of my interest is my team and small working group experience in the U.S. <p> The above identified influences gave rise to my focus on decision-making for future research . One of the important processes that I observed was the large variation in quality of management decisions . Especially during periods of major workplace change , including restructuring , I observed markedly poor decision-making . Those observations particularly sparked my interest in decision-making pertaining to improving the economy of labor and other resources . <p> During my six years of experience in the I.T . industry , I have learned to make decisions based on a combination of reason and practical experience . This approach has enabled me to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , it was this combination of reason or theory paired with implementation and the reinforcement of the two that has led to my learning and professional satisfaction . <p> I have demonstrated this practice of following up ideas with practical results in my now extensive work experience as a Systems Engineer . My work has been , and is , productive . I alone , or in a major team role , produced advances in software . I designed and implemented both the On-Line ROM Flash Utility for Microsoft Windows and Linux on Compaq/HP Enterprise-Level Proliant Servers and also the PCI-X Driver on Open UNIX8 for PCI-X Capable Proliant Servers . One of my inventions is now being reviewed by a Compaq/HP committee for patent filing . <p> Truly great decision-making requires another element . It needs to be joined by equally good communication skills . The power of good communication skills paired with good decision-making skills in making for a winning team has impressed me in various areas of life . One who excels in this area and whom I admire is Lakers coach Phil Jackson . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one challenging situation after another . His real-time decision-making is outstanding . I will have this ideal before me in my own work as I hope to produce a winning team too in the future . <p> I already have experience and knowledge gained from working on earlier teams in long-term Research &amp; Development projects in this very field that I want to pursue further . I know the satisfaction and pride that these past achievements have given me and also the desire to produce additional advances . In all my various past roles in the I.T . industry I have faced challenges that I learned to resolve . I know that there will be challenges in every situation and I feel very strongly that I am prepared for those in the Sloan School of Management . <p> I believe that the combination of continuing desire for self-improvement , increased learning , combined with my insistence on approaching problems with both reason and practical application , and thus to lay new paths with new ideas , is my defining character . I further believe that this character will take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in I.T . At the same time , I strongly hope that you will recognize my solid experience in the computer field , my U.S.-earned M.S. degree in Computer Science and my strong motivation compelling me to leave an established , personally-owned business as clear indications of probable future success , and admit me to the Sloan School of Management .

" The best way to give advice to other people is to find out what they want and then advise them how to attain it . " Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the opinion expressed above . Support your point of view with reasons and/or examples from your own experience , observations , or reading . <p> I agree that the best way to give advice to other people is to find out what they want and then give them advice about how to attain it . It means that we must understand the person first then give our opinions to him just as reference . <p> First , you must find out what the person 's real thought and intention ; otherwise , you may give wrong advice or the advice which is nonsense to the person .

My other friend told me this previous fiend 's real intention , when he said that his wife did not like to live in other person 's apartment , was to buy my apartment in a discount . <p> Furthermore , only when you find out what the person 's real intention is , you can decide if you should give advice or not . I give you the same person 's example . When he kept calling me that he did not earn enough money when he worked in his home town and asked my advice . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it with my own wage . His wage is just one-tenth of mine . So , I give my advice that he could come to my company . I help him to come to my company . Now , His real intention was revealed : He wanted to live the same living standard as I was or share the money , which I previously earned , with him . If I could really catch his intention at the very beginning . I am sure I will not give him any advice . <p> In conclusion , if you want to give advice to someone , you must know his real intention first . Only in this way , you will give good advice to him . And you must keep in mind that sometimes it is better not to give advice at all .

In any letter , you should include <p> * date , * name and position of the recipient as well as the organization 's name and address , * salutation ( use the recipient 's first name only if you would do so on the phone ) , * body text , * closing and signature , and * a method of contacting you .

The " encl. : " line tells the reader that you have included an additional piece of documentation with the letter . The " CC " line tells the reader that you have also sent the letter to a secondary audience . <p> If appropriate , you can also include a " Subject : " line between the address and the salutation . Margins and Text Spacing <p> When you use the block form to write a business letter , all the information is typed flush left , with one-inch margins all around . These margins can be adjusted slightly if you need to fit the letter onto one page , or if the page breaks create an awkward flow of information . <p> First provide the date , then skip a line and include the name , position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line before the salutation . Then write the body of your letter as illustrated here , with no indentation at the beginning of paragraphs . Skip one line between paragraphs . Skip two lines before each heading within the body of the letter . <p> Do not double space the body text of your letter . Using Headings <p> If your letter is more than two or three paragraphs , including headings can be helpful for your reader--be sure to use headings that capture the key topic of that section and capitalize each major word of the heading . Bolding or underlining the heading will help the visual design of your letter . <p> It is also helpful to include the date and page number in the footer of a letter that is more than one page long .

XX Universitys Ph.D . program in Electrical Engineering is the perfect fit for my aptitudes and for my future career as a university professor and professional researcher , and it is my sincere desire to continue my studies at your honorable university . <p> At the beginning of my university studies I was searching for direction . I tried many different areas including electric motor control design , and I conducted research on micro-motor drive controls . I learned to develop a sound , methodological approach to control circuit design . This area was underdeveloped in China , and initially it seemed that I had found my focus . <p> After graduating from university , I went to work for XX , one of the best and most progressive companies in China . As an engineer , I learned the latest technologies in micro-processing systems , personal responsibility and teamwork . But the longer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that the work was repetitive and techniques were simply copied from others there was little room for innovation .

Using C language and Matlab , I worked on flight system simulations , automatic drive modeling and system identification , but as I studied and worked at XX , I realized that what I was learning was too limited and out of date . I became even more determined to study abroad . <p> Currently I am working towards my Masters Degree in XX , where I have finally found my motivating field of interest .

All of these events have only deepened my interest in system and control . <p> I am working on my thesis in the field of the application of output regulation methods to altitude control and disturbance rejection of spacecraft . I have just passed my yearly oral presentation .

I want to use my strong research abilities , my professional knowledge , and my deep motivation to find progressive solutions . I would also like to apply the current nonlinear control theories to practical systems such as spacecraft control , ship path following , robot trajectory control etc . My education has given me strong motivation and a clear sense of purpose while my diverse experiences have broadened my horizons and stimulated my mind with an intense desire to succeed .

This practice is effective because it not only sells products but also helps people feel better about themselves . " <p> Many advertisements do indeed use attractive models or celebrities to entice consumers into buying the products that are being promoted . Who would not like to look like the beautiful models that are depicted enjoying the product ? Who would not like to be like a Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods ? To a certain extent , buying products to emulate the persons shown in the advertisements can make a person feel better about him or herself . But this type of advertisement can be a double-edged sword - when the product does not make the person " be like " the person in the advertisement , there can be disappointment and disillusionment with the product . <p> Marketing departments have long known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade consumers to buy a product . Some customers may actually believe that buying and using the product will make them " be like " the people featured in the ad . For other consumers , there is probably at least some subconscious reaction that causes them to believe that they will in fact assume some of the characteristics of the person depicted in the advertisement . Consumers with a lower sense of self-esteem are more likely to buy a product based on the motivation that they will become like someone else . <p> Proof of this marketing axiom can be found by simply looking at advertisements from around the world . People featured in advertisements are almost always good-looking , healthy and physically fit . Marketers are savvy enough , and enough market research has proven that , consumers are motivated to buy by advertisements featuring attractive models . Even advertisements that are aimed at the older people of a population will feature attractive older people .

Young women in particular may buy cosmetics or clothing advertised by beautiful models in an attempt to look the same as them . Young men may buy athletic shoes or apparel in an attempt to perform athletically in the same way that the person featured in the advertisement plays . These people may then become further discouraged when they use or wear the product and find out that they are the same person that they were before . Buying the product has n't changed anything . <p> There are others that may derive a certain sense of satisfaction over the fact that they wear the same underwear as some beautiful models or that they drink the same soft drink as Britney Spears . These people in general already have a good sense of who they are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . For these people , the purchase of the product is not so much as an image enhancer ; it is more of a form of self-expression . Perhaps drinking a Pepsi-Cola makes them feel younger or wearing Nike shoes makes them feel more athletic , no matter how old or inactive they may be in reality . In this manner , it is possible that advertising can make people feel better about themselves . <p> Marketing and advertising absolutely must appeal to people in one way or another to be successful . Research has shown that using celebrities and attractive people can motivate consumers to purchase a product . In whatever manner , advertisers hope that they actually can make people feel better about themselves , because that can help foster repeat purchases of a product . Ultimately , whether an advertisement makes a person feel better about him or herself depends on the individual and how they perceive themselves as compared to the particular advertisement in question .

Much of what happens in government takes place " behind the scenes " , not necessarily in full view of the cameras in the meeting place .

To merely televise governmental proceedings will not affect society unless society watches these events . <p> Society can certainly benefit from the television coverage of certain governmental proceedings .

This question requires you to make an inference , based on Eisensteins argument , regarding her view of the attitudes of the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph of the passage notes Eisensteins argument that women neither wholly accepted nor rejected the dominant ideology of the time , and that they modified this and other ideologies to suit their needs . Choice A is incorrect . The dominant ideology is one among several ideologies that Eisenstein argues were adapted and modified by working women ; the passage does not suggest that Eisenstein believed that working women resented that ideology or considered it degrading . Choice B is incorrect because Eisensteins argument is that women took aspects of several available ideologies and modified them ; there is no suggestion that any one ideology was preferred over others . Choice C can be eliminated because according to the passage , it is Tentler , not Eisenstein , who argues that working conditions increased the attractiveness of the dominant ideology . Choice E is not correct . Eisenstein argues that domestic work tended to isolate women from one another ; there is no indication in the passage that the women themselves believed the dominant ideology was responsible for this . <p> 3 . This question asks you to identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best answer is C. The first paragraph presents Eisenstein theory , then makes note of Tentlers opposing views , then continues with further explication of Eisensteins argument . Choice A can be eliminated because the paragraph discusses a certain historical development , the evolution of working womens values , but it does not make prediction about future developments . Choice B is not correct because the paragraph is not concerned with contrasting definitions of any term . Choice D and E are not correct because the paragraph does not discuss a tentative proposal that requires evaluation or a controversy that calls for resolution . <p> 4 . To answer this question you must decide which answer would best provide the sort of information that the author feels is lacking in Eisensteins study . The authors critique of Eisensteins argument is found primarily in the second paragraph . Choice B is the best answer because the author points out that Eisensteins study is flawed in that it relies on sources that are not representative of the average female worker . An analysis of writings by typical female wage earners would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eisensteins study already focuses on labor organizers ; it is unlikely that the author feels that even more attention to this group is necessary . Choice C is not correct because the passage does not suggest that three were disagreements among social and political groups as to the definition of the dominant ideology . Choices D and E are incorrect because Eisensteins study is not concerned with the interaction between socialism and feminism , nor with labors particular role in the introduction of women into the workforce . <p> 5 . This question asks you to identify the primary purpose of the passage as a whole . The best answer is D. The passage discusses two hypothesis concerning zonation of mangrove forests . Choice A can be eliminated because the passage presents as a viable hypothesis the idea that mangrove zonation may be caused by adaptation to salinity . Choice B is incorrect because the passage is concerned with the causes of zonation patterns , not simple with a description of those patterns . Both C and E contradict information that is presented in the passage . <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage about early research on mangrove forests . That research is discussed in the first paragraph . Choice B is the best answer . Early research on mangrove forests is characterized as having produced descriptions of species distribution from shore to land . Such a distribution is described in the first sentence of the passage as " zonal . " Choice A is not correct . Early research described mangrove distribution from shore to land . This implies a regular pattern of distribution , not a random one . Choices C and D are not correct because there is no indication in the passage that early studies of mangrove forests were concerned with the plants chronological development or with the reclassification of species . Choice E is incorrect because the passage does not say that the research in question did anything except describe species distribution . <p> 7 . Here you are asked to make an inference based on information that is stated in the passage . Note that the best answer will refer to a situation where Daviss paradigm does NOT apply . Choice E is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time , thus extending the shore . A shoreline where few sediments could accumulate would be unable to develop according to such a scheme . Choice A is not correct . Davis first expressed his theory of " land-building " in his study of Florida mangrove forests . Thus his paradigm presumably applies to the shoreline of those forests . Choices B and C are incorrect because the passage states that areas with weak currents and weak tidal energies are areas where land formation will progress according to Davis paradigm . Choice D is not correct because Davis paradigm describes the " land-building " process of mangroves , so a shoreline that had been extended by that process would fall within the paradigm . <p> 8 . Here you are asked to make an inference about the likely view of the author of the passage . Note that the best answer must be a statement that the author would most likely judge to be INCORRECT . Choice C is best . The author points out that while mangroves normally thrive in highly saline regions , this is not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this answer , so the author would likely regard the claim made in this answer as incorrect . Choice A is incorrect because it paraphrases an assertion the author makes in the first sentence of the passage . Choice B is incorrect because it paraphrases an assertion the author makes in the last sentence of the second paragraph . Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the author would agree with this statement . Choice E is not correct . The author notes that areas with weak currents and tides are likely to be extended through land formation . Thus the author would consider the assertion made here to be correct , not incorrect . <p> 9 . This question asks you to identify which one of the five answer choices is NOT mentioned in the passage as a benefit associated with backward integration . The best answer is B. The passage does not indicate how backward integration affects the profit margins on sales of components by independent suppliers . Choices A , C , and E are mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incorrect because the passage indicates that backward integration is a way of having a reliable source of necessary components . <p> 10 . This question asks you to identify information presented in the passage about independent suppliers of product components . Choice A is the best answer . The passage asserts that independent supplies making the same components as assemblers may not share technological innovations with assemblers . Choices B , C , D , and E can be eliminated because there is no indication in the passage as assemblers experience improved profit margins , lower their prices , suffer financial difficulties , or stop developing new versions of the component . <p> 11 . This question asks you to choose the statement that best describes the function of the last paragraph of the passage . The best answer is B. At the end of the third paragraph , the author indicates that assemblers benefit from contracting with , rather than owning , independent suppliers . In the last paragraph , however , the author indicates that contracting with independent suppliers can itself present problems . Thus the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third paragraph . Choice A is not the correct answer because the passage makes several points about backward integration , but does not present a central argument about this topic . Choice C is not the correct answer because the final paragraph qualifies rather than supports an argument made in the third paragraph about contracting with independent suppliers . Choices D and E are incorrect because the final paragraph does not identify questions or present a specific example . <p> 12 . This question asks you to identify information presented in the passage about the relationship between profits and investments for producers of technologically advanced components . The best answer is D. The passage indicates that the high investments required to develop technologically advanced components . Choice A is incorrect because the passage indicates that large , not modest , investments in research and development are required . Choices B and C are incorrect because the passage indicates that profit margins for producers of technologically advanced components are low , not high as these answer choice assert . Choice E is incorrect : although the author claims that long-term contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not indicate that long-term contracts with purchasers lead to high profits for producers of technologically advanced components .

" <p> To state that the study of history is only valuable if it is relevant to our daily lives is to ignore the value that history has beyond the day-to-day activities of human beings . It would seem to be a rather shallow statement that implies that humans only live just to survive rather than planning for the futures of their children and the environment . <p> First of all , to study history is to look at a road map of human behavior that has led us to where we are today in the world . For example , the lessons learned during all of the past wars can make for more effective wartime leadership by avoiding mistakes made by past commanders . From the ancient Chinese author Sun Tzu 's book " The Art of War " , today 's military commanders and even business leaders gather valuable information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of this type of history has a value beyond the daily lives of people . It can lead to a military victory or the success of a business that directly affects what happens in the future , including the futures of those that are possibly not even born yet . <p> Another example is that by studying history , parents can help to improve the lives of their children in the future . Lessons learned by generations of their ancestors before them could help show them the way to properly raise a child . What worked for others can give guidance to the parents of today and tomorrow to make sure that children are prepared for their own futures beyond their daily lives . <p> Additionally , the study of medical advances made throughout history can be the foundation to build upon to make the medical advances of today and tomorrow to make people live longer and healthier lives . A researcher 's daily life may not be enhanced by the study of the history of the AIDS pathogen , but it could certainly bring about a profound effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control and cure the disease are found . The study of previous research over history has led to many amazing medical discoveries . To study history only to enrich one 's daily life would here again seem to be incongruous with the truth . <p> A further example of the value of the study of history beyond its effect on daily life is the treatment of the environment and the earth as a whole . Looking back to the past to see the various effects of various human behaviors on the environment can show valuable lessons on what can happen if proper precautions are not taken . The nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl have been studied to ensure that they do not happen again . Certainly the study of the effects of nuclear materials on humans and the environment provides value beyond that of the day-to-day life of people . The study of oil spills and their effects on the environment gives similar guidance on how to avoid or at least minimize the damage of an oil spill on the environment . The study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth has given birth to new laws and regulations on certain chemicals that help to preserve this valuable part of our atmosphere . All of these examples of studying history provide value far beyond its impact on the daily lives of people . <p> To be certain , there are people out there that believe that only what affects them right here and right now is important . For them , the study of history might seem to be a waste of time if it does not affect their day-to-day lives . But for countless other individuals and groups , the study of history leads to improvements in activities that have an effect reaching far into the future , beyond their daily lives . The futures of mankind and the environment depend on these types of people who have enough foresight to study history to make for a better future for everyone .

Support your views with reasons and/or examples from your own experience , observations , or reading . <p> Whether employees leave their personal lives entirely behind them when they enter the workplace has became a controversial issue since different people hold different opinion due to their respective angles . Some claim that integrating personal life with work can foster a workplace ambiance that helps everyone do a better job . Others , on the contrary , argue that employees should not allow their personal lives to interfere with their jobs . As far as I am concerned , I shall agree that employees should keep their private lives and personal activities as separate as possible from the workplace . My point of view will be strongly supported by the following three reasons . <p> In the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace with private affairs and personal activities reduces efficiency of the company . As we know , employees in a company usually have the fixed working hours .

It is even feared that the entire Chinese civilization will terminate if this deterioration continues uncurbed . However , equally astounding is the reluctance on the part of the general public to take concrete actions against this dire possibility . What is encouraging in the face of this bleak picture is that a generation of responsible young people , including myself , is making relentless efforts for the rescue of this much abused environment . In my undergraduate program at Hebei Engineering University , Tianjin , and graduate program at Beijing Technology and Business University , I have chosen to major in Environmental Engineering . Between those two programs , I had 2-year work experience ( 1997 1999 ) at Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Co. , Ltd where I was responsible for environmental monitoring and pollution control . Nevertheless , it seems that environmental protection is such an immense task that no matter what efforts we make , they never suffice .

Under such circumstances , I file this personal statement to your esteemed university under the hope of seeking more advanced trainings in the field of environmental engineering . <p> In the course of nearly a decades education and research , I have made some tentative achievements in the field of environmental engineering . My thesis , entitled Design for the Disposal Plant of the Sewage Emitted by the Printing and Dyeing Mills of ShengZe Township in Jiangsu Province , focused on the treatment of the waste water emitted by the local printing and dyeing mills by means of anaerobic-aerobic method , which was a quite advanced approach at that time . I collaborated closely with the students in my project team to formulate the design parameters , the processing procedures and other steps . In our design , 70% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95% percent BOD could be eliminated aerobically . So far , the plant has been put into use , playing a major role in the local environmental protection . My thesis , which was based on this project , was rated " Class A " , an achievement which only 3% students in the entire university could attain . <p> Another similar project in which I participated was the Sewage Disposal Workshop of Xian Brewery . In this project , the design of the anaerobic tank was the key . I conducted detailed analysis of the design parameters and the structure of the anaerobic reactor . After the debugging , it could eliminate 98% COD , an achievement up to the advanced domestic level . In the project , the ingenious design of the 3-phase separator in the anaerobic pond received national patent . <p> After graduation , I found employment with Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Co. , Ltd where I was in charge of the operation of production facilities and the monitoring and the controlling of detrimental materials in the emitted sewage .

I focused on comprehensive atmospheric evaluation , environmental chemistry , and environmental system analysis . In order to strengthen myself , I paid special attention to the study in biology , computer skills , and the relevant mathematical methods . <p> During my Masters program , I have been most interested in the monitoring of water pollutants by using biosensor . My thesis -- The Study of Amperometric Tyrosinase-Membrane Electrode Modified with Maltodextrin for Detection of Phenols is such an instance of applying the biosensor to environmental monitoring .

Currently we are cooperating with a major domestic manufacturer in analytical instruments to turn out products of this kind . The Fluid Injection System ( FIS ) we designed can realize online monitoring and the sample machine is expected to be produced within the end of this year . The entire project has been rated by the State Environmental Protection Commission as " demonstrating leading technology by both international and domestic standards . " My thesis , based on the research findings of this project , was again rated " Class A " . <p> In connection with this research project , I wrote a research paper entitled Research of Tyrosinase Biosensor for Detection of Phenols , which has been published in the Journal of Beijing Technology and Business University in January 2002 .

In addition , by carrying out a considerable amount of independent research work , I have helped him to have succeeded in applying for the project The Detection of Coli.e in Water by Means of Biosensor . Finally , I have attended " Engineering Science and Technology Forum Problems and Strategies for Urban Environment " and a number of other academic conferences .

For this , I received Scholarship for the Student of Excellence . I believe that in my future degree program , I will continue to achieve academic excellence . <p> " The earth does not belong to the human beings but the human beings belong to the earth .

The argument depends on the assumption that increased exposure to the visual arts on public television has caused a similar increase in local art-museum attendance in the past years . However , the poll that increased art-museum attendance is statistically correlated with similar increases in television viewing of visual-arts programs , does not necessarily mean that the increased television viewing of arts is the cause of the rise in museum attendance .

I tried to understand the principle underlying each chemical phenomenon and how each principle was derived . To do so , I had to understand the textbooks thoroughly and supplement my classroom education with information from the Internet , the library , the lectures and other sources . This way of learning allowed me to become familiar not only with the core courses like Physical Chemistry , Principles of Chemical Engineering , Analytical Chemistry , Inorganic Chemistry , Chemical Engineering Analysis , Calculus , etc. but also with quite courses not offered to students of majoring in chemical engineering such as Polymer Chemistry , Polymer Physics , Spectroscopy Analysis , Chromatography Analysis and Fine Chemicals Synthesis .

As part of a XX and sponsored by XX , our research would decrease environmental pollution and promote sustainable social and economic development . <p> The underlying principle behind my research was to liquefy the raw materials of wood into biomass heavy oil , with distilled water as solution . My experiments examined the effect of such factors as reaction temperature , duration , ratio of biomass/water , the chemical composition of the raw material , and catalyst on the liquefaction of wood and the productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted on an extensive scale in China , I had to formulate research plan , consult technical literature , set up the laboratory , procure necessary equipment , and fix technical problems . For example , when I found that the mechanical pressure meter on the autoclave , the main equipment of the lab , displayed low sensitivity and precision , I added an electronic one to fix the problem . <p> As a crystallization of my research findings , my research paper XX has been published by XX . In addition , the same journal XX has accepted another paper of mine entitled XX Through those researches , I have mapped out my research interests . In the broad world of chemical engineering , the knowledge I have gained is just a tiny faction and it is necessary for me to venture into the even greater world of the unknown and the unexplored . As far as biomass resources are concerned , we can use them as an important renewable resource . Through thermochemical means like pyrolysis and gasification and through biological means like fermentation , they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , even though we have been living in the shadow of global energy crisis , no effective alternatives have been unraveled .

Yet I am clearly aware the immense efforts I have to make in order to fulfill this aspiration . This constitutes the very motivation behind my present application for a Ph . D. program from the Department of Chemical Engineering of the XX University . There are some important reasons for my choosing your esteemed university . The most important reason is that its research on biobased products is one of the strongest research orientations , which perfectly matches my past research experience . Your strong faculty is also an important factor ; the 1:1.9 faculty/student ratio promises to give each student sufficient instruction and attention , allowing for close communication . Finally , your curriculum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core subjects within their own discipline but also go beyond their discipline to attend courses in other departments in order to develop a broad ken of knowledge .

I have based my decision to pursue an academic career not on purely practical reasons , but rather on my own natural interests and aptitude . My personal philosophy is that money and social status should not be pursued as life-consuming objectives and that in actuality they are the by-products of goals originating from one 's inner needs . I understand that my intellectual capacity is a gift , and I intend to use this gift to the very best of my substantial capabilities . <p> I am interested in the field of study of Organizational Behavior . In the past , I have had the experience of working in settings where the people and the corporate cultures of the companies were all different . I have found that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their organizations , depending on whether they are state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , large multinational firms , or small to medium sized foreign enterprises . One simple example is that of the ability of an employee to act independently without direct instructions from his or her boss . In many Chinese organizations , acting without direct instructions is considered a form of disrespect towards the supervisor , who is generally offended by such behavior . In my experience and research , such organizations tend to have low operating efficiency with the employees losing their innate ability to take the initiative . <p> In contrast , foreign enterprises tend to welcome employees who have the ability to make decisions on their own , though the extent to which this is true depends on whether the supervisor is a local Chinese or an expatriate . These organizations have comparatively higher operating efficiency and employees enjoy greater job satisfaction . <p> My research and observations have shown me that only a small fraction of Chinese employees are well adapted to the working methods of the foreign enterprises . Many are accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not experienced at taking on some reasonable responsibilities . What accounts for the different behaviors of these people and their organizations ? My observations and personal experience have greatly aroused my interest in studying this subject . I am interested in determining the specific factors that determine the different behaviors of employees and how they work together to form the behavior of the organization , as well as finding ways to modify such behaviors to make for a more healthy and properly functioning organization . <p> In all of the various fields that I have worked in , such as international trade , marketing and office administration , I have found that the most important factor in successful businesses lies in how the business is able to exploit its resources to meet the needs of its target markets . Human resources ultimately make possible the full utilization of the other resources , even including that of the most advanced and powerful new technologies . The essence of success at leveraging resources is managing people and their behavior . With the introduction and development of the idea of employee empowerment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more people throughout the organization rather than just a few senior level managers . I would very much like to study these trends - what exactly are the roles that employees and employers play in modern organizations ? What impact do these changes in organizational behaviors have on the social and economic development of countries ? <p> In China , there are currently no outstanding professors in the field of organizational behavior . Textbooks are translated from other languages rather than written by native Chinese . My goal is to become the most outstanding professional scholar studying and researching Organizational Behavior in China . With China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , there will be tremendous changes and challenges in organizational structures . These changes must be studied and thoroughly researched so that successful practices can be identified . Models can then be developed to guide future Organizational Behavior practices in China . One of my goals is to write THE authoritative textbook on Organizational Behavior in China . <p> I have chosen to pursue my Ph.D . abroad , in the field of Organization Behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , study and research of management and organizational behavior in particular is much better developed and is at a much more advanced level than the rest of the world . I believe that studying in America can not only broaden my vision in this field but also help me to find ways of thinking and solving problems . In China , research in the social sciences has not progressed as quickly as research into the natural sciences and economic development . I grew up in an environment where there was only one right answer to the question , and that was dictated to us by the teacher or the government . People were not encouraged to question the way things were , and often would have to pay a price for thinking or acting differently . Of course , practices have been changing with the opening-up policy and governmental and economic reforms . But the opportunity for overseas study in the United States will not only provide a better research and study environment but also the rare chance to see the world and China through a different paradigm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many opportunities for research for various projects . In my MBA program , all of my courses required written papers and presentations , such as market research and business plans . I thoroughly researched every written paper to find the most up to date information with a tenacious pursuit of accuracy . During my undergraduate studies majoring in the English language , I not only learned the language but the culture and logic behind the language itself . This understanding has helped me to unlock the sometimes-obscure meanings in written work to get at the essence of the data and how it applies to my particular case . <p> I have developed a study plan for successfully completing your Ph.D . program . First , I will aspire to grasp and thoroughly understand research methodology to lay a solid foundation for conducting serious academic research . Secondly , I will complete the basic courses in organizational behavior and related fields while conducting some elementary research . Third , I will study the present theories and practices in the field while observing the development of organizational behavior in China . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to contribute innovative theories leading to effective practices . <p> I believe that my love for education is due mainly to the fact that I was born into a teaching family . Both of my parents and my elder sister are teachers . I embraced the love of learning at an early age , excelling as early as elementary school when I was chosen as one of only three students admitted to the best middle school in our province . My role model and inspiration has always been my father . My father was born into a very poor family and was the only child to survive while all of his brothers and sisters died of disease and malnutrition . My grandmother ( over the objections of my grandfather ) insisted that my father go to school rather than to work in the fields . Since then , he has continuously studied the agricultural field for years and wrote the first ever laws and regulations in China regulating the agricultural economy while simultaneously earning the respect and appreciation of high-level government officials in the ministry . My father has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a female in China such a pursuit is usually discouraged , if not impossible . His will to survive against all odds and his never-ending pursuit of education have given me the inspiration to follow his example and never let adversity stand in the way of achieving excellence to the fullest of my abilities . <p> " The Confessions " by Rousseau stated that the least knowledge acquired by humans is knowledge about humans . Knowing yourself and fellow mankind are extremely important in life as well as in management .

Now , on the verge of completing my undergraduate program , I again and again ask myself two questionswhat is the purpose of my life and how can I be constant to my purpose ? The answers seem not too difficult to come . As I have chosen to specialize in Management Information Science as an undergraduate , it is natural that I continue to tap my potential in this field and develop myself into a leading specialist on this subject in the future . As to how to be constant to this purpose , the answer is equally simply , to pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . As an indication of my constancy , I have relinquished an opportunity offered by my university for a direct graduate program . Instead , I am determined to apply for your esteemed university . I believe that your university has much better faculty , research facilities , and academic environment , all of which will be vital to my academic success . <p> At present , I am a senior student at XX University , majoring in MIS at the Department of Management Information Systems ( enjoying a leading academic reputation in China ) , School of Economics and Management . In this key polytechnic university of the country , my persistent efforts to improve my academic performance has paid offI was merely average in the first semester as a freshman but now I am ranked top third in my class . Apart from my perseverance , my deep love for this specialty and my incessant perfecting of study methods have contributed to this improved performance , which has further convinced me of my unmistakable potential in this area . As a scientific discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behavioral science , computer science and communication science . This interdisciplinary nature underlies my deep interest in MIS . Through the study of MIS , I have not only learned useful knowledge in a great variety of fields but also have come to the realization concerning human knowledgethat man can solve his target problems most effectively and efficiently through a comprehensive application of knowledge in related fields . <p> An important experience of learning came when I studied the course The Principle and the Application of Database . In order to create various diagrams in the database , various limitations of the Normal Form had to be considered in order to avoid redundancy and inconsistency in data . The verbal descriptions of those forms were easy to comprehend but only when I actually started to design the database did I really realize that difficulty to create the diagrams that could both conform to the requirements of the Normal Form and satisfy the needs of the clients and the database operations . I have always tried to effect a parallel development between the study of theoretical knowledge and the improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course project of The Principle and the Application of Database , I compiled a database application program that could help a power supplier calculate various statistics regarding the consumption of electricity and the payment of fees by different consumers . In the course project of Computer Network and Application , I designed a plan for the installation of a certain companys LAN , including the procurement of the necessary equipment and the laying of lines . Such hands-on opportunities have always enabled me to discover the disparities between theory and practice and to rectify my incorrect understandings . My teacher made very positive comments on the results that I achieved . <p> As a new scientific discipline , Management information systems was developed in the 1980 " s in the United States and it has been playing an increasingly important role in all the fields it has been applied to , greatly enhancing the efficiency of management and reducing cost . While the United States boasts of very advanced theories and technologies in MIS , we have to acknowledge so far China has considerably lagged behind the international standards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate and manage information effectively between different functional departments of an enterprise has led to low-efficiency operation and to low customer satisfaction , which has further affected the development of the country as a whole . However , present-day underdevelopment itself also implies greater space for future development . The introduction of advanced information management technology will significantly improve the operation efficiency of Chinese enterprises . My greatest wish in applying for undertaking a Masters program in MIS at your esteemed university is to command the latest knowledge in this field and bring this knowledge back to my country to facilitate the popularization and development of MIS in China . <p> In my future degree program , I expect to receive systematic education and training in MIS , with special emphasis on relevant information management technology . In this regard , I have a good foundation . I have done some coursework in E-Commerce at XX University and I designed a simulation e-commerce website ( which was put on show in my class as Excellent Design ) . I have developed a basic understanding of how e-commerce is operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management such as the design of the order management system , logistics distribution information system , online payment system , network security and maintenance . I believe that the study of those issues and many other related technical issues and management patterns will comprehensively cover the knowledge of MIS and at the same time enable me to concentrate on specific areas . In my future studies , I will try to obtain as many technical practices as possible to extend my study method of learning through practice as MIS is essentially an applied science . <p> I deem myself well-prepared for your well-respected program . Apart from the sound academic foundation I have laid in my specialty , I am most proud of my practical ability to perform specific projects and apply management . In addition to my well-received performance in the project designs in such courses as E-Commerce , The Principle and the Application of Database , Software Development Tools and Computer Network and Application , I have also participated , as part of my extracurricular activities , in the development of MIS for the XX Company in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business procedures and for the optimization of the companys existing system . For my important contributions , I received warm praises from both my teacher and the relevant users . At another companyXX Precision Equipment Co . Ltd , I took part in the project to develop the management system of the customer relationship . I was specifically in charge of developing three subsystemssales automation , marketing management , and customer service and support and I applied Sybase Power Builder and Microsoft SQL Server for system setup . The development of my management skills came from my experiences of working as a student leader in the Students Union and of leading a team in our universitys Contest of Simulated Enterprise Competition in which we won the Best Creativity Award . Those experiences enhanced my decision-making skills , teamwork , and creativity apart from my legal awareness , market analysis , human resource management and overall coordination . <p> In this age of increasing digitalization , the collection , communication and management of information has become an integral part of an enterprises competitiveness . I feel lucky that my education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIS in China and that my future will be as promising as the application of this science in China .

Before the planting season , I could see the leafless remnants of burnt trees still standing . The burning of pristine forests destroys both the habitats and countless species which depend on and thrive in these habitats . The few remaining bare , scarred trees silently convey the cost to our natural resources of pursuing our economic interests . Some forests are preserved by government edict issued in response to international pressure . But most of this preservation occurs alongside major roads not to protect the ecosystem , but to prevent disturbance to ranches and farms along the highways .

I was able to use tools that I acquired in my economics and environmental studies classes . In general , logging creates economic benefits at the local level . It increases employment in the timber industry and subsequently in related non-timber industries ; it also benefits local government . <p> Yet , it has great deleterious environmental effects : soil erosion , watershed destruction , and a decrease in specie diversity due to loss of habitat .

This emphasis also tries to consider non-economic values , such as aesthetic pleasure and specie diversity . It also discusses tools like GIS and system analysis that apply to environmental management . Because of my interest in GIS , economics , and environmental studies , this emphasis suits me perfectly . Furthermore , the interdisciplinary approach of the School of Environmental Studies attracts me since it combines social sciences strengths with a knowledge of the natural sciences necessary to protect and preserve the environment . <p> After completing my masters program , I would like to continue my education and obtain a Ph.D . in natural resource management .

What are the underlying workings of cells ? It was these initial curiosities that led me into this magnetic world of biology . It is my unchanging aspiration to explore and to discover the mysteries of the inner workings of life in the micro-cosmos represented by cell and molecules as a physician , as a biologist and as a medical professional . I am delighted to find that I am getting closer and closer to the point of realizing this aspiration of mine . <p> I come from Ningxa Province , the most impoverished area in Chinas West . The pathetically backward medical conditions there spurred me to become an accomplished physician who could make contributions in alleviating the pains of the local residents . With exceptional scholastic efforts , I distinguished myself in my region which was equally backward in education level and entered the Department of Clinical Medicine , Peking University of Medical Science , one of the most prestigious universities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During my undergraduate studies , with perseverance and efficacious learning strategies , I managed to reach No. 2 ranking in my class in terms of scholastic aptitudes , with especially outstanding performance in the courses in my specialty . <p> However , during my clinical internships , I discovered that the theoretical knowledge I learned from textbooks was often incongruent with , and sometimes even diametrically opposite to what I actually discovered . This made me develop a skeptical mind in academic research . In the project Helicobacter pylori induces the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 in human gastric epithelial carcinoma cell line BGC-823 , I found in the majorities of my experiments that , in screening positive recombinants , the rate of detecting positive clones was not as high as was imagined . Sometimes , bacterial colonies produced through self-correlation outnumber those of correlation products , which meant that the workload in screening clones would be significant increased . I think that I will always carry with me this spirit of skepticism in my academic research because it gives me courage to cast doubt on established viewpoints and to probe into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning habit of mine is the problem-oriented mentality . Having participated in some simple research work , I discovered that the process of recombinant DNA screening was overcomplicated and inefficient . To solve the problem , I consulted relevant technical literature and conducted repeated experiments , the result of which was the development of the Rapid Screening Recombinations by Clone Groups , a much simpler and more efficient method to screen recombinant DNA . This initial research success , however insignificant in retrospection , gave me a strong sense of pride . Under the instruction of Prof. Wang XX , I completed my thesis The Effect of Angiotension II on the Heme Oxygenase Gene Expression in Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats . <p> As I delved deeper into my studies , I realized that clinical medicine at its present technical level faces some problems that are difficult to solve , such as the etiology and the mechanism of diabetes , tumor , and cardiovascular diseases . As far as I am concerned , the ultimate solution to those problems lies in Basic Medicine , which allows us to observe the changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spare time , I further consulted a large quantity of technical literature and textbooks on the techniques of cell and molecular biology and decided that I would attempt at research projects in Basic Medicine , those projects that were virtually impossible for clinical doctors . Therefore , immediately after my undergraduate program and exempted from an entrance examination , I embarked on a Masters program in the Cell and Molecular Biology specialty at the School of Basic Medicine , Peking Union Medical College . <p> I am very proud of my academic performance during my Masters Program , which has been more impressive than my undergraduate performance . In all the specialty courses I have become the top student in my class . My solid foundation in theoretical knowledge has provided me with a sound basis to expand my research horizons and to search for innovative research methodologies . My labwork focuses on the interplay between proteins and I have participated in three major research projects : a ) study on the proteasome subunits ( which are closely related to protein degradation in the Ubiquitin/Proteasome ) and catalytic zymoprotein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the common characteristics of proteins that interact with Ubc9 in the proteasome-conjugating system by means of information science ; and c ) the establishment of SH2 Protein Library ( which has applied for patent from the State Patent Office ) . I will write a couple of research papers based on the findings of those projects and hopefully publish them in some leading academic journals in those fields . <p> Difficulties also abound in my studies . I have found that although the bi-hybridization system of the yeast is an effective and efficient way to analyze the interaction between proteins , it has its limitations . For instance , the system is located within the nucleus , in which reactions like ? ? ? and the formation of disulfide bond are impossible . For another instance , there is the problem of " pseudo positive " expression . Therefore , how to transfer , with more perfect techniques , the bi-hybridization system of the yeasts to organisms with eucaryon ( which are higher than saccharomycettes ) so as to make the processing of proteins , their refinement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results constitutes one of our urgent tasks . On the other hand , to construct the chart of yeast protein interactions and to undertake molecular biological studies related to pathology by exploiting the properties of the genes within the yeast that bear close resemblance to human genes will also be a fascinating field of study . The United States plays a leading role in the development of life science . It is a universal dream of all biological researchers to carry out thorough research there , including myself . <p> Looking back on my research experience , I realize that I have gone through important changes in my understanding of scientific research . As an undergraduate , I regarded research simply as a way of finding the best scientific and technological means . I assumed that all problems could automatically be solved with the discovery of updated and sophisticated approaches . During my Masters program , my understanding deepened and it was Prof. Guo XX , my supervisor , who helped me develop this deepened understanding .

His knowledge and concepts have made me realize how insufficient I am in my knowledge and technical competence . His constant encouragement has reinforced my determination to seek an advanced degree program in the United States to develop myself into an accomplished medical professional like him . My hope is to learn much more professional knowledge in the field of Cell and Molecular Biology and related experimental techniques , to renovate my existing concepts and the conventional mode of thinking . <p> With this Personal Statement , I want to indicate unequivocally my purpose of pursuing a Ph.D . program in Cell and Molecular Biology at Harvard University ( John Hopkins University , Stanford University ) . Your university comes on top of my priorities because it enjoys an unparalleled position in this field both within the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superior research facilities , the nurturing academic environment , strong faculty and a quality education will fulfill my aspiration to become a scientist with important achievements in the future in my chosen field .

I would like to devote myself especially to those important projects which are just in their incipient development and enjoy tremendous potentials . I will avail myself of the ample academic activities to exchange and to learn from leading specialists , and to develop new perspectives .

@@42231238 @2231238/ <h> Sample Statement of Purpose for TESOL <p> I love language because it carries beauty and thought . While the study of languages seems monotonous and meticulous to many people , to me it is an unfathomable ocean of fun . My initiation of English study originated from my obsession to literary aestheticism . It was a step-by-step aesthetic pilgrimage to the glorious palace of western literature when I started from ABC on , then read simple passages , later moved onto the beautiful essays and poetry and at last plunged into the classics by literary masters . <p> Literary works are the inspirations from writers hearts . William Shakespeare and his plays , Francis Bacon and his philosophy , the poetry by William Wordsworth and Percy B. Shelley and the novels by Thomas Hardy and Mark Twain , they displayed to me the sharp and unique observations of writers on nature as well as on life , touring me to the underlying beautiful world of nature as well as revealing the truths of the multi-faceted life . If only you listen to this---- " the palm and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shepherds pipe all day and we hear aye birds tune this merry lay " , only a few words and yet you are already in spring with its loveliness and vivacity . And there 's Shelley , saving you from the abyss of infernal despair with only one stroke of his pen , " if winter comes , can spring be far behind ? " <p> It is precisely this enjoyment of the beauty of English resulting from my reading of literary classics that inspired my own impulses to write . I tried to record my own observations of nature and my own perceptions of life with the tentative skills in English writing . The more I practiced , the more I became interested in English composition . Furthermore , I developed the habit of thinking in English when writing my compositions . These two reciprocally benefiting processes contributed to my unparalleled aptitudes in written English in my class . The joy of reading English and writing English reinforced my already deep love for English language as a whole . It convinced me that I would be willing to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my command of this fascinating language . With my strong interests and relentless persistence , I did very well in my academic performance , obtaining first-class scholarships twice and was even granted the Japanese International Simitomo Scholarship , an award only given to the best in specialty studies . <p> My good performance in coursework has never made me complacent . Whether in coursework or in extracurricular activities , I have always exploited an important quality in character--perseverance . I was an elite member of the basketball team in my department and together with my teammates many times won the championship of interdepartmental basketball competitions . I organized my departments drama performance and personally played the role of the beast in Beauty and Beast . It was a challenge and a test to the limitation of my potentiality . To do it well , I spent so much time on English pronunciation , acting , facial expression etc . In the end it won us the silver medal in the all-university match . <p> Another important quality in my character is passion . First , it is a passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful motivation in my studies of them . I believe that there is another aspect about my passionthe impulse to share my knowledge of English language and my perceptions of life with others . This impulse to share with other has led me to believe that a teaching career would be my best alternative . I simply want to share with others my passion for English language and literature in particular and my passion for life in general . It is well-said that " for education to be an enriching experience , the meanings that emerge must become personal , and they must be significant and important in some part of the persons life . " My concept of a teacher is that a teacher should not merely act as a gateway to knowledge . A person can become a better teacher by influencing students with his or her passion , enthusiasm , and dedication , by exposing students to the beauty of the things that are being taught . As a future teacher , I will try to be not only very competent in imparting professional knowledge but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion . I will make my teaching a lifelong benefit to students and a spiritual reward to myself . <p> Today , English study has become one of the most important tasks for every Chinese student . In spite of that , we consider it regrettable that there is unformed yet any scientific and effective English education system in China . To most of the Chinese students , English study is excessively tedious and unrewarding . Apart from the historical and cultural reasons , we ascribe this unsatisfactory phenomenon to the lacking of a completely scientific English education system . The old English education system paid little attention to practicality and so to most of the students it was sheer learning and no using at all . To solve that problem , it is very important to stimulate students interests in using the language . Mine originated in one of my homework . It was in my sophomore years when my teacher assigned to us the writing of a composition , supposedly on his teaching . Today I still remember the underlying red inks presented to me from my teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It greatly motivated me toward English teaching . Later I studied , by myself , the Cambridge Books For Language Teachers series , including Psychology for Language Teachers , Second Language Teacher Education etc . Through these I realized that language teaching was an art . It involved English language for sure and that was not all . Knowledge of psychology , linguistics , computer assisted education etc. were all necessities in it . <p> Considering the present English teaching conditions in China , I think the key for students to effectively study English is motivation and interests . To achieve that end , for a person like me , determined to be an English teacher , it is of vital importance to systematically study the advanced teaching methods such as contemporary language teaching theory and methodology , computer-assisted language learning and rational study evaluation processes . Ohio University draws my attention exactly in that it provides the courses that suit me best . <p> My tentative study plan for better completing your TESOL program is three-staged . First I will make a speedy psychological re-orientationto transform my role from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on how to convey knowledge of English effectively . After this necessary adjustment , I will endeavor to learn the prevailing theories and methodologies of English language teaching from diverse schools of thought on the basis of my own experience of English learning . After laying a solid theoretical foundation , I will seek all the available opportunities to participate in various workshops , seminars , lectures and conferences on and off campus related to TESOL . I will definitely do internship as English teaching is an art that must be practiced more than theorized . Through practice , I will discover my strengths and my weaknesses in my English teaching . In undertaking those activities , I will contribute my uniquely Chinese experiences and perspectives on English teaching . I will also be concerned about the problems that my classmates might encounter in their individual teaching experience , especially those culturally-related problems . Finally , I will focus on a specific topic for writing my dissertationCultural Barriers in English Teaching . This is perhaps the biggest problem in English teaching in China as the Chinese language and culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My career objective after completing my TESOL program is to return to China to seek a teaching position at the English Department of a major Chinese university where I can apply what I have learned from your TESOL program . I will join an academic association of English teaching . I will consciously guide my English teaching with the specific TESOL principles to make my practice effective and fruitful . Meanwhile , I will do extensive research work with a view to popularizing this notion , that English teaching is not only an art but also a science . My ultimate career objective is to develop myself into a specialist in China in the field of English teaching . <p> It has long been my dream to be an excellent English teacher . China is a country where education has historically been highly regarded . I would love it if I could , through my education in Ohio University , to contribute my share to the future development of English education in China and all over the world .

Through a very stringent screening test , I distinguished myself from the rest several hundred outstanding students from Universities of Beijing who had won " Top Scholarship " and became one of the 14 most outstanding students to embark on a 7-day visit to Australia . In Australia , we met with students from major universities , had exchanges with them , and also visited leading Australia enterprises . This exchange program , brief as it was , allowed me to experience Japanese culture and traditions . The experience has proved definingfor me , this very first experience of setting step on a foreign country enabled me to significantly broaden my horizon and to acquire totally new perspectives . I realized that I have far more exciting things to learn in countries other than my own . <p> At this very moment , as a Masters student majoring in international economic law on the verge of completing my program , I have felt the need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to receive a typically western legal education and rigorous trainings that may equip me with an international perspective . The legal system of a country is closely related to its political , social and cultural traditions and to its overall economic situation . In particular , International Economic Law that I study is a new discipline that is designed to regulate international economic relations ; it involves international public law , international private law and the civil and business laws of different countries . It is my conviction that the best way to learn this subject well is by plunging myself into the major countries in the world to experience and to know their specific legal systems . <p> While boasting a most developed economy , the United States is also reputed for its most advanced teaching and research , and its legal system is also most well-developed in the world . Those factors motivate me to apply for a Masters program in International Economic Law ( International Trade Law ) from your esteemed university . I firmly believe that my strong interest in this subject , my solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform academic research will facilitate my successful completion of my proposed program . <p> I have the confidence that my past academic experience can make me a competitive for your program . The reason for my confidence is based on the fact that I have received the best legal education that a Chinese student can expect in his/her own countryan undergraduate program in the Law School of Tsinghua University and a Masters program in the Law School of Peking University . Whereas an elitist Chinese student belongs to either Peking University or Tsinghua University , I have been nurtured by both of them . What makes me especially proud is that my educational experience is not confined simply to China . Apart from my brief tour of Australia , I have also attended a one-month joint program in Korea . <p> My undergraduate program at Tsinghua University permitted me to systematically learn all the basic courses of law , and expose me to major categories of individual laws . I was most interested in such laws as civil law , contract law , international economic law and maritime business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarships is an indication of my academic excellence . <p> For my Masters program at Peking Law School , I chose International Economic Law as the area of my specialization . To deepen my study , I read most of the classical works on the subject and my voluminous reading encompassed International Trade Law by Clive Schmitthoff and International Finance by Hal S. Scott &amp; Philop A. Wellons . An important extracurricular experience is our Law Schools Moot Court Contest at which my team members and I won the first prize through close collaboration and teamwork . <p> In 2002 , my academic performance qualified me as one of the four students from the entire mainland to go to Korea to attend a course program . For one month , together with law students from all of the world , I studied three important courses Introduction to American law , International Financial Law , and WTO and China , all delivered by American professors . I not only achieved high scores for those three courses but also adapted to the American-styled education under an all-English environment . This experience will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education in my LLM program . <p> As law is more an applied rather than theoretical subject , I have made conscious efforts to undertake internships at local law firms during summer and winter vacations . This summer I worked at Beijing Arbitration Committee where I was exposed to a number of international economic and trade disputes . In coping with those specific cases , I applied my knowledge on one hand and , on the other hand , I developed a more direct and practical understanding of the laws in international economy and trade , as well as relevant international conventions , that I had learned in class . <p> With the rapid scientific and technological advances , social progress and media proliferation , the economies of various countries in the world are becoming increasingly interdependent , and economic globalization has become a tendency that no one can reverse . With Chinas accession into the WTO , China has established close and broad economic relationships with all the WTO members of the world and Chinas trade volumes with its major trade partners have increased on an unprecedented scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single unified framework from now on . My objective is to grasp in-depth knowledge in international economy and trade , and especially the knowledge of the laws and regulations in those two fields in the worlds major economic forces like the United States and European Union .

Your esteemed university is known for its leading position in the teaching and research of international economic ( trade ) law . Your strong faculty and advanced pedagogical resources makes your university my ideal choice . <p> It is my hope that my systematic education at your university will give me the necessary foundation for a rewarding career in international economic ( trade ) law . In this age of increasing economic ( trade ) conflicts , my professional knowledge and training will help to ease the tension and promote the healthy development of economic ties between China and the rest of the world .

" <p> The intensity of today 's media coverage has been greatly magnified by the sheer number and types of media outlets that are available today . Intense competition for the most revealing photographs and the latest information on a subject has turned even minor media events into so-called " media frenzies " . Reporters are forced by the nature of the competition to pry ever deeper for an angle on a story that no one else has been able to uncover . With this type of media coverage , it does become more and more likely that anyone who is subjected to it will have his or her reputation tarnished , as no individual is perfect . Everyone makes mistakes . The advances in technology have made much information easily and instantaneously available . Technology has also made it easier to dig further than ever before into a person 's past , increasing the possibility that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement is much too broad , however . " Anyone " covers all people all over the world . There are people whose reputations have only been enhanced by media scrutiny . There are also people whose reputations were already so poor that media scrutiny could not possibly diminish it any further . There may very well be people that have done nothing wrong in the past , at least that can be discovered by the media , whose reputations could not be diminished by media scrutiny . To broadly state that " anyone " subjected to media coverage will have his or her status sullied implies that everyone 's reputation worldwide is susceptible to damage under any type of media scrutiny . What about children , particularly newborn children ? What about those people whose past is entirely unknown ? <p> Another problem with such a broad statement is that it does not define the particular level of media scrutiny . Certainly there are different levels of media coverage . Does merely the mention of one 's name in a newspaper constitute media scrutiny ? What about the coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example a wedding or the birth of a baby ? Is the media coverage of the heroic death of a firefighter or police officer in the line of duty ever going to diminish that person 's reputation ? It seems highly unlikely that in these examples , although these people may have been subjected to media scrutiny , these individual 's reputations are undamaged and potentially enhanced by such exposure . <p> Without a doubt , there are many examples of individual 's whose reputations have been diminished by media scrutiny . The media 's uncovering of former U.S. President Bill Clinton 's affair with Monica Lewinsky will most likely overshadow the entire eight years of his administration . Basketball superstar Michael Jordan 's sterling reputation has been tarnished more than once by the media ; first by media coverage of his gambling habits , then most recently ( and in a much more harmful manner ) by news reports of his marital infidelities and the divorce from his wife of thirteen years .

It could even be argued that media scrutiny killed Princess Diana as her car sped away from the privacy-invading cameras of reporters in Paris . There is no doubt that there are a large number of people who have been hurt in one way or another by particularly intense media scrutiny . <p> In summary , it seems impossible that for every person that is subjected to media scrutiny , his or her reputation will eventually be diminished . Millions of people are mentioned in the media every day yet still manage to go about their lives unhurt by the media . Normal individuals that are subjected to media scrutiny can have their reputation either enhanced or damaged depending on the circumstances surrounding the media coverage . The

Applying to law school requires research and decision making that can only be undertaken by you , the student . The faculty of the Department of History &amp; Government , however , are willing to offer assistance to students interested in legal careers . You will also need to obtain official catalogs and application materials from the schools to which you are applying along with the necessary registration material for the Law School Admission Test ( LSAT ) and the Law School Data Assembly Service ( LSDAS ) . Some of these materials are available through the History &amp; Government Department or online . Please check with your faculty or pre-law advisor regarding any questions or concerns . <p> In general , the application process involves four major stages .

As you will read , performance on this test is very important and this stage should be taken extremely seriously . Upon taking the test you should already have some idea as to the law schools you intend to apply . Thus , Stage III , researching and applying to schools of your choice , and Stage II will overlap . Securing letters of recommendation and preparing your personal essay are critical and we have some specific advice on these important steps that you may find useful .

Most law schools do not accept unofficial transcripts ( i.e. reproduced copies or copies which have been forwarded through the student ) . <p> : You will also be asked to submit letters of recommendation , typically from 3 different recommenders .

@@42231253 @2231253/ <h> How to Write a Letter of Recommendation for Medical School Admissions <p> Writing letters of recommendation for medical school is a time-consuming but important task . As you probably know , the admissions process for medical school is extremely competitive . In any given year , only around 40% of the students who apply are accepted . Even students who have strong grades and standardized test scores need excellent and convincing letters of recommendation in order to help them gain admission . The perspective you provide in your letter can be influential in determining whether a student has a successful application . <p> Therefore , we have put together these guidelines to help you think about the task before you . <p> When a student asks you to write a letter of recommendation , know that you are not obligated to do so , and decide whether you can write enthusiastically enough to be helpful to the student . Since the vast majority of recommendations are positive , those that are neutral are interpreted as negative and can impair a students chances for admission . If your honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable writing favorably , you have every right to decline a students request for a letter . <p> In writing , please be as specific as possible . General descriptions of a students positive qualities are not as useful as detailedexamples that illustratethe students abilities and achievements . A statement like " John is a brilliant thinker " is quite flattering , but it becomes more convincing if more details are added : " John is a brilliant thinker . For my class at Penn , he submitted an extraordinary fifty-page term paper on women and medicine in early modern England . After determining what practices were available to women in that period , he analyzed the representations of female physicians in the drama of the English Renaissance . His literary interpretation was original and elegantly written . " <p> This same level of specificity is important in discussing non-academic matters too . Take , for instance , the following statement : " Johns commitment to the Narberth Ambulance Squad and to the people we serve is extraordinary . " The medical schools would find this assessment all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johns commitment to the Narberth Ambulance Squad and to the people we serve is extraordinary . While most of our volunteers live within the township , John commutes 45 minutes each way from Philadelphia by bus and by train for each of his shifts . And his record of attendance is perfect . This conscientious behavior is typical of the way he conducts himself . " <p> Try to compare the student to others you have known in a similar capacity . Statements like , " In terms of intellectual talent and drive , John ranks in the top 10% of all undergraduate students I have taught over the past seven years , " can help an admissions committee place your recommendation into a broader context . <p> Admissions committees often interpret omissions of relevant information as implicitly negative . For example , if you praise a students academic work but say nothing about him/her as a person , an admissions officer may conclude that the student is smart but socially inept . Therefore , it is ideal to try to touch on the following topics in any letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation , personal character , commitment to medicine , and interpersonal skills . Of course , your ability to comment on these topics will vary depending on how you know the student . <p> Statements that are negative or refer to problems can jeopardize a students candidacy . A comment like , " John is sometimes abrasive , but I do n't  think he ever means to be rude , " or " John worked hard but his exams were never quite up to snuff , " can give an admissions committee pause . If you have serious concerns about a student , whether of an academic or personal nature , then it may be better to ask the student to look elsewhere for a recommendation . <p> If you wish to give a thoughtful evaluation of a students weaknesses ( as well as his/her strengths ) , please try to couple it with an explanation of how they will not interfere with the students ability to perform well in medical school . <p> Please omit references to the students appearance , as they trivialize the recommendation . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant asset , describe its effect on others . For example : " Johns warmth and sense of humor naturally draw others toward him and help make him a welcome participant in our laboratorys weekly meetings . " <p> Unless the student requests otherwise , please do not address your letter to a particular medical school . In most cases , your letter will be sent to every medical school to which the student applies . <p> Federal law stipulates that students can see letters of recommendation unless they waive their right in advance . The students decision as to whether your letter will be confidential or non-confidential will be designated on the form he or she gives to you . Most students choose to waive their right , since the medical schools generally find confidential letters to be more convincing and compelling . However , if you , as the author of a confidential letter , wish to show a copy to the student , that is absolutely your right . <p> Please type your letter of recommendation . You may type it directly onto the recommendation form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the form .

My days in the physical therapy department often made me think about the prevention of injuries as well as the injuries themselves . I was already doubting my future career choice as a physical therapist . Although I loved the science of it and helping people , the lack of variety within the field and its limited options for growth bothered me . I needed a career that helped a large number of people , emphasized prevention and primary care rather than tertiary care , and would continually challenge and motivate me to improve . Knowing that I really did not want to pursue physical therapy as I had originally planned , my thoughts wandered to the area of public health , particularly health management . <p> My first true introduction to the public health arena came in a class offered through the Big U School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary health issues , I was intrigued . The world of " capitation , " " rationing of care , " and Medicaid fascinated me as I saw the range of problems that public health professionals were trying to solve in innovative ways . This one semester class provided me with a basic but thorough understanding of the issues faced in health care today . In the last two years I have continued to learn about public health both through coursework and work in the field . <p> Because field experience is such a valuable learning tool , I searched for a research assistant position that would allow me to view public health at a different level . I worked on a project at a county health clinic in Englewood , a low-income , minority community .

Its job of immunizing thousands and interacting with all members of the community is often forgotten , but is important for keeping an entire community healthy . <p> My work at the county health clinic as well as my knowledge of some areas of public health led me to accept an internship in Washington D.C. this past summer . The internship provided me with a greater understanding of a federal public health agencys operations and allowed me to contribute in a variety of ways to the XYZ Department in which I worked . Most importantly I worked on " policy issues " which involved identifying and summarizing problems that were out of the ordinary as well as documenting resolved issues in order to establish protocols to increase the departments efficiency . In addition I served on a scientific review panel which was responsible for editing a seventy-page proposed regulation before its submission . <p> Along with my duties at XYZ , I attended seminars and met with public health leaders at different functions and events .

The person provides specifics here about the programs specific appeal and strengths <p> Since rejecting physical therapy as a career possibility my interest in public health has only grown . I welcome the challenge of serving a large community and participating in such a dynamic and challenging field . What if an aspirin a day could prevent heart attacks ? What if abandoning unnecessary procedures saved thousands of dollars , which then allowed a hospital to treat other patients needing care ? What if every person was guaranteed care and that care was good ? I would like to find answers for these questions during my career as a public health graduate student and professional .

By contrast , in Chinas art arena , painting and sculpture continue to dominate artistic endeavors and avant-garde practices , though not absolutely non-existent , have been few . Nevertheless , the younger generation of artists like me has been most receptive to the western art theories and concepts over the past two decades . On the other hand , the rapid changes of the Chinese society have created the most valuable resources for the artistic enterprise .

Unlike most art students who tend to focus more on creative practices and the improvement of their techniques than on theoretical orientation , I found that both the French impressionism ( with its emphatic color theories ) and the Russian realism ( largely outdated as a genre ) , plus the my education in the middle school which was largely dictated by political ideology , could by no means satisfy my creative impulse to visualize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge lay in how to explore for a way that could fuse my concept with my technique .

In addition , I have also become acquainted with books of art history like Modern Western Art by Lucy Smith , History of Modern Art by H.H. Anason , and The Story of Art by E. H. Gombrich .

D and E violate parallelism by substituting an awkward gerund clause for the first noun phrase . <p> Answer to Question 2 <p> In choice D , the best answer , the phrase contemporaries of Harriet Tubman presents a complete possessive without adding an apostrophe ( e.g. , Tubman 's ) . Choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : contemporaries of Harriet Tubman 's . All choices other than D have errors in verb tense .

A and B produce incoherent , fused sentences in which the two main clauses are not parallel . Furthermore , in A the referent of they is unclear , and in B the statement hiring illegal aliens would be a penalty makes no sense . D violates parallel structure by substituting a present participle ( penalizing ) for the second main verb . E introduces an incoherent passive infinitive construction that violates sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choice A , the best answer , preserves grammatical parallelism while allowing for logical expression of temporal relationn++ships ; A employs the parallel participial phrases spawned ... and extending ... to modify filigree . Other choices present different grammatical constructions that are not participial modifiers and thus not parallel to spawned : extends in B is a present-tense verb ; it extended in D begins a new clause ; and is extending in E ungrammatically introduces a new predicate . In C , extended is nonparallel if it is assumed to be a past tense verb form ; if it is assumed to be a past participle , it illogically states , as does D , that the filigree extended only in the past . <p> Answer to Question 11 <p> Two instances of subject-verb agreement must be observed in this sentence : The period ... has been established and what is much more difficult to determine ... is .

A incorrectly uses the plural form are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plural form have in the first clause , and D incorrectly uses are in the second clause as well . E incorrectly uses the plural form are in the first clause . Furthermore , because the date of the period in question was established before the writing of the sentence , the verb of that clause must be in the present perfect form ( has been established ) . <p> Answer to Question 12 <p> The best choice , A , offers an adjective phrase unequivocally modifying policy and exhibiting grammatical parallelism ( decreasing ... and improving ) . In choice B , the gerund the decreasing is not grammatically parallel with the infinitive to improve . Likewise , in C and D , the decreasing of ... costs is not parallel with improving the efficiency . In E , the infinitives to decrease and to improve , while parallel , are less idiomatic than the prepositional phrase of decreasing ... and improving in modifying the noun aim .

D is also garbled syntactically because the conjunction and has been misplaced . In E , the wording is awkward . Choice B is best . <p> Answer to Question 14 <p> In choices A and B , the pronoun it simultaneously refers forward to someone ( or a person ) and backward to the term " psychopath " As a result , the sentence asserts illogically that the term is actually a kind of person rather than a word referring to a kind of person . Choice C repeats this fault and adds an error in agreement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term ( singular ) . E omits a main verb , such as applied , that , in grammatical context here , is required after is . Also , the word people incorrectly shifts number from singular to plural . In choice D , the best answer , the verb refers is correctly used after it , and the alignment of pronouns and antecedents is both logical and grammatical . <p> Answer to Question 15 <p> Choice D , the best answer , appropriately uses the adverb so to refer back to the verb accord . The other choices inappropriately use pronouns ( it or this ) to refer back to the verb . Also , A and B use the indicative verb rewards , whereas the logic of the sentence demands the conditional would reward ( what Parliament believes to be the undue rewarding of illegal immigrants has not actually taken place but is considered only as an outcome of a hypothetical action ) . <p> Answer to Question 16 <p> To convey the idea that shifting a portion of health-benefit costs back to workers has two complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these effects with and also or with not only ... but also .

They must be similar to each other ! " , but they did n't appear to be interested in the question . I believed that I was the only person trying to find the answer until I got acquainted with a professor of theoretical physics at XX University . He told me that analogies between different areas of physics do exist and that many scientists are exploring them . I can not forget my excitement when I talked to him and found that I was n't alone in my attempts to solve the puzzle . Since then every step in my life brings me closer to the answer . <p> In 1998 I entered Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology ( MIPT ) . As a winner of XXIX International Physics Olympiad in Reykjavik , where I received Gold medal and a special prize for the best solution of a theoretical problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to a thorough standard course of study , I have taken a number of elective advanced physics and math courses .

It was the most interesting year of my studies at MIPT as the requirements at the Landau Institute are extremely high . For instance , in order to pass the exam on Diagrammatic Techniques , I solved about fifty complex problems such as finding quantum correction to the conductivity of two-dimensional system with the help of diagrammatic methods . <p> Problems involving a combination of both High Energy and Condensed Matter Physics are of special interest to me , for example , quantum Hall effect , superconductivity , and modeling of cosmological phenomena in condensed matter systems .

Although I it is beyond me to report the exact number of the participants in this specific test the world over , the score I achieved indicated to me that I was above 98% , and according to the analysis by my classmates , this might be the highest score that Chinese students have ever achieved . While I was aware that the importance of any test score as an indicator of ones scholastic aptitudes should never be over-exaggerated , the result still gave me a tremendous sense of self-pride and self-achievement . I believe that I achieved such a high score not through mere coincidence . Instead , it is the result of my long-time love for and dedicated efforts at biology . With an implicit faith in my knowledge of biology and in my potential to continue to excel others , I here solemnly file this document in an attempt to apply for admission into your esteemed university for a Masters program in pharmacology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive applicant for your highly respected program , partially because of my unusual interest in pharmacology . As a bridge across medical science and pharmacy , pharmacology plays a vital role in the research on the ways to resist diseases . The exploration and the subsequent elaboration on the mechanism of therapeutic functioning of drugs is a necessary step in the development and application of drugs to overcome diseases . Faced with this academic discipline that is inextricably connected with human life and human welfare , I have always been fascinated by this subject , bent on making my own contributions to the improvement of the quality of human life . Every time I learn about new theories , approaches and developments in biology and pharmacology , I can not help feeling excited . Each setback I encounter or each success I achieve in my experiments would motivate me to persist and continue . It is this fascination with biology and pharmacology that stands behind my dedicated studies and research in those subjects . <p> The 4-year comprehensive and systematic study and training in the specialty of pharmacy guaranteed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine of XX University , the best medical institute in China . In an academic environmental famous for its rigorousness , I established a solid foundation in such diverse fields as biology , chemistry , biochemistry , pharmacology , pathology , physiology , and cell biology . As I approached my studies primarily from a problem-oriented manner , devoting much more energy to labwork than to coursework in order to satisfy my curiosity for solving practical problems , my overall GPA is somehow affected , slightly lower than what I would have desired . In my case , GPA , which is purely based on exam scores , does not account much . In retrospect , I have been more concerned with developing my hands-on abilities and on developing an extensive knowledge rather than on intensive test-oriented knowledge . Nevertheless , compared with other students , I am sure that I excel them in terms of experimental skills and the ken of knowledge and , for an undergraduate , a good foundation supported by comprehensive specialized knowledge and strong hands-on abilities are most important for more intensive studies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my excellent experimental skills and research experience will qualify me to be a helpful research assistant to my future supervisor and to make important research achievements . Even when I was a freshman , I started to work as a research assistant in the laboratory . Over the past four years , I have commanded most of the basic skills necessary for undertaking lab research , such as operations on animals , cell culture , electrophoresis experiments , etc . By far , my most important research experience came from undertaking my graduation project , which exemplified an overall test of experimental techniques . I chose to focus on the Effect of Ye3 on the Cell Apoptosis . The reason for choosing this subject of research is that the study of cell apoptosis has a crucial importance in the treatment of cancer and in maintaining the immunity of those suffering from AIDS . On the premise that rare earth ions are considered capable of entering cells , I decided that my project would concentrate on rare earth ions and their effects on cell nucleus . With extensive experiments , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would produce totally different behavior toward cell apoptosis . When the concentration of rare earth ions is below a certain ultimate limit , the function of the ions changes from that of facilitating cell apoptosis to that of suppressing cell apoptosis . As an initial and tentative study , my research has won very positive comments from my advisor . In undertaking a large quantity of experiments , I not only applied basic operation skills with much dexterity but also acquired many new techniques such as making post-coloring observation of the morphology of cell nucleus through the confocal fluorescence microscope , and performing qualitative testing of cell apoptosis with the help of flow cytometry method ( FCM ) . <p> Having completed my undergraduate education and acquired necessary qualifications , I would like to pursue a more advanced degree program at The Department of Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics , Faculty of Medicine at The University of XX . The department , founded in the 1950s , has been greatly strengthened by the joining of dozens of renowned scholars and specialists over each of the past decade . Its mission , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanisms of drugs in biology and medicine , " reflects the Departments consistent dedication to academic excellence . Your Department fosters research collaborations within the Department as well as with other XX Faculties &amp; Departments , national and international universities and related industries , and is committed to the development of new research areas . I am especially interested in Clinical Pharmacology Research Organization ( CPRO ) under the leadership of Dr. XX . <p> Your research-oriented program adheres to an " apprenticeship " model of graduate training in which in which graduate students work in close collaboration with a particular Faculty member , their supervisor . Since the matching of research and professional interests between the student and a Faculty member within the Department is paramount , I would like to identify Dr. XX and Dr. XX as either instructor or supervisor with whom I would like to work with . Dr. XX may enlighten me on central nervous system physiology and pharmacology while Dr. XX may instruct me concerning the mechanisms of action and resistance and intracellular pharmacokinetics of antiviral agents .

In the recorded history of two to three thousand years , China developed the worlds most comprehensive and most fascinating culinary legacy . However , in the modern period , on account of Chinas limited research capacity in food chemistry and biochemistry , the level of food processing has obviously lagged behind that of western countries . As a Bachelor of Engineering from the Department of Food Science and Engineering of XX University , I would frequently feel a strong sense of responsibility whenever I hear of the aborted exportation of Chinas agricultural and sideline products due to quarantine problems , or the incredible discrepancy between Chinas huge food productivity and its international market share .

In connection with my coursework in Tobacco Raw Material , Tobacco Smoke Chemistry , and Surface Active Agents , I not only completed all the required subjects of experiment but also took an active part in relevant research programs of the university by undertaking some experiment operations . Although I was paid very little for the limited funding of those programs , it was a great satisfaction to observe the magic processes of chemical reactions and I was able to accumulate considerable practical experience in the selection of chemicals for experiments and in the control of experiment conditions .

" <p> I cultivated an intense interest in mathematics as early as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical thinking , " mathematics naturally became my central focus of study as I achieved consistently exceptional scores in every final-term examination , earning the nickname of " mathematics prodigy . " At middle school , I represented my school to participate in the national Mathematics Olympics Competition to win a second-class award . As soon as I had access to computer in the senior middle school , I became enchanted with the computer programs that possessed equal logical beauty as the mathematics vocabulary and language . Consequently , when I entered Nanjing University where I studied at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science , I felt as if plunging into a vast reservoir of knowledge that allowed me to absorb precious learning to my hearts content . Not satiated by the theories of mathematics taught in class , I attended many courses in computer theories and application as my subsidiary program , courses that included Data Structure , Operation Systems , Assembler Language like Programming with C Language , Multimedia &amp; Internet Technology , and Mathematical Analysis . Those courses helped to develop my enthrallment with abstract symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a specialized subject is a purely theoretical discipline , I paid much attention to the improvement of my ability to apply mathematics to the solution of practical problems . In my spare time , I liked to study mathematical models and algorithms , trying my hands at their realization by compiling some computer programs . Two classmates and I formed a mathematical model construction team and we researched on the subject of Economic Growth Model , which focused on the modeling of economic growth by applying differential equations of mathematics . My sound ability in programming was fully manifested in compiling codes . My involvement in this undertaking not only deepened my understanding of mathematics , but also perfected my computer techniques . This project was awarded second-class prize of Mathematical Modeling Competition among the colleges and universities in Jiangsu Province . <p> Another thing that I like to do in my spare time is learning both the hardware and the software computer skills . So far , I have passed the Grade III Computer Test and Intermediate Level Programmer Test , achieving qualification certificates from large **27;201;TOOLONG software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and GIGABYTE . Among the seven tests for Microsoft Certified System Engineer , I achieved the highest scores in three tests in the entire city of Nanjing . During the two years in which I acted as chairman of the Computer Association of our universitys Students Union , I organized several major campus events in which , by exercising my special talents in computer technology , I launched computer training programs to students of non-computer majors . Within a short period of time , the association developed into the largest student organization on campus and under my leadership more than 400 members devoted themselves to honing their computer skills . Besides enhancing my organizational capability and my leadership , I was awarded the honor of the Outstanding Student Organization Leader , an honor which made me very proud of myself . <p> In order to test the validity of my knowledge , I attended many off-campus seminars and press conferences at product and technology promotions . In addition , I have published approximately 20 papers featuring my research findings in professional computer journals including Microcomputer , Computer Journal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at a number of major computer companies . At HP China , I was responsible for providing clients with solutions to the information platform and for post-sale services . At the Users Software , Chinas largest financial software company , I was in charge of offering solutions in the field of e-commerce and office digitalization to government organizations , hotels and other institutions . I also conducted extensive internship at the Software Lab of Landsoft Company . Those activities all contributed to strengthening my ability to study solutions . So far , I have acquired successful experiences in more than 10 cases . Last but not least , I am now working part-time at Nanjing Milkway Network Transaction Center offering training courses in MCSE . <p> Nevertheless , I am painfully aware of the fact that in China one has very limited chances to apply practical mathematics skills and to experience advanced computer knowledge . Although I have received high-level professional trainings in China , I still face the predicament resulting from the break between theory and practice when I come to tackle practical problems . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from sufficient . Hence , my determination to go abroad to seek further studies at some prestigious universities with mature theoretical research and advanced technologies . <p> When I studied multimedia and Internet technologies , I discovered that almost all the most advanced multimedia communication technologies and the most mature information platform solutions are derived from Europe . It is frustrating to find that in present-day China in-depth research in these areas is virtually non-existent . Under such circumstances , as an aspiring young student , I have no choice but to pursue advanced trainings in England to study the most updated information technology . Among many prestigious European universities , the University of -------------- comes on top of my priorities . My penchant for English universities is not only related to the fact that their long-standing academic tradition , which is universally acknowledged , and nurturing academic environment can satisfy my longing for a quality education . It is also because I , as a person who started learning English in the second grade of my elementary school , have always cherished a special love for English culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where great authors of such ever-lasting literary works as Wuthering Heights , Jane Eyre , and David Copperfield were born to directly observe , to experience to learn , and above all , to understand . <p> It is beyond doubt that Europe plays a leading role in the world in the field of communication technology . The communication media in the future will complete incorporate the visualized , multi-platform and highly efficient technology . The problem of bandwidth in data transmission has always been the major obstacle in the development of this technology . I am interested in the field of data compression and de-compression by means of optimized algorithms , a field of research in which lies the ultimate solution to the obstacle in data transmission . I am soberly aware that I am bound to encounter a series of challenges and difficulties in my future academic pursuit abroad . I have to learn a great variety of theories and knowledge in my chosen field on one hand and to face fierce competitions on the other . It is conceivable that I will come under significant psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availing myself of the excellent intellectual environment and lab facilities of your esteemed university and closely following and grasping the most sophisticated computer technology , I will be able to achieve constant improvement of my abilities on both the theoretical and practical levels .

@@42231267 @2231267/ <h> Examples of Recommendation Letters <p> Letters of recommendation are taken very seriously by graduate school admission committees . They are a primary source of information regarding those qualities and abilities which can not be measured objectively through GPA or test scores . Graduate schools are looking for applicants who are personally mature , responsible , motivated , committed to and personally " turned-on " by psychology , and who , in general , will make a positive contribution to their academic community . Responsible , enthusiastic participation in class is one of the best ways to get good recommendation letters . <p> Most programs will ask for three or four letters of reference . These should be from either college professors or supervisors from a psychology related work , volunteer or research experience . At least two of the letters should be from psychologists . Do n't assume that people will write you a positive reference ; politely ask them if they feel that they know you well enough to write a positive letter . Potential references should be contacted early in the Autumn Quarter of the senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of classes taken from them ( with grades earned ) and addressed , stamped envelopes . Give your letter writers a list of all of the schools you are applying to ( along with any specialized recommendation forms ) at once . Do not give them two this week , another the next week , and three more the third week . Allow at least three weeks from the time you ask for the letter to the time it is actually mailed . Remember , faculty are probably writing letters for other students , and the end of the quarter tends to be a busy time for faculty , too . <p> One of the advantages of a small liberal arts college like PUC is that students have the opportunity to get to know their professors personally . This is important , since a good letter of recommendation is not just positive , but concrete and specific . A letter reading " Joe is an enthusiastic , mature and superior student " is much less effective than one that reads " Jennifer is the kind of student a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me for outside references , and would come by my office to discuss her interest in cognitive dissonance research . " In order for teachers to write effective letters like this , students must take advantage of small class sizes to share their interests and personalities . <p> On the other hand , negative impressions are easily , if subtly , communicated at a small school . Consistently sleeping through class , turning in sloppy or late assignments , or getting by with minimum effort are remembered and interpreted by faculty as immaturity , laziness or apathy . The temptation may arise to " fake good " and attempt a superficial interest or commitment . Not only is this usually easily seen through , but it is foolishly counterproductive . If you are not genuinely interested in some area of psychology , then why fake it ? A more common problem is the student who is genuinely interested and excited by some areas of psychology , but is shy or uncomfortable about sharing this interest with a teacher . Students are encouraged to take a small risk , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many opportunities for informal teacher contact ( club functions , chapel , Sabbath school , etc. ) and allow the behavioral science faculty to get to know them . This will not only result in more concrete , and therefore helpful letters of recommendation , but will greatly enhance the learning community of our department .

During this process of schooling and growth , I have come to identify the object of my greatest interest , criminal law . I have obtained " A " for both criminal law and criminal procedure law . Despite my profound interests in a range of areas , I stood one of the top ten of the entire session ( totaling 150 students ) in terms of credits of undergraduate courses . I know it would n't be possible but for my keen interest in the specialty and a wholehearted devotion to the studies . <p> To conduct independent studies and research are the two major tasks I have completed during the undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether authored and published three articles , namely , On the Essence of Common Law , Economic Analysis of the Right to Muteness , and Investigation Report of Evidencing by Witnesses During A Criminal Procedure .

In addition , I also participated in the famous Challenge Cup Collegiate Paper Contest , and was one of the only two prize-winners of Beijing contest area . <p> I am fully aware that sound interpersonal skills and motivation of team spirit are the basic personal qualities required of a good legal practitioner , so I have been very active in taking part in various social activities during the undergraduate period .

I always find playing the ball extremely helpful in developing team motivation , willpower and a spirit of going all out for success . <p> The major driving forces behind my identification of criminal law are my profound interest in this subject and knowledge of so many problems related with criminal law that need now addressing urgently .

These unique experiences form the basis of my decision to apply for admission by your acclaimed university . For I believe that extensively comparative studies and intensive knowledge of different cultures and histories are absolutely necessary for me to study law well . <p> In my studies in the future , I will focus on the courses on criminal procedure and evidencing law as well as the methodology studies , and will integrate the knowledge obtained in these courses with the witnessing in court and other criminal procedure issues that I will address in the future .

Because we can never know the past directly but must construct it by interpreting evidence , exploring history is more of a creative enterprise than it is an objective pursuit . All historians are storytellers . " <p> There would seem to be two different perspectives presented in the above statement . The first two sentences are concerned with exploring history and would seem to discuss looking at history that has already been written . People who concern themselves with the study of history are not storytellers , but rather story interpreters . The last sentence refers to the people that write about history , the historians themselves . Certainly , to a certain extent , historians must be storytellers because they have a story to tell . But the term " storyteller " seems to imply a greater amount of creativity than what is involved in actually explaining what has happened in history . For the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the historian , as it would appear to be the underlying core idea . <p> From the perspective of the historian , most historians do not have the benefit of having lived through the period of history that they are writing about . By researching through thousands of old letters , legal documents , family heirlooms and the like , historians must look at fragments of history and somehow put these pieces together to reconstruct what actually happened . In this sense , they must be storytellers because inevitably , their personal insights become part of what others will see when they read the historian 's writings . As an example , there are many differing opinions as to whether Thomas Jefferson actually fathered children with one of his slaves . Some historians have written that it is a virtual certainty , while others argue that it was his brother , rather than Thomas himself , that fathered the children . They both can not be right . Although they are all historians , they are also storytellers giving their opinion on what version of events actually transpired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much less of an opportunity to fall into the " storyteller " category as they are present as witnesses to these events as they are happening . Television , newspaper and other media coverage is widespread and almost unrelenting . Television captures visuals and audios that are spread rapidly around the world and theoretically can last forever . There is much less room for putting one 's own " spin " on an event , especially regarding the exact details of what happened . But even with today 's events , there is room for opinion on the part of the historian . For example , historians are already arguing what evidence the United States government had regarding potential terrorism prior to the incredible tragedy of September 11 , 2001 . Looking back now , it seems obvious that the government should have known that something on a large scale was going to happen . With the benefit of hindsight , there were several failures in the government 's counter-terrorism efforts . Historians will now argue over the exact version of what happened , as they become storytellers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example showcasing the idea that all historians are storytellers is that of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . Variations on who was responsible and what actually happened have been the focus of hundreds , if not thousands , of books and historical accounts . Many historians argue vehemently that his or her account of history is the " true " version . Given the same evidence , historians decide which evidence is credible and which is not to arrive at their own conclusions . Clearly storytelling is a big part of how history is written . <p> Particularly when it concerns ancient history , all historians must be storytellers to a certain degree . " Connecting the dots " of surviving evidence from the time period or event being examined requires a certain amount of personal intuition and supposition . Historians that write about events from the more recent periods will probably be less inclined to be " storytellers " as the sheer mass of evidence that is presented will likely lead to better documentation of historic events as they happen . 
@@42231276 @2231276/ <h> How to Evaluate a Job Offer <p> Let 's assume your employment interview went well , and there 's sincere and mutual interest on both sides . <p> Now you need to decide two things : first , whether the new position is right for you ; and if so , what sort of offer you 'd be willing to accept . <p> To evaluate the pros and cons , ask yourself the following : Does the new job meet the criteria you spelled out when you first began your search ? Will the new job improve your level of personal and professional satisfaction ? Or will it simply offer you a rehash of what you already have ? Hopefully , the unique qualities you 're seeking will be within your grasp . <p> Keeping Score <p> If you 're not sure about the new job , or need help in being more objective , take the following test as a way to compare the two positions . You should be able to get a feel for how the job you interviewed for stacks up against your current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The position comparison test can be " scored " two different ways . You can either tally the totals ( the best job has the highest score ) ; or you can use the test as a way to examine your priorities . <p> Let 's suppose your score was 15 to seven , in favor of the new company . Does that mean you should change jobs ? <p> Well , not necessarily . It depends on which considerations are most important to you . If an increase in travel will ruin your marriage , then it wo n't matter how many positive considerations point to the new job . ( This is assuming you want to stay married . ) <p> However , a simple tallying of the score can be very helpful when the decision is a tough one , and no single consideration acts as a " knockout " factor . Besides , mathematical " logic " can always be used to justify what you already feel to be the right decision . <p> The Economic Factor <p> Compensation , of course , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new position . <p> Oddly , few people take the time to really understand their economic choices , mostly because there are so many hidden factors , such as cost of living , benefits , relocation expenses , and so forth . <p> Regardless of where compensation ranks on your list of priorities , it 's a good idea to know what you may be getting into when faced with a career decision . <p> To help you put your economic choices into perspective , use this compensation comparison to evaluate both your prospective compensation package and what you 're currently earning . <p> The best time to make your calculations is before an offer is made . That way , you can form a clear idea of what you 'll need , without having to dicker ( or experience shock ) later on . <p> If you 're looking at an opportunity that 's in a different geographic location , you might want to do some investigating before you even interview . For example , if you live in a nice suburban community in Lawrence , Kansas , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area like San Francisco ? Your answer ( and your willingness to make the necessary trade-offs ) will help determine your level of interest when considering the new position . <p> Figuring the Bottom Line <p> The best approach to putting the deal together is to decide whether you want the job before an offer is extended . This allows you to clarify whether the job suits your needs . Unless you 're motivated solely by money , it 's doubtful a few extra dollars will turn a bad job into a good one . <p> If the job interests you , then determine the conditions under which you 'll accept . These fall into two categories : Bottom Lines and Porcupines . <p> The term " bottom line " refers to the amount of compensation you feel is absolutely necessary to accept the job offer . If , for example , you really want $46,000 but would think about $45,000 or settle for $44,000 , then you have n't established your bottom line . The bottom line is one dollar more than the figure you would positively walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worth , and helps avoid an unpredictable bargaining session . <p> I recommend against " negotiating " an offer in the classic sense , where the company makes a proposal , you counter it , they counter your counter , and so on . While this type of tit for tat format may be customary for negotiating a residential real estate deal , job offers should be handled in a more straightforward manner . <p> Here 's how : Determine your bottom line in advance , and wait for the offer . If the company offers you more than your bottom line , great . If they offer you less , then you have the option of turning the offer down or revealing to them your bottom line as a condition of acceptance . At that point , they can raise the ante or walk away . <p> Lay Your Cards on the Table <p> Once the bottom line is known , you can avoid the haggling that so often causes aggravation , disappointment , or hurt feelings . <p> My experience has shown that it 's much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to barter to get what you want . An employer can get very irritable when a candidate says , " I 'll think it over , " or keeps coming back with new demands again and again . Even if you get what you want , you 've created a negative impression with the company which will carry over after you 've been hired . In effect , you may win the battle , but lose the war . <p> By determining your own acceptance conditions in advance , you 'll never be accused of negotiating in bad faith or of being indecisive . Whether you 're representing yourself or working with a recruiter , learning to differentiate between financial fact and fantasy will facilitate the job changing process . <p> You may want to itemize your bottom line , and , if it 's appropriate , show it to the company ( or your recruiter ) as a means to justify your salary request . Carefully figure your total package , and document any loss of income that may result from a differential in benefits , geographic location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recruiter asks for your bottom line , he or she is n't trying to manipulate you or conspire with an employer that plans to " lowball " its candidates . The recruiter is simply making a good faith effort to discover what makes you happy , and put together two interested parties . <p> The Porcupine Category <p> Of course , there are considerations aside from money that usually need to be satisfied before an offer can be accepted . Factors such as your new position title , review periods , work schedule , vacation allotment , and promotion opportunities are important , and should be looked at carefully . <p> To understand the candidate 's needs , I use the porcupine approach to quantify each consideration or " point " made by the candidate as a condition for acceptance . Once I understand each point , I can work with the company to put the deal together , without having to go back later to get " one more thing . " <p> Once you know your bottom line and each condition , or point on the porcupine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want , since you 've established quantifiable goals to shoot for . <p> How an Offer Is Staged <p> Every company makes hiring decisions differently . Some will encourage shoot-from-the-hip managers to make job offers on the spot . Other companies will limit the decision maker 's ability to act quickly and unilaterally , and require a drawn-out series of staff meetings , subsequent interviews , corporate signatures , and so on . <p> These days , it 's not uncommon for the hiring cycle to last weeks or even months , regardless of how " critical " the position might be . The best approach is to maintain contact with the company , allowing for the fact that there 'll probably be some delay . Presumably , you asked what the hiring procedure was when you first interviewed . Their answer should give you some indication as to when a decision will be made . <p> Offers can be extended by either a letter , or verbally from a hiring manager . They can also be made through a third party , such as a recruiter . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include these three components before it can be considered official : <p> 1 Your position title ; <p> 2 Your starting salary ; and <p> 3 Your start date . <p> Before you resign from your present job , make sure you nail down each of these components from a company official , either verbally or in writing ( in the form of an offer letter ) . Even if the offer comes through a recruiter , you should always contact the employer directly , and if possible , get a letter of offer or acceptance to verify the deal ( although a verbal offer and acceptance will act as a legal contract ) . <p> Not long ago , I was working with a candidate who interviewed for a position with one of my client companies . The interview went extremely well ; so well that the VP of the company called the candidate at his home that evening to discuss the offer . <p> " Well , Paul , we really like you , " the employer told the candidate . " The job is yours if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Paul . " When do I start ? " <p> " Well , I 'll call Bill tomorrow and work out the details , " replied the employer . <p> Understandably , Paul got excited . Filled with pride , he drove his ailing grandmother by the new company the next day , so hecould show off his new place of work . <p> But guess what ? The employer never called me , and never called Paul , either . For some reason he changed his mind , and did n't have the decency to let anyone know . <p> The reason I tell this story is to warn you that even when the cat seems to be in the bag , it ai n't over ' til the fat lady sings . An offer has to include a position title , a starting salary , and a date of start to be official ; just telling you the job is yours is n't enough . <p> Here 's another word of caution : Offers sometimes have strings , or contingencies attached . Do n't be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physical examination ; <p> Document your citizenship or immigration status ; <p> Obtain a security clearance ; <p> Undergo a thorough background investigation , in which your credit history , police records , and travel history might be examined ; <p> Verify your academic credentials ; or <p> Provide proof of your past employment , salary , or military service . <p> Very often , these contingencies must be satisfied before you can to report to work or receive a paycheck . <p> Accepting the Offer <p> If everything about the new position is satisfactory , go ahead and accept the offer . If you 're expecting an offer from a second company , you should let the second company know about your offer right away , so they can speed up their decision . That way , you 'll avoid jeopardizing one deal for the sake of another . <p> Once an offer 's on the table , it makes common sense to accept or reject it within a day or so . Otherwise , your inability to commit will reflect poorly on the way you make decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new employer . In either case , you 're likely to be bruised by waiting too long . <p> If you have legitimate concerns , or you still have questions that need to be answered , now is the time to bring them up . Rather than tell the employer , " I 'll have to think it over , " use the following script : <p> " Mr. Employer , this job looks very good to me , and I 'm enthusiastic about coming to work for your company . I 'll be in a position to accept your offer and start in two weeks if I can just clarify a couple of things ... " <p> The answers you get will make your decision for you , and you 'll either accept or reject the company 's offer . <p> If you decide to reject an offer , remember that it 's almost impossible to resurrect the deal at a later date , since the position will be offered to someone else , or the employer will feel insulted , and close the door on your candidacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final . <p> New Angles and Unusual Deals <p> Most deals come together quite cleanly , with little need for haggling or creative financing . Sometimes , though , it takes a little imagination to satisfy both parties . <p> Money can present a problem for employers when your salary requirements exceed the published range for the position , or create an inequity within the department . In fact , internal equity issues ( in which your expected salary might be greater than someone on the staff who has more professional or company seniority ) are the cause of most deals that fail to close for financial reasons . <p> To satisfy money matters , look for ways to increase your overall yearly compensation , rather than your annual salary . Here are a few added goodies you can shoot for to boost your earnings without ruffling too many feathers : <p> A sign-on bonus to be paid in cash on your date of start ; <p> A performance bonus to be paid after thirty , sixty , or ninety days , assuming your clearly defined goals are met ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum , or over a specified period ; <p> A generous relocation bonus to be paid on your date of start to cover expenses ( but which can be spent at your discretion ) ; <p> An accelerated review which would occur after three or six months , rather than on your first anniversary of employment , in which your salary would be increased ; or <p> An early participation in the company 's bonus , stock purchase , or pension plan ; or other employee benefit program . <p> When required , companies will sometimes serve up these tasty morsels to hungry candidates who recognize that overall compensation consists of more than salary alone .

To be sure , as a student from the Department of Mathematics , xxxx University , I had sound foundation in statistics ; but it required an equally sound knowledge base in biology in order to perform well in a host of seminars on bioinformatics . To develop my interdisciplinary knowledge , I tried desperately to be educated in biologythrough self-study , consulting a large amount of relevant technical literature , attending lectures , and discussing with classmates . <p> Indeed , that was a period of overwhelming fatigue and excitement . Sometimes , going to sleep at 3 oclock in the morning and getting up 4 hours later was habitual .

My knowledge of bioinformatics derives chiefly from two other booksBiological Sequence Analysis Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids ( Cambridge University Press ) and Bioinformatics A Practical Guide to the Analysis of Genes and Proteins ( Interscience ) . The input from those books enabled me to propose constructive suggestions in the latter-day seminars and summer workshops , and my ability to do independent study and to learn new knowledge is fully demonstrated . <p> Prof. xxxx , whom I met early in the junior year , has exerted a defining influence over my academic interest .

In addition , in the second half of my junior year , I attended two semester-long seminars on bioinformatics , one held by the Department of Mathematics on xxxx analysis ( with special emphasis on the application of probability models ) and one by Prof. Xxxxx from the Department of Biology on the application of xxxx analysis .

I would argue for quality over quantity . That is choose 5-10 universities if you are a top student and 8-15 universities if you are an average student . Choosing more than 15 universities makes no sense because you wo n't be able to apply personal approach to each university ( by that I mean correspondence with secretaries and faculty members , adjustment of your statement , preparation of specific documents which only some universities ask for , etc ) . <p> First , taking into account your level choose 20-30 universities in which you might be interested ( you will later select fewer of them ) and ask all of them to send you application materials ( see Sample Letter ) . Select most of the universities with ranks corresponding to your level , add 3-4 better ones and 3-4 sure-shots ( the ones which are definitely below your level and readily accept students from MIPT , MSU , etc ) . Top students usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure-shuts as Stony Brook , Rochester , Rutgers , etc. if we are talking about PhD in Physics . Average students choose 3-4 from the top ten universities and select most universities in the 10th-30th range .

When making the final choice keep in mind that filling out application materials is quite time-consuming and painful , so please think about quality . <p> Another comment , when choosing universities besides ranks do consider location , this is an extremely important factor , you will definitely understand that when you come to US . Preference for location is a very personal thing . But generally the following is true : Middle states are more conservative , more traditional , family oriented and usually more boring . Southern states are generally friendlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make me choose the university in Texas or Arizona ( just think about melting pavement in summer ... : - ) But that 's me , some of my friends live there and are quite happy ( you can drive in air-conditioned car , stay in air-conditioned buildings and go outside at night ) . My favorite states ( and quite many Russians will agree with me ) are the most Eastern and Western states , I mean California , New York , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Connecticut , etc . These states are the most culturally diverse once , people are more educated , you will see less " average Americans " around , women dress better , more cultural attractions , and many more advantages . Also , think about the city where the university is located . Some universities are located in small towns in the middle of nowhere others near or in the big cities . Both of these have its advantages and disadvantages and is mostly the matter of personal preferences . My first choice would be either San Francisco or Boston .

No single view necessarily characterizes every " lobbyist " . An " emissary " is a messenger or agent . No particular view necessarily characterizes an " emissary " . <p> 4 . PERSEVERE : A. put into B. send out C. take away D. give up E. bring forward Explanation : To " persevere " means to continue in an enterprise in spite of opposition or other difficulties . D is the correct answer . To " give up " can mean to cease to try to accomplish something . To " put into " could mean to invest , as energy , or , more generally , to insert . To " send out " means to emit . To " take away " means to subtract , to relieve someone of something , or to remove . To " bring forward " can mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suggest a lack of perseverance . <p> 5 . EXPIRE : A. evolve B. stabilize C. come to life D. grow to fruition E. bring to light Explanation : To " expire " means to die or to run out of time . C is the correct answer . To " come to life " ( to begin living ) is the opposite of to die ( to end life ) . To " evolve " means to develop gradually . The process of evolution must involve life , but to " evolve " is not the opposite of to die . to " stabilize " means to make steady or to maintain without change . To remain in a stabilized condition may mean to remain alive , but it is not the opposite of dying ( ending life ) . To " growth to fruition " means to develop to the point of being productive .

METAMORPHOSE : A. move ahead B. remain unaltered C. descend slowly D. examine in haste E. prepare in advance Explanation : To " metamorphose " means to change or be transformed into something else . B is the correct answer . To " remain unaltered " is the opposite of changing or being transformed into something else . Metamorphosis might be part of a process of moving ahead , but to " metamorphose " is not the opposite of moving ahead . To " descend slowly " means to come down without speed . Coming down is not the opposite of transformation . Examining in haste has no clear relationship to metamorphosis . Preparing in advance is a preliminary step , not the opposite of transforming . <p> 7 . PUNGENCY : A. boredom B. redundancy C. unresponsiveness D. blandness E. insignificance Explanation : In some contexts , " pungency " is a quality that is directly perceived . It implies sharpness , a stinging quality , and frequently applies to smells or tastes . D is the correct answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stimulating , sharp , or stinging . It is frequently used to describe tastes . Something that is the opposite of pungent might cause " boredom , " but " boredom " is a feeling rather than a quality . " Redundancy " refers to that which is extra , unnecessary , or repetitive . " Pungency " is a quality that might provoke a response , but " unresponsiveness " is a characteristic of the perceiver , not of the thing perceived . " Insignificance " is a quality , but it does not necessarily imply a lack of sharpness . It is not a common quality of tastes or smells . <p> 8 . DIVESTITURE : A. acquisition B. promotion C. subsidization D. consultation E. monopolization Explanation : " Divestiture " is a taking away of something , presumably desirable , that was formerly possessed or owned . One can divest oneself , or one can be divested of something during " divestiture " . A is the correct answer . " Acquisition " means coming into possession of something desired . " Promotion " means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . One could be divested of a new position , but the idea of a position is not included in the definition of " divestiture " as it is in the definition of " promotion " . " Subsidization " means the act of giving money or aid in any of several possible situations . " Subsidization " refers to a continuing process of being granted something rather than to the point at which something is attained . " Consultation " means a conferring among people .

DISPATCH : A. serenity B. leisureliness C. heedlessness D. irregularity E. aversion Explanation : " Dispatch " in this question means quick efficiency . Although " dispatch " can also be used as a verb , " serenity " in the first choice is used only as a noun and not as a verb , so " dispatch " must also be used as a noun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowness and lack of quick efficiency . " Serenity " means calmness , and may suggest a state of mind or an appearance of calm . Though " dispatch " suggests activity , it is not incompatible with " serenity " . " Heedlessness " means lack of care in performance . It implies a lack of efficiency but implies nothing about the speed of operation . " Irregularity " can suggest dishonesty or a lack of continuity in action . It does not imply lack of either speed or efficiency . An " aversion " is a feeling of dislike or a desire to avoid , rather than a way of behaving . 
@@42231283 @2231283/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Political Science and International Relations <p> In 1999 when I was just a freshman of the XX University of China , I won the title of the Best Debater at the annual debate contest of the Department of History . The subject of the debate was " Sino-American Relationship in the Forthcoming Millenniumon the Wane or on the Wax ? " The position of the team that I represented was that the Sino-American relationship in the new century would be on the wax and our persuasive arguments ensured our ultimate triumph . During the contest , the unique perspectives , the broad range of knowledge covering history , political science and international relations , and the overwhelming oratorical eloquence that I demonstrated captured the attention of Prof. XXX , the president of the panel of judges . Prof. XXX was a leading scholar in China on modern world history and on American history . After the debate contest , he had a private conversation with me , giving positive comments on my performance while pointing out my inadequacies in my knowledge . From then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relations , thus strengthening my growing interest in those two fields . <p> My present decision to switch from history to political science and international relations is further related to the unique education I have received at XX University and to its academic atmosphere . The university is one of the most prestigious universities in China , with unparalleled academic reputation in economics , political science and international relations . In such an academic environment , I have been exposed to knowledge in a wide range of fields . In the field of economics which I minored in , I have learned much about developmental economics and comparative economics ; in the field of international relations , I have known much about world politics and economy , modern world history , the political systems of the West , etc . As my understanding of economics and history deeps , I have come to realize that politics and international relations are the main forces behind the development of the major powers of the present-day world and this very realization underlies my commitment to the study of political science and international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be described as rewarding and fruitful . I was the sole student in my class to win " second-class " scholarship for two consecutive years for outstanding performance in the coursework of core subjects , and my overall GPA was the third highest . Students of History Department are required to obtain the compulsory 181 credits through their 4-year program , the toughest requirement in the entire university . Even such a heavy load of coursework could not satiate my academic initiative , therefore I minored in economics to achieve extra 28 credits . I applied efficient and effective study methods to my coursework , which ensured my successful performance . In my systematic self-education , I read classic works on history and economics and followed closely the latest developments in international politics and relations . <p> Although a mere undergraduate , I have gained some tentative research experience by participated in several research projects . I have served as research assistant to Prof. XXX in the project under his direction--American Foreign Policy After World War I. I was research assistant to Prof. XX of the School of Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In June 2002 , Prof. XX from the Wilson Research Center of the United States came to address the Symposium on the Research of Cold War History in the Future . As one of the symposium organizers , I listened to the wonderful presentations of a number of scholars on the subject and had a close talk with Prof. XX , who exposed me to the creative research methodology and the impressive research achievements of the Wilson Research Center . The experience significantly broadened my academic horizon . My thesis , entitled The Economic Policy and Sino-American Trade Relationship during the Clinton Administration , is a conscious attempt to apply interdisciplinary analysis as it encompasses fields far beyond the economic realm . Prof. XXX , who also specializes in economic history , was my supervisor . Under his fruitful guidance , I collected a large quantity of first-hand data and classified them into neat categories . Based on sufficient data , I offered my own unique analysis and proposed my interpretations of the forces at work behind the Sino-American relations in the economic realm . My thesis was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to 5% of the students in my grade annually . <p> My performance in extracurricular activities can testify to my all-round personal development .

I have some tentative teaching experience , and won the title of the Most Valuable Teacher during my teaching internship at the No. 2 Middle School in XX City . I have important management experience and a strong awareness of cooperation , developed through my organizational work in such student organizations as Computer Network Association , Badminton Association , Economics Study Group , and International Politics Forum . A special mention should be made of my data retrieval for the Press Information Center of XX News Agency . Due to my Internet skills and sensitivity to useful information due to my broad knowledge , I retrieved , classified and analyzed information for the Economic Decision-Making Journal and Top-Management Information Journal for high-ranking government officials and for top management of enterprises . <p> Despite my achievements heretofore , I am well aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program at XX University which legitimately enjoys a most unparalleled academic prestige in the world .

It is my belief that XX University will impart to me advanced knowledge , broaden my academic perspectives , and develop my research potential . <p> Chins social and economic development requires cooperation with the international community . With Chinas increasingly important role in the international arena , it is important for China to understand the prevailing international tendencies and to make full use of diplomatic resources . The United States and the European Union are two dominant forces in the worlds political arena and how to develop constructive relations with them is the key question China faces .

After completing my proposed program , I will seek a teaching and research career in China to study and to interpret this rapidly changing world . <p> On August 27 , 1963 , Martin Luther King Jr . pronounced his dream to the entire world in his campaign in Washington for racial equality and for Black human rights . Ultimately he sacrificed his life for the belief that " Everyman is born equal .

Having completed both my undergraduate program and graduate program in two leading institutions of medical science of China , I have developed a strong foundation in clinical medicine and internal medicine . During my research-intensive Masters program , I have come to focus on cancer cells and have achieved important research findings . In order to search for continued academic and professional excellence , I deem it necessary to pursue a SD program in cancer epidemiology and the Department of Epidemiology of xx University will be the perfect academic environment in which to do so . <p> In applying for your program , I must direct your attention to my academic qualifications , my research achievements and my motivation toward cancer epidemiology . During my undergraduate program at The Department of Clinical Medicine , Medical School , xx University , I attained a GPA of 87/100 and a top-2 ranking among 250 students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the three winners in our College ( consisting of 1500 students ) of xx Scholarship , I went on an exchange program at the School of Medicine , xx University , xx . <p> Having laid a solid foundation as an undergraduate , I kept excelling in my Masters program at xx College of Clinical Medicine , xx Medical University . Apart from coursework in such core courses as biostatistics , cell biology , biochemical technique and isotopic technique , my greatest achievements lied in the improvement of experiment skills and research potential . I worked on my Masters research projects at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology , xx Institute for Biological Sciences , Chinese Academy of Science . There , my ability to perform independent research was significantly enhancedtotally self-reliant , I read technical literature , chose my orientation , designed experiments , determined the reagents to be used , carried out specific operations , analyzed data and presented summary reports . In particular , I mastered key techniques in cell biology such as cell culture , flow cytometry , PCR , Western blotting , and cDNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated especially strong backgrounds in mathematics , biochemistry , cell biology , genetics and statistics . <p> By far , my greatest distinguishing achievement has been the research I have accomplished . In a research program sponsored by the xx Foundation , I researched on the potential mechanism(s) whereby the neutral lipid isolated from the endosperm of Job 's tears ( NLEJ ) , known to possess an anticancer activity with relatively low toxicity , produces anti-proliferative effects in the PaTu-8988 and SW1990 human pancreatic cancer cells . In the research , I found that NLEJ inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest as well as regulation of gene expression in vitro . Therefore , NLEJ might be a chemotherapeutic agent against pancreatic cancer . Based on those research findings , I have completed a research paper entitled xx , which has been accepted by Journal of xx ( indexed by SCI ) for publication in early 2005 . <p> My research achievements so far also include the publication of three other papers as first author in core scholarly journals xx ( Chinese Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical xx , Issue 6. 2004 ) , xx ( Chinese Journal of xx , early 2005 ) . In addition , I have written two reviews concerning the domestic research on " xx " and on " xx " . This October I have contributed two chapters " xx " and " xx " to the book xx . <p> With my research qualifications regarding pancreatic cancer , I have actively participated in international conferences and domestic conferences , at which three papers have been collected into international proceedings and two into domestic proceedings . In September this year , I participated in xx , an annual European conference on the basic research and clinical diagnosis in gastroenterology , at which I did an oral presentation and won an award . <p> Compared with average applicants whose backgrounds are related to public health , I have obvious advantages . I have professional experience as a resident physician at xx Hospital , xx University , since this July .

Such a clinical background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptual , of cancer as a disease , as I have been systematically instructed about the etiology of various cancers , the mechanism of their pathogenesis at both molecular and cytobiological levels , susceptible groups , their diagnosis , treatment and prevention . In addition , I have developed unique and insightful understanding of the need to integrate basic research with clinical application and to have a close grasp of the future research orientations . I believe my comprehensive knowledge will prove a major asset for my future high-quality research . <p> Having developed all the requisite backgrounds , I am bent on a SD. program in cancer epidemiology at xx University . To undertake your program will obviously require me to somehow shift from clinical experiences to epidemiological research and I have important reasons to do so . Clinical medicine is primarily targeted at individual patients while cancer epidemiology will allow me not only to study the reasons for the cancer pathogenesis , development and distribution among certain groups of people but also learn how to formulate policies and measures to prevent , control and eliminate cancer-related diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unravel cancer etiology . The applied nature of epidemiology makes it highly valuable in providing guidance and directions for clinical practice and basic research . Furthermore , cancer epidemiology takes a group perspective in combating cancer , either a family group or the entire mankind can benefit macroscopically from its research findings . Finally , promotion of human health through disease prevention is always more positive and economically meaningful than post-contraction therapy . <p> xxs Department of Epidemiology has a long tradition of teaching and research in the epidemiology of cancer , especially with well-grounded multidisciplinary research and cutting-edge methodology . Under your program , I will study the research methods of clinical epidemiology and molecular epidemiology , and probe into the laws of distribution and the dangerous factors of the malignant tumors , as well as the way to determine the highly susceptible groups and to develop effective preventive measures and strategies . Specifically , I will focus on the following aspects of molecular cancer epidemiology the relationship between certain genes and cancer , the experimental research on using plant extracts to prevent cancer , searching for early-stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In my tentative study plan , I would spend the first two years studying genetic epidemiology , cancer genetics , the application of biomarkers in epidemiologic research .

The results from the pre-experiments will help me adjust my orientation . Once the topic is decided , I will try to perfect my experiments and , with the help of literature , preliminary research results , and data analysis , I will complete my dissertation in which important breakthroughs can hopefully be achieved . I believe that my fruitful study and research at your well-respected institution will make me the first-rate cancer researcher in my home country who can , in turn , make excellence my lifelong habit .

You should plan on spending several weeks investigating the potential schools to which you intend to apply . Each law school has its own application forms as well as institutional-specific criteria for admission . Most charge an application fee and have specific deadlines for the submission of application materials . More importantly , the overall cost of attending law school ( tuition , board , living expenses , etc. ) varies greatly . <p> Step 1 : Research the Options There are many factors to consider and you must determine which factors are most important given your unique situation . In general , however , there are some common factors that should be considered in selecting law schools . <p> Factors to Consider : <p> Cost : Remember that beyond tuition you have to take into account the cost of room and board , expected living expenses for that location , and additional costs like study aides and books . Consider too the reputation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools disclose information on placement statistics - the rates at which their graduates pass the bar exam and average alumni salaries . It is highly recommended that you fully assess your financial situation and prepare for the management of debt in selecting a law school . Remember that full time study and the necessity of doing well in law school will limit your ability to engage in additional employment . <p> Availability of financial assistance : Scholarships for law school are generally few and very competitive , but some schools do have scholarships , grants or assistance programs like federal work-study . Contact the individual schools for a complete listing of available financial aid . You may also want to contact the schools ' career development offices for information on paid research , part-time and/or summer employment opportunities . Most law schools recommend that first year students not hold any outside employment and emphasize that it is unrealistic for students to work more than 20 hours a week while in the J.D. program . Many students rely on federal or private loan options to finance their legal education . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking ahead about the financial ramifications of your choice is sound planning . <p> Admission criteria : When debating schools keep in mind that the criteria on which each institution bases admission will differ . In other words , there is no uniform formula . Some schools have pre-determined standards for eligibility ( i.e. a minimum LSAT result ) . Thus , these schools will not even consider applicants who do not meet the minimum criteria . Remember that there are typically hundreds of students applying for a single slot and the strength of your application may be judged relative to other applicants . Not all schools make immediate decisions ; rather they will grant admission to some students , placing others on a " waiting list " for admission . The standards for admission and decision making policy should be stated in the schools ' admission catalogs . For official clarification consult that institution 's admissions office . Although the formula will be different for each , schools typically base their admissions decisions on some combination of the following factors : <p> LSAT Scores <p> G.P.A. ( Grade point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( written statements by the student which accompanies his or her application ) <p> Class ranking and College attended <p> Background and experience ( or strength of the applicant ) <p> Extra-curricular , professional and leadership activities <p> Citizenship , race or ethnicity <p> You should assess the probability of your being admitted to this school based upon a realistic assessment of your academic record and test scores . The goal should be to identify institutions that best meet your needs and offer a fair probability of admittance . <p> Law School Ranking/Reputation : The American Bar Association ( ABA ) is responsible for granting accreditation to law schools and is a good source of information regarding the curriculum and facilities of approved law schools . The LSAC also offers an " Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools . " There are numerous alternative rankings of law schools and these various guides are typically available in the legal section of most bookstores . Additionally , publications such as Newsweek and U.S. News &amp; World Report offer annual evaluations of law schools . There is no single , agreed upon ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputations . Generally speaking , the " better " the school , the more competitive the admissions standards . Beyond the reputation and ranking of a school , consider the factors that are most important to you , including class size , faculty access and faculty to student ratios . <p> Program Specialities : Many law schools offer concentrations or special programs in specific areas of the law ( such as environmental law or criminal justice ) . Additionally , many schools allow students to pursue joint degrees ( such as a joint J.D./M.A. or J.D./Ph.D. ) or advanced legal degrees such as the LL.M . ( Masters of Law ) . Some institutions offer part-time enrollment , evening classes or clinical programs which may be attractive . Depending on your goals or interests , your decision may include schools that match your areas of interest or desired expertise or which allow program flexibility . <p> Location : A very basic consideration should be the location of the school . Out-of-state tuition increases the cost of a legal education and location will affect associated expenses as well ( i.e. travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment will strongly influence the overall experience . You may also want to consider long-term plans . Many students opt to study law in the state in which they plan to take the bar . <p> Other Factors of Importance : Because every situation is unique , there may be additional factors for consideration . Try to identify all of the factors that matter specifically to you . Take the time to look for schools which meet your most important criteria . <p> Where to Obtain Information About Individual Law Schools : <p> Official Guides to Law Schools : There are commercial publications which distill relevant information such as the location , size , admission criteria , application fees , program specialities and pass rates ( the percentage of graduating students who passed the bar exam ) . There are several publishers that offer these guides and are available through most bookstores . Additionally , many guides have a companion cd-rom version which includes the admission forms for each school . <p> Online : Virtually all law schools have web sites which include basic information and online admission information/materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search using any commercial search engine ( i.e. Yahoo ! or Excite ) . You may also want to try www.LSAC.org ( the Law School Admission Center ) for links to law schools and law school guides which are available for purchase . <p> Writing to the Law School : You may also call or write the law school directly to request admissions catalogs and materials . Contact with a school , whether in person or by phone , is a good way to get a better " feel " for the place . Consider too visiting the school or talking directly with an admissions counselor as a way to obtain more information about a particular institution . <p> Ask Around : Talk to individuals who have gone to law school . Check the alumni registry of your undergraduate college for names of individuals who have attended a particular school . Ask the admissions officers whether their school provides any contact sources for prospective students . <p> Department of History and Government : Daemen 's Department of History &amp; Government has a number of admissions catalogs from various schools available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotus Hall ) . The Department 's pre-law advisor will also have copies of the LSAC 's " Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools " and " Law School Directory " available for student research .

I had thought of giving it up , yet with strong will and perseverance , I overcame the pains and kept study hard , and won the first prize in my province in the contest . <p> That experience will live in my memory for my whole life . Now I am a senior undergraduate student in the Physics Department of Peking University . Just like many other people , I have had a dream about science since my childhood . It is this dream that has made me interested in physics and choose the Physics Department of Peking University and make physics my life goal . To me , four years ' study is much like a spiritual journey into the magnificent palace of physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanics , Electrodynamics to Statistical Physics , again Quantum Mechanics , I realize the ever-deepening process of human understanding of nature ; meanwhile I can not help marvel at nature 's beauty of simplicity and harmony . During this journey , I have acquired the fundamental knowledge about physics and developed basic physics experimental abilities and physical thinking . I have earned the excellent academic records of overall GPA 3.53 and major GPA 3.84 . Moreover , I have scored points above 90 in most of the kernel specialized courses . Yet most important of all , in this process I have enjoyed both the ideas of previous physics masters and the beauty of harmony and simplicity in nature 's evolution and function , i.e. , what the masters have termed the beauty of nature . <p> In order to satisfy my passion for physics , I have furthered my studies from two aspects . One is to broaden my vision by reading extensively . In the past three years , I have read much works about physics , especially those of the masters , such as The Eeynman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through reading I have obtained not only much knowledge out of the textbooks , but also those masters ' peculiar thinking in analyzing and solving questions , which have provided guidance to my studies . The other is to try to get as many as possible experiment opportunities . It seems to me that experiments are helpful for my acquiring much perceptual knowledge about physical phenomena and developing powers of intuition in physics . Bearing this in mind , in addition to finishing every in-class experiment , I have made use of my vacation to conduct other experiments in other laboratories . For instance , during the winter holiday in my second year in college , I went to the provincial key material laboratory at Zhengzhou University to make some test of the fatigue properties of **25;260;TOOLONG .

Through them I can ponder on the fundamental physical phenomena and the laws behind them . Moreover , they have fostered my habit of independent thinking and analysis . <p> Yet I am fully aware that physics itself is far from enough . A person 's success depends not only on his professional background , but also on his overall quality , such as ability of self-study and communicative skills .

Looking forward I find that I have just started my new journey . Modern physics has a history of several hundreds ; yet it is still full of contemporary vigor . In the past ten years , the introduction of methods such as MBE and MOCVD have made it possible for various devices with distinctive quantum effects possible ; meanwhile , they have resulted in numerous novel phenomena , including electronic interference and conductivity oscillation . And the issue as to how to explain theoretically the properties demonstrated by quantum electronic and opto-electronic devices of or under the size of 100mm has become a very challenging novel sphere of physics . This is just the field in which I am interested and hope to achieve some breakthroughs . <p> To undertake future research in those areas , I have equipped myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics and my extensive study of this subject have enabled me use Monte-Carlo simulation and Molecular Dynamics simulation skillfully .

Against such a backdrop I have decided to discontinue my teaching career in favor of an application for a Masters degree in Interpretation and Translation at the renowned XX University . Through this degree program , I expect to develop myself into a well-trained specialist in this field who can make important contributions to translation and interpretation , which is also a meaningful form of cultural and interpersonal communication . <p> I always congratulate myself for the right decision I made five years to specialize in English Education at the English Department of XX Normal University .

As the carrier of all those information , the English language aroused my serious interest in exploring the culture and its related aspects represented by the English language . <p> On the other hand , the Translation course brought me new perspectives concerning linguistic and cultural characteristics of the target language and my vernacular . The conversion of those two independent language systems not only involves semantic and stylistic renditions but also underlying cultural penetration and transplantation .

These include the relationship and the interaction between the central nervous system and other systems of the human body such as the endocrine system , the immunological system and the circulation system . Furthermore , as far as the brain itself is concerned , it has an amazing structure . The cortex alone is divided into a multiplicity of cellular layers , each consisting of different cells , with extensive fiber connections not only between different layers but also between individual cells inside a given layer .

In addition , neuroscience is more an applied subject than a theoretical one . With this realization , I have made conscious efforts to participate in research projects . When a sophomore , on account of my outstanding performance in course work and my strong enthusiasm for experiments , I was accepted by my advisor Prof. Wang Haijie into his research team in which , under the guidance of Prof. Wan , I worked together with his graduate students on the research of the lymph transfer of the glutinous molecule in the tumor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my classmates .

However , in 1992 there were only four species of amphibians observed in the park , and the numbers of each species were drastically reduced . The decline in Yosemite has been blamed on the introduction of trout into the park 's waters , which began in 1920 ( trout are known to eat amphibian eggs ) . But the introduction of trout can not be the real reason for the Yosemite decline because it does not explain the worldwide decline . " <p> In this argument , the writer of the letter concludes that global pollution of water and air has caused a decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her conclusion , the writer cites the results of two studies , seventy-five years apart , that purportedly show that the number of amphibians in one park in California , Yosemite National Park , have drastically declined . Additionally , the writer casts aside a given reason for the decline , stating that the introduction of trout to the park ( who are known to eat amphibian eggs ) does not explain the worldwide decline in the number of amphibians . This argument defies simple logic and suffers from several critical fallacies . <p> First of all , the argument is based on only two studies in one specific part of the world , Yosemite National Park in California . It is impossible to pinpoint a worldwide theory for the decline of amphibians based on any number of studies in only one specific location in the world - the specific varieties of amphibians , geographical conditions and other location specific variables prohibit such a sweeping generalization . One very specific location can not be used as a model for all other locations , even within one particular country , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever that links the Yosemite study with any purported effects anywhere else in the global environment . <p> Secondly , the two separate studies were done seventy-five years apart . There is no evidence that the two studies were conducted in a similar manner over the same duration of time or even over the same exact areas of Yosemite National Park , or that the exact same study methods were used . For example , perhaps the first study lasted over an entire year and was conducted by twenty-five experts in amphibious biology , resulting in the finding of seven species of amphibians in abundant numbers . By contrast , perhaps the second study was conducted over a period of one week by a lone high school student as a school science project . The writer offers no basis on which to compare the two studies , leaving it open as to whether the two are truly comparable in their breadth , scope and expertise . <p> Finally , the writer notes that the decline in the amphibian population has been blamed on the introduction of trout into the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the purely specious basis that it does not explain the worldwide decline . This part of the argument blithely dismisses the very relevant fact that trout are known to eat amphibian eggs . This attempt to " prove a negative " is the last resort of those in search of some vain attempt to prove the truth of the matter that they are asserting . It is basically impossible to " prove a negative " ; this is an attempt to shift the burden of proof back on to the nonbelievers of the argument . The global environmental situation and that of Yosemite National Park are not perfectly correlated , and the fact that the trout may very well be responsible for the decline can not simply be dismissed without further proof . <p> In summary , the writer fails to establish any causal relationship between global air and water pollution and the decline of amphibious life worldwide . The evidence presented is extremely weak at best and narrowly focuses on one tiny area of the globe , as well as putting forward as proof two studies about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer would need to directly put forth evidence associating air and water pollution with not only the decline at Yosemite but also throughout other areas of the world .

@@42231301 @2231301/ <h> How to Request for Letter of Recommendation <p> One of the greatest areas of confusion and miscommunication among students applying to graduate school involves letters of recommendation . Students are often hesitant to approach faculty to ask for letters . Writing letters of recommendation is part of a faculty member 's job and he or she expects to write letters for the good students in his or her classes . Do not ever hesitate to ask for a letter or recommendation because you feel you will be imposing . In the process of deciding whom to ask and how to ask , students often procrastinate--making it more difficult to find willing faculty members to write letters on short notice . What follows are suggestions ( based on faculty comments ) which may prove helpful to students in the process of seeking letters of recommendation : <p> Whom should you ask for a letter of recommendation ? <p> Normally graduate schools are interested in receiving letters describing a student 's academic ability . Thus , you should ask faculty members who can comment on your performance in an academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes where you have made the best grades . Even if other faculty know you well , an instructor of a course where you earned a C might not be able to write a very strong letter . If possible , you should strive for letters that stress different areas of strength , e.g. , one letter that emphasizes computer skills , another your research skills . That way letters wo n't be duplicates of each other . Asking the faculty advisor or someone who has known you only in an informal setting , such as a fieldwork class or student organization , may bring a refusal because most faculty know that you need letters from professors in your key courses . If you wish to have an employer ( from a psychologically relevant job ) or a fieldwork supervisor write a letter for you , consider using him or her as an extra reference . The minimum number of letters requested by a school should come , if at all possible , from your academic instructors . Never have a relative , family friend , or minister write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school to which you are applying . <p> How do I get to know faculty ? <p> At a large school like CSULB and in a large department like psychology , it is often hard to get to know faculty . It is up to the student to make a special effort . Taking more than one class from the same professor is a good idea . Participating in class discussion is helpful , but make sure the professor knows your name . To accomplish this you might talk to the professor before or after class or stop by the office hours . However , be sensitive to cues from the professor ; do n't interrupt the professor just as he or she is about to begin lecture or engage in a lengthy conversation after class if other students are also waiting . The ideal way to get to know faculty is to volunteer to work on research or special projects . Do not wait until your senior year to think about graduate school . If possible begin your planning in your sophomore or junior year . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of recommendation ? <p> Hopefully you will have had a chance to know at least one or two faculty members well enough ( work on the faculty research project , involvement in several small classes , etc. ) that asking for a letter is a comfortable process . However , that is not the case for all students . Some may find that faculty members who they know best are part-time faculty who are not around when they need letters or the full-time faculty they know are on sabbatical or have retired . Thus , they will be in the awkward position of having to ask a faculty member who they do not know well to write a letter . Approach the faculty member by explaining your situation and inquiring whether he or she knows you well enough to write a helpful letter . Listen carefully to the response . If the faculty member seems reluctant , you might want to consider asking someone else . Always ask the faculty member in person . Do not leave a pack of letters in the faculty member 's mailbox and expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not appear personally , at least phone to find out if the faculty member is willing . <p> Should I waive my right to see the letters ? <p> The Buckley Amendment grants students rights to have access to their educational records including letters of recommendation . However , recommendation forms ask students if they wish to waive their right to see the letters of recommendation . Most authorities advise students to waive their rights because the recipients will then know that the information in the letters is more candid . Information contained in letters where the student does not waive the right of access may be discounted by the schools who receive it . Also many students do not realize that they only have the right to see their records if they are accepted by a school and enroll . <p> When should I ask faculty to write my letters ? <p> Give faculty members enough time to write the letters . Many students delay in completing their application forms and postpone the process until a vacation period . As many letters are due near the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christmas holidays . As they begin to organize their applications they approach faculty near the end of the Fall semester . Do not assume that faculty members will enjoy spending their Christmas vacation writing your letters . Instead approach faculty at least six weeks before your first letter is due , so that they may write the letters at their convenience . Some faculty members would appreciate it if you would leave a reminder message on voice mail several days before the deadline . Ask the faculty member if he or she would like you to do that . Also , you will want to approach faculty early enough that , if they are not able to write a good letter for you , you can still ask other faculty members . <p> What can I do to make the process of writing the letters easier for faculty ? <p> Make the process of writing the letters as easy as you can . Faculty members may see up to 300 students a semester . Hence they may not remember the details of your experiences in their classes as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took from the faculty member in question , your grades , the topics of any papers you wrote , and any other noteworthy events related to the class in which you participated . Even if you received an outstanding grade in the class , the faculty member may know little else about you other than the small sample of behavior observed during the class . <p> To provide the most informative , well-rounded letter , many faculty would like additional information about you . You may want to provide a resume which includes : a ) your overall GPA and Psychology GPA b ) your GRE scores ( if available ) c ) a list of psychology ( and other relevant ) classes you have taken including your grades in each d ) a statement of your goals . If you have different programmatic goals for different schools to which you are applying , be sure to inform the faculty member of that fact . e ) your work and volunteer experience ( if any ) f ) your accomplishments in research ( if any ) g ) your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. student government ( if any ) h ) a list of any honors you have received or expect to receive i ) an explanation about any area in which you consider yourself weak , or any other information you consider helpful <p> You should arrange this information in a systematic way . Provide a cover page that includes a table indicating the school to which you are applying , the name of the program , and the due date for receipt of the letter . You might also add a column to the table for any special notes you have about individual programs . <p> You may want to approach the faculty member shortly before the deadline to see if the professor needs any additional information . ( This will also serve to jog the memory in case the professor has set the letters aside . ) <p> Is there anything else I should do to make letter writing easy for the professor ? Writing letters of recommendation is a time consuming process . Just filling in the information on the recommendation forms ( name , title , school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty signature ) may take up to several hours if a student is applying to a large number of schools . A student who fills in the blanks for the faculty member may find his or her thoughtfulness results in a better letter from a faculty member who appreciates the student 's organizational ability . When requesting the letters , you might ask each faculty member how he prefers to be listed on the recommendation forms . <p> Do not expect the faculty member to spend his/her own money or the department 's money to provide envelopes and stamps . In the packet you give to the faculty members writing your letters , include envelopes that are addressed and include the return address of the faculty member . Make sure that you put enough postage on the envelopes . Type whenever possible . <p> Additional tips : <p> 1 ) Most faculty prefer to send the letters directly to the school . Do not ask the letter writer to return the letters to you unless the institution specifically requests that procedure . <p> 2 ) Since the letter writers invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope that you will be successful , they would like to know the outcome . As a courtesy , please inform those who wrote letters for you whether you were admitted to graduate programs and which ones . The undergraduate and graduate advising offices would also like to know about successful applicants .

Technological innovations have taken place , but the overall condition of humanity is no better . War , violence and poverty are still with us . Technology can not change the condition of humanity . " <p> The discussion of this statement turns on what is meant by " little real progress " from the first sentence , " the overall condition of humanity " in the second sentence , and " the condition of humanity " from the third sentence . To be sure , war , violence and poverty are still with us and we as mankind are probably more aware of these problems worldwide than ever before thanks to advances in technology and communication . But depending upon the definition of progress and the condition of humanity , this would appear to be an incorrect statement . <p> First of all , the phrase " little real progress " from the first sentence must be defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , war , violence and poverty , then perhaps it could be stated that humankind has not made much improvement over the past one hundred years . People are still dying , wars are still being fought , violence is present almost everywhere and there are most likely people in every country in the world living in poverty . However , if the term " progress " is defined not as elimination of these problems but rather a reduction in them , then great progress has been made over the past century . Life expectancies are up in nearly every country of the world due to improvements in medicine and the scientific study of the human body . War and violence , although still present , has been reduced and to a large part confined to certain areas of the world rather than the global wars of the past such was World Wars I and II . Poverty has also been reduced as international trade has lead to economic improvements in many formerly impoverished nations . Very real progress has been made in these areas over the past one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of humanity " and " the condition of humanity " must be defined . If the terms mean that we are all still born into pain , suffer many tragedies during our lives , and still die in the end , then of course the overall condition of humanity is no better than it was one hundred or even one hundred thousand years ago . Life is still life , and no matter what technological innovations come along , it is unlikely that the basic facts of living as a member of the human race will ever change . However , if the term means how we are able to live our lives during the time that we are given , then again tremendous progress has been made during the past century . Cures have been found for many diseases , some of which have officially been completely eliminated . Medical treatments for other diseases have made them less deadly or less debilitating . For example , many cancer victims that would have died in the past can now go on living comfortably and cancer-free after treatment . Diabetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly normal lives . Even poor eyesight can be effectively eliminated through laser surgery . It would seem to be beyond argument that overall , the condition of humanity is much better now than it was one century ago . <p> If one takes a very narrow definition of " progress " and " the condition of humanity " , it could be fairly stated that mankind has made little in the way of advancement over the past century . Millions of people worldwide still live in poverty . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) is killing millions of people with no cure in sight . War and violence continues in the Middle East , Africa and Afghanistan . But to take this narrow point of view would be to ignore the obvious tremendous advances that have been made over the past one hundred years by the human race . As mankind continues on into the twenty-first century , it would be preferable to consider all that has been accomplished over the past one hundred years and to look ahead to future advances over the next century instead of ignoring mankind 's obviously improved circumstances today .

When I managed to squeeze inside the crowd , I saw two drowned boys lying on the beach . They had just been salvaged from the sea . Doctors in a nearby seaside clinic were immediately sent for but on that particular day only one was on duty . She applied first-aid measures to one of the boys and asked a young man , an on-looker in the crowd , to follow what she was doing to save the other boy . Whereas the professionally-trained doctor save her patient with her expertise , the inexperienced young man did not really know how to proceed .

At that time , a secondary education in nursing at a polytechnic school was the highest academic education one could obtain in China . Yet I was convinced that , with the social and economic development of China , nurses were bound to receive higher levels of academic training . Therefore I made persistent efforts to improve my English proficiency and taught myself all the advanced courses in senior middle school .

Meanwhile I continued to accumulate clinical nursing experience and further improve my English proficiency ( in 1993 I scored 610 in my TOEFL test , which was a rare achievement among Chinese nurses at that time ) . <p> My seven-year professional experience as a nurse and my sound command of English theretofore ushered in the golden period of my career . In 1994 , I wrote a job-application letter to the American president of the newly-established XXX Hospital , which is jointed administrated by XX Medical University and the Medical Center of XX University . My impressive qualifications resulted in my exceptional recruitment by the hospital and ever since then I have been working in a predominantly American hospital culture and in a English-speaking environment under the leadership of the American vice president in charge of nursing .

Demonstrating distinguished professional performance and potential , I was promoted to work as Medical-Surgical Nursing Director from 1997 to 2002 , supervising the nurses and their managers on a dozen of floors . I also directed various departments in their ward management , documentation of medical records , disinfection and quarantine , nursing and continued education . I continued to introduce advanced American nursing concepts and procedures and offer regular vocational training to nurses as the hospital leading nursing specialist . I emphasized on the total nursing concept and on the quality improvement of patient-oriented nursing services <p> My greatest challenge and achievement at this hospital so far is working as Director of XX Office .

The SARS epidemic last year has exposed the fragile condition of Chinas public health system . My involvement in XX certification made me realize earlier than others that China sorely needs to make drastic efforts to perfect its public health system . An examination of my own academic background in nursing , my academic and professional background in administration , my exposure to American medical system and practices , makes it apparent to me that a Masters program in Public Health is most appropriate for me in further facilitating my career development .

Besides , the entire replacement of the present coins and paper money system will inevitably hurt millions of coin-collectors as well as those so-called " high-tech phobic people " , who feel at a loss when dealing with such things as ATM , computer network and the Internet . <p> In sum , although theoretically the replacement may bring convenience to people and can avoid certain problems , in practice , the recent developments in technology can only change some aspects of the existing monetary system , not the entire one . 
@@42231305 @2231305/ <h> GRE Test <h> Sample Response to Real GRE Issue Questions <p> Issue # 9 : " It is primarily through identification through social groups that we define ourselves . " <p> As primarily social animals , human beings naturally seek out different groups to which they feel they have a certain sense of belonging . But there are two different aspects of this issue involved : identifying oneself with a social group for its social implications and identifying oneself with a social group for internal needs . A person can have two different identities , one that involves an individual 's self-perception and the way that others see that particular individual . There is a natural dichotomy between the two sides of one 's personality that is usually displayed between the different types of social groups with which an individual may identify oneself . <p> Self-definition can either be honest or dishonest . A person may join a social group because he or she thinks that the people that belong to this type of group are the same as he or she , whether it is true or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she would like to be the same as the people that belong to this particular social group . As one example , consider a person who grew up poor and poorly educated , but became wealthy through the luck of the lottery or an inheritance from an unknown but wealthy relative . This individual then joins a wine-tasting club and buys season tickets to the local Philharmonic Orchestra and opera house . Although this individual knows nothing about wine , orchestras or opera , he or she is seeking to identify him or herself as a culturally literate person simply because the person is now wealthy . Through joining these social groups , the individual is seeking to define him or herself as socially elite , although the only difference now is that the person has great wealth and in reality probably does not fit in with the other members of the groups . In this case , one 's self-definition by identifying with social groups does not match up with how society still identifies the individual . <p> On the other hand , there are individuals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain social groups . At a very basic level , younger people may join gangs based on a sense of identification with certain gang members or gang ideas . By displaying different identifying tattoos or certain colors , these people clearly identify who they are and what they stand for by the particular to which they belong . Certain religious groups also give a clear identity to their members . Joining an Islamic fundamentalist group such as the Taliban or an Orthodox Jewish organization indicates a certain identity that is common to all of its members . Political organizations such as Greenpeace and the National Organization for Women also make a certain statement about the identity of an individual member . In all of these cases , an individual 's self-perception and how others view that individual are probably very similar . These types of organizations speak to a person 's very fundamental values and joining one is probably that person 's way of saying to the world " this is who I am " . <p> Joining other types of groups may or may not indicate a person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , may just be a matter of whichever party your parents belong to . Spending time with a particular group of friends may only mean that you like only one of the people in the group or you have nothing better to do , it may have nothing to do with your self-identification . People that belong to these groups do not necessarily belong to any one social group for identification purposes ; it may be only a matter of convenience . <p> It depends on the individual and the particular social group under discussion as to whether we primarily identify ourselves through association with social groups . Once the individual or the social group has been identified , a determination must still be made as to whether the individual has joined for self-identification purposes or to impress upon others a certain image of that individual .

However , a good resume will attract the attention of the hiring manager and secure a job interview . The purpose of a resume is to disclose your accomplishments and qualifications to a potential employer . If the employer likes what she sees , she will contact you for a face-to-face meeting . <p> Think of your resume as a promotional brochure about you . You need to show a potential employer what you have accomplished and where your experience lies . Your strategy should be to emphasize the experience and skills that a particular employer is looking for . <p> Your resume is also an example of your communication and organizational skills . A well done resume is itself another reminder of what kind of valuable employee you would be . Likewise , a sloppily produced resume is a terrific way to get yourself taken out of the running before it even starts . <p> There is a lot of information available on resumes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . Our advice is to find a good book on resumes and learn the fundamentals of resume writing . Try to stay with the most current material you can ; resume advice follows trends . The Internet is home to plenty of free advice and information , but in most cases that information will be less detailed than a good resume guide . <p> Think of your resume as a promotional brochure about you . You need to show a potential employer what you have accomplished and where your experience lies . Your strategy should be to emphasize the experience and skills that a particular employer is looking for . <p> Keep it concise . Employers have lots to do , so do n't make the mistake of asking them to read through an unnecessarily long resume . A long , wordy resume will put off someone who is already short on time . Resumes should be one page , if possible , and two if absolutely necessary to describe relevant work experience . A two page resume is no advantage if it 's full of information that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use the space only if you need it to fully disclose your accomplishments . <p> Make your words count . Your use of language is extremely important ; you need to sell yourself to an employer quickly and effeciently . Address your potential employer 's needs with a clearly written , compelling resume . <p> Avoid large paragraphs ( over six or seven lines ) . Resumes are often scanned by hiring managers . If you provide small , digestible pieces of information you stand a better chance of having your resume actually read . Use action verbs such as " developed , " " managed , " and " designed " to emphasize your accomplishments . <p> Do n't use declarative sentences like " I developed the ... " or " I assisted in ... " ; leave out the " I. " <p> Avoid passive constructions , such as " was responsible for managing . " It 's not only more efficient to say " Managed , " it 's stronger and more active . <p> Make the most of your experience . <p> Potential employers need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what you can do for them . <p> Do n't be vague . Describe things that can be measured objectively . Telling someone that you " improved warehouse efficiency " does n't say much . Telling them that you " cut requisition costs by 20% , saving the company $3800 for the fiscal year " does . Employers will feel more comfortable hiring you if they can verify your accomplishments . Be honest . There is a difference between making the most of your experience and exaggerating or falsifying it . A falsified resume can be easily spotted by an employer ( if not immediately then during the interview process ) , and if it does n't prevent you from getting the job , it can cost you the job later on . <p> Do n't neglect appearance . Your resume is the first impression you 'll make on a potential employer , and a successful resume depends on more than what you say ; how you say it counts as well . <p> Check your resume for proper grammar and correct spelling-evidence of good communication skills and attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job faster than submitting resume filled with ( easily preventable ) mistakes . <p> Make your resume easy on the eyes . Use normal margins ( 1 " on the top and bottom , 1.25 " on the sides ) and do n't cram your text onto the page . Allow for some breathing room between the different sections . Avoid unusual or exotic font styles ; use simple fonts with a professional look . <p> Use standard , non-textured , fine-grained paper in white or ivory . Keep in mind that textured and dark colored paper may not copy well when the employer makes copies to pass around to other participants in the hiring process . <p> If you need to copy your resume , make sure your copies are clean and clear . Even the best looking resume can be ruined by a poor copier . Use only copiers maintained for professional copying . <p> Target . Target . Target . Emphasize what you can do for an employer . Be specific . If you are going after more than one job opening , customize your resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific position . Remember to only include the experience that is relevant to the job . <p> Eliminate superfluous details . Unnecessary details can take up a lot of valuable space on your resume . <p> Do n't mention personal characteristics such as age , height , and marital status . This is information that employers may not legally solicit from you , and they would probably be more comfortable if you do n't volunteer it yourself . <p> List your hobbies and interests only if you can relate them to the position you 're applying for . If you need room to describe your work experience , avoid this altogether . <p> The phrase " References available upon request " should be left off if you need room to describe your work experience .

Others might describe my decision as preposterous for apparently understandable reasonsthat to received specialized education in computer science and technology at that time ( and even now ) is regarded as a guarantee of lucrative a job and stable income , especially so when I had great potential for it as I entered XX with very outstanding performance during the highly competitive national university entrance examinations . Nevertheless , against the remonstrations on the part of my parents , friends and former middle school teachers , I persisted with my decision .

With double efforts re-doubled , I achieved top scholastic performance not only in terms of my computer subjects but also in terms of my biological subjects , completing in one semester the coursework usually for two semesters . Although those were the most challenging days in my life heretofore , with an average of 5 or 6 hours of sleep a day , I enjoyed making relentless efforts . By the time when my trial study came to an end , I felt that I have taken the most important step on the way to realize my aspirations . <p> The College of Biological Science of XX is one of the most prestigious biological institutions in China , where you can find many of the best minds of the countrys youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition is fierce in this college .

Throughout my undergraduate program so far , I have been ranked first in a total of 93 students in my grade and was admitted into our Colleges National Experimental Class of Scientific Subjects . Diligence and perseverance can explain my high GPA , but the real underlying factor is my deep love for biology as a scientific discipline . Those factors are combined to enable me not only quickly digest and absorb what has been taught in class but also to immerse myself in extensive extracurricular readings of latest publications . As an undergraduate , I have won first-class scholarship , special-class scholarship , and the XX Scholarship from the United States . In addition , I received third prize at the national English contest for university students , and excellence awards for my Band-IV and Band-VI National College English Proficiency Tests , the latter being the most difficult standardized English proficiency test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English language . <p> The world of biology represents a totally different world from that of computer in that the former is vibrantly alive , rich and colorful . It is ever so fascinating to explore the wonders of various life processes . Among a rich variety of course selections , I have been most interested in plant biology , genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , cell biology , plant physiology , and advanced microbiology . They have allowed me to gain insightful understandings of the foundation , development , differentiation and proliferation of life on the molecular and cellular levels . While informing me of important knowledge , those courses have also exposed me to many fields of which man is still ignorant , hence my intensified desire to probe into those unknown but exciting realms .

For more than one year , I have been performing experiments in my lab , acquiring useful experimental skills and improving my ability to analyze experiment results . For instance , in doing Northern experiment on molecular hybridization , I acquired the skill of RNA extraction , and developed a tentative mastery of the extraction and filtering of toxin , FPLC , electrophoresis , congenial grafting , hyperfiltration , lyophilization , and other techniques . In the tree transformation experiment , I practiced the process and the methods of the carrier configuration .

In a competitive environment consisting countless elitist students , I found myself only ranking 32nd among a total of 113 students in the final exam of the first year .

It is up to us all to do our best within this limited life span and to emit as much heat and light as possible so as to illuminate the whole world while providing warmth to ourselves before the candle of life dies out . The saying brings me home that life is limited , but love and relentless efforts can be a torch that kindles it and makes it most valuable . For me , this torch is nothing other than biology . I remember that when I was a little child , I would often go to a nearby pond in the afternoon to observe the little fish , shrimps , snails and the waterweeds in it . Their tranquil and free life would always arouse my great admiration . In the evening , by the roadside lamps , I would try to catch some crickets to be kept in a pot to enjoy their beautiful music .

Being mischievous , I dug out the flower trees my father planted in pots to observe their root system and sometimes poured hot water into the pots . On other occasions , I would open up the belly of the fish that my mother was preparing for food to observe their viscera . This also reflects the strong desire of a teenager to probe into the mysteries of life . It was with those inborn impulses that I have chosen life science as the objective of my career . <p> After my college matriculation examination , I applied for biochemistry and molecular biology and was admitted into Nankai University .

In this account I made extensive extracurricular readings and reflections to sponge up all range of knowledge so as to upgrade my comprehensive capacity and placed importance on fostering creativity of new ideas , a broader professional vision and an insight into the frontier areas . In addition , as member of our university 's Biology Association , I often participated in activities publicizing scientific knowledge , allowing the general public to know about the science of life and to understand the secrets of life so that they can treasure the life of ourselves and of our fellow creatures . <p> With relentless efforts , In September 1999 I entered Peking University as a graduate student.

After much careful consideration , I abandoned the Ph.D . degree program at Peking University . Nevertheless , on account of my outstanding performance at Peking University , I was recommended by my advisor to work at National Lab of Molecular Oncology , Cancer Institute , China Academy of Medical Science &amp; Peking Union Medical College headed by Prof. Min Wu , an academician .

From this , I struck upon the idea to pursue an advanced degree program . After much investigation , I have come to the conclusion that XXX University is my ideal choice for undertaking this program .

The science of geology encompasses a multiplicity of subjects that pose important challenges in comprehensive qualities , analytical skills and holistic thinking on the part of the prospective geologists . This nature of geology accorded perfectly with my temperament of meeting challenges . Petroleum Geology , Sedimentology , Geochemistry , Basin Analysis , Field Geology , Tectonics , Organic Geochemistry and Stratigraphy were among the most important courses that enabled me to lay a solid professional foundation .

But as I started the Masters program , I decided that I was to concentrate on the improvement of my research abilities and creativity by participating in as many research projects as possible in which I could put my theoretical knowledge into practice . I was lucky to be able to work together with some senior specialists from whom I learned the standard procedures of geological research . Among many research projects I have participated in during my graduate studies , thexxxxxxof China can be cited as the most important one .

Home of petroleum industry , the United States plays a leading role in geological research and petroleum prospection . While the United States has started the commercial utilization of geological energy sources other than petroleum , such as coalbed methane , China has not even take any major steps in this aspect . At one conference , I was shocked and ashamed to learn that some Chinese geologists were still involved in the researches which had already been undertaken by their overseas counterparts 20 years ago .

A galaxy of accomplished scholars and researchers are engaged in studies of geological theories and theories of petroleum geology .

@@42231321 @2231321/ <h> Sample Statement of Purpose for Mechanical Engineering <p> I was born into a poor family in a remote mountainous village in Shandong Province . The untimely death of my uncle , who was very close to me , because of illness and poverty shocked me to such an extent that I once decided to drop out of the school and to help support the family . But my parents did not allow me to do so . Illiterate as they were , they nonetheless understood that " Education is the key , " and were anxious to put this key in my pocket , in spite of all their difficulties . With the growth of age , I now have a much clearer sense of purpose for my life , which is not just to help one family , but to lift many more out of poverty and ignorance . <p> I remember that I proved to be a fast learner as early as at elementary school . For instance , I was the only one student in the entire school who could solve linear equations with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning were Mathematics , Physics , and Chemistry . Every year , I participated in national or provincial contests in Mathematics , Physics , and Chemistry for high school students , and won either a first or a second prize . With this kind of training , I gradually developed a confidence in my ability to compete effectively in any academic circumstance . In 1996 , I entered the famed Tsinghua University as a student majoring in Precision Instruments and Mechanics , with scores at the National University Entrance Examinations ranking the first in the region and the fifth in the province . <p> In Tsinghua University I found the gateway to the beautiful garden of Mechanics . What I saw in its Micron and Nanotechnology Center , such as electric generators only a few microns large , and various laser devices in precision measurement , carried me away completely . When I learned that in near the future , Nano-electronics could produce pocket-sized giant computers , and make fragile porcelain ware exceedingly robust , and , especially , that Nanotechnology will play a central role in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up to pursue a career in this exciting area , for the rest of my life . <p> During my undergraduate years , I built a solid foundation in the Basics of Precision Measurement , Material Science , Precision Equipment Engineering , and other related areas , earning excellent academic records . In addition , I made concentrated effort in developing a strong ability in lab research , especially during my undergraduate senior studies and during my Master 's Program . I once designed a piezoelectrically driven micro-jet , following the idea of the spray mechanism of the ink jet printer with certain micro-mechanical processing . On the basis of this research , I invented a new model of micro-jet for lung treatment . During the several months of lab research and the writing of my graduation thesis " Experimental Research on Micro-jets , " I learned a great deal about power electronics , microelectromechanic systems , silicon processing , and engineering mechanics , and significantly enriched my lab experience through dozens of lab testing projects in precision measurement , in areas such as the sugar thickness sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the applications of multimedia technologies , and the use of the single-chip computer . <p> Besides lab research , I also did part-time work with three companies , involved in the research and development of products of micro-mechanic systems , database , and the GIS . With these work experiences , I developed an ability to conduct research work in corporal environments , and also attained a keen insight into the practical and commercial sides of micro-mechanics . I applied my knowledge of MEMS to the preparation process of the micro-flow sensor produced by the company . For this project I looked up a large amount of technical literature , which also involved much translation for those who could not read in English . My English improved considerably , after many hours spent in the library reading IEEE publications . In this environment , I remain a fast learner , because I have learned how to learn , not just what to learn . I in fact learned some of the computer programming software , such as Visual Basic , Visual C++ , and Delphi , on my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I notice that most of the key equipments I used in the lab were foreign imports . Since the manuals that came with them often did not cover all the technical details of their internal structures , it made them rather difficult to operate . With this experience I began to realize that China is still way behind Western countries in the development of precision engineering . I wish to pursue a higher degree abroad , with a focus on MEMS , and especially on micro-mechanical systems . To my great surprise , I found that Arizona State University has a highly advanced graduate program in Mechanical Engineering , which will meet my needs perfectly . I have visited the web page of the university several times , and have some contact with Professor Ampere Tseng , whose research areas seem very attractive to me . Professor Tseng has in fact encouraged me to apply to its graduate program . <p> There remain some problems in the lab experimentation that can not be solved with all the knowledge I presently have . For instance , how can we produce orifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we can observe their dynamic characteristics ? To realize this , all the technical details of the system have to be taken into consideration . The system not only consists of the objects to be processed and the processing devices , but also consists of the working environment , mechanical and environmental control , training of the operating personnel , specifics of operation , and the fundamental understanding of the entire process . All those procedures must be properly handled in order to ensure the successful production of the smallest orifices possible , with perfect accuracy under the help of the most sophisticated precision instruments . I look forward to finding answers to this and many other problems during my graduate study at ASU . <p> In my future program at your prestigious graduate school , I intend to concentrate on the following areas of study : ( 1 ) MEMS ; ( 2 ) CAD/CAM/CIMS ; ( 3 ) Micro-Mechanical System ; ( 4 ) Micro-Flow ; and ( 5 ) System Control . In accordance with this , I would like to divide my studies into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my studies of the foundational courses in MEMS to construct a firmer theoretical basis to expand the related knowledge in electro-mechanical integration . In the second stage , I plan to undertake some research projects that can demonstrate leading technology and creativity , especially in the field of MEMS technology and its application , so that I may develop myself into a specialist in this field . Finally , since the 21st Century is bound to be a century of nanotechnology and since China 's accession into WTO has created many technical challenges and opportunities , I believe that nanotechnology , especially MEMS , will become the prevalent technology in the new millennium . This will be a rare opportunity for the maturation and the development of nanotechnology and its products . By that time I can contribute my professional expertise to this important process as a leading scientist in China .

@@42231324 @2231324/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Political Science <p> In my dreamscape , I used to be haunted by a magic mirror that reflected the past , the present and the future of human society . I asked the mirror what this represented and the mirror answered by showing me the celebrated Oracle of Delphi of ancient GreeceKnow Thyself . I could never forget such a dream , nor could I interpret it . It was only after I studied law and political science that I seemed to have found the answer . As a matter of fact , the magic mirror that kept obsessing me is jurisprudence and political science , which expunge us of the dust on our minds eye , enabling us to examine ourselves as human beings from the perspective of reason and to develop an increasingly clear understanding of the world in which we live .

As is claimed by Cicero that law is the supreme form of reason , I yearn to experience the power of reason through the study of law and through legal trainings . Motivated by my intense interest in the legal and political systems of the United States and Britain , I chose to major in International Law as I embarked on my undergraduate program at the Law School of the University of International Business and Economics ( UIBE ) . The Law School has been designed this year by the Ministry of Education of China as one of the two state-level key research centers in international law . At this prestigious institution , the most important thing I did was to acquaint myself with major classics in law and in political thought by political and philosophical thinkers in western history , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My voluminous reading of Western classics includes The Republic by Plato , Politics and Athenian Constitution by Aristotle , de Re Publica and de Legibus by Cicero , The City of God by St. Augustine , On Law , Morality and Politics by Thomas Aquina , Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes , L homme machine by La Mettrie , Ethics Geometrically Demonstrated by Spinoza , Essay concerning Human Understanding and Civil Government by John Locke , On Liberty and Representative Government by J. S. Mill , The Prince by Nicolo Machiavelli , Treatise on Human Nature and Of Civil Liberty by David Hume , Metaphysical Elements of Justice by Immanuel Kant , On the Law of War and Peace by Hugo Grotius , Economy and Society by Max Webber , and A Theory of Justice by John Rawls .

Whenever I study the technical literature , I always have a strong feeling that I am tracing the forces , amidst diverse and disparate phenomena , that have governed the development of human society . My educational backgrounds in Common Law , Comparative Law , Comparative Constitution , International Law , and Western Jurisprudence not only exposed me to the basic research methodologies in Anglo-American politics and law but also created a sound foundation for my more advanced studies in the future . My devoted efforts to coursework rewarded me with concrete scholastic achievements , with particularly outstanding performance in all the specialty-related courses . My GPA is &gt;3.7 , ranking top third in the entire Law School . My tangible rewards also include many first-class and second-class scholarships from the School . <p> My immersion in western classics in the fields of politics and law , ranging from ancient Greece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop some distinctive understanding concerning the evolution of Chinese and Western political and legal systems within different cultural frameworks . In the historical development of human civilization , the West was much ahead of the Oriental China in breaking away from the Medieval Period and its aftermath to achieve the emancipation in personal value and identity . Individualism and emphasis on the legitimacy of human rights became the prevailing value orientation in the civic society . The essence of " rule by law " in the contemporary West , founded on the philosophical conception of human nature as evil , actually lies in imposing legal checks on public rights . By contrast , China is a country predominated by the ancient tradition of " rule by man " , stressing human and moral factors in societal administration based on the notion of human nature as " good " . Unfortunately , such a notion resulted in law becoming the subsidiary of autocracy in Chinese society , a handy instrument for the execution of state will and state power . Chinas cultural tradition and institutional mechanism lack the idea of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has never been any attempt to equate law with justice , individual rights and social contract . Again , in Chinese legal culture , there is hardly any extant legal legacy that is accords with the modern spirit of " rule by law " . In a word , China lacks the kind of legal basis that has characterized the Western tradition . Over the past two decades , China has made encouraging achievements in perfecting its legal system and obviously this process requires Western input . <p> I would like to cite several important facts from my experience that point to my potential in undertaking your Ph . D. program . For the first three years of my undergraduate program , I did internships during each summer vacation at Beijing Municipal Procuratorate and Beijing Municipal Anti-Corruption Bureau , an experience which has helped me gain some insights into the existing conditions of Chinas political system and judicial system . Secondly , I want to call your attention to my English proficiency . Prior to entering university , I won second prize in National Olympics English Contest and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for High School Students , not to mention numerous other awards at provincial and municipal levels . In university , English is widely used in a lot of courses , especially in case studies in which all the cases and reference books are in English . I am the only student in my School to have achieved straight As in all English courses . As a sophomore , I worked part-time as senior translator for Beijing Zhehui Translation Agency and I was the correspondent and broadcaster of the English program of our universitys broadcasting station . Since August 2001 , I have also been working part-time at Beijing New Impression Times &amp; Culture Co. , Ltd where , as project assistant , I have been responsible for public relations and for arranging a number of cultural events including Piano Recital by Israeli pianist Einat Fabrikant , Israeli Duo Piano Concert by Siwen and Silver , musical play Madam Swing by Russian Stroisky Jazz and Modern Dance Troupe , etc . On those occasions , I demonstrated my English proficiency and my skillful communication . <p> My four-year education in jurisprudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , realizing that a mere undergraduate education can by no means endow me with the requisite knowledge and scholarly qualities for an accomplished political scientist , I would like to pursue a Ph.D . program that only your esteemed university can offer . In China , genuine scholarship in political science has been done only over the past two decades ( since 1979 ) and this fledgling nature necessarily makes the scholarship very immature . It is true that Chinese history does boast a number of prominent political thinkers , but the concept of politics as evolved over the two thousand years of Chinese feudal society differs from that of the West in many fundamental aspects . Politics is the most direct and powerful lever affecting a society and constitutional government is the cornerstone of the civilized society . In the West , the idea of constitutional government has become an unshakable and universal value which has shaped a distinctive political culture of constitutional government . In comparison , the politics that we have in China is what might be designated as a political culture of party constitutional government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime must be implicitly obeyed . This perverse concept has caused the constitution to be prostituted to the will of the ruling party and the public rights are allowed to impinge upon individual rights willfully under various pretexts . A popular theory concerning the relative supremacy between the party and the law is that in legislation the party is supreme whereas in jurisdiction and in law enforcement the law is supreme . With this logical absurdity , how can the supreme authority of law be guaranteed ? How can individual liberty and human rights be protected and realized ? An essential point is that a nation deprived of its constitutional government is like a person who has lost his soul . <p> It is encouraging to notice that major reforms are being undertaken in Chinas political and legal spheres . But such reforms are most fruitful when guided by sound theories in political science . For this challenging objective , the existing theories of political science in China are apparently inadequate and those circumstances allow me to realize that this is the right time for me to develop myself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D . program at UC Berkley , I would like to focus on Political Theory , Comparative Politics , Legal Philosophy , Jurisprudence and possibly Public Law , areas that I am most interested in and in which I believe I can accomplish the most substantial research achievements . With its undisputable position in political science and its research-intensive program , UC Berkley will permit me to receive the kind of education necessary for realizing my academic objectives . <p> For me , political science is an academic discipline that can also serve as my personal belief . If an academic subject can be studied and researched both as a discipline and as a belief , it will be the greatest joy of my life and it is all too natural for me to pursue it as my lifelong career . My ideal is to emulate Cicero who is both a great scholar and a great political practitioner . It will indeed be a worthy cause if I can exert a discernible impact on the Chinese society with the political ideas that I can develop with the help of an advanced education in your program .

All this probably makes me an economist , but my objective is to become a good one . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took with Professor Branson I decided that there is nothing more interesting than international economics . Professor A made issues of monetary economics and government policy fascinating . Lectures delivered by Professor B attracted me to labor market problems .

One of the reasons I want to study further is to reach at least the same level of intuitiveness and panoramic view of the subject as my teachers have . <p> My Master of Arts degree was in the field of Health Economics , which I am very interested in . It was mostly empirical dissertation . My dissertation was titled " .. " and I worked under the guidance of Professor C.

My master 's thesis has been presented at the " Russian Economic And Political Institutions In Transition " conference and currently we are preparing it for publication . <p> At this time I am also doing empirical research devoted to inflation and monetary policy . I feel cautious specifying which area of economics interests me most for further study , but I do not think that this is a drawback . I find economics particularly attractive for the fact that it is broad , and has not yet been split into a set of narrow sub-branches -- economists all speak almost the same language . I also think that in the face of complexity we face in this discipline , it would ineffective to specialize too narrowly . <p> This year I realized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies . Being a teaching assistant in Professor A 's Macroeconomics and Advanced Macroeconomics classes , I understood a lot of effort must be applied for a good student to turn into a good teacher . I feel that a similar gap lies between a good student and a good researcher . <p> I am a hard-working and determined person , and I am ready for a new leap in my economics career . I will work hard in hope that the quantity of the effort I put in will result in high quality knowledge . The fact is that the best possible supervisors and a highly competitive atmosphere are necessary for this quality . The only reasonable decision for me was to aim for such a place . All this gives me the motivation to apply to Princeton University .

@@42231331 @2231331/ <h> How to Write Powerful Letter of Recommendation <p> Many undergraduates ask their GSIs for letters of recommendation . Undergraduates sometimes feel more comfortable approaching a GSI than they would a faculty member . Furthermore , GSIs for large lecture courses often have more individual contact with undergraduates than faculty members do , and thus are often in a better position to write a detailed letter of recommendation . So , how do you write a good letter of recommendation ? <p> Before You Write the Letter <p> First , decide if you are the best person to write the letter . A letter of recommendation from a faculty member will carry more weight than a letter from a GSI . However , GSIs often know students better than faculty members , and may be able to write a more detailed , and thus more useful , letter . One solution may be for the GSI to write the letter and have it co-signed by the faculty member . <p> Ask the student what motivated him or her to ask you . Also ask if there are others that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy to ask someone else , and you can reassure the student , or encourage the student to ask a professor . <p> Also , decide if you can honestly recommend the student . If not , suggest that he/she consider asking another person . For example , if you feel that you can not honestly recommend the student , or you feel that you can not do so wholeheartedly , you may wish to suggest to the student that someone else might be in a better position to write the recommendation letter . <p> Discuss with the student the institution , program , or field of study to which he or she is applying . This will help you to decide whether you can recommend the student and give you a greater sense of what to include in or exclude from the letter . Your letter should point out how the student 's particular strengths fit well with the chosen discipline . <p> Ask the student for a list of paperwork that must be completed by you together with a list of dates and addresses . If the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the materials for different institutions in different envelopes or folders . Check that the student has signed any relevant waivers or other forms . In addition , check that the student has provided a stamped addressed envelope in which to place each completed recommendation . <p> Request copies of papers or exams that the student has submitted in your course to help you recall the details of their work . It is extremely important to give specific examples to back up your more general claims . This is easier to do if you have copies of past work in front of you when you are writing the letter . It is also helpful to check the grade records , if they are available , as many recommendation forms ask you to state the student 's position in the class ( for example , in the top 5% , 10% , etc. ) .

@@42231334 @2231334/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Industrial Design <p> I was an industrial designer before I knew that I was . Suppose you were required to remove the scales of a fish or the skin of a potato , what would you do ? My solution was simplefind 10 lids of bear bottles and nail them , inside out , in two rows onto a strip of wood . The zigzag structures would make this a handy tool , which was at once cost-efficient and environmentally friendly as it was recycled from waste industrial materials that would otherwise be buried in dump hills . Though this hand-made industrial product I invented when I was an elementary school student was not manufactured on a commercial basis , my parents and all the neighbors liked it for its practicality . <p> Yet , I was deeply aware of its inherent limitations . It was coarse and rough and did not look beautiful . I told myself that I must create a beautiful design . Then the opportunity came . Representing our school , I participated in a XX and , by exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic " design which brought me a winning prizing . <p> In retrospect , it was my family background that triggered my creative design impulses . Both of my parents are architectural designers and in their studios I could meet their colleagues and friends who were architects , structure engineers , interior designers and furniture designers . Under their influence , my early design works already manifested three essential elements of modern industrial designfunctional pragmatism , aesthetic appeal , and environmental friendliness . <p> Now , on the verge of completing my undergraduate program in industrial design at the Department of XXX of XX University , I have gained a heightened understanding of industrial design as a scientific discipline . I have not only laid a solid academic foundation by excelling in all my specialized courses and achieving top scores in almost all of them ; I have also improved my practical design skills through producing dozens of refined and sensitive works ( please refer to my portfolio ) . As a junior student , I represented my university to participate in two international design competitions " XX " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completing our competing pieces " XX " and " XX " <p> My undergraduate program is a journey of explorations and discoveries . While developing my scholastic aptitudes and practical skills , I have honed my aesthetic sensibility , perception of the world around us , and understanding of human needs . It is a process of unraveling my potentials and giving free play of my creative mind . My designs are characterized by bold originality , tempered by meticulous attention to even the minutest detail . In choosing industrial design , I have given full ventilation to my artistic impulses and concern for practical human demands . <p> Yet , a humiliating experience wrought an indelible memory on my mind , triggering my determination to pursue an advanced education in industrial design . At the end of the first semester , our department received a delegation of industrial designers from a German university . When touring XX , one of the delegates said to me : " I do not see many good design examples in this oriental metropolis . The gray buildings , with their uniform colors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street lamps , bicycles , and cars , hardly any of them capture your attention . " I wanted to protest , but I had to admit that the first-rate designs are those of foreign products and the so-called good domestic designs are mostly copies of western design ideas . Under such circumstances , how to be truly creative becomes a question that has long obsessed me . <p> As far as I am concerned , the only way out of this dilemma confronting Chinese designers is to " think globally and act locally . " Against the backdrop of globalization , it is not that Chinese designers are not creative ; the only problem is that they have failed to channel their creative impulses into international styles . To think globally is to develop international perspectives that may enable them to become leaders in a rapidly changing global culture . To act locally is to transmute their private and national experiences into tangible design expressions . The integration of the international thinking and local action will lead to design works at once aesthetically appealing and thematically eloquent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that they are fused with international sensibilities . <p> Toward such an objective , it is necessary for me to go to the cultural melting pot that is the XX to experience how cultural pluralism has contributed to creative design and how the faculty and students of different cultural backgrounds communicate and interact with one another . I would like to explore the role that desiring , designing and producing play in the birth of a creative work . I would like to seek solution to two important questions " How is it possible for me , as a native Chinese , to imbue the Chinese cultural elements and styles with new , modern , and global ones ? " and " What 's the new role of designers with regard to the changing economic conditions of today and tomorrow ? " I really want to become a designer who is an articulate original thinker , demonstrates leadership skills and seeks to use design as a vehicle for discovery and self-expression . <p> However , being a mere designer solely devoted to the solution of technical issues is not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " total design program " in which the designer is not solely responsible for originating creative concepts but also for assuming the role of a manager who links up the otherwise discrete steps in the creation of a finished design product . The birth of a satisfying product is not simply determined by the pure design factors . It also depends on inter-departmental coordination , on technical support from engineering sciences and on marketing strategies . Otherwise , even the most original ideas would die in their infancy . In other words , a total design program is a perfect marriage of design objectives and business objectives . The designer is required to play a growing role in the management of a design program . Therefore , the idea of " design for designs sake " is not sufficient . Designers need to be informed of the market feedbacks in order to deliver a total solution that addresses the clients needs on all fronts , including business details . In a word , the designer must have a clear awareness of the business context in which the design must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek answer to the question " How can I improve my skills to interact with other players in a particular design project and even serve as an agent for both the buyer/user and the seller/manufacturer ? " I have attempted to hunt for an answer to this question by doing an internship this summer at a local company that designs advertisements for industrial products . It is so encouraging to find that the M.F.A. program offered by the School of Art &amp; Design of the University of XX addresses this issue by treating the often overlooked " distribution " as a major component of a comprehensive , articulated process of creation . In order to ensure that creative work ultimately engages an audience in some context , your program teaches students to explore intentional distribution options , as well as issues of economic feasibility , information communication technology and social networking . <p> Through your program , I will be taught how to expand the intellectual reach of creative work and to utilize a comprehensive process for bringing creative work into the world . Apart from coursework , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer collaborative projects , culminating activities including public exhibitions , creations in individual private studios , and group presentations of creative works .

The backward teaching methodology and the prevailing pedagogical ideology have rendered Chinese education out of place with the modern international development in education . On the macro level , the current education theory and practice in China lag significantly behind advanced countries in the West . For instance , though education via the internet has achieved considerable development in past two years , in practical operation such education has more often than not deteriorated into an extended form of the conventional examination-oriented education instead of a really interactive process .

Meanwhile , the pursuit for higher levels of educational development and of the quality of life has largely transformed the educational value orientation of the general public . The educational model that is centered around the cognitive and intellectual instruction has been seriously questioned . Greater attention has been devoted to the cultivation of well-developed personality and to the ontological status of the individual in education . Such issues as the internal studies of education science , scientific decision-making in education , and meta-education have also been increasingly emphasized upon . There have also been innovations in educational research methodology . The tendency has been to combine modern technology with humanistic research categories and with naturalistic research categories , and to organically integrate qualitative descriptions with quantitative descriptions . It is also important to carry out educational experimentations in which educational predictions are complemented by educational feedbacks . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made the comprehensive application of diverse educational approaches necessary . Those new horizons are what fascinate me . <p> In view of the following qualifications that I have acquired , I believe that I will acquit myself satisfactorily in the prospective Ph.D . program in education that I am currently endeavoring to apply for . First and foremost , as is often claimed , one 's interest is one 's best director . I believe that I will do well what I am really interested in doing . Secondly , though I majored in economics as an undergraduate , my trainings during that stage helped develop effective modes of thinking and research approaches . In addition , I conscientiously self-studied many works related to education , including A Developmental History of Educational Science in the West , which enabled me to construct a solid groundwork for more advanced studies in this field . Next , it can be safely asserted that education and economics are not entirely separated . For example , it is necessary to apply many statistical methods in educational psychology and my academic record indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I am particularly attracted by the School 's powerful pedagogical resource , vibrant intellectual atmosphere and a comprehensive curriculum . I plan to apply for a degree program in Instructional Technology or Educational Psychology , both of which enjoy unparalleled academic reputation in the world . My application for Instructional Technology is motivated by my strong interest in the application of modern science and technology , especially the information technology represented by the Internet , in the field of education and in the nature of a series of revolutionary changes resulting thereof . Instructional Technology is a new discipline that has emerged as a result of the rapid development of modern communication technology since the late 20th century .

The tendency in the 21st century is to emphasize on the micro research of educational activities and against this backdrop educational psychology will be attached greater importance . In Instructional Technology , I would like to focus on the following studies : how to improve educational efficiency by applying research results from natural sciences and engineering technology ; how to explore the combination and coordination of pedagogical contents and to improve teaching methodology by exploiting the theoretical findings from psychology and educational science concerning the process of teaching and learning .

It is my conviction that , in the United States , advanced educational theories , technologies and information will facilitate me immensely in the achievement of remarkable academic progress , fulfilling my aspiration to become an accomplished professional in the field of education .

@@42231340 @2231340/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Guide to Legal Practice Areas <h> A Note About Legal Practice Areas <p> Many thanks to the William Mitchell College of Law for allowing us to reproduce its " Guide to Legal Practice Areas . " Take a look at the wide variety of specializations it describes , and consider which one(s) might be right for you . <p> In doing so , remember that you will NOT be a specialist in anything when you graduate from law school . Law schools provide a general education across many areas of the law . Late in your second year , or in your third year , you will be free to focus on courses that interest you , but coursework alone will not make you adept at any particular field . Law schools do NOT expect you to know or declare any specialization to gain admission , and you do NOT have to choose one before graduation . Nevertheless , if you know what you are interested in , you can try to plan your elective courses and summer jobs to prepare you for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly express interest in three fields that are often misunderstood . They are international law , patent/intellectual property law , and sports law . If you are interested in one of these fields , you need to understand what it really entails , because it might not be what you expect . For example : <p> " International " law is a term of art that means , in essence , the law among nations . International law is a narrow field covering treaties , international agreements , human rights , and the likethe stuff of State Department lawyers and diplomats . If you are interested in that , fine . But when most students say they want to practice " international law , " they simply mean that they want to work overseas . If you want to work overseas for a private U.S. law firm , chances are good that you will not practice international law ; rather , you will focus on contracts , real estate deals , and other types of business law in a foreign setting . Some law schools offer programs in " international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using that term . If you are willing to accept a position overseas , it is very helpful to have experience in a foreign language , or at least some study abroad or travel abroad experience . <p> If you are an international student studying in the U.S. , admission to a U.S. law school can be quite a challenge . There are a number of explanations for this fact . First , a U.S. law degree is rarely recognized overseasit will not make you a lawyer in your home country . Second , even if you are admitted to law school in the U.S. , you may not be eligible for law practice . You need to be eligible to stay in the U.S. , and you must still be admitted to the bar of a state , and many states either require you to be a citizen , or require that an attorney swear an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States . State bars do extensive background checks covering many years , and it is not always possible to complete this check when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a U.S. citizen , you should contact each law school to see if it admits non-citizens and then contact each state bar association where you would wish to practice to see if you can be admitted . Many law schools offer their foreign students an alternative degreean LL.M. , which is essentially a masters degree in law . It will not allow you to practice law in the United States , but it could prove valuable upon return to your home country . <p> Patent/Intellectual property law concerns protecting inventors creations . " Creations " can include , for example , a new machine or process , a logo , a piece of music , or a poem . The field tends to be broken up into those who practice patent law , a very specialized form of law that seeks patent recognition before the U.S. Patent Court , and those who undertake other fields such as trademark and copyright law . Many law firms require at least their patent lawyers , and sometimes all of their intellectual property lawyers , to have an undergraduate degree in engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you like intellectual property law , but lack such a degree , you might wish to focus on non-patent work , or on patent litigationwhere you do not seek patents , but rather litigate in regular federal court to protect and defend existing patents . <p> " Sports law , " like international law , is often misunderstood . A good sports law attorney essentially practices regular old contract and business law in a sports context . Sports law attorneys might take a sports law course in law school , but its more important to get a good background in contracts , tax , labor and employment law , and mediation and negotiation . Whatever the specific field , a good business attorney needs a solid background in at least these areas . <p> If you have any questions about legal practice fields after reviewing this document , please feel free to ask : stop by or send us an e-mail , and well try our best to get you timely and relevant information about specific areas , including the latest " hot " practice areas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * <h> William Mitchell College of Law Guide to Legal Practice Areas <p> The following is a breakdown of some of the most common practice areas you will encounter in the traditional practice of law . This is by no means an inclusive list . It is meant to serve only as a guide , and to give you a very general and brief overview of what an attorney in any given area is likely to encounter in terms of legal issues , his or her clients , and the types of problems he or she might be called upon to solve . You will find that many practice areas overlap , and include elements of one or more others . Also , some of these terms describe a " style " of practice , such as " General Practice " or " Litigation , " while other terms used here relate to a specific area of substantive law . <h> Some Helpful , but Very General &amp; Brief Definitions : <p> Criminal Law encompasses those matters that are acts in violation of penal law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . Criminal matters are always prosecuted by a federal , state , or local government bodyin other wordsthe people . Criminal defense can be handled by the public sector or the private sector ( law firms ) . Conviction , punishment or acquittal is the desired result of a criminal case . <p> Civil Law includes those actions brought to enforce , redress , or protect private rights . A sum of money is assessed for violations of civil law . <h> Most Private Law Firms are divided into two general areas : <p> The Litigation Group : These are the trial lawyers . Attorneys in the litigation group are involved in all the steps of the process for those legal issues filed in court . A litigator ' s work includes the preparation , discovery , the trial itself , and potentially the appeals process . <p> The Transactional Group : These are the " deal-makers . " These lawyers are likely to handle many corporate issues such as financing projects , mergers and acquisitions , and securities . Transactional work will also include real estate transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to make it interesting , any transactional matter can end up in litigation . <h> Administrative Law <p> Certain governmental bodies are charged with administering and implementing particular legislation . Examples are worker ' s compensation commissions , tax commissioner , public service commissions , Federal Trade Commission , and so forth . These bodies are called agencies , commissions ( i. e. , Securities and Exchange Commission ) , corporations ( i. e. , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ) , boards ( i. e. , Federal Reserve Board of Governors ) , departments ( i. e. , Department of Education ) , or divisions . These bodies have authority to carry out the terms of the law , and to create regulations for the conduct of business before them . This is distinguished from legislative authoritythat is , the authority to make laws . Attorneys who work for these bodies are involved in compliance with regulations , rules , orders , and decisions to carry out the regulatory powers and duties of such agencies . <p> Additionally , lawyers from many practice areas encounter administrative issues in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative agency . Any business that is in an industry that is " regulated , " such as health care , environmental science , manufacturing , aviation , or securities is subject to administrative authority . Therefore , attorneys in many practice areas are charged with ensuring that their clients ' business practices adhere to the standards set forth by administrative agencies empowered to interpret and regulate business activity within a given industry . <h> Aviation Law <p> An aviation practice can range from the representation of clients involved in litigation arising out of a crash of a large commercial airliner to defending a lost baggage claim . Aviation law involves the basic tort law concepts of negligence , breach of warranty and strict liability as well as contract law . Attorneys may represent aircraft or aircraft component manufacturers , airlines , private pilots or other parties in the general aviation industry , or work with an administrative body such as the Federal Aviation Administration . There are also transactional attorneys practicing aviation law , such as those rendering advice to a corporate client that wishes to purchase an aviation-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banking &amp; Finance <p> A banking and finance practice within a private law firm can represent a wide spectrum of clients in the financial and commercial areas , including banks , bank holding companies , and clients with banking affiliations . These attorneys have substantial knowledge in state and federal banking regulation , enforcement actions , tax law , bank mergers and acquisitions , bankruptcy , commercial paper , secured financing , real estate and Uniform Commercial Code matters . Lawyers with this expertise are also found within the banking institutions themselves in a corporate setting . This practice area is largely transactional , and overlaps with many other areas of law . The banking and financial industry is heavily regulated , at the federal and state level , so many attorneys are needed in compliance work , and occasionally administrative law matters . <h> Bankruptcy Law <p> This area of law includes aspects of corporate law , litigation , commercial law , tax law , and others . A lawyer ' s negotiation skills are primary in a bankruptcy practice . The clients ' ultimate goals are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors so there is an opportunity to reorganize or rehabilitate the business , or in the case of lenders , to maximize their recovery . These goals are usually achieved through direct negotiations between the parties , a " work-out " in which the debt is restructured , or a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Laws . <h> Civil Litigation <p> Civil litigation runs the gamut from a basic marriage dissolution to a complex , mass torts case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants with millions of dollars at stake . In fact , any legal issue can be litigated . For example , while the probate process is generally transactional , a will can be contested and the dispute can be settled in court . While there is a very structured set of procedures in the litigation process , it can also be an amoebathat isthe case can take twists and turns , and change in ways you don ' t anticipate . The best litigators are prepared , and not easily rattled by the unexpected . For many lawyers , it is their client ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most issues filed in court conclude in settlement . Once in the courtroom , however , the litigator is a legal specialist who combines oratory skills with legal analysis and cross-examination to convince a judge and/ or a jury of his or her client ' s position . Below , are some of the most common specialty areas for civil litigators : <p> PERSONAL INJURY : Many trial attorneys have rewarding careers litigating personal injury cases . Attorneys who are successful and rewarded in this practice area are skilled presenters , and enjoy the advocacy role . They represent people who suffered " damage to their person . " While that might bring to mind some late night television advertisers soliciting whiplash victims , most often , attorneys in this practice area are representing victims who have been damaged in ways that affect them for the rest of their lives . The personal injury lawyer ' s job is to " prove damages , " or to maximize monetary compensation for an injured client . To do so , a personal injury lawyer will actively engage in investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will almost always call upon medical and/ or technical experts for testimony . They are adept interviewers , gathering information from witnesses , medical professionals , insurance companies , and victims . They are persuasive communicators , and often must know how to utilize sophisticated technology for graphics and visuals to demonstrate their case to a jury . <p> INSURANCE DEFENSE : Insurance companies are often the parties that pay for damages in many civil litigation matters . These companies generally have their own team of attorneys who are usually experienced litigators . Insurance companies will also hire outside law firms to assist in their defense , depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the claim . If a claim is litigated , insurers have personnel specifically trained to investigate its validity . ( People with law degrees are sometimes sought out for these positions ) . Attorneys specializing in insurance defense also work for private law firms hired by insurance companies . <p> An insurance defense practice , whether in an insurance corporation or a law firm , will also call upon other legal professionals . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careersas experts in risk management , contract administration , investigation , and regulatory compliance . <p> PRODUCTS LIABILITY : A man sues a lawnmower manufacturer for personal injury sustained when the blade hits a rock , propels it from underneath the mower , and strikes his leg . He claims the mower was defectively designed . A woman with an adverse reaction to a drug sues three pharmaceutical companies , and a drug industry trade association . She claims her illness was caused by the defendants ' failure to warn her of the dangers of the drug . The State of Minnesota sues a building contractor , claiming negligence in the builder ' s use of asbestos in buildings constructed over ten years ago . These cases have different fact situations , legal theories , and evidentiary concerns and defenses , but they all fall under the " products liability " practice area . Numerous theories of recovery can be brought under single or multiple causes of action . They include negligence , strict liability , breach of express warranty , breach of implied warranty , and in some situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for personal injury . Sometimes , such as in the asbestos case , damages are available for economic loss . In certain cases , punitive damages are awarded . <p> COMPLEX LITIGATION : This describes a case filed in court that is likely to have multiple parties and multiple causes of action , and sometimes crosses jurisdictions . Examples are mass tort cases and class actions such as the breast implant litigation , the tobacco litigation , and the Dalkon Sheild litigation . Lawyers involved in these cases are with private law firms or in-house , corporate counsel for one of the parties named in the suit . Generally , the large private law firms will be on the defense side , and plaintiff ' s work is handled by smaller firms . <p> OTHER COMMON SPECIALTY AREAS FOR LITIGATORS : As mentioned above , any legal matter can end up in litigation . Employment matters are often heard in court , such as hiring discrimination claims , wrongful termination , or sexual harassment . Business and corporate issues are frequently litigated , such as the interpretation of a shareholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family law matters frequently get settled in the courtroom , such as marital termination agreements and child custody . Contract disputes , tax matters , and real estate issues also provide enough litigation for many lawyers to make a lucrative practice specializing in litigating these types of cases . <h> Civil Rights <p> There are many state and federal agencies with legislative responsibility for enforcing civil rights laws . This area of law is also practiced in private law firms , corporations , and legal services organizations . Laws vary from state to state and generally prohibit discrimination based on race , color , religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation , handicap , ancestry , age , status as to public assistance in regard to employment , access to housing , use of public accommodations , and opportunities in matters relating to credit and credit transactions . <h> Commercial Transactions <p> Commercial transactions is a general term used to describe a whole body of substantive law applicable to the rights , intercourse , and relations of persons engaged in commerce , trade or mercantile pursuits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole or substantially by all states , and governs commercial transactions , including sales and leasing of goods , transfer of funds , commercial paper , bank deposits and collections , letters of credit , bulk transfers , warehouse receipts , bills of lading , investment securities , and secured transactions . Commercial transactions encompasses many areas of law including banking and finance , securities , real estate , bankruptcy and more . Some lawyers have specialties in one or more of these areas , and others will handle a wide variety of commercial transactions . These lawyers are employed by private law firms of all sizes , the corporate sector and the government sector . <h> Communications Law <p> With the growth of technology , this is a growing and emerging practice area . Very generally , communications law can refer to those laws regulating the media , such as libel and slander , privacy rights , and First Amendment issues . New electronic media such as the Internet , cellular communication , and e-mail have created a host of issues that are unresolved . Until laws are created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorneys with this specialty could work for a governmental body such as the Federal Communications Commission , private law firms , or corporate entities . <h> Construction Law <p> Construction law is a specialty dealing with all matters of new building construction . This can range from the real estate transactions , the financing of commercial projects , and contracts between developers , subcontractors , and buyers . Some litigators specialize in this area as well , and can encounter issues from personal injury stemming from construction site accidents to products liability of materials used in building . <h> Corporate Law <p> A general corporate practice involves the entire spectrum of legal services for a diversified client base . Work includes corporate counseling , negotiating and preparing legal documents for all types of business transactions , from sales agreements to complex joint ventures and business combinations . Private law firms can represent publicly-held companies , privately-held businesses , start-ups , venture capitalists , investment bankers , and others . They will deal with issues such as joint ventures , financing , mergers , acquisitions , dispositions , securities , tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within corporations as " in-house " corporate counsel . For these lawyers the corporation for which they work is their client . The issues they handle may include all those mentioned above , as well as handling employment issues or lawsuits against the company arising out of personal injury , products liability , or breaches of contract . <h> Criminal Law <p> Criminal prosecution is generally handled by government agencies at the federal , state , and local levels . Attorneys are found in federal enforcement agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency . The United States Attorney ' s Office has 94 offices across the country . This prosecutorial arm has a Criminal Division broken down into three parts : Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force , General Crimes Section , and Economic Crimes Section . State agencies include those such as the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension , and the state Attorney General ' s Offices . Local offices are the city , county and/ or district attorneys . <p> Criminal defense is also handled by some state and local government entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nonprofit or public service agencies such as Legal Aid Societies , and the private sector . Usually , law firms engaged in a criminal defense practice are small , private law firms , and will represent individuals facing drug charges , DUI , and other various misdemeanors and felonies . Occasionally , very small municipalities will contract with local firms to serve as their prosecutor . <h> Education Law <p> Lawyers who specialize in education law are likely to encounter three types of legal issues in their practice . The first stems from Constitutional issues , such as First Amendment Rights , that can arise in public education , both in K-12 and higher education institutions . The second area of issues is related to employment law . These can include tenure issues and contracts of teachers and faculty ; discrimination and harassment issues , both student to student and among faculty and staff ; and other Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issues . Other issues likely to come before an education lawyer are tort claims relating to liability of an educational institution . The Federal Department of Education hires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these specialists are found mostly in state Boards of Education , local public school systems , working for the educational institution itself as in-house counsel , or in private law firms hired to represent these institutions . <h> Elder Law <p> As our population continues to age , elder law is emerging as a specialty in which many lawyers find opportunity . Elder law encompasses a host of legal issues that specifically affect the elderly . For example , the baby-boomers are in their 50s now , and becoming concerned with retirement security . Lawyers with expertise in financial markets and investment products are needed to provide those services , along with accompanying real estate and estate planning issues . Other issues might overlap with health law , including Medicare/ Medicaid issues , nursing home payments , assisted suicide and living wills . Other common issues are will , trusts , and conservatorships . <h> Employee Benefits / Executive Compensation Practice <p> Attorneys in this practice area represent both publicallyand privatelyheld companies , and banks and trust departments in all phases of designing and administering employee benefits and retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health benefits , and other investment vehicles companies offer to their employees . Other issues include incentive compensation plans , capital accumulation plans , and stock option plans . These attorneys often have a client counseling role , assisting their clients in long-range strategic planning , educating clients on current regulations and legislation , and advising clients to ensure compliance with those codes . This is a highly technical area of law with many tax implications . Many practitioners have backgrounds in accounting and/ or an advanced law degree in tax . <h> Entertainment / Sports Law <p> An entertainment law practice can range from representing on-air personalities to professional athletes to educational institutions . These lawyers will negotiate employment agreements and standard player contracts . The practice involves negotiation of endorsement/ marketing agreements , representing clients in grievance/ arbitration proceedings , providing tax and estate planning advice , and reviewing and/ or developing investment agreements . It is also common for lawyers in this practice area to handle numerous real estate transactions , and manage their clients ' equity interests in real estate . <h> Employment &amp; Labor Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private and public sectors in a variety of labor and employment matters . A labor relations attorney will represent employers in matters such as unfair labor practices , collective bargaining negotiations , representation elections , grievances and arbitrations , and strike litigation . These attorneys also counsel clients on issues such as affirmative action compliance , employee handbooks , workplace rules , and other related matters . An employment litigator will represents clients on issues such as discrimination in hiring , wrongful discharge , breach of employment contract , workplace libel and slander , employee right to privacy , and other issues . Some employment lawyers are also found representing companies before administrative agencies such as state bureaus of employment , bureaus of workers ' compensation , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board . Others actively advise and represent clients in OSHA matters involving employee health and safety . <h> Environmental Law <p> This practice area encompasses a number of activities . There is an ongoing need for attorneys to provide regulatory advice to businesses . Government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if a business , citizen group , a county or municipality believes a regulatory agency has issued a permit that does not adequately protect the environment , administrative procedures enable these parties to challenge the permit . <p> Attorneys are also consulted to represent clients in the industrial and manufacturing industry that , because of past activities , have been scheduled for investigation and clean up in the next decade . Private parties may also be involved in disputes involving land contamination and will hire private counsel . While some environmental disputes are litigated , most are handled through the administrative process . Finally , environmental lawyers are often involved in putting together business deals such as real estate transactions , and business acquisition and divestitures . Often when these transactions involve the transfer of real property , environment assessments are required . <h> Family Law <p> Family law practices are usually limited to small and mid-sized private law firms . Some public service agencies , such as Legal Aid Societies , will represent indigent clients in family law matters . Family law matters can include pre-marital advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visitation ; divorce planning , negotiation and/ or litigation involving support , spousal maintenance , or division of property ; and post decree modifications and enforcement . Those engaged in a family law practice are very skilled counselors and negotiators , whose success is often dependent upon their ability to demonstrate genuine concern and compassion for their clients . Family law often involves trial work , and can overlap with many other areas of law such as tax and estate planning , real estate , corporate and finance , contract , and criminal . <h> General Practice <p> A general practice is just what it sounds like . This refers to a law firm or an individual lawyer who handles many different types of legal matters from different practice areas . Many solo practitioners and small-firm lawyers have a general practice , or as it is sometimes called , " door law , " that is , they will handle whatever comes in the door . Usually these lawyers will limit their work to litigation or transactional matters , but there are a handful who do both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning that there are departments of attorneys devoted to handling a spectrum of particular practice areas . The lawyers within these departments are usually specialists in their given field , however the firm as a whole is described as " general practice . " This term is limited to private law firms and individual lawyers . Government and corporate setting lawyers are usually specialists in one or more closely-related fields . <h> Government Practice <p> There are literally thousands of government entities that hire lawyers , and they are found at the federal , state , and local levels . Many of these bodies are mentioned elsewhere in this article . Some offices may do work that is specific to a substantive area of law , such as the administrative bodies like the SEC . We felt we should still include a " government practice " section separately because there are so many government offices that handle many different types of legal issues and offer a wide variety of practice styles . A good example of this is the state Attorney ' s General Offices . These offices generally provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciary and local officials such as county attorneys and sheriffs to assist them in enforcing state law . In Minnesota , more than 100 state agencies , boards and commissions receive legal advice and representation from the staff of the Attorney General ' s Office . <p> The Attorney General regularly helps to shape public policy by proposing legislation to deal with legal policy concerns in the state . For example , proposals can include crime and violence prevention , consumer protection , civil rights , environmental protection , or children ' s advocacy . The Office also implements a wide range of public policy programs , including drug prevention , sexual violence and harassment prevention , environmental protection , consumer education , child support enforcement and more . <h> Government Relations <p> Some large firms have a department called " Government Relations . " This group of lawyers is usually involved in some aspect of " lobbying . " Lobbying is defined as all attempts to influence legislators to vote in a certain way or to introduce legislation . Attorneys in the government relations department will be involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbying activities . Additionally , these lawyers may be involved in trying to influence administrative rule-making bodies , such as the Department of Health or the Environmental Protection Agency . Some of these lawyers may also become involved with litigation stemming from a perceived unfair consequence of legislation . Clients can range from private or public companies , such as a managed health care provider where proposed legislation could have a direct effect on its business ; or professional associations , such as the American Medical Association , that represent members of an industry that could be affected by proposed legislation . Lobbyists are sometimes hired directly by these organizations . In some instances , the government relations attorney is an employee of the corporation or organization , rather than working for a law firm hired by that entity . <h> Health Care Law <p> This represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic practice areas . It is a specialty which blends many practice types including litigation , general corporate , medical malpractice , antitrust , tax , securities , real estate , labor , partnership , to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years have created a huge demand for lawyers as issues such as assisted suicide , crimes against the elderly , right to die , and others present themselves . The changing nature of the organizations in the industryinsurance and managed care companies , physician organizations , hospitals and clinics , regulatory bodies , and patient groupscalls for lawyers skilled in business transactions such as mergers and acquisitions . Litigation has also stemmed from the challenge of issues such as access to health care and health care benefits . Healthcare technology is growing rapidly and attorneys are needed to protect ideas and inventions , and to advise companies in that business in their general corporate matters . Healthcare is a highly-regulated industry , and many lawyers assist their clients in compliance issues . There are a host of issues here , and that is only expected to continue to expand opportunities as this industry continues to change . <h> Immigration <p> Immigration is a comprehensive body of federal laws that govern issues of foreigners coming into the United States , including admission , exclusion , deportation , and naturalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Department of Justice , employs a great number of immigration lawyers . Courts devoted to handling immigration issues will also hire attorneys to assist judges . In recent years , the legislature has been in the process of reforming immigration laws , and some members of Congress and other legislators have hired immigration lawyers for assistance . Private firms also represent clients ranging from those seeking citizenship , new citizens working to bring their families into the country , aliens with issues related to employment or education visas , and/ or companies who wish to recruit and hire internationally . Also , some in-house , corporate counsel may deal with other immigration issues if the company they work for does business internationally or has other international concerns . <h> Intellectual Property <p> This area is perhaps the fastest-growing , hottest area of law , with the demand for qualified lawyers exceeding the supply . Attorneys in this field , with very few exceptions , are required to have degrees in one of the hard sciences : engineering , medicine , computer science , physics , etc . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademark , licensing , trade secrets , and patent law . Clients are usually businesses involved in the chemical , medical and pharmaceutical , biological , mechanical , electronics and computer technologies . Lawyers assist them in acquiring , protecting and exploiting intellectual property assets , including patent preparation , prosecution , licensing and litigation . Intellectual property attorneys can be found in private law firms of all sizes . Many private law firms are " boutique " firms , and limit their practice exclusively to intellectual property . Corporations in these industries often hire their own , in-house patent counsel . <h> International Practice <p> The term " international law " is really a misnomer . There is no one practice area that could be described as " international . " Rather , an international practice is one in which the attorney ' s clientele consists of organizations or individuals that conduct business internationally , or have international clients themselves . Assets such as language skills and multi-cultural experience are valuable to attorneys who wish to engage in an international practice . These attorneys are usually those who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients over time . Few new attorneys are able to secure a job in an exclusively international practice . <p> An international practice can encompass all aspects of business enterprise including mergers , acquisitions , joint ventures and other investments ; international finance ; international development projects ; international intellectual property rights ; international trade and finance ; regulation of international trade ; international tax matters ; international government representation ; litigation and regulatory compliance ; international arbitration ; and international real estate matters . Lawyers in an international practice can also represent individuals and families in complex immigration , residency , tax , estate planning , and corporate and investment legal issues that cross the boundaries of the national legal systems . <h> Judicial Clerkships <p> Judicial clerkships should be distinguished from other " law clerk " positions . " Law clerk " is usually the title given to a law student who assists an attorney with research and writing duties . A judicial clerkship , however , is a post graduate position , assisting a judge , usually for a finite term of one or two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , from the Supreme Court of the United States to county level district courts , at both the trial and appellate level . These positions , at the federal level and the state appellate level , are generally highly competitive and require superior law school credentials and a demonstration of superior legal writing skills . These positions are considered to be quite prestigious , and many new lawyers who have served as judicial clerks have found that the experience was not only one of the most rewarding of the their legal careers , but that the experience opens many doors , and expands opportunities available to them at the conclusion of the clerkship . <h> Legal Services <p> Legal services are generally private , nonprofit corporations which provide free legal representation in civil and criminal matters to low income and elderly residents in various geographic areas . Attorneys who join legal service organizations have the opportunity to acquire experience quickly and develop skills in a variety of civil and criminal matters . Legal issues common to legal service organizations are family law matters , landlord/ tenant disputes , criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Medical Malpractice <p> The practitioner here will deal with claims that question the standard of care rendered by a physician , dentist , optometrist , chiropractor , or an employee of a hospital . An attorney practicing in this area must understand not only legal principles , but also must be knowledgeable as to the appropriate standard of care to be exercised in a variety of health care professions and settings . Representative issues can include those such as : Did the medical professional fail to diagnose or misdiagnose the patient ' s condition resulting in injuries ? Did the surgeon perform a procedure improperly resulting in injury to the patient ? Did the nursing staff follow orders issued by the physician ? The attorney ' s task is to simplify and focus the issues , and to make a case involving complex medical facts , issues and analysis as simple and straightforward as possible . <h> Municipal Law <p> State and local governments have need for many different kinds of legal services . Some of those services are provided by attorneys who are employed within the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law firms who specialize in the public sector practice . Those services required include general advice and counseling , drafting agreements and legislation , advice and assistance in the implementation of governmental programs , and representation in judicial and administrative proceedings at the federal , state and local levels . Substantive areas can include public finance , education , securities regulation , hazardous waste management , housing and urban development , land use control , telecommunications , elections , and a host of other issues . Clients of these lawyers include states and their agencies , board of education , counties , cities , villages , townships , state and municipal university and colleges , and some private sector entities in their relations with public bodies . <h> Probate Trust &amp; Estate Planning <p> Probate , Trust and Estate Planning attorneys represent clients who run the gamut from the most modest of estates to those that are highly complex , either because of the unusual nature of the client ' s assets and liabilities , or because of the nature of the client ' s business , commercial and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to income , gift and estate tax matters , and well as pre- and post-death personal and administrative aspects of a client ' s estate . This is another practice area with huge tax implications . Many of these attorneys are CPAs or have accounting background . Attorneys with this expertise are found in many different environments , including private law firms of all sizes , and in organizations such as banks , trust companies , and accounting firms . Clients can be individuals or corporations . <h> Real Estate <p> Real estate law relates to any issue involving real property . Many lawyers have a special expertise in real estate law , while many others encounter tangential issues of real estate law in other practice areas . Real estate tends to be a fairly technical practice area with a lot of accounting functions and tax implications . It is common for real estate issues to be dealt with on a regular basis by tax and probate and estate planning practitioners . Many in-house , corporate attorneys deal with real estate issues . For example , many companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large commercial sites for their own office space , or lease space in their building to other businesses . Real estate lawyers also represent individuals making all kinds of real estate transactions . Title companies , mortgage companies , and other lending institutions will also hire real estate legal specialists . Government real estate lawyers may deal with issues such as condemnation and eminent domain , and are usually hired at the local level . <h> Securities Law <p> A security is simply a manifestation of an investment in an enterprise . It may be a bond , a share of common stock , a note , a limited partnership interest , interest in real estate or any other tangible or intangible asset imaginable . The practice is primarily transactional work , business counseling , some litigation relating to investments , and the raising of capital for the enterprise . Securities lawyers are found in private law firms as well as in-house corporate counsel . Some government entities also hire securities lawyers , the largest of course , being the Securities and Exchange Commission . Day-to-day work can address those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placements , blue sky commissions ( registration requirements that vary from state to state ) , reporting requirements , and SEC compliance . The client base can be diverse and dynamic including private and public businesses , venture capitalists , investment analysts , bankers , and securities brokerage houses . <h> Tax Law <p> Attorneys specializing in tax can be found in many employment settings , in both the public and private sectors , including large accounting firms . Clients can include individuals , government bodies , private and public businesses from a small family business to Fortune 500 corporations . Tax specialists work closely with practitioners in other practice areas . Virtually everything a lawyer does for a client will have a tax consequence , whether it is a marriage dissolution or drafting a simple will , or advising and executing complex commercial transactions . Whether the client is an individual or a huge corporation , the tax lawyer ' s goal is to maximize the preservation of assets and the positive impact on the bottom line . This is accomplished through careful tax planning and counseling of clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as public and private offerings , debt instruments , equity stakes and other tax-oriented investments . Tax attorneys also provide advice to tax-exempt organizations on the tax aspects of a wide range of organizational and operational matters . These attorneys are highly knowledgeable in obtaining tax-exempt status in the most expeditious manner and effectively counseling such organizations on maintaining their tax-exempt status . <h> Tribal / Indian Law <p> There are some lawyers who work exclusively with legal issues affecting Native American tribes , Indian land and reservations , and treaties . Attorneys are found in federal government bodies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs and The Indian Claims Commission , which hears and determines claims against the United States on behalf of any Indian tribe . Private law firms also have lawyers who specialize in matters relating to Indian lands and reservations , tribal rights , and other legal issues affecting Native Americans . Additionally , specific Indian tribes , which are recognized as sovereign entities with the power to regulate their internal and social organization , have lawyers who may be members of the tribe themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , " to handle the legal affairs of their tribe . Public service agencies also serve the Native American community with lawyers who specialize in the Indian Child Welfare Act , and others who serve children , the elderly , or indigent members of the Native American community . <h> Workers ' Compensation <p> Practice in this area consists of representing employees and employers in the administration of workers ' compensation benefits . Typically , law firms exclusively represent either employers or employees , however there are some firms that will represent both . On the employee ' s side , counsel assists injured employees in filing for benefits due as a result of industrial injury or disease . It can also include the litigation of claims which are appealed from the administrative process to the state court system . On the employer side , lawyers are defending their clients against such claims . Employer ' s counsel can also be involved in counseling and educating employers in establishing safety programs and other methods designed to reduce industrial accidents and injuries . In large law firms ( generally defense-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often cut their teeth on workers ' compensation matters to gain trial experience before moving on to more complex legal areas . <h> To Sum it all Up ... <p> It ' s pretty hard to sum it all up . If nothing else , you can see that there are a huge number of options for you . We have discussed here only those areas which are generally recognized as major fields of specialty . There are literally hundreds of areas of sub-specialization and niche practice areas . This summary is meant to be a concise resource for those just beginning to explore a career in the law . When you begin law school , and throughout your law school career , you are encouraged to seek out other resources for more in-depth exploration .

It may well be asked why I maintain such a close affinity with petroleum . The answer is simple and straightforwardbecause I was born and I grew up on an oil field and I have cherished a deep love for all that it represent . Even as a child , I had a habit of watching for hours how beam-pumping units , standing as if like a miniature forest , worked , indulging myself in all kinds of fantasies and reflections about the mysterious reservoir underground with great curiosity . I imagined that someday I would be able to unveil its mysteries . With the lapse of time , I am approaching the 30th year of my age and a cursory retrospection makes me realize that , for nearly a decade , I have been making efforts toward this objective . The black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite attractions . In order to understand petroleum better , I consider it necessary to travel to the other side of the Pacific Ocean to improve my knowledge and expertise in petroleum research . <p> I am most proud that I have obtained both Bachelors degree and Masters degree through 7 years of dedicated academic efforts at Beijing University of Petroleum , Chinas most prestigious institution of higher learning in the field of petroleum . What made me even more proud of myself is the outstanding scholastic performance and research achievements that I accomplished . For four consecutive years during the undergraduate program , I was awarded first-class scholarship and the honor of Student of Excellence , an honor to which only 3 out of 180 students were entitled . I also won second prize for the universitys first mathematics contest and the first prize for the physics contest . My distinguished scholastic aptitudes led to a direct Masters program waived of entrance examination . During my Masters program , the research project I undertook Research and Fabrication of the Automatically Electrical Equipment Used for Testing the Flow Parameters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . My research paper The Application of the Thermal Resistance and Heat Capacity Operator in the Simulation of Temperature Distribution of the Surrounding Areas of Wellbore Equipped with Electrothermal Paraffin Tools such as the Electric Heating Cable or Rod won first prize at the universitys Treatise Presentation . Furthermore , I own one patent for the Automatically Electrical Instrument for Measuring the Flow Parameters of Cores and was awarded IET scholarship , the highest-level scholarship in China awarded to students who study energy sources . <p> By studying each course with serious interest , I gained a complete understanding , on both theoretical and practical level , of how bodies of underground oil , gas and water move and how to tap the resources that they represent . In addition , I learned how to reconstruct the distribution of underground oil , gas and water by means of numerical simulation software , how to create three-dimensional geological model of the oil reservoir , and how to prepare plans of oil field development . Whenever I succeeded in creating a three-dimensional model , or preparing the plan for oil field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that my child dreams were being fulfilled one by one . And each time when I saw my research papers being published in the nations core periodicals and journals and wining high evaluations from experts , I could experience a great sense of achievement . So far , I have published 7 papers in such periodicals and journals ( please refer to my Resume for more detailed information . ) <p> With a view to solving practical problems , my thesis for the Bachelors program , The Simulation of Temperature Distribution of the Surrounding Areas of Wellbore Equipped with Electrothermal Paraffin Tools Such as the Electrical Heating Cable or Rod , was regarded by the Academic Panel of my Department as " creative " . The thesis solved the problem of the discretization of the thermodynamic equation by the numerical interpolation method . Based on this , I compiled the numerical simulation software and worked out two major problems , that of selecting the most efficient electrical cable or the electrical heating rod in order to save energy , and that of providing a foundation for the numerical simulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding areas of the wellbore . This software has been put into wide application in Chinas two major oil fieldsQinghai Oil Field and Liaohe Oil Field . Similarly , my thesis for the Masters program , The Simulation and Modeling about the Effect of Side-Tracked Horizontal Well and Created Fracture Used for Developing the Remaining Oil of the Top Part of the Thick Oil Layer , explored how the remaining oil in the top part of the thick oil layer can be fully exploited by means of side-tracking in the horizontal well and hydraulic fracturing of the upper parts of oil layers . In this thesis , I compiled numerical simulation software with more than 8000 lines of source codes . A scheme of numerical simulation input parameters was designed based on cross experimental design method , which realized the simultaneous optimization of multiple construction parameter variables . Since its application in Daqing Oil Field , the first major oil field in China , this software has been highly appraised . Both my undergraduate and graduate theses were rated as " Class A. " <p> Since the completion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Petroleum Corporation where I work at its Department of Prospection and Production . As the person in charge , I have participated in a number of research and development projects . I was responsible for framing quite a few schemes of new oil field development , designing and assembling an electric automatic instrument for measuring the flow parameters of cores . In collaboration with the famous American oil reserve evaluation company DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton , my colleagues and I assessed and calculated the total amount of reserves owned by China National Petroleum Corporation . In addition , I designed a set of computerized automatic testing and simulation device for simulating the pressure distribution of underground fluids . Those are just some of the major responsibilities I have performed . The most valuable thing in my 4-year work experience is that I have gained an in-depth understanding of many important production processes of an oil field as well as major problems that an oil field might face . I am very happy that in my work experience I have had opportunities to practice the knowledge from my formal academic education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another important thing is that I have become increasingly aware of the importance and the necessity to constantly improve my professional knowledge and skills in order to be able to solve the difficult problems that arise in actual production processes . <p> To keep myself abreast with the most recent international developments , I consciously availed myself of all possible opportunities to attend various conferences and special training programs . As early as my Masters program , I launched our universitys Society of Future Petroleum Engineers , a student organization in which I acted as its president . As such , I organized Serial Lectures on the High Technologies in the 21st Century . While working at China National Petroleum Corporation , I attended quite a number of domestic and international conferences , including The 7th International Conference on Heavy Oil and Tar Sandstone Reservoir , SPE Annual Conference in 1998 ( China ) , Seminar on the Technology of Improving Oil Recovery , Symposium on the New Technology of Oil Field Development , etc . Due to my distinguished performance in work , I was sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainings and to conduct technical exchanges , especial in the field of numerical simulation . Those experiences have been vital to my career development . A byproduct of those experiences is that I formed the idea of pursuing a first-rate education in the United States . <p> At present , there is still a big gap between China and advanced Western countries in terms of the technology of petroleum prospection and development , especially in the development and application of super-large numerical simulation software and large-scale three-dimensional reservoir description software . China has a lot to learn from the United States which occupies a leading position in all those areas . I expect that I can undertake thorough research in a particular area under the guidance of a world-class scientist . Based on a careful consideration of the present situation in the scientific and technological development of Chinas petroleum industry , I would like to focus my prospective Ph.D . program in one of the following fields : a . Reservoir Numerical Simulation ; b . Reservoir Engineering ; c . Well Testing . <p> Tulsa University is reputed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . The specialty has a very strong faculty and advanced research facilities . It offers research-intensive programs and many field trips . Such an academic environment agrees very well with my academic and research interests . In my future program , I will continue to build up my theoretical knowledge , consolidate my basic skills , and learn the most recent advanced technologies . I will try to focus my program on a specific subject that will most meet the needs of Chinas petroleum industry . I believe that , compared with the previous two degree programs I completed in China , my degree program in Tulsa University will be the most fruitful one . 
@@42231343 @2231343/ <h> Sample Statement of Purpose for Civil Engineering <p> I was born 23 years ago in a desolate small mountain village where there were only several rows of low and primitive huts constructed with cob bricks . But when I returned to my hometown recently , I found that the one-time mountain village has given way to a sizable town with modern facilities and utilities as a result of the ongoing national campaign of urbanization . This is just one instance that illustrates the magic power of Civil Engineering in effecting radical social and economic changes . From the very outset , it is precisely this magic power of Civil Engineering that has fascinated me as a scientific discipline . As if to reinforce this fascination , I am fortunate enough to be the daughter of a father who is a senior engineer , whose professional influence contributed to my engineering orientation during my middle school days , which ultimately led me to the world of civil engineering into which not many women students are prepared to venture . By contrast , I am bent on a lifelong career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A towering building arises from the ground " ( equivalent to the English idiom that " Great oaks from little acorn grows ) . As an ordinary young girl , my past intellectual pursuit is just like the process of constructing a towering building , laying a solid foundation , making sustained efforts to develop , and achieving final success . At the very outset of my undergraduate program , I formulated a plan for my academic development , outlining the objectives that I must achieve at different stages of the program . With due efforts , I have attained almost all of them . My academic performance is ranked top three in my class ( consisting of 37 students ) and top ten in the entire grade ( consisting of 189 students ) . I am quite proud of my performance because the academic environment at XX University is highly competitive . Apart from my academic rankings , I have been awarded a spate of honors such as Outstanding Student and Outstanding Student Leader , as well as scholarships for three consecutive years . I concluded my undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not endowed with any extraordinary intelligence , my academic initiative and commitment has prepared for me a groundwork as firm as that of a towering building . <p> As one of the three Chinese universities with the longest history , XX University is famous for its Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering . The education I received from my teachers is at once comprehensive and in-depth , covering all the important fields of civil engineering . Apart from such core courses as Construction of Buildings and Reinforced Concrete , I have also been very interested in courses related to mechanics and mathematics like Theoretical Mechanics , Material Mechanics , Structural Mechanics , theory of Elasticity , and Descriptive Geometry . This is not only because they are indispensable to civil engineering but also because they contain the kind of erudition and cogent logic that simply fascinated me . Finally , courses in computer science , The Design of Computer Language and Programs and CAD , equally attracted me , for I realize that the mastery of such basic computer skills would significantly strengthen my expertise in civil engineering design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would use CAD cartographical software to do cartographical simulation on my own computer and try to envision the specific steps of operation in actual applications . This learning strategy ensured that I could work out the otherwise rather difficult structural designs with much facility . With the increase of my professional knowledge , I discovered that there were important links among those different realms of knowledge and it was my task to unify and apply them . I achieved this when doing my graduation project " The High-Rise Teaching Building of XX University " . There are many old buildings on our university and our project team , under the guidance of Prof. Yi , was to design a new teaching building that must show due respect for the existing elegantly-styled traditional buildings on one hand and incorporate modern elements on the other . As team leader , I divided the project into three component partsbuilding design , integration with the environment , and structural design .

I have been a member of the student government of my class , in charge of art and entertainment activities . I have also served as student leader of the departmental student union responsible for organizational work , launching a series of campus events designed to enrich the students campus life . I won second prize in the 200-meter dash . I received the first prize in the structural design competition of the university . All those activities improved many of my personal qualities such as leadership and interpersonal skills . I also realized the importance of teamwork to the achievement of success in whatever endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also been considerably improved . <p> Established in 1842 , XX University is one of the four leading polytechnic universities in Europe . Its hydraulic laboratory is considered the best in the world by the International Hydraulic Environment Engineering ( IHE ) . In such a prestigious university , I can expect to receive the best advanced education in civil engineering . I would like to concentrate on civil engineering , environmental science and construction engineering . With reference to the civil engineering curriculum of XX University , I have formulated a tentative study plan . In the first six months I will devote to an extensive coursework in the advanced theories of civil engineering , environmental science and construction engineering , attending a variety of core courses . In the next six months , I will try to learn and master advanced design skills , including CAD skills . In the second year , I will participate in extensive internships , workshops and seminars and try to apply my knowledge to practices . My ultimate aim is to submit a well-written dissertation . <p> I believe that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broaden my perspectives , in and outside the field of civil engineering . Those perspectives will let me have a clearer idea about the limitations of my own country and possible improvements that we can make . My 4-year undergraduate program in civil engineering has equipped me with a solid academic foundation . In addition to that , my practical experiences and English proficiency , plus my strong motivation , those are three major factors that will ensure my success in my proposed program . <p> As Chinas economic development gathers increasing momentum , a new wave of massive construction will hit the nation in the near future as urbanization has become a national policy . This situation creates a historical opportunity for the emerging generation of civil engineers . To embrace this historical opportunity , I need to receive advanced academic input , develop international experiences and learn updated concepts . I am convinced that civil engineering is a science that is closely connected with human welfare and , as a would-be civil engineer , I will fulfill my self-actualization in contributing to the welfare of my fellow countrymen .

The solid and comprehensive coursework that I did for my program covered the theories of almost all the fields of jurisprudence . On top of that , I gradually developed a pluralistic perspective in my academic research under the influence of my advisor and other teachers , all of whom obtained advanced degrees in jurisprudence from the law schools in western countries . Out of my wide-ranged interest , I read extensively most of the western classics in law and philosophy including On Crime and Punishment , On the Spirit of Law and The Social Contract .

The thesis received a " Class A " rating for its originality in that year . <p> Upon graduation , I availed myself of various opportunities to undertake legal practice .

This training program was taught solely in English language by professors of American XX Foundation , scholars sent by XX Justice Department and XX and XX lawyers . In this program , I received systematic training in courses such as British and American contract law , trial systems , American uniform commercial code , business law and legal regulatory environment , American Constitution , etc. and I was given the honor of Excellent Graduate .

" I believe that my ability to communicate makes me well suited to pursue a medical career . While I possess the strong science background necessary for success in the profession , I also consider myself a " people " person . As a waiter and bartender , I dramatically improved and expanded my communication skills since I was constantly meeting new people and discussing different topics . Because people constantly disclosed their personal issues to me as a bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also an excellent listener . In medical school , I also plan to pursue side work educating students and serving as a resource to the public . One of my most rewarding experiences has been tutoring high school students in math , physics , and biology , and helping people in my choir learn Byzantine music . Always able to develop a good rapport with students , I believe I possess a talent for teaching others in a friendly manner and in a manner that helps them to grasp difficult concepts easily . As part of my medical career , I will aim to continue teaching and to provide information to the public on the prevention and treatment of ailments and diseases . Undoubtedly my cultural diversity will be a great contribution to The Chicago Medical School . Being raised in a Greek family in Canada , visiting different countries , and now living in the United States , I have experienced the similarities and differences among many diverse cultural groups and geographical areas . This allowed me to relate to different types of people by understanding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work well with other medical students and help me serve my patients better in the future . Highly motivated to succeed , I dramatically improved my grades following a time of confusion and immaturity in 1990 and 1991 , which was brought on by family illness and turmoil . Once I realized what goal I wanted to pursue in life , I worked hard to succeed , and my remaining five years of schooling are truly indicative of my intellectual capacity and motivation for success . My strength as a candidate to The Chicago Medical School lies mostly in the objectives that I plan to fulfill upon becoming a physician . They are , in no particular order of importance , as follows : 1 ) To provide excellence in comprehensive care by using my acquired skills as both a competent professional and also as a compassionate human being . 2 ) To cultivate my leadership role both in the community of my practice and in the nation to formulate and maintain health care principles and advancements. 3 ) To employ the latest knowledge and techniques in detection and prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) To develop and employ methods to take care of an aging population . 5 ) To show reverence for human beings by giving excellent care to all 6 ) To forever expand my knowledge through experience , continuing education courses , and research . I have been diligent in my pursuit of medicine as a career because I am convinced that medicine offers me the opportunity to live a fulfilling , rewarding life dedicated to helping others . I will enter medicine eager to learn and thirsting for the knowledge to help my fellow human beings . Attending The Chicago Medical School would be one of the greatest rewards for my motivation and persistence for success . I swear to uphold and exceed all that is expected of a future physician while promoting the progress of medicine and humanity .

Ms. Smith took the classroom version of Principles of Epidemiology for Public Health ( EPID 160 ) this past fall . Based on her performance in the course , I feel she would be a good candidate for the MPH program . <p> Grading in EPID 160 is based on a combination of " objective " and " subjective " evaluations . The objective components are two open-book , take-home examinations ( 35% of the overall grade ) and a paper ( 25% ) , each based on an article . Each teaching assistant grades several exam questions across the entire class ( this year we combined the 101 classroom and 64 Internet students ) . Thus , exam scores provide a good basis for comparison . The papers are also graded anonymously , but in spite of attempts to standardize the grading there are undoubtedly differences across graders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall grade ) and peer ( 20% ) evaluations of participation in small group discussions about case studies based mostly on articles . Although I try to adjust the results for differences in grading styles across TAs and across small groups , these scores are less comparable across the class as a whole . <p> Ms. Smith 's overall grade of 85 fell right in the center of the distribution . Her score of 79 on each exam was just below the median on the first exam ( quartiles were 75 , 80 , and 85 ) and just above the median on the second exam ( quartiles 70 , 78 , 88 ; the median for students in the classroom edition was 80 ) . Her grade on the paper was somewhat disappointing ( 78 , just below the first quartile for the class as a whole and for all papers graded by the same grader ) . <p> On the more subjective evaluation components , Ms. Smith 's ratings were very good . Scores on these evaluations tend to run high , but Ms. Smith was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum score .

She always came prepared to lab , asked good questions , and frequently volunteered to present her work . Many epidemiologic concepts are not straightforward , and it was evident that Mary put a great deal of effort and time into learning the material . She was one of the hardest working students and would often email me with questions . Her lab group benefited immensely from her inquisitive style .

However , a memorable experience during my internship prior to the undergraduate graduation completely changed my mind . When I witnessed how a patient suffering from lymphatic cancer was tortured , minute by minute , by the agony of approaching his death and yet had to undergo the immense physical pains brought by chemical therapy , radioactive therapy and other trauma-producing therapeutic measures , I experienced a deep sorrow and regret for my not being able to help him alleviate his pain . <p> I know that at present clinical level there are still many tough problems remain unsolved , such as the deciphering of the pathogeny of auto-immune diseases and its corresponding prevention and treatment . Only through colossal research work in immunology will it be possible to arrive at some tentative treatment of such diseases . Therefore , when I graduated from XX Medical College , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in immunology , which is closely connected with basic medicine and is . By now , initial progress has been achieved .

But more importantly , it is embodied by the academic success I have achieved in my 5-year undergraduate education in medical science and in the development of strong ability to perform independent medical research in my two-year work experience . <p> My undergraduate program in clinical medicine encompassed approximately 30 courses across basic medicine and clinical medicine . I was particularly interested in those sub-disciplines of biological science that demand cogent logical analysis and creative thinking . Immunology fascinated me most . That was because it is a science that exploits the principle that the immunological system of all living organisms can produce rejection effect against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely new solutions to the diverse phenomena displayed by different strains and individual organisms and to their diseases .

For this , I was awarded special-class Scholarship for Outstanding Student for 6 times throughout my undergraduate career . <p> Apart from coursework , I participated in academic exchange activities as student representative of our college . In 2000 , I made a presentation entitled " A General Description of Cellular Apoptosis and Clinical Application " at the First Youth Forum on Pathology in XX Province and my presentation was given the Winning Prize by professors of pathology present at the forum .

This gave me the precious opportunity to apply my knowledge and to be further exposed to research . Besides working as a teaching assistant at Microbiology and Immunology Department , I devoted most of time to advanced self-education in immunology . For two years , I have been responsible for delivering both theoretical and ( pre- ) experimental courses in microbiology and immunology in the entire college , as well as after-class coaching . I have been the first in my Department to propose that educational reform be introduced into our Department to adopt the heuristic method of elicitation and bilingual education ( Chinese and English ) .

In view of the relationship between the CTLA-4 as an inhibiting co-stimulating cell and the genesis of SLE and its level of severity , as well as the abnormal pattern of the subpopulation of the T cell in the peripheral blood of the SLE patients , I suggest that , in the genesis and development of the SLE , the abnormal expression of CTLA-4 and other inhibiting cells in T lymph cells can lead to distribution disequilibrium of the subpopulation of T cells in an organism , creating abnormal patterns in immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto-immune diseases . The significance of my research project lies in the fact that the pathogeny of the auto-immune diseases in the SLE category can be explicated through the activation of lymph cells and signal transduction in the immunological system . In this way , the view that CTLA-4 is an intervening and regulating point in the prevention of SLE and other auto-immune diseases will receive stronger support and the key to intervention and regulation becomes more likely to be discovered . <p> As an interdisciplinary subject that is of cutting-edge significance , immunology offers many exciting yet challenges fields for research breakthroughs . As far as I am concerned , I am most interested in the research on auto-immune diseases and on tumor . Specifically , I am very enthusiastic about studying the disequilibrium of the subpopulation of cells in organism caused by those diseases , the role of dendritic cells ( DC ) , and other topics .

I believe that your education will broaden my knowledge horizon , expose me to distinguished professors and their original concepts and creative teaching . I will also learn advanced theories of immunology and sophisticated experimental skills . Ultimately I hope that I can become part of the process that human beings use advanced research findings to decipher the mysteries of life and the genesis of diseases .

To unveil this great sophistication , I resorted to experimentation . As early as I was a junior , I took the initiative to join a national key laboratory based in the Department of Biology Science of our universityThe Laboratory for Biological Resources and Ecological Environment under the Ministry of Education . The laboratory has been performing the countrys most pioneering ecological research in the prevention of grassland desertification , locust and rat plagues , and the exploitation of grassland resources like fungi . <p> My two-year research work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became part of the XX Research and Development Program . Pseudononas Pseudoalcaligenes is a new pathogen bacterium whose metabolism produces insecticide protein . The pPA7 promoters , which control toxic protein synthesis , can be cloned from this gene-engineered bacterium and used to kill locusts effectively by means of a mass of chitinase . <p> My distinguished academic performance won me First-Class Prize for Excellent Undergraduate ( 1999-2000 ) and Quanxin Prize of XX University ( 2000-2001 ) . But Outstanding Graduate of XX University ( 2002 ) and Honor of Excellent Graduation Thesis of the University ( 2002 , awarded to only 5% of undergraduates ) were much more defining because they qualified me for a direct Masters program with entrance examinations exempted . <p> Although my graduate study has continued to provide me with input in fundamental theories , it has been dominated by research , the development of scientific thinking and advanced experimental techniques . This is very much in accordance with my expectation of a research-intensive Masters program . No sooner did I embark on the program than I joined the research on the analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southwestern China . It is part of XX Program of China whose objective was to seek countermeasures for grassland degradation and desertification . In the project , we separated and cultured bacteria , fungi , and actinomycetes by different substrata , recorded their amounts and analyzed their living features , identified and classified special strains by their different biological functions . Our research is meaningful in furbishing the intrinsic grassland environment and harmonizing the relationship between resource utilization , preservation and management . . <p> A more challenging project I have undertaken is XX a key project of stockbreeding of Sichuan Province in the 10th Five-Years Program . Together with other team members , I have traveled to 9 counties and collected more than 600 blood samples of goats . By extracting their genomic DNA separately and amplifying them with selected 80 random primers by PCR , we evaluated and compared the results of PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis . The phylogenetic map and tree obtained can she 'd light on genetic differentiation and taxonomic research , providing an essential basis for the preservation and breeding of fine goat stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper XX , published in Journal of XX University ( Natural Sciences Edition , the countrys core scholarly journal ) . As the second author , I am preparing another research paper which will be submitted to an international scholarly journal . My Masters dissertation will be an comprehensive examination and presentation of the findings of the entire project . <p> During my graduate program , I have made conscious efforts to cultivate two important qualities . By serving as a volunteer at the XX of China in Sept. 2002 and at theXX of China in Oct. 2003 , I have learned the importance of keeping abreast with the latest developments of a rapidly developing discipline . In undertaking large-scale formal research projects and fieldwork , I learned the importance of concerted teamwork in achieving the common objective . Working as a team leader , I designed and scheduled experiments , and rationalized division of labor among three graduate students and 10 undergraduates has made our research on the random amplified polymorphic DNA a complete success . <p> Doing a Masters program puts me only halfway from my ambition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program at XX University can consummate this ambition . My study of your School of Life Science indicates that cutting-edge achievements have been made there , with more than 50 faculty working in four major fields physiology , ecology and evolution , systematics , and molecular biology . I myself would like to concentrate on molecular biology or genetics and the laboratory led by Prof. XX is involved in basic and applied genetic research while Prof. XX is studying the mechanism of breast cancer by means of molecular biology . Apart from those fascinating research , your school allows students access to extensive support facilities including an electron microscope center , herbarium , natural history museum , vivarium , greenhouses , and growth chambers . Your research programs , curriculum and facilities make your university the cradle for those would-be biological scientists , who can integrate their academic work closely with practical application . <p> Intrigued by the multi-faceted beauty of the world of biology , I find myself just inside the threshold of this wonderful world . Well-grounded in academics , in research , and in experimental skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong research career and your highly regarded Ph.D . program will be my new starting-point.

It measures the ability to respond to questions in limited time.The Graduate Record Examination ( GRE ) is a multiple-choice exam designed to measure verbal , analytical , and quantitative skills . The GRE General Test , required by most graduate schools , many vet schools , and various other allied health professional schools , is considered to be a good predictor of your success in a graduate program .

It may be of a verbal , quantitative , or analytical nature . <p> There are some important facts to remember when taking the GRE General Test . First , each question is worth the same number of points , no matter how hard or easy it is . Second , in each section except the reading comprehension questions ( in the Verbal Section ) , the questions tend to go from easy to difficult . Therefore , it is foolhardy to spend too much time on early questions when you know that later ones will probably take even longer .

You may obtain a registration form from the Fort Lewis College Career Placement Office , or by writing : <p> Your raw score ( number of correct answers ) is converted to a score on a scale of 200-800 . If you miss all the questions , you still score 200 . An 800 score can be achieved even if you miss one or two questions . The Verbal , Quantitative , and Analytical scores are reported separately as scaled scores - you will also receive a percentile rank ( indicating the percent of total examinees scoring below your score ) .

@@42231356 @2231356/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Communications Studies <p> There are two divergent views concerning the prospect of Chinese media development whether an exciting future or a downturn as a result of unregulated disorder . To what extent is each of those contentions justified ? My 2-month summer internship from July to August in 2004 at XX has allowed me to gain insight into the complex reality of the countrys media community . Although in appearance Chinas media market is booming and making big money , there are inherent crises . Apart from the political control imposed on the media , Chinese media workers suffer from a conservative ideology , backward technology and shortsightedness resulting from the false boom . This is largely related to their lack of international experiences and perspectives . My present application for a Masters programme in Communications Studies at your esteemed university stems precisely from the motivation to develop the kind of international experiences and perspectives that most Chinese media professionals lack . <p> My internship at XX has been significant . Apart from gaining a realistic picture of Chinas media world , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel is primarily targeted at the audience in the national capital , but it has important ramifications over the entire country . The show " XX " where I worked has created a standard in the field . During my internship , I performed such duties as interviewing and editing of programmes under the guidance of the programme director , from whom I learned important experiences of collecting materials and producing programmes . It constituted my very first experience of standard media work , although I used to work at our universitys broadcasting station . Both of those experiences have helped to motivate me toward a possible career in media . <p> As a student of English , I have developed a strong interest in media . This development seems inevitable on two accounts . There is first the longtime influence of my mother who used to be a journalist and is now a senior editor . Another factor is my character . I have known to other as lively , energetic , sociable , and communicative . As a child , I practiced playing piano and also practiced dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic talents made me a leader in extracurricular activities . By actively participating in those activities , I learned how to plan , manage and launch major events . Since September 2002 , one year after I began my undergraduate programme at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences , Institute of XX , I have been acting as art and entertainment representative of the class , the director of Art and Entertainment Department of the Schools Students Union , and vice chair of the University Students Union . In my various positions , I masterminded and launched a series of important events and served as anchorwoman . Those events include the universitys annual large-scale performance in commemoration of the December 19 Incident from 2001 to 2003 , freshmen receptions and summer evenings in 2002 and 2003 . <p> In executing my extracurricular duties , I have seen how I can use my talents to fulfill public responsibilities and how to interact with different sorts of people . But my sense of achievement also comes from many other aspects , more or less related to media . In May 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Talents Contest of XX , which was part of the 3rd Nationwide English Talents Show sponsored and televised by XX . Both my English proficiency and oral eloquence were highly recognized by my teachers and fellow students . In Nov. 2003 , I was responsible for directing a short English play " Lucky 250 " which won first prize at the universitys first Short Play Competition . Our play later entered the XX Competition and claimed a third prize . Around the summer vacation in June and July this year , I interned at XX Art and Culture Development Co . Ltd and my duties included translating documents , business proposals , correspondences , and manuals and participating in corporate planning . As the companys line of business is brokering art performances between China and other countries , I learned important knowledge about intercultural communications . <p> Learning English as my major has allowed me to have important experiences of the cultures of the English-speaking countries . I used to be a volunteer who showed a group of British and American teachers working in China around the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned about their own cultures . As sophomore and junior , I took part in many exchange programmes with international students studying in XX , among whom were students from the UK , Canada and America . I believe that this cultural knowledge will be useful to my prospective studies in Communications Studies because your programme is best understood in a cultural context . <p> In carrying out the studies in my own specialty , I have been most interested in the courses related to English and American literature . In addition to providing a historical framework of English and American literature , our teachers have offered in-depth analyses of major literary movements and their representative authors , and I have developed a relatively comprehensive knowledge of the novelists , playwrights and poets and their individual works in the great literary traditions of those two English-speaking countries . The study of English and American literature has produced a two-fold significance for me . Achieving over 80 points ( as in a 100-point grading system ) in the last two examinations , I have remarkably enhanced my aesthetic sensitivity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , my study of English and American literature has presented me the best channel for improving my English proficiency , especially in reading and writing . As a student of English , I have also make conscious efforts to improve my proficiency in listening and speaking by practicing with teachers and students from the English-speaking countries on our campus . Compared with other Chinese students who apply for a programme in Communications Studies , I have a much stronger background in English language , which constitutes my unique strength . Moreover , I submitted an article to a writing competition under the name of XX on Campus and claimed an Excellence Award . <p> I am especially proud of the fact that my active involvements in extracurricular events , while promoting my personal development in an all-round manner , have not in the least hampered me from attaining my academic excellence . I have developed useful knowledge and skills in areas other than our own specialty , which many of my fellow students do not possess . On the other hand , although our teachers have been invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 academic ranking in my class consecutively , winning third-class scholarship in the 2002-2003 academic year . <p> When I first chose to major in English , the choice was made out of my admiration of English and western culture . Now , as my interest shifts to communications , I am equally excited over my new choice . XX University has achieved rapid ascendancy in academic ranking among all the UK universities over the past decade and its Institute of Communications Studies is one of the largest departments of its kind in British universities . The postgraduate programme offered covers six schemes , some of which is taught in association with BBC . Establishing the Center for Television Research as early as 1963 , XX University was one of the first to undertake the study of communications as an academic discipline . I chose your programme because I am eager to learn advanced knowledge of this discipline . My study plan is that , on the basis of the books on communications I have self-studied , I will choose a comprehensive spectrum of core courses as well as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would concentrate on mass media and society , with emphasis on political communications , Art Communications , and communications and international affairs . My dissertation will focus on one of those aspects , which will bear importantly on Chinas existing media and communications practice . <p> Mass media is essentially about interaction and communication . As China gradually opens its media market to foreign enterprises , radical changes are bound to take place . My prospective programme will be part of that Sino-UK interaction and communication . I envision myself in the near future as working either in a leading Chinese media enterprise which operates jointly with a western partner or in a western media organization operating in China . Therefore , my present application for your programme will play a vital role in my future career development .

It should in any case be clear that the professor had the opportunity to get to know the student well and assess his/her capabilities . If the person does research work under your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the student , and any significant projects undertaken by the individual . You may wish to include a sentence about the nature of your research group and its activities . Here , you can also give a one-sentence summary or overview of your opinion of the recommended individual . <p> Next 2-4 Paragraphs <p> The assessment of the students capabilities should be made from a multiple point of view over the next 3-4 paragraphs . From a professional point of view , it should give account of the students knowledge , interests and capabilities , activities and results , work capacity , etc . Personally , it should assess the students personal characteristics , character , social skills , his or her relations with the students and professors . Same as in other application documents , the direction should be from facts/experience to qualifications , and from those , to value judgments .

Also , if you do make negative comments , back them up with facts . <p> The final paragraph should provide an overall assessment of the students potential to fulfill the requirements of the program , even though partial judgments can and should be provided in the body of the letter . You can make a more broad characterization of the individual and his or her demeanor . Finally , indicate the degree to which you recommend the individual to the program she or he is seeking : recommend without reservation , strongly recommend , highly recommend , enthusiastically recommend . <p> Some Remarks <p> Most recommendation forms contain a certain number of fields , the multiple-choice kind , where the professor has to assess , by checking cells , your abilities .

Though my grades were among the top ten percent , and I received a scholarship two times , I did not have truly outstanding performance .

Because of my diligence and my love for this subject of learning , I remained a student of top-ranking GPA in the class , and won the Scholarship of the First Class for three consecutive years . In my thesis " A Study of the Applications of Titanium Dioxide as a Semiconductive Photochemical Catalyst in the Degradation of Wastewater , " I targeted the traditional separating process in treating wastewater , which often resulted in secondary pollution .

You must demonstrate to the committee how your goals coincide with what the program has to offer as well as how you will fit in and how your qualifications will benefit the program . It is the personal statement that communicates to the admissions committee what it is about you which makes you stand out from the other applicants . The more competitive the school , the larger the pool of applicants with strong GPAs and GRE scores , the more important the personal statement becomes in the selection process . Therefore it is important to devote ample time to writing your statement . <p> How important is the statement of purpose in the application process ? In short , it is a very important piece of application materials . Start working on it at least three weeks before the deadline for you to sent your documents . Even if all the rest of your application is perfect the carelessly written statement can spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it to determine what kind of person you are and whether you are capable to be successful in their PhD program , how well you are suited for that , how goal oriented you are and many other things . Well-written statement can greatly help you to get admitted even if you have average test scores . <p> What information should I include in the statement of purpose ? Discuss your career goals , and how an advanced degree and this program would help you get there . Include relevant experiences such as research you have done and skills you have demonstrated . Relevance is key , and doing your homework about graduate school programs will help you determine relevancy . Ask some of these questions ... what degree programs does this school offer ? What areas of emphasis does it offer within that major ? What license and certificate preparation does the program provide ? What original research is being done by which faculty at this school ? The answers to these questions should help you decide to which schools and programs you 'll apply . This information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only include your life story if it 's relevant . <p> How exact should I be about the research field I would like to work in ? People in the admission committee are looking for applicants with determination , for those who know what they want to do in their life and know why this university and this program will enable them to reach their goals . If you have broad interests and experiences you can state that you are still choosing the exact field for your research , usually though it is better to state the area you are especially interested in ( it can be quite a broad area such as experimental condensed matter physics or modeling of cellular processes ) . Do n't narrow you field to much though . Make sure that at least 2-3 faculty members ( 4-6 is even better ) are working in the field you have emphasized . And remember ( ! ! ) you can always change your mind after you have been admitted into the program , nobody will force you to stick to the area of research you emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members who I want to work with ? It is highly advisable to mention faculty members who you might be interested to work with . It is especially important if you have already done some work similar to the research some of these professors are now doing . If the professor you have mentioned is in the admission committee this can also help . Also , do not hesitate to contact these ( and other ) professors personally ( via email ) . Ask questions about their current and prospective research projects , about the possibility to become members of they group if you get admitted , about the department , you might want to attach your statement of purpose and resume to the first letter you send them . <p> How long should the statement of purpose be ? Your statement of purpose should be about 1 to 1 1/2 pages ( 500-600 words ) . Use normal margins and font 11 or 12 , refrain from using small fonts since they are hard to read . Generally , a shorter statement of purpose that is clearly written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the same statement of purpose for all universities which I apply to ? Mostly you will see advices that you need to write a separate statement for each program . Ideally this might be the best , but realistically you will not have time to do all the work it requires well . So it is better to spend time writing one really good statement and then for each university changing particular part of the statement which emphasizes some aspects of particular programs and mentions faculty members ( usually it is one or two last paragraphs of the statement ) . Do not sent completely identical statements to all universities , mention the name of the university in the text , it is fine to use " Your University " , but you also need to use the name of the university . Finally , make sure you send right statement to the right university ; - ) . <p> Who will read my statement of purpose ? Your audience is made up of faculty members who are experts in their field . They want to know that you can think as much as what you think . 
@@42231364 @2231364/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Tips to Borrowing an Alternative Loan <p> 1 . Take time to carefully review your familys financial situation and identify every financing resource available . Be sure to explore all options before applying for an alternative loan . <p> 2 Determine the total amount of education debt you and your family are willing to accumulate during the students college enrollment . Take into consideration the four years worth of federal student loan debt the student will be taking on as well as what income the student may realistically expect after graduation . Use on-line calculators to determine monthly payments . <p> 3 . Be careful not to borrow too much in alternative loans as it may have an adverse effect on the future borrowing potential for the student . Realize that even though a parent may be the co-signer on an alternative loan , and the parent(s) is the primary borrower on a MEFA loan , the student has the same responsibilities and obligations for repayment as the co-signer or parent and it will effect the student 's credit score . The larger the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be for future borrowing . A parent PLUS loan may be a more appropriate loan to consider , as the parent is the only borrower on a PLUS loan and the student 's credit would not be effected . Do n't forget that the student will have federal Direct student loans to pay back as well--so try to limit any alternative or MEFA loans with the student as a borrower . <p> 4 . Think long term when choosing an alternative loan . You should borrow from the same alternative loan program each year during your college career . This will make repayment easier and more cost effective for you . Private loan consolidation , combining two or more different alternative loans into one new consolidated alternative loan , is possible but the choices are very limited and their terms may not be as attractive , so you must choose a loan that meets your needs now and for the future . <p> 5 . Thoroughly review and decide how important the various features of a loan are to you before choosing one ; these features include fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates are determined , co-signer release availability , borrower benefits and incentives . <p> 6 . We recommend that students apply for an alternative loan with a co-signer . This will reduce any fees , and lower the margin above the index in determining your interest rate . <p> 7 . Choose a loan which has a competitive margin above the index . This margin will determine your future interest rates . An index is a nationally recognized interest rate that is used by the lender to determine your future interest rates . The most popular indices are the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) Prime Rate and the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) . The margin is the amount which is added to , or substracted from , the index which determines your interest rate . For example , if the index is a WSJ Prime Rate of 6.00% and your margin is 1% above the index , then your interest rate is 7.00% . <p> Historically , the LIBOR rate has been lower than the WSJ Prime Rate , and therefore , the margins above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime rate . For up-to-date rates for the WSJ Prime and LIBOR indices , visit the Bloomberg web site . <p> 8 . Another consideration is the frequency of the interest rate changes . Some loans change every three months . Some loans change their interest rates every month . During a time of rising interest rates having your rate change on a monthly basis will cost you more money . <p> 9 . Alternative loans should be the last option a student should consider . The Federal Direct and the Federal PLUS loan programs are much better options . If you need to borrow an alternative loan be sure that you have borrowed the maximum Federal Direct loan for which you are eligible . First year students may borrow up to $2625 ; second year students may borrow up to $3500 ; and $5500 for each subsequent year ; for an aggregate of $23,000 . <p> 10 . Think about the length of your repayment period and how your monthly payments will be affected . If you plan to borrow more than $20,000 in alternative loans for your undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 20 , or 25 year repayment term . If you choose a loan with a repayment period of 12 or less years your monthly payment will be large and not manageable . Do n't  forget that you will also have the Federal Direct loan to pay back as well . Play around with the on-line calculators listed in tip #2 above or check out this calculator to see how interest rates and term lengths affect your future monthly payments . <p> 11 . You may want a time period inbetween leaving school and when monthly payments begin . Look for an alternative loan which has a grace period when payments are not due . For example , the Federal Direct loans have a six month grace period after leaving school or graduating when monthly payments are not due . <p> 12 . If the student can not make monthly principal and interest payments while enrolled look for an alternative loan which defers these payments . We do , however , recommend that students and/or parents pay the interest that is charged on the alternative loan while the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student is enrolled the accumulated interest will be capitalized , or added , onto the amount borrowed at repayment . By having the interest added onto the principal at repayment , additional interest will be charged on this capitalized interest . You want to avoid having this happen to you as this will add to the cost of borrowing an alternative loan . <p> 13 . Be careful of tiered pricing loans . These loans have different fees and margins above the index depending on the credit score of the borrower or co-borrower . The differences can be quite large . Borrowers with excellent credit fare the best with usually no fees and a zero or low margin over the index . The advantage of the tiered pricing is more loans can be approved using this method . But at what cost to you , the borrower ? Paying nine percent of what you borrow in fees and a 5% margin over the index is not a great deal . If you find yourself in a tiered pricing loan ask yourself if you can afford the high margin over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be worth thinking twice about borrowing that loan . If you can not be approved for a tiered pricing loan at the excellent credit level you may be better off not applying for that loan . <p> 14 . Some loans have a co-signer release option . This means that the co-signer can be released from the obligations of the loan after a period of time and the student borrower will remain as the sole signer on the loan . Be aware that to be able to release the co-signer , you must make a certain number of on-time payments before the lender will consider releasing the co-signer . Also , the student borrower needs to prove that he or she is able to make payments on the loan after the co-borrower is released . If this is an important feature for you , inquire about the number of on-time loan payments required to release the co-signer and how is the borrower determined to be able to make payments after the co-signer is released . <p> 15 . Most loans have borrower benefits and payment incentives . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , deferment of monthly payments , and the co-signer release . Payment incentives include interest rate reductions after a certain number of on-time payments , and interest rate reductions for automatic payments from a bank account . A word of caution about incentives linked to making a number of on-time payments : only a small number of borrowers actually benefit from this type of incentive because there may be a late payment made along the way . To safeguard against having late payments , ask what is the window of time when a payment is considered to be on-time . For example , if the payment is due on the 10th of the month , and the window is 10 days , you have until the 20th to make the payment and still be considered on-time . If the window is only 5 days , you need to make payments sooner . To ensure that payments are made on time , ask about paying the monthly bill using automatic payments from your bank account . <p> 16 . Be in touch with our loan counselor .

This position , which is somewhat similar to TA , permitted me to cooperate with my teachers of those three courses to undertake some basic research . <p> In those exciting periods , I found that many mechanisms in pharmacology and toxicology had to be studied on the molecular level . Meanwhile , genetic science was becoming an increasingly power tool in pharmacological and toxicological research . With this important realization , I self-studied a large number of textbooks in those fields and took the initiative to keep myself abreast with the latest interdisciplinary developments in contemporary pharmaceutics . Once again , due to my excellent academic performance , I was recommended , during my internships , to participate in a development project of a new medicine at Beijing Pharmacological &amp; Toxicological Research Institute . The research team adopted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Huperzine A tablets . Eventually , the newly-developed drug won the Second-class State Award for Invention and my Bachelors thesis , which was based on my research findings from this project , was given a high grade of 89 points . <p> After graduation , I worked as a project manager in a large pharmaceutical technology development company . However , the low-level imitative drug production soon bored me , even though I earned high salaries . To satisfy my desire to undertake more creative and more meaningful researches , I switched to The Institute of Radiation Medicine of Beijing , believing that pharmacological and toxicological research was what fitted in with my real research interests . I joined the research team under the leadership of the renowned radiation and toxicological specialist Prof. Wan X X , who is also an academician of the China Academy of Engineering . The projects I have participated in include research on radiation-caused cancer and on the chemical-induced vicious mutation mechanism in the embryo cells of mouse . This wholly novel research field aroused my intense enthusiasm , allowing me to acquire considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , and CGH technology . <p> My English proficiency qualified me for the project of constructing a databank of patented Chinese traditional medicines launched by the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.C. To ensure its high technical quality , I attended an all-English long-distance coaching program directed by experts from French Industrial Intellectual Property Bureau . By studying the latest international bibliography of pharmaceutical patents , I discovered that intellectual inventions in life science require a comprehensive combination of chemical , biological , mathematical and even computer knowledge , acute observations , rich imagination , and strong hands-on abilities . Those are prerequisite qualities for being an accomplished pharmaceutical scientist . <p> Under the circumstance that there are alarming gaps between China and its international counterparts in the field of pharmacology and toxicology , I have generated a most fervent desire to pursue advanced studies in those two fields and the University of ------------ comes on the top of my priorities . The sound research environment , advanced experimental technology and complete research facilities , as well as knowledgeable professors are what can land me onto new intellectual horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially my research experience in cancer development as a result of radiation-induced genetic mutation , to grasp as quickly as possible the pharmacological research skills of your university . I will focus on the study of malignant tumor and the disease-causing mechanism of HIV viruses . With mechanism study as a " point of entry " , I will explore the possibility of developing effective pharmaceutics . I know this would be difficult , but I am determined to make persistent efforts toward this objective .

This was precisely what I had in my mind when I used this word to name the folk rock band that I launched in collaboration with two other undergraduates when I was a sophomore and in which I was the bass guitarist . For about one year , we composed our original songs and lyrics and gave a total of 14 performances on and off campus . We became the cover story of the magazine XX and were interviewed by the XX Cable Television Network . <p> Although I had to disband the band so that I could indeed concentrate on my studies when I became a junior student , this brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . The process of musical composition gave me the same pleasure as undertaking mathematical induction and deduction . In creating my music , I started with a motif , followed by a few segments to succinctly present my musical ideas , and finally expanded them into full-length structure with the rigorousness and harmony characteristic of equation derivation . For me , musical creation and mathematic exploration are not contradictory , but are essentially the samethey are all about the underlying order , structure and beauty of the seemingly random phenomena . <p> I displayed recognizable talents in mathematics after I entered XX Middle School , where classes were conducted in a seminar-like environment , it was I who was always the first to solve the questions and to go to the blackboard to explain the steps whereby the solution was obtained . The classical joke of the class was that I , instead of Mr. XX our mathematics teacher , was the person who did the real teaching . <p> But the most defining experience occurred when I happened to read the formula for calculating the area under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eager to know how it was derived . Failing to deduce the formula by myself , I raised this issue to Mr. XX , who refused to give me any instruction , saying that it might distract my attention and energy . But my stubbornness prevailed . Without referring to any materials , I spent weeks deriving the formula and after repeated failures my efforts paid off . I derived the equation , which I was surprised to find during my undergraduate education essentially similar to the Euclidean approach in the ancient Greece . <p> The impact of this experience proved profound . I started to realize the importance of imagination to mathematics and recognize my talent in this aspect . Before I completed my senior middle school , I had read Polyas How to Solve It and other classics of mathematics , which bred in me the determination to take up mathematics as my major when I was admitted into XX in 1999 . <p> What is special about my undergraduate program is that , instead of the usual 4-year duration , the students of XX up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , I have attended many more courses , which are also more difficult , than students in the succeeding grades . I have taken and am going to take 11 courses specifically for graduates . Having completed more than 200 credits for the first four years , I have laid a more solid foundation in my area of specialization and been exposed to a much wider range of specialized knowledge . My overall GPA , which is well over 3.0 , has shown sustained ascendancy as I gradually shifted my focus from extracurricular activities in the first two years to formal academic study ever since then . In terms of my major , my GPA was 3.68 and I achieved the highest scores in the entire class in such courses as General Topology , Advanced Number Theory and Linear Algebra II . I have been awarded second-class scholarship once and among 50 students in my class my ranking is top 10 . <p> Looking back on my past academic pursuit in mathematics , I find myself well grounded not only in classical Mathematics but also in specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XX allowed me to master the fundamentals of Number Theory and to understand the celebrated remarks with which Gauss emulated the Number Theory . Prof. XX s course Communicative Algebra not only exposed me to the ideology and methodology of Algebra but also ushered me to contemporary mathematics and gave me introductive background to Algebraic Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry . Algebraic Geometry delivered by Prof. XX , made me really perceive the power and beauty of modern approaches in uncovering the identical or similar characteristics behind the apparently diverse issues . I am quite familiar with classics of mathematics such as Fermats Last Theorem by Edwards , Basic Number Theory by Andre Weil , Commutative Algebra by Boulbaki , which I self-studied . Such a comprehensive curriculum and my self-education have enabled me to master fundamental knowledge and develop specialized mathematical thinking . <p> Not contented with grasping established conclusions and existing knowledge taught in class and books , I have the habit of speculating on the underlying implications of the known axioms and of testing the known principles through different mathematical approaches . I also like to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another subject , like what I did in using the techniques of Matrix theory to simplify and work out a problem in Algebraic Number Theory . In addition , while working on difficult problems , I made it a point not to consult any hints in order not to be confined by established conventions . In this way , I have repeatedly tasted the joy of exploring new territories and letting my imagination soar . <p> As an undergraduate , I am particularly proud of my two achievements . The first is the Undergraduate Research Program of XX titled " XX " in which a classmate and I came under the direction of Prof. XX . In this privileged three-person environment , we had in-depth discussions on several selected topics of Number Theory and had extensive exchanges of views and skills with Prof. XX . We offered totally new approaches to some problems in Algebraic Number Theory and my classmate and I published two papers in a Journal of Mathematics of our department . For this reason our group was awarded the honor Outstanding Student Research Program and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another development , Prof. XX , based on his intimate understanding of my knowledge in Algebraic Number Theory , invited me to give lectures for two weeks on the subject to graduate students whom he was teaching the course Analytical Number Theory . This was the first time in XX that an undergraduate gave lessons to graduates and naturally it created quite a sensation . <p> I first learned about the University of XX in I Want to Be Mathematician by P.

Specifically , I am interested in Elliptic Curves , Cyclotomic Fields , and K-Theory . In choosing to study in XX , I wish to learn the latest developments in interdisciplinary studies in the fields that I am interested in . I can also keep informed of the major research findings in recent years . After completing your Ph .

Some of those opportunities are extremely rare and selective , eligible only to a very limited number of top students . As a student of international studies , I have veritably acquired quite considerable international experiences and developed international perspectives , especially in Southeast Asian studies that I would like to study through a Ph.D . program . This is what distinguishes me from the rest of my classmates and from other Chinese applicants to your program . <p> Majoring in International Relations in my undergraduate and graduate program , I have received both intensive and extensive academic trainings in this field and have undertaken advanced research in them . My academic transcripts would indicate the full spectrum of foundational and core courses I have taken as an undergraduate and as a graduate student .

On one hand , during my undergraduate and graduate programs , I have achieved an average overall GPA of 3.8 , with an even higher GPA in specialized courses , which has brought me the highest-level scholarships of the School and the University . Since 2002 , I have been recruited as teaching assistant by the Universitys Center of American Studies on the course American Culture and Society . On the other hand , I have pored over a quantity of classic works on international relations to be acquainted with the scholarly perspectives and views of the leading authors in the field . For example , The Clash of Civilizations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking on the distinctive features of Asian civilization and on the relationship among major powers in East Asia . I am also impressed by the idea of " soft power " proposed by Joseph Nye , which inspired me to carry out research on the role of Asian values in Lee Kuan Yews Reign over Singapore in my undergraduate thesis , which was scored 90 points . In addition , based on group discussions and research findings , I have published several papersxx , xx , and xx . <p> One thing special about my Masters program is that the program is jointly run by the School of International Studies of xx University and the xx Foundation . The courses have all been taught by eminent scholars from the United States , Japan and China and the languages used include English , Japanese and Chinese .

You might , however , want to eat something to get your energy level up . DO NOT BE LATE . If you are late , you will not be permitted to take the exam . When you arrive at the test site , be prepared to fill out paperwork , present two forms of photo i.d .

If you start to panic , take very deep breaths and exhale slowly . <p> Remember , you can skip questions that appear too difficult . If you skip a question , be sure to darken the proper numbered oval as you continue the test . <p> If time is about to expire , fill in all the remaining ovals , as there is no penalty for guessing . Some people prefer to fill in all of the same ovals ( all " Bs " or all " Cs " ) on the theory that they are likely to pick up at least some points . When time is called , stop .

" The typical response I hear when students get their scores is " Geez , I did n't  do as well as I did on my practice tests . " Why is this ? The LSAT is a stressful , time-intensive exam . Even if you take a lot of practice tests , it is still impossible to exactly mimic the emotional stress and stake of the real thing . Also , you are now being judged against the other tens of thousands of test takers across the country . Over 100,000 people per year take the LSAT test , and its a new group every time .

Food spoilage microorganisms are responsible for approximately one-fourth of the total amount of food disposed throughout the world ( Huss , 1992 ) . Society also pays a huge economic price for the illnesses caused by foodborne pathogens and concomitant decrease of productivity . Thus my major interest is in researching methods for detecting microorganisms in the food system and the means for controlling or eliminating them . <p> After I received my master 's degree and serving two years in the military , I started working as an Associate Food Scientist at the Food Industry Research and Development Institute ( FIRDI ) in September , 1990 . For the first 22 months there I was a lecturer in the Training Unit , where I taught about food processing plants as a part of employee training under the " Food GMP Authorization and Promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agricultural Standards ) Quality Mark System " . Both are important official systems for ensuring food quality in Taiwan nowadays ; nevertheless , they lean toward plant hygienic layout and design , and end-product inspection . <p> At my request , I transferred to the HACCP Working Group in July , 1992 . This one-year on-line microbiological survey and monitor of food processing factories advanced my understanding of environmental stresses on microorganisms and the methods of destroying them . My co-workers and I submitted the proposals " The HACCP System for Production of Frozen Roasted Eel " and " The HACCP System for Production of Ice Bar " in June , 1993 . HACCP is a preventive system of food safety . It is more effective and reasonable than conventional quality assurance programs based on end-production testing . This system has been introduced into Taiwan by FIRDI for over four years . However , the concept of HACCP is still frequently misunderstood or little known , partly because plant management often mistakes it for a " trouble-shooting " system , not a " trouble-preventing " one . Another reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCPs are located and what the applicable criteria are for preventing a false sense of security . Taiwan is demanding of pecialists in this field . <p> From July , 1993 , to the present I have been the Assistant Manager , R&amp;D Division , in Kasei Frozen Foods Works Co. , Ltd . Fortunately I could employ my knowledge here in Kasei to achieve an ambitious dream of mine:the " Umbrella of Quality Assurance . " This encompassed the hygienic design of the processing equipment and layout of this plant , employee training and hygienic management , cleaning and disinfection procedures , sampling and inspection plans , HACCP system , etc . These broadly describe my research interests . In order to enhance my research abilities , I have taken courses in SAS ( Statistical Analysis System ) at Taiwan Institute of Technology . In February , 1995 , I will attend 90 hours of classes in " Technology of Food Quality Control Program for High-level Management " at China Productivity Center ( CPC ) . In the subsequent months , I am also planning to study books relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal training . And then , most importantly , I would like to begin intensive study at your graduate school .

At present , few scholars here are carrying out research on this subject . I strongly desire to gain expertise in hygienic design of food processing equipment , cleaner and sanitizer efficacy , biofilm , waste product handling , etc .

Interviewers try to ask questions that , in their experience , will give them the information needed to make the selection of the best candidate for the job .

This question is critical to the successful outcome of any hire for any position . No matter how technically qualified you may be for a position , " fitting in " is even more important .

At engineering college , I secured the first rank in Academics during the final two years of study . I was also awarded the Gold Medal from the Office of the President of India for all-round excellence and possessing qualities likely to make the Finest Marine Engineer from my batch . <p> Having completed 10 years of active service last year as a Marine Engineer aboard X ocean-going tanker vessels , with about 2 years in the capacity of Chief Engineer , I had gained a large amount of hands-on , practical knowledge of marine &amp; mechanical engineering systems , such as IC engines , steam &amp; gas turbine machinery , cargo handling hydraulic systems , centrifugal pumping and purifying systems , advanced unmanned automation &amp; control systems , etc . But I aspired to go beyond being a maintenance engineer to a design engineer , and realized I needed to gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I applied to and was admitted into the Master of Science degree program in Ocean Engineering at the University of California , Berkeley . At Berkeley , I was introduced to modern theory and practice of ship design and was specially fascinated by the field of Structural Reliability as applied to ship design . My final research project was the preparation of a report for a Reliability-based guideline , converting the deterministic Rules for determining structural scantlings for steel ships currently being applied by the American Bureau of Shipping , City , State . XX is a leading Ship Classification Society , a governing body that establishes and administers standards for the design , construction , and operational maintenance of marine vessels and structures . I am currently employed as a Ship Structural Engineer at XX , working on structural plan reviews for new buildings and creating Finite Element Models for analyzing dynamic and static loads on ships . <p> Yet , all through these years as a professional engineer , I fueled my passion for Art by devoting almost every moment of my leisure , at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of fine art . I created numerous paintings in oil and gouache , and many sculptures in clay , continually honing my creativity and artistic skill . I won many awards and prizes for painting and sketching at the school and inter-collegiate level . Although I could not find the time to learn painting in a formal art course , I have read extensively on various subjects in art and learned further by copying many works of great Masters such as Michelangelo , the pre-Raphaelite painters , and some ancient Indian Masters in Sculpture . I did finally realize a long-standing desire to study art formally when I did an intensive summer course in drawing at Berkeley . <p> The Product Design Course , especially in the form it is being offered at Stanford University , jointly by the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Art , seems to me to be the most perfectly suited to my dream of forging these two diverse interests of mine into a fulfilling new career . Though I have had no formal training in design , I have found that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various problems faced during my career at sea , such as designing new types of tools for machinery maintenance , more efficient methods of overhaul or more effective automation systems . At leisure too , I have always enjoyed designing and building models , be they a set of rotating water fountains for ship-board decoration or a stable painting easel from the limited material available on board or architectural sketches for my future home . <p> I have also worked with keen interest in computer-based simulation models and training aids my father is currently involved in developing . I have designed numerous models for his company demonstrating lesson plans for the functioning of various mechanical systems such as principles of IC engines , fuel injection and fire detection systems etc. , using software such as 3D Studio and Macromedia Director . I am currently engaged in developing a web-site for showcasing an exquisitely beautiful temple complex in Southern India , called X. <p> While I was studying at UC Berkeley , I had the opportunity of visiting the Stanford University campus and meeting with Professor Y of Design Division . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his advice I visited the Design Loft on campus , which has left a lasting impression on me . There was a charged atmosphere of creativity in that room and it seemed ideas would almost shape themselves out in that melee of materials and tools and half-built models . <p> I am sure that formally studying Product Design can channelize my capabilities and enable me to come up with functionally efficient and aesthetically pleasing designs especially in the field of household consumer products and electronics . I would consider it an honor if I could study at Stanford University and assure you that I will put in my utmost effort into this domain .

It is through this pursuit that I have been tempering myself and adding value to my life . I 'm fully aware that if I want to add more value to my life , I should never be content with what I have learned in my undergraduate education and the achievements I have made in my work in well-known multinational enterprises . Instead , I should strive to scale new heights . Now it is the right time I apply for a Ph.D . program in industrial engineering , my specialized field of interest . <p> I consider my work experience at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself . The company put a lot of trust in me . I was made responsible for the implementation and maintenance of all ERP systems in all its factories in China and was appointed a key member for implementing the manufacturing management system of a refrigerator factory . Besides , I was a key member and advisor for the implementation of the Hub system a logistics solution - for two DVD/CD-ROM factories . I was honored an Excellent Employee in only half a year after joining the company . Moreover , I won appreciations from my superiors and colleagues with my sound communication skills , learning ability and work performance . <p> In fact , I have dealt with many aspects of industrial engineering in my work before joining XX . I had been working on designing and development of an ERP system in XX Technologies Co. , Ltd. - a dynamic company in the tobacco industry - from July 2000 to August 2002 . I was specifically responsible for designing and programming the warehouse management and equipment and parts procurement module , analysis of program requirements and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in searching for the optimal solution and making on-site investigations to familiarize myself with the operation procedures in all departments covering procurement , warehouse management , customer service and channel management , and getting a large amount of most valuable data and experience . <p> I know well that my fruitful work performance would not be possible without my successful undergraduate education at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of XX University a key university in China . In the curriculum for the specialty of Measurement Technology and Instruments , I developed a strong interest in a wide range of courses including Probability Theory &amp; Mathematical Statistics , Fundamentals of Control Theory , Computer Control Technology and Digital Signal Processing . I was obsessed with the things different theories can do . Probability predicts the likelihood that an event will occur . Statistics taught me how to perform analysis . Control theories showed me that the world consists of large and small systems that are interrelated and interact with each other and life is always in a positive/negative feedback at a certain moment . Computers do complicated calculations and make machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do . And it was so fulfilling when programs I compiled controlled the computer in completing different tasks . My study of these courses laid a sound foundation for my development of interest in industrial engineering . <p> Meanwhile , I never confined myself to my own specialty because I knew this would make my perspective narrow and unenlightened . I would read extensively in the library books and journals in hologram informatics , computer science , expert systems as well as novels and journals in English . I was often so engrossed in my reading that I forgot the time . <p> I was honored an Excellent Student of my department in my third year for distinguished academic and extracurricular development . However , what really distinguished me is my graduation thesis for which I brought into full play my ability to apply knowledge and exercise independent thinking . At the time , I was taking part in my supervisors project to design and develop a real-time locomotive operation simulation system for the XX . Therefore , I decided to base my thesis on researches in the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calculate the most rationalized acceleration and deceleration speed for the locomotive at different times and places . I encountered many challenges in my research . For example , I did n't  know much about the performance of the motors in different models of locomotives . However , I did n't  give up . I consulted a wide range of documents , studied the most commonly used locomotive models and designed the basic computation model . Finally , I successfully completed my thesis and the results computed by the model were highly accurate . I received full recognition and high appraisal from my supervisor for my contribution to the project . <p> While I have made outstanding achievements in my work , I have also observed the hard facts in Chinas machinery industry and other industries in their rapid development .

Moreover , as an interdisciplinary subject that encompasses integral system design , implementation and improvement for human resource , materials , equipment , information , energy environment , etc. , industrial engineering requires planning , forecast and evaluation of the effectiveness of the above systems with industrial analysis and design theories and methods . Therefore , a practitioner in this field has to have comprehensive knowledge in mathematics , natural sciences , humanities and social sciences . And as a discipline bridging engineering and scientific management , it covers a wide range of fields including operations research , human factors , manufacturing engineering , quality control , management engineering and information systems . <p> The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering of the University of XX is known for its strong faculty and the fusion between research and applications .

@@42231395 @2231395/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Nutrition <p> " Is nucleic acid a nutrient ? " This was the topic for a biochemistry group discussion two years ago . Though even now I do not know the exact answer to this question , it triggered my interest in nutrition . By consulting relevant technical literature , I come to realize that nutrition plays an important role in strengthening peoples physique , enhancing their immunological functions , and reinforcing health . This realization has changed my view that medical means and therapeutic measures are the fundamental alternative in the treatment of all diseases . When I used my basic knowledge in nutrition to give treatment to my grandpa suffering from the diabetes II through a controlled diet , I managed to maintain a stable level of his blood sugar . This indicates that a scientific diet and a proper composition of nutritional ingredients can effectively control the occurrence and development of many chronic diseases , hence my increased interest in the science of nutrition . <p> The outbreak of SARS in the first half of this year has given us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of extended efforts , including the efforts designed to fight off various infectious and epidemic diseases , and prevention is the best approach to a sound physical condition . Obviously , nutrition plays a vital role in enhancing the immunity of the human body and promoting human health . But what makes me worried is that , at present , the importance of nutrition as a scientific discipline has not come to the serious attention of the medical profession and the general public in China . The general public simply follows its conventional diet habits , without sufficient scientific guidelines . Therefore , the study of nutrition becomes one of the most effective ways to improve human health and the quality of life . <p> This has led me to develop a serious interest in nutrition and it now appears that this interest is becoming a major career objective . For this reason , I am anxious to undertake a Masters program in Nutrition Science at your esteemed university . I believe that I have a sincere motivation for an advanced program in Nutrition Science and I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemistry , and important potential for carrying out academic research . Those factors will ensure my successful completion of my proposed program and achievement of important research results in a subject I am so strongly interested in . <p> When , more than three years ago , I was admitted into XX ( arguably one of the top-ranking universities in China ) with the privilege of being waived of the otherwise requisite entrance examination ( a special honor for senior middle school graduates with exceedingly outstanding academic performance ) , I opted for the specialty of bioengineering at the Life Science and Technology School as the subject could provide me with unique opportunities to probe into the mysteries of human life . My systematic education in this subject has allowed me to receive comprehensive academic training across a diversity of fields including biochemistry , microbiology , and cell biology and I have been able to achieve very satisfactory scores in all of them . <p> Both nutrition science and biological science are closely connected with human health . When I attended the course microbiology , it was the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbiology in understanding the mechanism of how infectious and epidemic diseases spread and in preventing such diseases aroused my deep interest in it . On the other hand , cell biology unravels the mechanism of various activities of life and the pathogenesis of various diseases . It provides the most fundamental knowledge for biology and relevant sciences . My knowledge from those two courses will serve as an important theoretical foundation for my future study of nutrition science . <p> The commitment to public welfare is an essential quality for those dedicated to a lifelong career related to human health . As a would-be public health professional , I have made conscious efforts to cultivate such a quality . I am the publicity director of our institutes Red Cross , responsible for organizing a series of campus events including the publicity of the World Health Day , the large-scale name-signing campaign to fight against AIDS on the World AIDS Day , and elementary training in first aid . In addition , I have participated in an ecological survey organized by our Institute to protect the suburban environment of XX . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and helping hand to others . Meanwhile , I have reinforced my determination to help people combat various diseases and live a healthy life . <p> At present , the nutritional conditions of Chinese citizens are far from being satisfactory . Malnutrition is rather common ; people either display insufficient nutrition or overtake of certain nutrients . In rural areas , regions of poor economic conditions and ethnic minorities , the diseases resulting from insufficient nutrition are widespread . By contrast , urban citizens tend to show surplus nutrition , resulting in the development of chronic diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases . The rate for the occurrence of the malignant tumor is also on the rise . <p> Although to promote human health and to ward off diseases have been the primary objective behind the biomedical research , I understand that a lot of the research programs in the field of biology are still confined to laboratory experiments and there is a long way to go before the research findings can be commercially applied . My motivation in seeking an advanced degree program in nutrition is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be applied to the solution of such practical problems of strengthening our physique , preventing diseases and improving our health conditions through a scientific makeup of our daily diet . <p> Despite the fact that in present-day China nutrition science has not captured sufficient concern that it deserves and the general publics understanding of it is rather limited , it is bound to make extensive development as people become more and more concerned with improving the quality of their life . As one of a few prestigious universities in the world that offer advanced degree programs in nutrition science , your university boasts of admirable teaching and research achievements , with a strong faculty and state-of-art research facilities . An education from such a university will definitely endow me with the most updated theories and practical experiences in nutrition science . <p> SARS is now kept at bay , but we are given many important questions to ponder over , one of which is " how can we improve our disease-fighting ability in our daily life ?

For the first year of my life I lived in a tiny cabin in the woods with plywood floors and no indoor plumbing . Even though my parents were the only ones in their families to have college degrees , they were always struggling to make ends meet . My father , a Vietnam veteran , was either unwilling or unable to hold a job for very long . Eventually my mother decided to go back to school , leaving my father to take care of my sister and me while she studied and worked . <p> At the start of elementary school I was placed in a program for gifted students , taking special classes designed to challenge me where regular classrooms could not . It was wonderful , but it was n't to last . When I was eight , my parents decided to move to northern Minnesota , and I was pulled out of the gifted and talented program . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially strapped school district . There were no special programs at my new school . Most of the students were from poor rural families like mine and the dropout rate was high . Suddenly , I was very bored in school and began to hate it . <p> When I was fourteen , we moved again . This time we went to yet another small rural town in the farming country of southwestern Minnesota . Right away I got a job as a waitress at the local diner , using the earnings to help my family . The job was difficult for a shy kid like me , but my family needed the money . I eventually learned to overcome my shyness , and after a year of working at the diner I became very good at it . But then my family moved again to , of course , another small rural town , this time in north central Minnesota . <p> It did n't  take long for me to realize that I did n't  want to be a waitress in a series of small towns for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to have a better life I would have to depend on myself .

To be honest , I think I really just needed an excuse to get away . Thankfully , I was awarded a scholarship from the Blandin Foundation in my community to go to France during my junior year with an exchange program , and I jumped at the opportunity . <p> Going to France changed my life . I was intellectually challenged for the first time since I left Alaska . I embraced the challenge and loved every minute of it . One of the happiest times of my life came in February of that year when I realized I had broken through the language barrier and had become fluent in French . Despite the initial language difficulties , I earned straight As at the French high school I attended and became close with my French friends and host family . It was difficult to leave at the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced intense culture shock . <p> During my senior year I took college courses at the local community college instead of attending high school . I worked full-time in the evenings and had a daily babysitting job , too . On top of that , my parents were both commuting several hours away for work and I was left in charge of my younger sister . I struggled to make it to class and study when I could find the time , and I somehow managed to earn a decent GPA by the end of the year . <p> I chose to go to St. Cloud State University because I did n't  want to be stuck at the community college for another year , and I knew that if I wanted to get somewhere in life I had to have at least a four-year college degree . College has n't  always been easy .

I am a curious person that craves intellectual stimulation and exposure to new ideas . I want to become a lawyer for many reasons but the primary reason is because I want to have a good career so that I can support my family and myself . I have spent enough of my life in small , rural Minnesota towns and now I am ready for my next big personal and academic adventure . <h> Sample Personal Statement #2 <p> When I was eight years old my family moved to a small town about forty miles north of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . Slinger has a population of 3000 . After getting over being the new girl from big scary Milwaukee , I basically sat side-by-side the same twenty-five classmates for the next four years . After that , we all went across the street to the middle school where another elementary school joined us . Of course everyone knew everyone else here as well . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get a sense of belonging and deep friendship by being so close to people . I was an " insider " who shared everything with the same people , day in and day out . <p> But the feeling of comfort I had in being part of the group soon gave way to a sense of monotony . The people around me were blind to diversity and were reluctant to change . The people Ive known forever disregard diversity with respect to people and cultures , but more fundamentally they fail to pursue the diversity of what life has to offer . I knew more existed in the world . I knew life existed outside of Slinger , and that is what wanted for myself . Consequently , I chose to attend college 400 miles away from anyone I ever knew and where no one knew me . <p> When I decided I wanted to study law after graduating from St. Cloud State University , I knew I needed some experience . I wanted to get my foot in the door at a law firm or simply be exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career was really for me . I went home to Slinger for the summer wanting to work in a law firm . Unfortunately , in Slinger there are just two lawyers . They are husband and wife and work out of their house . Their son runs their errands . So much for the legal market back home . <p> I realized then and there that I had outgrown Slinger for good . I decided to seek employment in the big city of Minneapolis . I obtained an internship at the Hennepin County Public Defenders Office . Working as an investigator for public defenders opened my eyes to how difficult it is for the accused to obtain what they are constitutionally entitled to . Many of our clients were scary , and committed unspeakable crimes . I had never seen anything like it . While growing up I read about some " kids getting into trouble " in the Slinger Police Blotter , but I never had to sit five feet from a convicted murderer contesting a charge of armed robbery . <p> Still , this defendant deserved all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was proud to help him . The folks back in Slinger would never have understood this . I participated in a part of our legal system that makes sure everyone is given justice . But when my own clients are reluctant to work with me because the only experiences they have had with the law are negative , it makes it very challenging to serve them fully . I may have been able to get statements from everyone who saw my client the night of the alleged crime , but I cant convince my client that the law is supposed to work for him . Again , because of where and how I grew up I have always viewed police officers as the " good guys . " But at the public defenders office , I had a seven-year-old client who shut the door in my face because he thought I as a cop . He wanted nothing to do with me . This is something I have never been faced with before in my life . I wanted real life legal experiences from my internship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defender , I continued to further my legal education both in and outside of the classroom . For example , I was nominated to participate in the National Youth Leadership Forum . For two weeks we intensely studied the South African legal system . The experience was amazing . Like my internship , it changed my outlook on the law . The South African legal system is in the process of complete transformation . To see the struggles of a nation working toward a kind of justice its people has never known made me look at the United States system of justice with more reverence . In America we see the right to a jury trial as a fundamental right . In South Africa they see juries as a hindrance to justice . They do not believe that ordinary people without legal education are able to decide the guilt or innocence of a person . <p> Not only was what I learned about the South African legal system worthwhile , but the people I met made my trip unique as well . I loved being able to talk to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thoughts and feelings about these new approaches to the law was intellectually stimulating . Moreover , I made lasting friendships . The folks back home did n't  want me to go on the tripthey were worried for my safety due to South Africas notorietybut I 'm so glad I did . <p> I have begun to learn about what the law entails and I have seen the law at work in a variety of places . I want to continue learning in law school . To be able to work with some of the most diverse , educated , and experienced people in the world is an aspect of law school that I look forward to . I want to learn with and from them . I am committed to exploring and mastering the legal field , and I know that I will succeed because I have the drive , patience , and courage to go tackle the " unknown . " <p> I have come a long way from being a small town girl living where everybody knows my name . But , I still have a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and law school is the next step that will enable me to do just that . <h> Sample Personal Statement #3 <p> Note : The following 345-word personal statement was part of a successful application to a top-25 law school . When he arrived on campus with the law schools new entering class , the Dean of Admissions not only remembered his application , but also told the author that his was " the best personal statement that she had ever seen . " Study this personal statement carefully . Note that the stories told reveal a lot about the applicant , and that despite its short length , this statement packs a lot of punch . <p> For most people , the slap on the face that turns their life around is figurative . Mine was literal . <p> Actually , it was a punch delivered by a drill sergeant at Fort Dix , New Jersey , while I was in basic training .

I could thus advance more easily , but I also exposed my unprotected face to hostile fire . Drill sergeants are typically very good at detecting this type of laziness , and mine was an excellent drill sergeant . So , after his repeated suggestions that I correct my performance went unheeded , he drove home his point with a fist to my face . <p> We were both stunned . This was , after all , the New Army , and striking a trainee was a career-ending move for a drill sergeant , as we were both aware . I could have reported him ; arguably , I should have . I did n't  . It did n't  seem right for this good sergeant , who had not slept for almost four days , to lose his career for losing his temper with my laziness . Choosing not to report him was the first decision I remember making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier the next day ; neither was I the same unmotivated person who , for lack of effort , had failed at virtually everything I had previously attempted . I was determined ( itself a novel experience ) to apply myself to soldiering . <p> That was eight years ago . In the interim I have enjoyed a short but distinguished military career , married , fathered a child and resumed my college education . I am currently poised to graduate with honors from State University . Looking forward to law school , I can only trust that my distant mistakes are not too costly ; I am certain , however , that the lessons Ive learned will continue to assist me. 
@@42231401 @2231401/ <h> The History of SAT <p> The SAT is word that every High Schooler dreads . This word has become engraved into their heads from the moment they hear " College " . The SAT can make or break your future . It has become one of the largest determining factors for , who goes where to College . College has become such a competitive and impacted institution , that in order to get into a college you must excel on this test . All of this is NOT true . <p> Before we even had the SAT , most people who went to college were the rich and elite on the east coast . Members of these school communities did not just want people who could pay their way in , but those who were qualified also . They wanted to expand their school population , so they need to broaden their horizons . They needed something that would that they could compare students all over the country and even internationally . <p> The idea of a national test was first developed in 1900 by a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEEB ) . This group was organized to " help high school students make a successful transition to higher education " ( www.collegeboard.com ) by giving High school students consistent guidelines from year to year , to strive towards . If the students knew exactly what the Colleges were looking for , in their new students they can strive to meet those standards . <p> The test was supposed to be a way to help along the admission processes for those participating colleges . By having the students take this test it also provided the colleges with a consistent tool to judge the Students that were coming from all the over the country . The Colleges do not know everything about the High School they came from , so to allow equal opportunity for everybody , they needed a standardized test . <p> So the CEEB , know today as the College Board , developed the Scholastic Achievement test ( SAT ) . Though just because they developed this test , it was not a factor consider by every College , at this time . The majority of Colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admission process , were the Colleges of the Northeast of the country , or the IVY leagues schools . This was because the few colleges that were part of the CEEB were from these Colleges . In 1926 there was just about over 8,000 people taking the SAT . It took many years for colleges to take the SAT as a viable resource to judge their new students on . Now there are over millions who take the SAT , because it has become a requirement for admission into College . <p> So , when the SAT was first introduced it was an Achievement test to determine what a student had achieved in their high school career . It was to " measure the level achieved by students " ( http : **36;371;TOOLONG ) who were applying to a college . They would determine whether they had acquired the amount of knowledge they should know to come to the school . It was the Colleges way to reinforce the grades that a student might have received in high school . Every college does n't know the difficulty of each individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that they had a supplement to the grades they had received . <p> In 1941 the CEEB had to change the name to the Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT ) , which it is most associated with . They changed the test to suite a more logical , and developmental viewpoint of the Student . The test had evolved into a determining factor of a person 's intelligence . The test was becoming more popular in the 1950 's and 1960 's , but had not yet become universal . As the SAT 's became more popular , people knew what to expect so they would study towards the test . <p> Coaching Schools developed for example ; Kaplan , and the Princeton Review . Schools such as these forced the College Board to change the name of he SAT yet again . This time they changed the name to the Scholastic Assessment Test ( SAT ) . They did not feel right about calling it an aptitude test when someone could be coached to get a good score . It now was determined by how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subject that was taught at the high schools . Though this name change did not last long in 1994 they changed the test to the neutral SAT , with out being an acronym . The SAT 1 is a reasoning test , which examines a students Mathematical and Verbal Skills . There is a possible high score of 800 in each subject , so a total high of 1600 . These scores were able to portray the students weak and strong points in the subjects . <p> The SAT provides a reliable system to determine the qualifications of a Student applying to go to a college . The SAT has been able to give colleges the opportunity to accept students based on their merit and not their Family background . In the Past the people who went to college or further their education were the rich and well connected people . The SAT has been able to set aside the family ties and provide concrete evidence of a student 's merit . <p> The College board wanted to make college appeal to those who believed they had no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cam from low- income families , by providing fee-waivers that could make it possible for those students to take the test , and not feel intimidated by college . The College Board wants to make every individual feel that college could be for them if they wanted it . <p> Additionally , the College Board set up the SAT to provide the College a consistent and common practice to compare to the inconsistent grading systems at the High schools . The colleges have no way of knowing the exact grading method for every teacher of every class they teach . The SAT balances out those broad ranges of teachers . The national test is the same one for every body who takes it . The same machines grade each individual test , and each test is scored exactly the same . This system provides for at least one consistent component when comparing applicants . <p> Finally the SAT is able to give stability to the inconsistencies of the nations curriculum standards . Education is not a national government issue . It is a state issue , which allows there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counties with in the state . It goes further in that each school has many different ways of fulfilling the requirements by the state . Each school could be teaching totally different things across the country . The SAT also again provides a consistent factor in the application processes . <p> Without the SAT the Colleges would have not one common factor between the students applying to attend their school . The Schools would become less integrated , because they would only accept those students near their area , because they knew their curriculum and grading . It would also cause the students who have the good background and received the best education to progress to the schools of the rich . <p> I am not saying the SAT is the only thing that Colleges look at when admitting students to their school . There is no school that uses the SAT as the only factor in the admission processes . The SAT only provides the College with a national consistent factor for every student that is considered for admission . <p> In fact the SAT has been changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By doing this forces the High schools to teach somewhat the same things , because every student is going to be tested on it in order to get into college . The College Board made the test so the student applies his or her knowledge and doe not just get lucky by guessing on an answer . This new way is supposed to make it so students are not learning how to beat the SAT , but in fact are knowledgeable and hardworking students . <p> Overall the SAT does in fact prove to be helpful , though it depends on the College or University on how much emphasizes it should take in the Admission processes . It has been modified to help fit the needs of today , but I do not think that it can ever be gotten rid of . Maybe replaced , for example the ACT , but they need some type of National Factor , which connects the whole country together in education .

In xxx he was a winner of the International Physics Olympiad ( IPhO ) in City , Country , and was awarded silver medal there . Also Ivan was a winner of All-Ukrainian PhOs , Young Physicists Tournaments during 1994-1997 . <p> His first year of undergraduate studies Ivan spent in the XX Department of XX National University . Next year he continued his study at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology ( MIPT ) . I was not surprised when Ivan was admitted to our institute as a second year transfer student . It is necessary to notice that no more than five students are admitted in such a way per year . For that they have to pass thorough examinations and show substantial irreproachable knowledge of physics and mathematics , as well as high clarity of thoughts . <p> Studying at the Institute is very hard but Ivan became one of the top students here . This judgment is supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students Physics Olympiad ( 2nd position in xxx ) , successfully participated in All-Russian students Theoretical Mechanics Olympiad .

For such excellence in studies and research work Ivan was selected two times as a Soros Student . <p> Every year a small group of students and MIPT professors conduct winter and summer sessions of the Russian IPhO Team . The aim of the sessions is to select and to train the team of 5 high school students . For this reason we turn to students of MIPT , generally former participants of IPhOs , who proved themselves to be excellent students . They invent problems to solve , give seminars , laboratory classes and examine high school students knowledge of physics . Ivan Ivanov belongs to this small group of students . I have to mention that Ivan started his teaching practice as early as while studying at XX University . He conducted sessions , training high school students for All-Ukrainian and International PhOs .

For the last 8 years I have known several students like Ivan quite well . For example XX , XX and XX ( all of them are graduate students at Harvard now ) , XX , XX and XX ( they are graduate students at MIT ) , XX ( University of California at Berkeley ) .

You should follow the instructions on the individual applications regarding the number and types of letters that they want to receive . In general , however , the following guidelines apply : <p> Law schools use the letters to determine " close calls " or to make decisions about applicants who are in the large gray middle area ( not instant accepts , not instant rejects ) . <p> You should have at least one letter from a faculty member . That letter should tell the school why you are capable of the intellectual work necessary of a law student . In short , the best letter tells the law school that you can do the work because you have the requisite analytical and writing skills . The law schools want to know what kind of student you are going to be . You should , therefore , develop a close relationship with at least one faculty member who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is particularly important if you have a low GPA or LSAT score . You need someone to attest to you academic abilities . If you have been out of college for a long time and can not obtain faculty letters , you should have your recommenders attest to your intellectual abilities and skills . <p> The more specific and detailed the letter , the better . Give your recommender a copy of the attached guide for letter writers , along with a resume and copies of your work . <p> Letters from advisors , employers , internship directors , or supervisors are fine , so long as they can attest to the same kinds of skills . <p> Letters that discuss your personal qualities are less useful . See the attached guidelines for letter writers . Personal qualities count , but more importantly , the law school wants to know that you can handle their work . You can discuss your personal qualities in your personal statement . <p> Some letters are useless . These include " name dropping " letters from people who do not really know you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short or generic letters ; and letters that you have reserved the right to see . <p> You have the choice about whether to waive your right to look at your letters of recommendation . However , it is n't really a choice , because a letter that is not confidential is basically discredited by law schools . Your recommender should be able to write the letter in confidence , and you should waive your right to see it . <p> Many law schools prefer that you use the LSAC 's letter of recommendation service . You should consult with the school regarding which course is best ( usually indicated on the application ) . However , there is some evidence that personal lettersones sent directly to the school , with the school 's name , and tailored to the schoolmatter more , because law schools pay more attention to them . If you have schools where you would like an " edge , " or would prefer to attend , consider asking your recommender(s) to prepare a personal letter for that school . <p> Letters that are old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of school for a few years . You can either arrange for your faculty letters before you leave or contact them again when you actually need the letters . If you contact a former professor , it is helpful to enclose a resume , a list of the courses you had with him/her and your grades , and samples of your work for those classes . A photo helps , too . Your professor will not be insulted if you do this ; he/she will be grateful . Remember , your professor sees hundreds of students each year , so reminders from former students are helpful . ( Note : you may wish to use the LSAC 's letter service , as they will hold letters for you for the duration of your registration period , which is currently 5 years . ) <p> The LSAC is continually updating its letter of recommendation service . You need to check when you register about the benefits it has added . For 2005-06 , there are several changes . First , you can store up to 4 letters of recommendation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are received , but you have the ability to designate which letters go to which schools . Also , the service is accepting " targeted " letters ( also known as " school specific " letters ) for the first time . <p> When to Use a School-Specific Letter : You need a reason to send a targeted letter to a specific school . If you do n't have one , a general letter will do just fine . Some reasons are better than others : " I have always wanted to attend your particular school " is not very compelling . " I like your small class size " is no better . The reason should be particular to that school . Maybe it has a special program for which you are ideally qualified . Perhaps for personal or family reasons you can not move and must attend the school closest to your home . A targeted letter gives you the chance to explain why you are uniquely suited for that school . 
@@42231407 @2231407/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> The Top Five Mistakes that Applicants Make <p> The following are the most common mistakes made by the students I have advised over the years . They 're listed in no particular order , but all of them are bad . Please do not contribute to this listavoid these pitfalls . <p> Applying without preparation . <p> Every year I see students at the start of the fall semester of their senior year who have just realized that they are graduating in May . Not having a plan for after graduation , they come by and tell me that they want to go to law school . If they reach me early enough in September , they can still take the LSAT and apply . But nine times out of ten , they are not ready for the LSAT and do not have the time to devote to doing an adequate job with their applications . Applying to law school takes planning , stamina , and money . Doing it at the last minute ( and yes , starting from scratch a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not going to make you a very competitive applicant . <p> Taking the LSAT on a whim . <p> I ca n't say it often enough : you should not take the LSAT until you are absolutely ready , and you should plan to take it only once . Do not go into the test with the mindset that you can simply do it over if you do n't like your score . Ask yourself : how much did you really study for the test ? A month 's preparation is not good enough . Studying during your work breaks the summer before you take it is not good enough . Taking the 4- or 8- week Kaplan course is not good enough . The best way to judge the time needed to study for the exam is to take a real LSAT under simulated conditions , and then grade your work . Are you happy with your score ? Do you earn that score consistently on the practice exams ? Do you have every reason to think that you will earn that score again on the real test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to attend ? Remember , there are over 100,000 folks a year applying to law school with you . The ones who take it the most seriously are likely to be the most successful applicants . <p> Focusing on law school , not law practice . <p> My students are great Internet researchers . They can tell me detailed facts about lots of law schools , and they commonly develop elaborate application strategies . Most of them , however , can not tell me anything about the practice of law , which is why one goes to law school in the first place . There is no substitute for real world experience in a law firm , a prosecutor 's or public defender 's office , a governmental agency law office , a non-profit legal organization , or any legal organization for that matter . Focusing on law school is a common mistake . Law school is only 3 years long , and it prepares you for your upcoming 40-year career . Which one should you really think about , and devote your planning and strategizing to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Applications should be in and complete at the latest by January 1st . In the current environment , I would highly recommend getting them in by December 1st . Every year I have students come to me in January or February and say , " I 'm applying to XYZ law school because it has a March 1st application deadline . " NOT ! While March 1st or April 1st technically might be the last dates to apply , in reality admissions decisions are made starting in November , and all of the free financial aid is usually gone by early February . Do you really want to be the last application the law school receives in a pile of thousands of applications ? Usually , you are better off waiting until next year to apply than applying so late in the admissions cycle . <p> Most students apply late because they do not have their act together . However , I 've had some studentsvery good studentsapply to certain schools late because they are getting rejected by the schools they applied to initially . This is a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should apply broadly to maximize your chances of admission and financial aid . You apply in the fall ; the decision where to attend is NOT made in the fall , but in the spring . It is perfectly okay to apply to schools that you are not really enamored with , using them as " safety " or " fallback " schools . I have advised some students who say , " if I do n't get accepted by the schools I want , I wo n't go . " The problem is , they tend to change their minds as graduation approaches and as rejection letters pile up . Lower-ranked schools start to look much more attractive than the alternative of not going to law school at all , and then these students race around to apply at the last minute to schools they should have applied to months earlier . Try to avoid this stressapply to a good long list of schools , including several realistic onesat the outset . <p> Writing a boring personal statement . <p> Yeah , it 's hard to write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to law school , and you have to be convincing . A boring personal statement will not help your cause , and in fact probably will hurt it because your file will not stand out from the others in the big pile of applications . <p> Some of my students conclude that , if they can not write a good personal statement , or if the process proves difficult , they are not law school material . Wrong ! Almost everyone finds if difficult to write a compelling and interesting personal statement . That 's no reflection on your intellect or your ability to be a lawyer someday . You need to put your insecurities aside for this project and give the law school a glimpse of who you areas if you are in an interview , albeit on paper . Writing it may be like pulling teeth , but that 's exactly the point . If it were easy to do , everyone would do it , and everyone would apply to law school . The successful applicants are the survivors , the ones who overcome their doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school admissions process . The personal statement , like the LSAT , is one of those hurdles . Jump over it with strength and confidence and flair . 
@@42231408 @2231408/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> What is a Good LSAT Score ? <p> This is one of the most frequently asked questions of pre-law advisorsmaybe the most frequently asked . Ultimately , how good your score is depends on one thing : how good your prospective law school perceives it to be . <p> You can obtain recent statistics for the law schools regarding what their median LSAT score was for last years admitted students . ( A median means that the same number of folks scored above and below that score . ) You can also obtain ranges : what percentage of folks with my score were accepted to which law schools . The ABA/LSAC Official Guide to Law Schools , found on-line at www.lsac.org , has a search engine that allows you to sort law schools by different kinds of data . This information is also available in the book version of the Official Guide , in the form of the grids provided by the individual law schools . <h> The Scoring Scale <p> The current LSAT is scored on a scale of 120 to 180 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an LSAT breaks down like this : <p> 10% of test takers score a 162 or above ; <p> 20% of test takers score a 142 or below ; <p> 70% of test takers are in the middle between a 142 and 162 . <p> These percentages stay pretty much stable from LSAT to LSATits one way the LSAC ensures that one administration of the test is not appreciably easier or harder than another . Thus , you can not " guess " the best date to take the test to get the easiest version , or be unlucky and take an exceptionally hard test . Scores are adjusted slightly if a test , on the whole , proves a bit easier or harder . On rare occasions , a question might even be thrown out . But these percentages remain stable . <p> So then , what is a good score on the LSAT ? The higher the better , obviously . If you are looking to be admitted to a top ten school , then in essence you are looking for a way to break into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores ( 90 percentile or higher ) . A high LSAT score is no guarantee of admission , but it comes close . <p> Each law school has its own goals for the LSAT . Some schools weigh it more heavily than others , but all schools take it seriously . You should , too . As I tell students when I meet with them , the better your score , the better your chance for admission and free financial aid . NEVER TAKE THE LSAT UNTIL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY READY . <h> Scoring Breakdown <p> If you score below 150 , your chances of acceptance are poor . That is not to say that you will never succeed , but that the odds are against you . Other things can offset a poor LSAT score , including a second and improved LSAT score , desirable diversity characteristics in an applicant such as race or socioeconomic factors , and the like . Also , there are at least two accredited law schools in the nation that will take almost anyone , offering them the chance at law school , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their students after the first year , taking their tuition and sending them off . But if you can hack it , you can stay . <p> If you score above a 160 or so , and particularly above a 165 , you may be fought over by some schools . The best law schools look for numbers in the mid- to high-160s ( or better ) , but even then you are not guaranteed admission . Ivy League schools have lots of great applicants for very few spaces in their classes , so sometimes even folks with high scores are unsuccessful at some schools . Schools like Yale and Stanford , with classes numbering under 200 students per year , are a real crap shoot unless your famous parents went there . But setting those few aside , there are plenty of law schools that would love to have you , and you should have good choices . If you apply in a timely manner , you will likely also see some free financial aid accompanying your admission letters . <p> If you are like most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores in the middle . In this group , the higher the score , the more options you will have . The way the LSAT is scored , there is very little difference , say , between a 153 and a 154maybe two more correctly answered questions , tops . So on the one hand , you should not shy away from schools that have median LSAT scores just above yours . On the other hand , there is a difference , say , between a 151 and a 155 , and you should take that into consideration when selecting schools . There are plenty of schools that would love to have someone who scores in the low 150s . And there are also plenty of law schools that would love to give some money to someone who scores in the high 150s . It all depends on where you want to go , and how flexible you are willing to be in the process . <h> Can a good GPA offset a poor LSAT ? <p> To a certain extent , yes , but not that much . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPA . If you look at the Official Guide in book form ( available on reserve ) , you will see on the various schools grids that , if you hold your GPA constant and raise your LSAT score , your chances of admission go up significantly at almost every school . The same is not so true if you hold your LSAT score constant and raise your GPA . <p> Of course , a good LSAT score does not make you a " shoe-in " anywhere . At the University of Minnesota , for example , Dean of Admissions Collins Byrd notes that every year nearly 10% of high scoring students are rejected , mostly because they have nothing else to show for themselves or because they come off badly on their applications . <p> If you are one of those folks in the middle ( 70% of test takers end up there , remember ) , the higher you score , the more you will distinguish yourself . The folks in the middle are the tough calls for law school admissions committees : instant accepts and instant rejects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicants in the middle is large , and after awhile it becomes hard to tell who is more deserving , or who stands out more . When this happens , the best thing you can do for yourself is have a compelling , readable personal statement . If your personal statement is undistinguished , your application will likely be undistinguished , too . You need a way to separate yourself from the pack of white , middle-class political science majors who have " always wanted to go to law school . " <h> In Summary <p> A good LSAT score depends upon what you want in a law school , and where you are willing to go . But as a general rule , and I can not say this often enough , the higher the score , the better your chances for admission and free financial aid . NEVER TAKE THE LSAT UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO DO YOUR BEST . NEVER GO INTO AN LSAT EXAM THINKING THAT YOU CAN " JUST TAKE IT AGAIN " if you do n't  like your score . Although the LSAT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a significant factor for every school , and you should take it very seriously .

Instruction is done " one-on-one " or in a classroom setting with a qualified teacher to help those preparing for the GED tests . <p> The following test taking strategies are helpful if you are preparing for the GED tests : <p> When you read to find the main idea , if you do not find a directly stated main idea , it is probably implied in the details and examples . To understand an unstated main idea , ask yourself questions such as What is Happening ? Where is it Happening ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , why , and how . ) <p> Remember that restating an idea does not mean just repeating it . Each time a writer adds another detail or example , the central idea of the reading is made clearer . Each supporting detail adds to the main idea , much as adding another piece to a puzzle makes it easier to identify the picture . <p> Writers often use examples that show how a principle can be applied to everyday life . As you read each example , think of related examples that you have seen in your life . Then think about how your examples are related to the information you are reading . <p> When you are attempting to distinguish between opinion and fact , look for supporting details and information that prove a point . Remember that facts can be proven , but opinions can not . <p> When you are trying to come to a conclusion when you are reading material , you will have to use your reasoning skills as well as your comprehension skills . Before you come to a conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of any unfamiliar terms from the context . <p> As you read a question or other written information , look for what might cause something else to happen . Sometimes , the order in which events take place gives a hint to what might cause some eventual happening to occur . <p> Remember to look carefully at any diagrams , charts , and graphs in the reading material . Although charts , graphs , and other diagrams often repeat information that is written as text , they also add extra details . Notice the terms that are used to label parts of the chart , graph or diagram . Then look for those same terms in the written material . <p> Before you answer any question , be sure you have information that supports your choice . Do not rely on things outside the context of the written material .

@@42231412 @2231412/ <h> GRE Test <h> GRE Verbal Guide <p> GRE Sentence Completion <p> As its name suggests , the Sentence Completion question requires you to complete a sentence with one or two blanks . Immediately after the question are the five answer choices . Which choice is correct solely depends on the information provided by the original sentence . That 's to say , the original sentence is the only place where you can seek clues for filling the blank . <p> There are about 6 Sentence Completion questions on the test day , and in most cases , the first question in the verbal section is Sentence Completion . Sentence Completion is rarely difficult for most students , but sometimes it may be a problem for international students when they are unfamiliar with the key word or phrase that serves the clue for completing sentence . You should know there are no more clues that you can seek elsewhere like the long passage in reading comprehension question . That 's why some international students prefer reading compression questions to sentence completion questions . There is no shortcut for understanding the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more English words as possible . <p> Given that you know the meaning of every word or phrase in the question , the sentence can be easily completed by identifying the clues in the original sentences . In the following passages , we will discuss how to seek problem solving clues , such as transitional words that indicate the relationship of each sub-sentence , and so on . <p> GRE Analogy <p> In an analogy question , you are given a pair of capitalized words and other five pairs of lower-case words . You are then required to choose a pair of words among the five that has the same logical relationship as the original capitalized pair . The analogy question not only tests your vocabulary base , but also tests your ability to recognize the logical relationship between two words . Here is an example . <p> Example <p> HORSE : MARE : : <p> ( A ) cat : kitten <p> ( B ) human : woman <p> ( C ) bull : cow <p> ( D ) child : adult <p> ( E ) animal : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " and the two colons ( : : ) means " is as " . We read the question as " horse to mare is as " Next , we need to define the relationship between this pair of words . What is the relationship between horse and mare ? A " mare " is a female horse . So , a rationale for this analogy could be " Y ( a mare ) is a female X " . Because analogy problems require us to look for a pair of words that have the same relationship has the initial two words , we are looking for a pair in which the second word is a female of second word . Once you have determined the relationship between the given pair of words and state it in your mind in sentence form , read through the answer choices substituting the possible pairs into the same sentence you have created to describe the initial pair . <p> Let 's work through the answer choices . Is a kitten a female cat ? No , this does not make sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really makes sense . Choices B , C , and D do not have such relationship . <p> Trap : It is extremely important to pick up the pair of words that has the same order in relationship . <p> How to define the relationship <p> Think of a sentence that expresses the relationship between the two capitalized words . Your sentence should not be too general . If it is , then it is highly possible that more one answer choices would fit into that sentence . Therefore , you should explain the relationship as precisely as you could . The more precise your sentence , the easier it is to pick up the right answer . <p> Let 's look at an example . <p> TELESCOPE : ASTRONOMER : : <p> ( A ) picture : artist <p> ( B ) environment : ecologist <p> ( C ) element : chemist <p> ( D ) brush : painter <p> ( E ) movie : director <p> We are trying to create a sentence that describes a relationship between the words telescope and astronomer . Let 's say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument commonly used in the work of an " astronomer " . Therefore , a rationale for this analogy could be " X ( a telescope ) is an instrument commonly used in or associated with the work of a person called a Y ( astronomer ) . " A " brush " is an instrument commonly used in the work of a " painter . " Therefore , D is the best answer . <p> Do n't  pick up the choice until you believe it is the best of the five pairs . Let 's look at an example to see why we should approach the analogy problem in such way . <p> MATRIX : NUMBER : : <p> ( A ) gas : molecule <p> ( B ) snow : precipitation <p> ( C ) act : opera <p> ( D ) school : fish <p> ( E ) crystal : atom <p> You may define the relationship of the word " matrix " and " number " as : matrix is composed of numerous numbers . In this way , choice A would be great because gas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last choice , you will not find a better pair . Choice E is the one . Crystal is defined as a regular arrangement of atoms . For the setup pair , matrix can be defined as a regular arrangement of numbers . The two pairs of words perfect match in relationship . Therefore , E is the best answer . <p> GRE Antonyms <p> There are about 9 antonyms on verbal section of the GRE . The questions are mixed in with the analogies , sentence completions , and reading comprehension . In antonym question , you are given a capitalized word , and then required a pick up a word among five that is opposite or nearly opposite to the original word in meaning . A sample antonym questions looks like this : <p> PROFOUND <p> ( A ) superficial <p> ( B ) precipitous <p> ( C ) deep <p> ( D ) tarnished <p> ( E ) innocuous <p> Which of the words is opposite in meaning to the word " profound " ? The word " profound " can be adjective or noun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is that the five words should be considered in same function . Here it is an adjective . " Profound " means difficult to understand or far below the surface . In choice A , " superficial " means lying on surface , directly opposite to the meaning of " profound " . " Precipitous " means steep in rise or fall , " deep " means same as " profound " , " tarnished " means losing luster , and " innocuous " means harmless . Among the five words , only " superficial " has the meanings that are opposite to the given capitalized . <p> Trap : Be alert to secondary meaning of a word . The GRE writers often use common words but with its uncommon meaning . <p> Put the words in sentence <p> A single word is difficult to understand , when combined into phrases or sentences , however , we have little trouble . If you do n't  recognize the meaning of a word , think of a phrase in which you have hear it before . <p> Consider the root word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can spot the root word to deduce the meaning of the original word . Most words are derived from other words .

And her grade surpassed that of the second top student with 10 . Thus it can be easily perceived that Miss Tian has an outstanding ability of learning , a solid grounding in theories and resourceful potentials to apply what she has learned to practice . <p> What most strongly impressed me was her performance in the university 's gymnastic team . After rigorous screening test , Miss Tian became a member of the gymnastic team not long after her admission to the university . For all that she had no gymnastic basis , she managed to see the three-year arduous training through to the end by virtue of indomitable will and keen interest in gymnastics .

Although Miss Tian kept falling down from the apparatus , she made unremitting efforts to improve her skills so that she was able to smoothly complete the whole set of movements in the contest . The training in the gymnastic team also helped to foster her fine sense of teamwork , one of the important makings for her future success in academic studies . <p> The rapid development at the globe will necessarily bring about tremendous and profound changes in the society .

@@42231419 @2231419/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Linguistics <p> In connection with my application for acceptance into your Ph.D . program , I am enclosing the following statement concerning my life , professional activities , and tentative future plans . <p> I was born in Xiamen , Fujian Province in China on November 8 , 1969 . Later , my family moved to Beijing where I grew up . I am from a family of academics . My father is a professor of linguistics and Chief of the University Journal Agency of Beijing Language and Culture University ( formerly Beijing Language Institute ) . My mother is a professor at the same university and teaches Chinese as a foreign language . From 1991 to 1993 , my mother taught Chinese at Wittenberg University , Ohio and Indiana University at Bloomington . She encouraged me to apply for admission to advanced programs in the U.S. <p> I graduated from high school in 1988 , and received the highest scores in my school at the National Entrance Examination for Universities . This made me an " Honor Student " at the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my major became English , with minors in linguistics , French and computer science . I was awarded consecutive scholarships for all four years in college . During my college years , I became more and more interested in linguistics . <p> My senior year was largely devoted to topics in linguistics , and my required thesis work focused on the influence of cultural and educational factors upon the Chinese and English languages . <p> After college , Beijing Science &amp; Technology University employed me . For the first year and a half I was assigned to a project aimed at creating improved computer program for idiomatic English-Chinese &amp; Chinese-English translations . This project proved me with considerable experience linguistics , and further improved my understanding of the subtleties of both English and Chinese . <p> Since the project completion , I have been teaching intensive English courses at Beijing Science and Technology University . Since July of 1993 , I have taught English listening comprehension at Beijing Language and Culture University . The latter classes are part of a program that provides adult Chinese professionals with opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially based on my desire to better comprehend the English language , and , in the process , learn more about my own language . China is now opening and engaging in ever expanding cultural and financial relations with the English-speaking countries of the West . It has struck me , as it may have occurred to many of my compatriots that negotiations to bring about these new and improved relations sometimes break down because of mutual ignorance about each others languages . I am aware that this has been a popular problem for study , among Americans engaging in business and other fields , but I am not aware of any serious attempt to research this problem from a Chinese point of view . <p> Through my work in the U.S. , I would hope to contribute to a better understanding of the problems inherent in the deep differences between the two languages . <p> I recognize that a thesis project in most graduate schools is chosen after on has studied in various programs in a department and after extensive discussion with ones professors . Nevertheless , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered a suitable topic . Such a study would focus on the cultural , historical , traditional and educational factors , which influence the two languages , and significantly contribute to possible misinterpretations . <p> My long-term plan is to continue working on comparative aspects of English and Chinese linguistics . I strongly desire to work in an academic environment combining teaching , research and writing . I heard that your English/Linguistics Department has a reputation for academic excellence . I am applying to your program because I desire the best education possible for my professional career .

@@42231428 @2231428/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Humanity <p> As a double major in Anthropology and Psychology at the University of Rhode Island , I have gained a strong background in both fields . My background is especially strong in physical anthropology , my primary field of interest . Physical anthropology consumes my life ; I do not study it because I find it somewhat interesting but because I am devoted to it ; I want to make it my life . In addition to maintaining a high GPA throughout my college career , and making the Dean 's list several times , I have also worked hard as a supervisor at Brooks Pharmacy for the past five years . Working my own way through college not only demonstrates my determination to gaining a high quality education and the seriousness with which I treat academics , but also attests to my leadership ability , maturity , and responsibility , both as a supervisor and as a student at the University of Rhode Island . My primary goal in applying to your graduate program is to prepare myself for a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research and in improving techniques used in the identification of human remains , I am very committed to pursuing forensic anthropology and believe your graduate program in anthropology will provide me with an excellent foundation in the area of physical and forensic anthropology . With a Master 's degree and Ph.D. , I will be well prepared to lead a very promising career . While I have no doubt that the program will push me to my limits , I am confident that I can face the rigorous challenges posed by graduate study and thrive under the demanding environment that advanced studies entail . <p> From my transcripts , you will see that not only am I a well-balanced student , I actually thrive in rigorous , upper level courses , courses akin to graduate-level courses . Armed with the confidence that I can excel at difficult courses , I believe I can achieve the highest level of success and satisfaction by taking the most demanding graduate program available . <p> In addition to my ability to excel in the classroom , I have demonstrated a proficiency in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my college career , and I hope it will become the primary component of my future . As a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island , I designed a research project entitled " Grooming and Affiliative Behavior in Three Species of Non-Human Primates " under the guidance of Dr. Su Boatright Horowitz in the Psychology Department at URI . My research proposal gained approval from the Institutional Care and Use Committee at URI and at the Roger William Park and Zoo where the three species of non-human primates ( Gibbons , Sakis , and Lemurs ) included in my study are kept . In addition to writing a successful research proposal , I also wrote and received a small funds grant from the University of Rhode Island in order to conduct my research . By being intimately involved in every aspect of research , from proposal and grant writing to data collection and analysis , I have learned what it takes to be a researcher , but more than that , I have learned how fulfilling and interesting research can be . <p> In the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poster presentation at the University of Rhode Island , and am planning to eventually publish my findings . Not only has this experience shown me that I am capable of excelling in conducting research , but it has also allowed me to develop a love for the hands on learning that is so crucial to successful research . In my final semester at URI , I will be participating in an ongoing research project concerning brain function and attention span under the direction of Dr. Dominic Valentino , a professor in the psychology department at URI . This project will undoubtedly further advance my academic skills and reinforce my passion for research . <p> Physical anthropology is more than just my primary area of education ; it has also become my hobby and lifestyle . The questions posed and answered via the study of physical anthropology have fascinated me for a very long time and have stimulated me to ask and seek to answer further questions .

@@42231431 @2231431/ <h> Resume Objective <p> Writing objective statements can be one of the most challenging parts of creating an effective resume . Below you 'll find some strategies and options to help you make the most of yours . <p> What is an Objective Statement ? <p> Immediately below the top section of a resume ( containing your name , address , etc. ) , there is usually a short section with one of these headings : " objective , " " professional objective , " " resume capsule , " or " career goals . " Most often the objective statement includes 1-3 line of text , summarizing the position(s) you are applying for and/or your main qualifications . While some writers choose to use a sentence format , many objective statements are simply descriptive phrases with minimal punctuation . <p> Why Write an Objective Statement ? <p> Objective statements improve your resume by helping you <p> emphasize your main qualifications and summarize them for readers <p> inform your readers of the position(s) you are seeking and your career goals <p> establish your professional identity <p> Tailoring for Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a good idea to tailor your objective statement ( as well as your whole resume and cover letter ) to particular organizations and/or positions . This means , for example , calling a position by the name the company uses to describe it . You might even indicate the organization 's name in your statement . Strive to match your qualifications with those desired by the organization . If you are unsure what your resume 's readers will be looking for , you 'll need to do some research to give your objective statement a competitive edge . <p> Questions to Ask <p> Before drafting or revising your objective statement , you will find it helpful to answer as many of the following questions as possible . <p> About You <p> About the Company or Organization <p> What are your main qualifications ( strengths , skills , areas of expertise ) <p> Which of your qualifications are most desired by your resume 's readers ? <p> What positions ( or range of positions ) do you seek ? <p> What position titles ( or range or positions ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What are some goals of the organizations that interest you ? <p> What type of organization or work setting are you interested in ? <p> What types of organizations or work settings are now hiring ? <p> Being Specific <p> The most common mistake made in writing objective statements is being too general and vague in describing either the position desired or your qualifications . For example , some objective statements read like this : <p> An internship allowing me to utilize my knowledge and expertise in different areas . <p> Such an objective statement raises more questions than it answers : What kind of internship ? What knowledge ? What kinds of expertise ? Which areas ? Be as specific as possible in your objective statement to help your readers see what you have to offer " at a glance .

@@42231439 @2231439/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Graduate School Application Fee and Cover Letter <p> Application Fee <p> Whether or not it will be possible to waive an application fee completely depends on the university . I would say 90% of the universities will waive the fee and if you are persistent it maybe 100% ( when applied second time I did n't pay fee to any universities including MIT and Stanford , which are usually the most strict ones in terms of the fee ) . First of all , ask the secretary via email whether it is possible to waive the fee , explain the financial hardship . If the waiver has been granted , state so in the cover letter when sending your application materials , if not include request for the fee waive with your application materials , you might also include the Letter from Profkom ( do n't forget to get it signed ) , and state in the cover letter that you are requesting a fee waiver . After that it is important to check with the department whether the fee waiver has been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might put your application on hold until you pay the fee and you wo n't find out about that unless you contact them . If after all your attempts , your fee waiver was not granted , you might try to send another request to the dean of the department or somebody else on the admission committee , if it fails it 's probably better to pay the fee or just cross out this university . ATTENTION : If you are applying on-line you wo n't be able to submit your application without paying the required application fee . <p> Cover Letter <p> Cover Letter is not required , but it is highly advisable to include it . <p> Filling out Your Application <p> The easiest way to fill out an application is to do it online . Unfortunately in the most cases to submit it you will have to pay an application fee , so if you do n't plan to pay the fee you will need to fill out an application forms by hand . Remember that neatness is important . Before filling out the original application , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate sheet of paper . You risk delay or even denial of admission if you send an incomplete application . It is very important to collect all the requested application materials ( statement , recommendations , test score report copies if you do n't request originals , transcripts etc . ) . University admissions committees will not review your application until all the requested documents are received ( if you have a valid reason why you can not submit some documents by stated deadline , explain it in the cover letter and send these documents ASAP ) . <p> Sending Your Application <p> To avoid losing parts of the application , send all the requested documents together in one large envelope . The recommendations should be sealed in individual envelopes signed by recommenders and enclosed in the big one . If you are able to pay the application fee , it is better to do so . Some schools will waive the fee , but others will not . If they refuse to waive the fee , they will hold your application and contact you . IMPORTANT : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the application fee , send the application to the academic department ( you can find their address on the university website or ask the secretary ) to which you are applying . Only the department may apply for a fee waiver . If you are able to pay , follow the instructions on the form . <p> The best and cheapest way to send your application is with your friend who currently in US and come home for winter break . If it is impossible use good post service such as Garanpost , PXPost.com , etc . <p> Deadlines for receiving application materials are often in January and February ( mid-December in some top schools ) . Do not wait until the deadline , send as soon as possible . After you mail the application , it is very important stay in touch with the university departments to monitor the progress of your application . One or two weeks after your application was supposed to be received check whether it was received , is complete and was given to the members of the admission committee for consideration .

It is through such training that I know I will be able to make the biggest impact on improving the lives of others as I strive to reach my fullest potential as both a professional and as a human being . <p> Proper training allows individuals to get off on the right foot , particularly in the cases of people who are entering into the work environment for the first time or for those that are in the process of changing their careers . With the correct type of training , people have the opportunity to enter into the job market with the skills that they need , with the ability to perform new functions as they are required , and the potential to be promoted to bigger and better positions as their careers progress .

Currently , China lags far behind the rest of the world as far as training for people in the workforce is concerned . China is currently experiencing exponential growth in almost all sectors , and this rapid development has created an urgent need for thousands of well-qualified experts in the training field . My desire is to devote myself to my country as an expert in the area of vocational training . <p> After a very thorough search and comparison between schools , I have found that Penn States graduate school has the best academic environment and that your Workforce Education and Development Program suits my situation very well .

I have gained a deeper understanding that training is a big business , and that both organizations and their employees have high expectations about what can be accomplished through training .

I have earned my bachelors degree , and my academic ability is very competitive with other students . My overall GPA ranked me in the top 5% among all students in my class , with a GPA of 3.70 for my last sixty credit units .

They want your essays to give a portrait of who you are , what motivates you , and what your personal and professional goals might be . In addition , your essays will provide a sense of how well you communicate . Do you have a way with words ? Do you get to the point ? Do you communicate with confidence ? Finally , your essays will reflect strongly how seriously you take your application , and by extension , your MBA project .

Then have them provide you with candid feedback . <p> Business school students face a uniquely difficult challenge , because most programs require a series of essays rather than a single , comprehensive personal statement . This fact alone should indicate the importance that business schools place on your written responses . Part of the reason for this extra required writing is that business schools also place a stronger emphasis on practical experience . Academic ability may still be the number-one factor , but it 's not enough to get you into a school , just as it 's not enough to guarantee your success in the business world . Business schools pay close attention to personal qualities , including your leadership , communication skills , initiative , vision , and many more . Grades and scores do not explain this side of you , and neither does a resume . <p> Thus your admission will depend largely on your ability to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant part of this process , as is a careful review of both your life and what you have done professionally . Many successful professionals have simply never had to articulate their accomplishments before and now for the first time must communicate this information in a very clear , concise , powerful manner that is accessible to anyone , even without knowledge of their field . Being able to convey both the substance and significance of one 's work life is crucial for all applicants .

You are legally entitled to them . The LSAT is perhaps the most important component of the law school admissions process . You should think carefully before taking the exam under non-accommodated conditions ; do not hamper your chances for a good score . <p> Submit your LSAT registration documents , including your request for accommodations , WELL IN ADVANCE of the deadlines . As soon as possible is not soon enough . The LSAC will take time to review your request for accommodations , and if you receive an unfavorable decision , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who had to appeal not once , but numerous times . The entire process of obtaining adequate accommodations took him nearly five months . <p> Be prepared to document your disability with CURRENT information . The LSAC will NOT tell you what documents you need to submit to make your case for accommodations . ( This fact causes a great deal of anxiety and frustration for disabled applicants . ) Instead , you send in your documentation and LSAC tells you if its adequate . The guidelines for documentation can be found on its web site at www.lsac.org . You will find that the LSAC is not very specific about the type of medical records and affidavits required to establish your disability and need for accommodations . <p> In general , however , you need to demonstrate at least that you ( a ) have a disability ; that has been ( b ) recently documented by an appropriate medical doctor/equivalent ; and that your disability is ( c ) linked directly to the accommodation you seek . Some students who have had their disabilities for years do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colleges make accommodations simply on the basis of a students claim of disability ; most probably do not require extensive documentation . <p> THE LSAC IS JUST THE OPPOSITE : IT REQUIRES YOU TO ESTABLISH YOUR DISABILITY , AND ITS LINK TO THE ACCOMMODATIONS YOU SEEK . Its standards are much tougher than your colleges or universitys . It will NOT be sufficient for you to tell LSAC that you already receive the same accommodations at your undergraduate institution . LSAC does not really care about the accommodations granted by other institutions . It is more concerned with medical documentation of your condition and how your condition affects your test-taking ability . The hard part is not establishing the disabilitymost students can do that through medical records . Rather , the hard part is establishing WHY your disability entitles you to the accommodations you seek . <p> The toughest accommodation to get , it seems , is extra time . Undergraduate institutions routinely allow extra time on timed examinations , but at least in my experience , it is like pulling teeth to obtain extra time from the LSAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have concerned its denial of extra time to mentally and physically disabled test-takers . If you are denied extra time , consider retaining a lawyer to " run interference " for you . Some disability law centers and legal aid organizations will represent you for free . Check with your school , too , to see if it provides any student legal aid . <p> My disabled student had a very difficult time obtaining extra time on his LSAT examination . Specifically , he had to establish that his disability was not simply physical . My student had to be specially tested to establish that the nature of his disability was both physical and cognitive . When he was able to submit the results of this testing , he finally received the extra time accommodation . However , he paid for this testing himself , and he used a lawyer .

When translated into actions this goal has reinforced my belief in leadership through creativity . <p> As a student in high school I had the idea of a drip irrigation system by a windmill . Using some old hose pipes , plastic tubes and a pulley arrangement I developed the model . This model won the gold medal at the prestigious Indian National science congress . While still in the third year of undergraduate program in Engineering I became the Technical consultant for a start up company . My technical idea won the first prize at Eureka 50K , Indias first Business Plan competition . For the past two and a half years I have been working in XXX corporation . The will to learn and the ability to spend long hours of cerebration on trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today as a 24-year-old individual I perceive that life for me has been a process of conscious evolution . The most integral part of this growth is the value system imbibed in me by my parents , teachers and my mentors and an intrigued liking for science . This played a vital role in my decision making for the future . As I finished high school I was selected for the Indian Naval Academy with merit ranking in the Top 25 in the country . However my liking for science guided me into pursuing a Bachelor degree in Electrical Electronics and Power ( EEP ) Engineering . This decision gave me ample opportunity to consolidate my creative energies and harness my technical aptitude . <p> In college , I always enjoyed long hours in the labs . It gave me the opportunity to correlate theory to practical phenomena . This in turn gave me a better understanding of the subject and newer lines of thinking . The course in EEP covered a wide panorama of subjects . Besides the core Electrical Engineering subjects I also studied major electronics subjects like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Digital switching circuits . I learnt programming in ANSI C and by the time I was in final year I developed a fair amount of expertise writing complex pieces of code . <p> In the third year of my engineering studies I was introduced to the subject of Control Systems . The first session in the labs was devoted to developing simple programs for a Simatic PLC . A combination of AND , OR blocks generating a complete control circuit for a motor fascinated me . I took up an internship in the Controls Lab and got to interact with Prof. A , a professor of great repute in the field of Automation and Controls . He introduced me to the synergies of Information technology and Automation systems . Under his guidance I completed the thesis in PC based Load Flow Analysis and also worked with the Mechanical Dept for PC based control of Robotic Arm . <p> Working on the projects gave me a sound technical base . But the greatest advantage of involving myself in these activities was that I developed the ability to multi-task effectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-curricular activities . I represented my college at state level Table Tennis and Debate competitions . I wanted to self-finance my education and worked part-time . I was also an active amateur environmentalist . The driving force behind all this was my aim to develop all the facets of my personality . In this process I could not achieve the grades I wanted to in the first and second year . But soon I garnered the skill of judicious allocation of time and energy . I did well in the third year and final year of Engineering . Moreover I do not feel that the marks I scored are the sole indicators of my understanding of the subject . A cogent reason to augment my belief is the final year of my engineering . <p> XX ( my present employer ) visited the college campus and offered me a job in the area of Process Automation and MES . I was among the twenty candidates selected from the best institutes across the country . I passed the six rounds of technical and personal interviews and I was the only student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up the job . For me it meant a chance to apply the knowledge gained so far in Controls and Automation systems and gain some industrial exposure . Besides this the job can help finance some part of my future education . <p> Unlike the milieu of the college , the corporate environment was very much different . The concept of learning on the job , accountability for the work at hand , conformance to in- housework flow standards gave me a greater focus . The most challenging aspect however was the rate of the learning , which was immense . In one year I developed competence in Real - time Energy management solutions . As part of my first project I developed software for Energy Management in a Cement Plant . The concept was based on the collection of Real-time Data from the DCS ( Digital Control System ) and populating a Database . With a certain degree of intelligence built into the software energy saving in the Cement unit was as high as 5% . This was a solution implemented for the first time by XX corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was selected as a team member for the deployment of the XX Industrial IT platform solutions . <p> I deployed solutions in the field of Statistical Process control and Asset Optimization in Metals and Cement Industries . During these projects I got to interact with the R&amp;D teams in XX and I also went through some research papers in my leisure time . The experience gained in the deployment of solutions and interaction with the technical teams of customers gave me a new insight . I realized that the business process decision making and the technical processes are not integrated in Real time . Although solutions like ERP aim to achieve this goal , information still exists in islands . In order to seamlessly integrate these areas a new architecture that links Automation systems and MES solutions needs to be developed . However this calls for comprehensive research . I can not pursue this idea while still in a job . Besides an academic program under the guidance of able professors would help me identify my specific research interests . Hence I have decided to pursue my Master degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machines Industrial Automation Lab at YY offers the best courses in this domain . The application driven research and development carried out in this lab coheres to my liking . I would like to carry out my research under the guidance of Prof. B.

His areas of work are of great interest to me and I believe that I can prove to be an effective and reliable team member in carrying out cutting edge research in this domain .

@@42231462 @2231462/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Science <p> My interest in science dates back to my early childhood . I have always excelled in physical sciences and have received numerous awards in mathematics in high school . At age 18 , I attended Beijing Normal University , majoring in physics . Four years of extensive study on in physics and my current work in surface science inspire me to undertake a greater challenge in pursuing a doctorate degree in physics . My aspiration to be a research scientist also makes the graduate study an absolute necessity for me . As an undergraduate student , I specialized in physics , mathematics , and computer science . And in my junior year study I studied computational physics in Applied mathematics III , during which I developed a 2-dmensional model with the finite size effect as a course project . in addition to being elated by my computer simulated phase transition phenomena , I was also pleased with the computed values of the critical exponents which closely agree with theoretical values . During the two-year course on the fundamentals of experimental physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the epitaxy systems , lithography , and computer controlled data acquisition interfaces . I enjoyed these hand-on experiences . My current duty , as a research assistant , is to set up diamond film growth kinetics experiments which is designed to verify whether the mechanism of H atoms destroying C-H bonds in diamond film growth is the bottleneck reaction to diamond film formation . The results will give valuable insights and better enhance the research efforts of another group here . In the meantime , I am learning about the scanning probe microscopy , charged particle optics , energy analyzers and instruments used in surface science through the seminars held in my group . In order to be knowledgeable in the breadth of physics , I have attended workshop and symposiums in different fields . In the symposium on Symmetries in Subatomic Physics held in 1995 in Beijing , I worked as an interpreter and edited the article " Conceptual Beginnings of Various Symmetries in the Twentieth century Physics " from Prof. C. N. Frank yang&amp;#0 ; s speech and translated it into Chinese . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academics , I also actively participated in extracurricular activities in my university years . In the senior year , I was a part-time teaching assistant grading exams and answering questions in the courses , A Journey to Subatomic World and From Quarks to Black Holes . I also had a part-time position as the bulletin board system administrator for the Physical Society of PRC . I am currently constructing their WWW home page to improve information exchange and science education in China . <p> Accumulating these valuable experiences , I am preparing myself for a career in scientific research . Being exposed to surface science , I am interested in mesoscopic systems and nanostructure materials . I plan to concentrate on condensed matter physics . Having carefully read the content of the graduate studies and on-going research programs at University of Washington at Seattle , I believe that UW is the best place for me to be . I am confident in that my diverse research experiences together with a firm commitment to physics have merited me to be qualified to undertake graduate study at the University of Washington at Seattle .

Besides , his communication skill has helped us overcome some very difficult situations and brought back a very important customer . <p> Li has the potential to be a good leader . First of all , he is quite ready to take the responsibility and deal with the subsequent difficulties . In August 2000 , after the sudden leave of his team leader while they were doing a project for SANWA Securities , Li was appointed to take the leadership . He took over the management despite of the strict schedule and the complicated situations . Thanks to his effective communication with the customers ( he could speak very fluent Japanese ) , the project was finished on time and was highly evaluated by the customer . Secondly , Li is very good at learning and applying his knowledge to practice . He spent his spare time to study project management , and finally got a certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute . I should say it is a quite difficult certification . Moreover , he effectively utilized some software tools in his project planning and management : a website integrated with such tools was constructed under his proposal to facilitate the communication and cooperation among his team members .

His team is composed of members from different countries . I know that they all have very good impression of Li . This should largely rely on his humility . Whenever there 's some trouble , he never blamed others or shirked his responsibility . Instead , He could concentrate on finding the cause of the problems and solve them . This helped to keep his whole team as a high-efficient and harmonious professional group . Li also keeps very good relations with his customers , even after the project is over . I remembered what he has said to me , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As I know , Li is an ambitious young man who desires for further development through a systematic study of business knowledge .

@@42231466 @2231466/ <h> Sample Academic Cover Letter <p> For your final exam , I would like you to write about the papers you 've written in class . Discuss how each of these three pieces came into being , evaluate whether you think they successfully communicated a purpose to an audience , whether you enjoyed writing them ( or not ) , whether you found your peer review letters helpful ( include whether or not your own peer reviews helped you think about your own essays ) , why you 've chosen to revise one particular piece--what revisions , specifically , have you made--and any other pertinent information about your papers you feel inclined to discuss . On the day of your final , you will turn in your letter to me , your final draft , and your first draft graded by the panel ( along with your journal entries ) . What I 'm asking you to do in this letter is to give a reflective , self-evaluation of your work this semester . This sort of reflective self-evaluation is called metacognition , which is often asked of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should allow you some distance in order to see yourself and your work from a different angle of vision . <p> The following example illustrates one student 's writing journey over the course of semester--she is writing for a portfolio class , which we , obviously , are not : As I sit and examine my nearly completed portfolio , I ask myself if I will ever come down this road again , writing nontechnical pieces . I am a prelaw student , and my writing usually consists of analyzing philosophers and commenting on Supreme Court decisions . Like everyone , I have no idea what the future holds , but I do hope I can carry some of the editing and rewriting skills I have learned from this portfolio into my major . That is not to say I would n't like to continue with writing : I really enjoyed the opportunity to develop a side of me that before was fairly untouched . The first paper in the portfolio , " Exposed , " recalls an experience with my ninth grade English teacher , Mrs. Flynn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years . This piece really surprised me--it was the first piece we wrote and , consequently , the first one to end my nonwriting streak . I was shocked at how easily it seem to lean out of my mind right onto the word processor , as if it was a story I had been longing to tell for a while . Although Mrs. Flynn never reappears in the portfolio , my insecurities about my own writing were a constant hurdle for me to jump . My advisory piece , " From Twists to Tangles : A Beginners Guide to Knots , " is by far the piece I feel least comfortable with , yet many of editors enjoyed it the most . Contrary to my bossy ( prelaw student , remember ? ) personality , I felt like it was arrogant and condescending to advise others how to do anything . Choosing a topic such as knots to label myself as an expert about was similarly difficult , as was actually figuring out " So how do you do it ? " The memoir " Air Fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense " I found very challenging to write . My pit bull-like perfectionist side reared its ugly and head and chased me though many rewrites and headaches . I believe these pieces were harder because they are both highly tied to experiences that my parents played a role in , and I wanted the final drafts to be a version I would be proud of giving to them . They both deal with my religion and issues that have developed because of it . My Judaism was a topic that proved so natural ( not to say easy ) to write about that once I started , I found that many pieces ( including those that I omitted from the final cut for this portfolio ) would end up exploring a **25;604;TOOLONG angle of a situation . Perhaps due to all the struggles with these pieces , they are the two that I like the most also , and would like to see eventually published . What unites this portfolio ? I had found throughout these four works a number of " links . " Most notable is my sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I question traditions around me , how people attack challenges , and how I have dealt with obstacles in my past . Even my ideas for future pieces involve a questioning spirit . I was pleased to discover this , since I consciously value questioning , but was n't aware it had seeped its way into my subconscious . I had heard more than once the words of Eleanor Roosevelt , " Nobody can make you feel inferior with your consent . " This I find ignorant ; although I am never one to support anyone claiming that they are a victim for whatever reason , I think the emotion of feeling inferior is in a class by itself . It is not an emotion one can straighten their back and walk away from , as Eleanor Roosevelt implies , since it is one of the emotions that cuts right to the bone and hurts deeply . Although I have no feelings of inferiority to anyone anymore , it was an emotion I had some tough wrestling matches with when I was younger . Writing this portfolio has proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and " explore " what I have to say , may you enjoy the journey , take some ideas with you , and , of course , tread lightly ! 
@@42231467 @2231467/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Social Work <p> For Boston University Social Masters The rapidly growing elderly population is becoming a serious social problem in many countries . Some countries have been successful at finding solutions for this problem but others have not . Japan is one of the latter countries . Although Japan has one of the highest life expectancy rates and a reputation for good quality of life for its elderly population , it has been unsuccessful at addressing this problem . Compared to other industrialized countries , Japan lags behind in programs for elders who are physically disabled , bedridden or in need of long term care . The current economic crisis is exacerbating this situation as the government is cutting funding for elder programs . This problem resonates deeply with me , and I hope to someday work on finding a solution . It is for this reason that I am applying to the graduate program in social work at Boston University : I seek the skills and knowledge I need to return to Japan and work for a social work service . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Growing up with my grandparents greatly influenced my values and personality : they taught me to be self-motivated and disciplined . Their resilience and support has helped me to persevere even when confronted with seemingly insurmountable obstacles . Because of their kindness toward me I have a deep respect for them and for elderly people in general . This is what motivates me to become involved in the field of social work . Traditionally in Japanese society , the care of one 's parents is believed to be the children 's duty . After World War II , such traditions have evolved due to changes in family structure . No longer is the eldest child the only one to inherit his parent 's property , and two-income families have become the norm . These changes have left Japanese people at a loss as to how to care for their aging parents . The current response to this problem seems to be hospitalization . Families increasingly hospitalize their elders who are physically disabled , bedridden or in need of long-term care . These individuals are usually transferred to nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two year wait list , they end up staying with family members who are often ill equipped to care for them . As a result , there are a number of incidences of elder abuse by family members and elder suicide . Also , there are many other elderly people who live alone--every year , many of them die with no one , not even their family members , having knowledge of their death . <p> Currently there is no social welfare program in Japan that offers assistance to these elders and their families . In the light of these terrible problems , the need for such a program is obvious . My interest in social work is to find ways to develop and improve the types of services available to the elderly in Japan at a systematic level . I want to be involved in the organizing , managing , developing , shaping and planning of social policies related to the elderly . I believe the social work program at Boston University will allow me to do that . By studying macro social work at Boston University , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies . In addition , Boston University 's emphasis on urban issues appeals to me immensely . As I will be returning to work in Osaka , the second largest city in Japan , graduate work in this area will better equip me for the challenges I will be facing . To me , an urban mission is a commitment to identify and find solutions to issues faced by urban areas . I believe I am well prepared for graduate work . <p> During my undergraduate study , I acquired the necessary background knowledge by taking advanced courses in the areas of psychology and sociology , including sociological research methods , social theory , statistics , psychological research , and psychotherapy . Along with these courses , I had an internship at the Asian Task Force Against Domestic Violence , a non-profit organization . I also volunteered at Sawayakaen , a nursing service , and Asunaro Children 's Mental Hospital in Japan . From this internship and my volunteer work , I have gained practical experience that I feel will contribute to my academic and professional success . I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging , and ultimately rewarding . I look forward to the experience from an intellectual as well as social point of view--I hope to learn and grow as an individual and a macro social worker .

@@42231472 @2231472/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> How Do I Write a Personal Statement ? <p> The personal statement is generally regarded as the third most important aspect of your law school application ( after your LSAT score and GPA ) . In a sense , it serves as your personal interview with the law school . Treat it as you would an interview : be polished , sincere , straightforward , and sell your strengths . Given its importance , you should devote considerable time to your personal statement . But make sure your time is well spent , and make sure you adhere to a few basic principles , as noted below : <h> Time Well Spent <p> The most common mistake a student makes is sweating for days and days over a draft of a personal statement instead of showing it to someone right away , at the idea stage . I have reviewed many personal statements that students labored on for hours that I considered unsalvageable . The problem is that , after the expenditure of so much time and emotional energy , a student is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he/she is too tired or reluctant to change it . <p> The lesson is : do not hold on to your personal statement as you labor over it . You need to share it , the sooner the better , so that you can find out whether your approach is interesting and convincing . Show it to someone who will give you a frank and honest opinion . You also need to have a bit of emotional distance from it ; do not leave it until the last minute . You need to put it on a shelf for a few days so that you can look at it in a more detached manner when it 's time to revise it . <h> Number of Drafts <p> Expect to do at least three drafts . You need to craft this thing , and that requires at least three edits . <h> Length <p> Adhere to the length requirements stated on each application . If none are stated , stick to 2 to 2 n++ pages , double-spaced . Virtually all pre-law advisors agree on this limit . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason . Do n't try to " cheat " by reducing the size of your font . Remember , your personal statement , in addition to being interesting , also has to be " user friendly . " Do n't make it hard to read by making the font or the margins too small . <h> Topics/Themes <p> The purpose of the personal statement is to make the readers on the admissions committee want you to join their next law school class . You have to find some way to show them that you would be a good addition to the class . Sometimes a law school will request that you write on a specific topic . If not , you will have to come up with your own topic . There are many possibilities , and I ca n't tell you the best one for you ( that 's why they call it a personal statement ) . However , here are some ideas that might make you attractive to the admissions committee and/or help you to craft a compelling personal statement : <p> Diversity : Not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " diverse . " Are you a resident of Michigan applying to a southern law school ? Are you from a small Michigan town without lawyers ? Many law schools want a class that represents as much of the state/nation as possible . Do you have a special talent or skill ( a sport , a musical instrument , etc . ) ? What can you offer the school that will be unusual or uncommon among those admitted to the incoming class ? <p> Overcoming Adversity : If you have struggled and achieved despite a tough situation , you have a story to tell . Examples would include overcoming a personal illness ; a personal tragedy or setback , such as the death of a parent or sibling ; living on welfare ; being arrested or fired , etc . The key here is to explain how the adversity shaped your development and made you a better person . If it also prepared you for law school , that 's even better . Warning : you need to choose this option carefully . Do n't lie , or stretch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adversity . If the adversity had no positive affect on you , do n't use it as the basis of your personal statement . Do n't whine or complain . Blaming others probably is n't wise , either . You need to be even-handed and thoughtful as you discuss your life struggles . <p> Stories from Your Past . This is one of my favorite approaches to personal statements . It is helpful for those who are worried that they do n't look distinctive or do n't offer much to distinguish themselves from others in the applicant pool . The truth is , you ARE different and you DO have much to offer . The trick is to identify what your unique contribution is . <p> Exercise : Think of stories from your life that were formative . Think of people in your life who influenced you in a significant way . Think about things you have seen and done that struck you as profound . List them . Now look at your list . Can you see any connections among these events ? What are they ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they reveal ? Is this a trait that makes you an attractive candidate for law school ? Use the trait you identify as the theme for your personal statement , and use the events as examples . <p> Alternative Approach : Pick a trait that defines you or , better yet , ask your friends to describe you . You might be outgoing , ambitious , caring , reflective , etc . Now prove it ! What examples from your life would you offer to prove that you possess this particular trait or skill ? <p> Consider this Example : I had a Berkeley football player do the first version of the above exercise , and this is the list of events he came up with , along with his response to each event : ( 1 ) In grade school , he was not selected for the advanced reading group . His elementary school rival was , and she teased him about it . In response , he resolved to join the reading group by the next semester , studied hard , and did . ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football squad as expected . In response , he worked like a madman in the gym , lifted weights , etc. and made the team the next year . ( 3 ) In college , he played for Cal but blew out his knee his sophomore year . His football career was over , and he had a transcript full of Cs , Ds , and Fs . In response , he resolved to get an education and became an A/B student by graduation . He did . <p> He wrote up these events in his personal statement . The theme was " determination . " He showed how , when faced with a personal challenge , he could not only meet it , but excel . His drive and work ethic enable him to accomplish the goals he set for himself . The next goal he set for himself was law school . After reading his essay , one had no doubt that he would succeed in achieving that goal , too . He went to Georgetown . <p> Skeptical ? Now you may feel that " determined " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , at least among law school applicants . But although you share the gifts of intelligence and drive and ambition with other folks , each one of you came about them in unique ways . Moreover , you will use your law school education to apply your gifts in unique ways . So do n't think of yourselves as typical , because you are n't . Your personal statements will reflect your differences . <h> Things to Avoid <p> One topic to avoid in writing a personal statement is : " I have always wanted to go to law school , as proven by the fact of my efforts on student government and my political science degree . " Keep in mind that there are lots of people like this applying to law school . That 's not a problemlaw school is self-selecting for these types of folks . The trick is to find something else to say about yourself , too . Use these traits as examples , not as the theme of your essay . Also , you probably would be wise to avoid citing legal television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another topic to avoid is the " Too Clever by Half Essays " : Some people get overly creative . They write their essay from the perspective of their cat , or as a poem , or something along those lines . These essays can be very good , but you have to be very good to write an essay like this . Such an approach can easily backfire . If you think you can pull it off , go ahead , but I would n't recommend it . Also , do not submit it until you have run it by me or some other seasoned person who will give you an honest opinion about it . <p> In 2003 , Janet Hein , Assistant Dean of Admissions at the University of Dayton School of Law , surveyed her admissions colleagues to find out , among other things , some of their pet peeves regarding personal statements . These included : <p> Do not base your personal statement on a quote from Emerson , Shakespeare , Thomas Jefferson , or anyone else for that matter . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specific questions asked by the school . Generic personal statements are less effective and less competitive . <p> Be sure the personal statement is well thought-out and executed . It should be an example of the applicant 's best work . <p> Applicants who apply on-line should take the time to send in a hard copy of their personal statements . Many on-line statements arrive with garbled text and formatting problems that make them very difficult to read . <h> Writing Style <p> Whatever topic you pick , you should avoid telling the reader about yourself in a direct , conclusory manner . ( " I am ambitious , " " I am interested in helping the poor , " " I have prepared all my life for law school , " " I worked very hard at my internship , " etc . ) The problem with this approach is not so much that you are tooting your own hornthat 's what personal statements are about , after all . Instead , the problem is that such essays are BORING . Moreover , lots of students write this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do , too . <p> A much better approach is to tell your story and let your reader draw his/her own conclusions . In the example above , my Berkeley football player never once said that he was " driven " or " determined . " But if you read his essay , it screamed it in his examples . The reader was left with the clear impression that he was driven and determined , and that he would succeed . In short , you are better off letting your reader come to the conclusionand the conclusion should be obvious by the time he/she reaches the end of your personal statement . <p> Hint : It is hard to avoid saying " I am " or " I plan " or " I did X , Y , Z , " particularly when you get to the end of your essay and have to explain in conclusion why you want to go to law school . You can use constructions like these , but do n't overuse them . <p> Since your essay is only about two pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one overriding theme . Do not try to say too much , or to cover too many aspects of your life . One theme , or two perhaps , is plenty . Do not try to overwhelm your reader by mentioning all of the significant things you 've done in your life . Often , less is more . Remember , it is the quality , not the quantity , that counts . <p> Do not rehash your resume in your personal statement . The personal statement is a reflection of your personality and accomplishments , not a list of your qualities and activities . You can and should include a resume in your application listing the details of your honors , employment history , and the like . <h> Structure , Grammar , Other Issues <p> Your essay should adhere to all standard rules regarding good essays : it should have an introduction and conclusion ; it should be easy to follow ; it should not contain grammatical or spelling errors , etc . You would be wise to avoid complex sentence constructions and highly stylized writing unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , and then give it to someone else to proofread , too . <p> Do not use your personal statement to explain problems with your application . If you have things that you feel you need to explain ( a low GPA at your first college , an arrest , a bad LSAT score because you had the flu , etc. ) , do this by typing up a separate statement . ( Usually a short paragraph will do . ) The exception would be if you chose this particular problem as the subject of your personal statement . ( This is rare , but sometimes necessary . For example , I had another Berkeley student who was arrested for possessing a handgun on campus . He agreed to a plea bargain . Obviously he had some explaining to do , and he did so in his personal statement . He was admitted to a fine law school and now practices admiralty law . ) <h> Final Thoughts on Personal Statements <p> At many schools , the representatives on the admissions committee read every single personal statement . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sometimes a single person reads every file . Regardless of how it is done , you can bet that the admissions committee members are staying up late at night , for many , many nights , reading hundreds of personal statements . Knowing this , you should be kind to your reader : like I said above , use standard fonts and margins , keep it clean and short , and above all make it interesting ! You want to be the file in the big pile that wakes up a committee member at 2:00 a.m. because your personal statement is so touching , fascinating , well-written , convincing , or whatever other positive adjective you can use to describe it .

@@42231476 @2231476/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for East Asian Studies <p> " What is the essential role of economics in a given countrys social life ? Why many proven theories of economics have failed to apply to Chinas economic conditions ? " Those are just some of the questions that I constantly pose to myself during the past few years of my undergraduate program in economics at XX University of China . Economics , as a rigorous system of generalized models that aim to be universally applicable , has repeatedly proved its efficacy in explaining general issues in economic life . But when applied to the specific economic issues in a particular country or region , its value becomes seriously undermined due to the distortions and interventions resulting from such factors as historical tradition , social conventions and political system . As a Chinese student , I have an especially strong feeling about this situation . <p> In the special and complicated social environment which is China , the lack of an in-depth understanding of the non-economic factors that affect the present social and economic life of the country makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my lifelong career , even though my academic training is designed to prepare me for such a career . I simply do not see much realistic significance or feel any true motivation . Such a dilemma has led me to considerable confusion , because my initial intention in choosing economics as my major was to gain insights into many fundamental problems of China by applying analysis of economics . It is such a delight for me to find that the University of XX offers Masters program in East Asian Studies , which is characterized by a wide coverage of research subjects and practical applicability of research findings . I believe this is the very solution to my present dilemma and frustration , hence my determined application for this Masters program . <p> As early as my middle school education , I have developed a strong interest in social studies and have demonstrated a correspondingly outstanding academic performance in the relevant subjects history , political science , and philosophy . When I entered the senior middle school , I chose to concentrate on humanities and with due efforts I succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I graduated from the school , I was given the special privilege to enter XX University of China , arguable the best university in China in social sciences , with the exemption from the otherwise requisite national university entrance examination . I chose to major in economics , a subject that I then thought could enable me to make direct contributions to the improvement of social welfare . <p> In the heavy and competitive coursework , I relied on diligent efforts and effective study strategies to achieve a high overall GPA ( 4.4 ) , with particularly satisfactory performance in the specialty-related courses , which can be indicated by the scores in my academic transcript . My solid academic foundation I have laid in economics will definitely serve as a useful stepping stone leading me to an equally outstanding performance in my proposed degree program in East Asian Studies . <p> While concentrating on economics , I continued with my special love for other subjects of social science and have tried , through self-education , attending optional courses and even auditing , to broaden my overall academic horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also learned how to search for useful information out of a bewildering wealth of technical materials in the library and to make full use of the library resources to carry out some tentative research . In addition , I volunteered to take part in research projects headed by some of my teachers as a way to maintain my persistent interest in broad sociological issues and to improve my ability to perform standard academic research . <p> Under such circumstances , it is easy to comprehend how excited I am when I discover that the program of East Asian Studies will allow me to combine my professional knowledge of economics with my research interest in broad sociological issues in East Asia . As a student from China , I have a deep understanding of Chinas thousands of years of historical and cultural traditions . I have a relatively deep understanding about the social and economic realities of other East Asian countries . My knowledge about the East Asia as a whole will be my unique asset in undertaking this program in East Asian Studies . <p> While feeling very proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two decades , I am also deeply concerned about some inherent social and economic issues of China such as unemployment , the rich-poor polarity , the failure to fully implement the rule of law , the slow progress in political reform , the unbalanced social and economic development between the eastern and the western regions of the country , the status of ethnic minorities , and loss of traditional values and moral standards , etc . Underneath the increasing material prosperity lie some alarming social problems . I would also like to explore the successes and failures of traditional Eastern Asian culture in the modernization campaigns . I am convinced that it is pointless being simply worried about the existing problems and blame people for those problems . It is more important for me to acquire the necessary academic foundation whereby to search for effective solutions to those problems . <p> I have long admired your esteemed university for its significant achievements in the teaching and research of East Asian Studies . I believe that in the academic environment of your university , which is at once liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective supervisor , my interest and research potential will be given the fullest development . In addition , your instructive teaching will allow me to perform creative research concerning the subjects I am interested in .

To elucidate their roles in the process , I used specific antisense to microfilament , microtubule , and glial fibrillary acid protein . Only GFAP antisense produced effect . By using different molecular methods ( such as western blot , RT-PCR , and staining ) , I proved that the effect was actually caused by the silencing of GFAP . In the end , the culture findings were confirmed in an in vivo stab wound model and antisense GFAP was discovered to be an effective inhibitor on astrogliosis , facilitating the neurons to recuperate and repair from damages and to re-establish their functions . <p> In another internship ( from March to the end of 2004 ) , I undertook another research in which I discovered that the electro-acupuncture could reduce the CPP score in the rat with chronic morphine addiction by 50% . Furthermore , this made it easier for the rat to get through the withdrawal period .

One may find that he or she can retain a subject better by listening in class and reading the text as a reference . A college student may also discover that he or she can understand a subject much better when it is being discussed instead of relying on the book as the only source . Being present for class is vital and may shorten the time one must spend studying . <p> Studying is another vital action that can make one a good student . Many students do n't take time to study for lack of time or lack of interest ; however , studying can improve one 's grades and help a student be prepared .

One may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , he or she can benefit by studying material because the student will remember material even after the test has been taken . Studying for a test not only relieves stress and increases one 's memory , but good study habits can also improve one 's reading skills . By reading material over and over when studying , a student may discover that he or she will begin to read at a greater speed and be more able to retain important points of the text or notes . If one ca n't grasp a subject by attending class or studying , he or she might decide to ask questions . <p> By asking questions , a student in college can increase his or her understanding of a subject . A good college student will ask questions because even if he or she may be familiar with a topic , asking a questions may make a student more confident about the material .

In undertaking studies in my specialty , I hope that I may contribute to making people live happily and healthily . Biochemical engineering is precisely such an academic discipline that is closely alloyed with the welfare of human life and existence because it applies engineering technologies to the analysis and solution of the difficult issues in medical and biological fields . It is my expectation that , through your program , through my unremitting academic efforts in completing your program , and through my future research , I may help develop effective new medicines that can relieve patients of their physical pains . If opportunity presents itself , I will even try to launch my own pharmaceutical firm dedicated to the development and manufacturing of purely natural new medicines , with low-toxic level and low side-effects . Specifically , I would like to see myself make contributions in the process of overcoming those stubborn diseases as cancer and Parkinsons disease ( paralysis agitans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward such aspirations , I believe that a Masters program in Biochemical Engineering at University XX is bound to significantly enhance my academic level and research competence . It is my conviction that such a Masters program will be a turning point in my lifelong career . <p> The most important evidence that I cite to prove my qualifications as a worthy candidate of your scholarship is my academic background and outstanding scholastic performance in the undergraduate career . In the realm of chemical engineering , XX Institute of Technology enjoys a significantly high academic reputation within China and being a student of this renowned institute means receiving comprehensive and systematic instructions and trainings both in coursework and in experiments , allowing me to build up a solid theoretical groundwork and to develop strong hands-on abilities . In most of the specialized courses , courses like Advanced Mathematics , Computer Fundamentals , Physical Chemistry , Modern Molecular Biology and English for Science and Technology , I achieved top scores and , in terms of overall GPA , I was consistently ranked No. 1 in a total of 39 students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the winner of top-level scholarships . <p> Apart from devoting to coursework , I have worked as research assistant in several research projects to develop new drugs . My most important experience by far is serving as research assistant to Prof. XXX , a leading biomedical expert in the field of Neuroscience , in testing the therapeutic effects of newly-developed drugs against Parkinsons disease on tumor cells . In this project , I not only perfected my skills in performing experiments but also cultivated many essential qualities necessary for future research such as interpersonal communication , time management , leadership skills and teamwork . This year , I have been lucky enough to attend the Conference on Advanced Engineering jointly held by my Institute and the XX University of XX , during which I came to be exposed to the most updated research achievements made by both China and XX in the biochemical field . I was especially impressed by the photopolymerized hydrogels , which can be used in drug controlled release , wound healing and tissue engineering having extensive safety record . In retrospect , this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden opportunities for the boom of modern biomedical science , I can feel an unquenchable desire to be personally involved in this historical process . <p> A careful examination of the features of your program indicates that your program is somewhat related to management and entrepreneurship . In this regard , I believe that I am also in possession of relevant qualifications . As I realized that biomedical science is necessarily related to drug manufacturing and requires certain business knowledge , I attended several courses related to international business at the University of XX last year , developing some basic understanding of the subject . In addition to that , I have often spent my spare time listening to the lectures at the XX Management School of XX University where the lectures by world famous scholars and specialists in the field of management give me tremendous enlightenment and edification . Later this year , I will take the Certified International Business Negotiation Expert Course by American Certification Institute , which will further improve my business foundation . <p> One thing that distinguishes me from the rest of average Chinese applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises and institutions , which include XX , XX Corp. , and XX Company of 502 Institute of China Areo-space Company .

The most important thing is that those opportunities of directly experiencing the realities of Chinas medical and pharmaceutical industries have made me soberly aware of the difficulties that they face and their serious gaps from advanced western technologies . In particular , Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises lack sufficient research and development input , resulting partly from lack of research funds and partly from the lack of well-trained biochemical engineers . The excessively long process of new drug development , among others , makes it difficult for Chinese enterprises to compete against their international counterparts . A related problem is the unnecessary exhaustion of large sums of money involved in this long process . I believe that my prospective program in Bioprocessing at University XX will provide me with important ideas to solve at least some , if not all , of the problems currently facing Chinese enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D process of new drugs while enhancing its technical level . <p> It is universally acknowledged that XX occupies a leading academic position in biochemistry and biomedicine in the world .

I am particularly fascinated by the new Science Enterprise Center at your department which promises to effect a perfect combination between my professional knowledge of biochemistry and biomedicine with business practices , with the ultimate goal to cultivate in me an important entrepreneurial spirit . Apart from this , your department has a wide range of interactions with a lot of disciplines and companies , such as a recent collaboration with the XX School . This will create the possibility for me to understand the management concepts and the R &amp; D experience of Britains first-rate pharmaceutical companies in the world , all of which will be closely connected with my own career objectives in the future . <p> My outstanding academic performance in the past , my internship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my situation , my abundant but little-tapped academic and business potential , and above all , my self-motivation , they all make me a worthy candidate for your Bioprocessing Graduate Scholarship .

My eligibility for the scholarship will serve as a recognition of my past academic excellence on one hand and , on the other hand , a motivation toward greater academic excellence in the future . Most importantly , the spiritual significance of the scholarship will overwhelm its materialistic significance . It is a special honor granted to only the elitist few . To such an extent , I will feel very proud of myself and the scholarship will be a source of inspiration for me to strive to be the leader of the tomorrows world .

Not satisfied with standard school program , in the last 2 years of high school I studied in Moscow Chemical High School which had a strong science and mathematics training . This greatly developed my skills and helped me to win three School Chemistry Olympiads . <p> After graduation school I entered the Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology one of the best educational institutions for Chemistry in Russia . By March 2003 , I will complete 5 1/2 years of undergraduate studies and receive a University Diploma . In our Physical Chemistry Department students are required not only to take undergraduate courses , including chemical engineering , but also to carry out research in one of the major research centers in Moscow or at the University . <p> I intend to continue my research work in chemistry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research experience and deepen my knowledge of chemistry . I have chosen Florida State University because it provides excellent opportunities to pursue research in various areas of chemistry . <p> Since 1999 I have been doing research work at the Division of Chemistry and Technology of Crystals of the University . My research for the most part is related to areas of Physical Chemistry such as Solid State Chemistry , Crystal Growth , Surface Chemistry and others . My first project was synthesis and determination of thermometric parameters of luminophors based on Zinc Sulfide doped with Bismuth . I synthesized and analyzed 19 luminophors with different additives such as Eu , CdS , LiCl and others . As a result of this work , I presented a paper entitled " Non-traditional application of luminophors " at the General Chemistry Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences student conference in 2001 . <p> In Fall 2001 , I switched to research in the field of crystal growth . My second project concerned the single-crystal growth of Calcium and Barium Tungstates ( CaWO4 , BaWO4 ) . This work I accomplished at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I grew these crystals by flux growth ( Czochralski technique ) . Such single-crystals are important as nonlinear solid-state components for lasers of stimulated scattering . <p> In addition , I have done work on deposition of thin films . This interesting laboratory practice was lasting during the one of my favorite elective courses " Technology of Heterostructures " . The subject of my research was physical and chemical thin film deposition of Lead Tellurium ( PbTe ) and Gallium Arsenide ( GaAs ) from gas phase , thus I have gained practical experience in deposition of thin films of A3B5 and A2B6 heterostructures in vacuum on silicon substrate . Such films are used in the electronic industry as semiconductor layers . <p> In Spring 2002 , I began a project that set the basis for my graduation paper . This research deals with the powder and nanoparticles of Aluminium Oxide ( Al2O3 ) which I analyze by adsorbtion measurements and Monte Carlo simulation .

@@42231498 @2231498/ <h> Business Letters of Reference <p> Letters of reference are critical ingredients in your job search , yet they are often misunderstood . A letter of reference serves as an indication of your reputation among those you have worked with . It provides an employer with an idea of who you are as a professional , and how well you interact with others . While the value of a reference is hard to measure , compared to objective criteria such as grades and class rank , good references can add a great deal to your application . Conversely , lackluster references will do little or nothing for you . <p> Obtaining a Quality Letter <p> It 's not rocket science to get a good reference , but you have to go about it the right way . In order to get quality references , you need to select whom you want to ask for references , cultivate your relationship with them , and then facilitate the process of getting the letters written . It can take time to build a relationship with a potential reference , and even longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for employers to ask you for references to start requesting them ! You should have at least approached your choices for references before you send out a single resume . Usually two references are sufficient but some employers may ask for more - check to make sure you know the requirements . <p> Who . The first and most important criteria for selecting a person to write a letter on your behalf is that they know you . This is actually more important than the prestige of the person writing the letter . A reference from the Dean or a local judge , if they have only met you once for a few minutes , is worth much less than a letter from a junior professor or former employer who knows you well and has seen your work . Obviously , the reputation of the person can help - a letter from the Secretary of State carries weight even if the person has never met you ! For those who do n't have close ties to Cabinet members , your best bets are professors and former employers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and has known you in a capacity that is relevant to your particular job search - a former commanding officer if you 're applying to the JAG corps , a supervisor of a volunteer program you 've worked with if you 're looking for a public interest position , etc . <p> How . Cultivating a relationship with a potential reference means talking to them . If it 's a professor , speak up in class and ask questions afterwards . If the professor has experience in an area of law that interests you , try to make an appointment to sit down and talk with them - they may have contacts or information to pass along . You want them to know enough about you in order to say something about your intellectual abilities , interests , personality and career goals , rather than just your grades . If it 's an employer , try to ensure that they 've seen examples of your work ; in writing or in person , and again , that they know enough about you to write about you with some detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act as a reference , you should understand that different people handle it in different ways . Some will want to talk to you about whom the letter is going to and what you want it to say ; some will want you to draft a letter for them as a starting point . Remember that the person providing you a reference is doing you a significant favor , so be polite but be confident . Convincing your reference that you are a worthy job candidate is the first step in convincing a potential employer . Assuming that the person you 've asked has agreed to write a letter , offer to assist in any way you can . Always bring a copy of your resume when you are requesting a reference ! <p> Delivery . The final step is to make sure your reference letter is completed . For certain judicial clerkships , letters of reference are usually sent to Career Services , which handles their distribution to judges . For other employers , follow their instructions . If they do not provide you with instructions , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and references may request that you not see the letter itself , others will be more open . Please follow their lead . Be diligent about checking on your references to make sure that a promised letter has been written ; people get busy , deadlines are forgotten , and ultimately it is your job to make sure that your letters of reference are delivered properly and in a timely fashion . <p> As always , come to Career Services if you have any questions about how to obtain letters of reference . Think of your references as a building block to establishing your reputation as a professional and an attorney ; work to obtain quality references and you will likely attain quality results .

@@42231503 @2231503/ <h> Free Sample Letter of Recommendation in Health <p> To Whom it may Concern : <p> At the request of Mr. Kipling Mao who is currently applying to your esteemed university for embarking on a degree program in medical science , I am very happy to compose this letter of recommendation on his behalf . <p> A professor of pediatrics , I have been serving as president of the Children 's Hospital of Chongwen District for the past decade . I made my initial acquaintance with Mr. Mao in 1993 when he became employed by our hospital to work as a resident in radiology . He worked as my direct subordinate . <p> I would describe Mr. Mao as having a solid academic background in the field of medical imaging . In 1995 , I arranged for him to undertake a six-month advanced training in Ultrasonics and CT Diagnosis . Later I recommended him to study clinical medicine at Peking Union Medical College during 1996 - 1999 , which resulted in Mr. Mao 's obtaining of the Bachelor 's degree in medical science . Meanwhile , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peking Union Medical College , focusing on CT diagnosis . His assiduity and perseverance finally made him a pediatric radiologist with relatively rich clinical experience . In 1997 , he succeeded in winning the first prize for radiology at the Technical Skill Contest for All Hospitals of Beijing Chongwen District . In 1999 , he was promoted to become a radiologist in charge . <p> Mr. Mao is in possession of some of the best qualities of a doctor . On the front page of his notebook were written four words : Selflessness , Benevolence , Diligence and Congeniality , which was a motto by Zhu FuTang , the late founder of Chinese pediatrics and academician of China Academy of Sciences . Guided by those principles , Mr. Mao worked diligently , responsibly , and considerately towards his patients . Sometimes when the victim of a problematic case has to be referred to the municipal hospital for a definitive diagnosis , he would take the pains to follow up the case until the case is accurately determined . <p> Another distinguishing feature of Mr. Mao is his prominent organizational capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under his leadership , the young doctors of our hospital launched a creative project of " Domiciliary Ward " aimed at providing first-class service to the hospitalized patients . In addition , he often paid voluntary visits to community centers to offer free medical check-ups to the local residents . For his unselfish contributions , he was awarded the honors of Model Doctor of Beijing Chongwen District and Prominent Youth of Beijing Municipality . <p> Professionally and ethically , Mr. Mao has proven himself to be a highly qualified radiologist . But a consensus among the Chinese medical profession is that , in many aspects , China lags far behind the United States in the development of medical science . Mr. Mao has talked to me on a number of occasions that he finds his previous medical training increasingly inadequate for the growing needs of modern medical science . Under such circumstance , it is natural that he desires to seek more advanced studies abroad . I deem it my obligation to offer my assistance to Mr. Mao in his application efforts . As far as I am concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he has taken many English training courses over the past few years . His language competence will help him soon adapt to his new environment and further facilitate him in his academic pursuits . <p> Should you make further inquiries concerning Mr. Mao , please do not hesitate to contact me . <p> Yours Sincerely <p> Professor of Pediatrics President of the Children 's Hospital of Chongwen District , Beijing

Since the 6th semester and beyond my graduation , I have been a cellist at the national music troupe , playing cello while teaching cello lessons to newcomers with basic skills . In addition , I was responsible for adapting the staff into numbered musical notations suitable for performance by Chinese traditional musical instruments . Throughout my undergraduate program , I was constantly involved in performance on and off campus , in major cities across the country , as well as in various intercollegiate competitions .

In my project , I developed a DirectX9.0-based Win32 program that , through the synchronization of DirectDraw and DirectMusic , demonstrated the entire process of playing the MIDI in the form of " piano roll " . At the same time , the DirectMusic component in the then latest edition of Microsoft DirectX 9.0 controlled the playing of the animation to realize the rhythmic synchronization between the flash and the music .

@@42231507 @2231507/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Interdisciplinary Studies in Sociology <p> My mother was almost muffled to death by my grandparents the moment she was born , simply because she was a girl instead of a boy of the family . It was the sympathetic neighbors who came to her rescue seconds before she breathed her last breaths . Several decades later , the similar fate of being sexually discriminated occurred to her daughter : I was ordered by my parents to discontinue my education just as I was finishing my junior high school . To them , the fact that I am female in gender itself ensured that there could be no bright future for me , however well-educated I could possibly become . Even though , as time passed , I entered a prestigious university in my capacity as the top student of my county at the highly competitive nationwide entrance examination and even though I have made considerable achievements in my professional career after my graduation , I have largely been overlooked in a male-dominated world and I encounter much greater disadvantages in getting promoted than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening when putting up in a hotel during a business travel , one of my male colleagues attempted a sexual molest on me and when rejected , he spread rumors to damage my reputation . Even though I tried to defend myself , my colleagues refused to believe me and I had to undergo all the shame and humiliation . The reason was simple I am female in gender . To a large extent , those bizarre experiences of mine represent in miniature the frustrations and the dilemmas of contemporary Chinese women . <p> As a senior journalist of Hunan Provincial TV Station , I have had too many opportunities to witness the dire conditions of Chinese women , especially in rural areas , and to deplore over their pathetic status . If a poor rural family can not afford proper education to its children , it is always the daughter who is first forced to quit school , and there is no exception to this rule . Since the so-called reform and opening-up campaign of China over the past decades , the market economy , heavily tinted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on womens lives . An increasingly number of women from poor rural areas have flown into cities , only to become prostitutes and frequently their families take this for granted , feeling comforted in the income that their daughters can bring . Moral standards are deteriorating especially rapidly . <p> All those indicate the particularly complicated nature of the status of contemporary Chinese women . In literature , a female character named Pan Jinglian in the classical novel Jinpinmei---A Story of Three Women has been interpreted in diametrically opposite fashions by critics over the past century , from the symbol of licentiousness to that of the warrior of womens liberation with the rise of feminist criticism . According to one traditional Chinese concept , the low intelligence of women itself can constitute their greatest virtue . Traditional Chinese societys prejudice against learned women has resulted in a vicious cycle : the less education women receive , the lower intelligence they develop , the more prejudiced the society becomes against them . Although in law women are accorded equal constitutional rights as men when the Peoples Republic of China was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased with the worsening of inflation and unemployment . Apart from increasing prostitution , some economists even proposed that women should go home from their jobs to make room for the redundant male labor . As has been elaborated on by political economics in Marxism , the advanced mode of capitalist production has created economic improvement of the Chinese society , but it has also led to the alienation of human nature as embodied in prostitution . In this dehumanizing process , women are the greatest victims . In this regard , Marxism has already incorporated some penetrating criticism of the evils of capitalism . But I believe that more perceptive interpretations of the changing conditions of contemporary Chinese women can be developed from the perspectives other than Marxism . <p> All those fall into the category of gender politics ( sometimes referred to as sexual politics ) and to me those issues have been as puzzling as they are frustrating until I started reading works by Western scholars , including the pioneering research done by on sexual politics by Kate Millet in Sexual Politics and Kathleen Barry in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the refreshingly original ideas of those western authors , different from the doctrinaire education I have received so far within the conventional framework of Chinese education . The spirit of criticism , the in-depth scholarly insights , and unique research perspectives as represented by those western writers are what I myself would like to develop in my prospective program . I have eventually come to the realization that a proper understanding of Chinese womens complicated status has to borrow the western scholarly research findings . In my future studies , I would like to examine the status of Chinese women from the perspective of western feminism and to put it into a theoretical framework , and try to seek some philosophical solutions to the issue . Another task for me is to discover the distinctive features of the problems facing contemporary Chinese women in this are of dramatic social changes , including their sense of disillusionment , displacement , and their desires . In addition , my unique background as a typical Chinese woman is what I can contribute to your interdisciplinary program . <p> I majored in Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanities , I have also received systematic education and training in history and philosophy , both Chinese and Western . My scores in such courses as Social Psychology , History of Western Philosophy , History of Life Science , History of Natural Sciences , Theory of Marxism , are unusually high , as can be evidenced in my Academic Transcript . As a journalist , I have covered extremely wide ranges of social issues in contemporary China , with special emphasis on womens status . This has allowed me to accumulate rich social experiences , develop ample empirical knowledge and gain insights into the problems in the real world . Those qualifications should prepare me perfectly for the interdisciplinary sociological studies in the Draper Program . <p> A tentative title for my Masters thesis topic can be Gender Politics in Contemporary China .

This may seem crazy compared to the amount of detail in a passage , but it is actually a much more productive , successful strategy than trying to swallow all the facts in a text . The reason for this leads to the following points : <p> In the GMAT Reading Comprehension , Think Global . <p> The GMAT test-makers want to see if you understand how , and especially why , authors develop their arguments in prose . As a result , what an author says is much less important than what an author does . Furthermore , what one line of a text does is much less important than what a paragraph , or the whole text , accomplishes . We 're talking structure here , rather than content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Reading Comprehension . <p> In GMAT Reading Comprehension , Act Local <p> While you ca n't memorize all the details in a text , you can prepare the terrain for detailed work whenever and wherever the questions demand .

With the text roughly mapped out , you are then prepared to " act locally " in that specific portion of the text relevant to a question . Take a look at the following questions : <p> The modern multinational corporation is described as having originated when the owner-managers of nineteenth-century British firms carrying on international trade were replaced by teams of salaried managers organized into hierarchies . Increases in the volume of transactions in such firms are commonly believed to have necessitated this structural change . Nineteenth-century inventions like the steamship and the telegraph , by facilitating coordination of managerial activities , are described as key factors . Sixteenth-and seventeenth-century chartered trading companies , despite the international scope of their activities , are usually considered irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed to have been too low and the communications and transport of their day too primitive to make comparisons with modern multinationals interesting . <p> In reality , however , early trading companies successfully purchased and outfitted ships , built and operated offices and warehouses , manufactured trade goods for use abroad , maintained trading posts and production facilities overseas , procured goods for import , and sold those goods both at home and in other countries . The large volume of transactions associated with these activities seems to have necessitated hierarchical management structures well before the advent of modern communications and transportation . For example , in the Hudsons Bay Company , each far-flung trading outpost was managed by a salaried agent , who carried out the trade with the Native Americans , managed day-to-day operations , and oversaw the posts workers and servants . One chief agent , answerable to the Court of Directors in London through the correspondence committee , was appointed with control over all of the agents on the bay . <p> The early trading companies did differ strikingly from modern multinationals in many respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home countries and thus characteristically acted abroad to promote national interests . Their top managers were typically owners with a substantial minority share , whereas senior managers holdings in modern multinationals are usually insignificant . They operated in a pre-industrial world , grafting a system of capitalist international trade onto a pre-modern system of artisan and peasant production . Despite these differences , however , early trading companies organized effectively in remarkably modern ways and merit further study as analogues of more modern structures . <p> 1 . The authors main point is that ( A ) modern multinationals originated in the sixtenth and seventeenth centuries with the establishment of chartered trading companies ( B ) the success of early chartered trading companies , like that of modern multinationals , depended primarily on their ability to carry out complex opertions ( C ) early chartered trading companies should be more seriously considered by scholars studying the origins of modern multinationals ( D ) scholars are quite mistaken concerning the origins of modern multinationals ( E ) the management structures of early chartered trading companies are fundamentally the same as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , early chartered trading companies are usually described as ( A ) irrelevant to a discussion of the origins of the modern multinational corporation ( B ) interesting but ultimately too unusually to be good subjects for economic study ( C ) analogues of nineteenth-century British trading firms ( D ) rudimentary and very early forms of the modern multinational corporation ( E ) important national institutions because they existed to further the political aims of the governments of their home countries <p> 3 . It can be inferred from the passage that the author would characterize the activities engaged in by early chartered trading companies as being ( A ) complex enough in scope to requrie a substantial amount of planning and coordination on the part of management ( B ) too simple to be considered similar to those of a modern multinational corporation ( C ) as intricate as those carried out by the largest multinational corporations today ( D ) often unprofitable due to slow communications and unreliable means of transportation ( E ) hampered by the political demands imposed on them by the governments of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of early chartered trading companies in order to ( A ) analyze the various ways in which these activities contributed to changes in managemnt structure in such companies ( B ) demonstrate that the volume of business transactions of such companies exceeded that of exceeded that of earlier firms ( C ) refute the view that the volume of business undertaken by such companies was relatively low ( D ) emphasize the international scope of these companies operations ( E ) support the argument that such firms coordinated such activities by using available means of communication and transport <p> 5 .

( A ) Hierarchical management structures are the most efficient management structures possible in a modern context .

@@42231513 @2231513/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> The Status of Diversity and Affirmative Action in Law School Admissions <p> Is affirmative action still used in the admissions process ? Will it help me ? What is " diversity , " anyway ? <p> In June of 2003 , the Supreme Court decided the case of Grutter v. Bollinger , which concerned the use of race as a factor in law school admissions at the University of Michigan . In a close vote , the Court upheld the use of race , provided that it is used narrowly and in conjunction with other admissions criteria . This decision was a relief for law schools across the nation , in that it affirmed their ability to use race as at least one factor in creating a diverse student bodyat least for the foreseeable future . <p> That being said , the best way for any person to gain admission to law school remains the same : do well in college and score high on the LSAT . The better you do , the more opportunities you will have for admission and free financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek , and many actively recruit , applicants from traditionally underrepresented minority groups . The definition of " traditionally underrepresented " can vary from school to school , but generally it includes African-Americans , Hispanics , Latinos , Native Americans , and sometimes Pacific Islanders . ( " Asian-Americans " is a broad category that many law schools no longer use , particularly those on the West Coast , where Asian populations are significant . Instead , they break up the category into distinct groups : Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and so forth . In parts of the country with low populations of Asian-Americans , being an " Asian-American " of any type might still add to the diversity of an entering class . ) <p> These days , however , diversity is not based on race alone . Many characteristics other than race can contribute to the diversity of a law school 's student body . Examples include persons of low socioeconomic status ; persons from rural areas or inner cities ; disabled persons ; persons who have overcome serious life obstacles ; first generation college graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and veterans . Read on to see how these categories might affect your application . <p> As you do , however , keep two things in mind : first , each one of us is " diverse . " Each person is a unique individual , with unique experiences and feelings , who has come to the application process in his or her own way . My students tend to lament the fact that they are white , small-town , Midwestern , and middle class . They often feel that they do not bring anything distinct or out of the ordinary to the table . WRONG , WRONG , WRONG ! Have some faith and confidence in yourself ! There is no one on the planet exactly like you , and there will never be again . Do not subject yourself to a " cookie cutter " stereotype that does not exist . Instead , convince the law school that , whatever your race or gender or age , you will contribute mightily to its entering class , and you will make a real difference in your chosen profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student is happy with and well-adjusted to his or her law school . A " good fit " is very important in choosing a law school . That " fit " is personal to you , regardless of the categories that might be used to classify you . You need to find a law school that you like , one where you feel you belong . Youll be better served in the long run if you choose a school that makes you feel welcome and comfortableto the extent that any first-year student is comfortable in law school ! <p> That being said , let 's turn to various categories of " diversity " to see how they might pertain to you . <h> Race <p> Many minority students shy away from law school , or do n't  consider it an attainable goal . To combat this problem of minority underrepresentation , some states , law schools , and undergraduate institutions offer preparatory programs for minorities interested in law school . One such program is called " LSPI " ( pronounced " liss-pee " ) , or Law School Preparation Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The program offers tutoring , LSAT preparation , speakers representing various legal careers , and the like . It can sometimes include academic work for credit , and it lasts through graduation . Another program is " CLEO , " or Council on Legal Education Opportunities . It is sponsored by the American Bar Association . Minority students who are accepted to law school may choose to attend a CLEO program the summer before they enroll . The program is offered at regional law school sites across the country . Some undergraduate versions of CLEO offer similar training to prospective law students while they are still in college . The " Plus Program , " or Pre-Law Undergraduate Scholars Program , is aimed at introducing minority undergraduate students to the possibilities offered by law school and legal careers . CLEO and PLUS programs generally range from two to six weeks in length , and involve rigorous training in legal reasoning , analysis , and writing . Finally , some law schools offer their own programs for prospective or accepted applicants . Commonly , these programs bring minority students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students attend lectures , meetings , and socials and get used to the law school environment , thus alleviating some of the chaos that surrounds the start of the first semester . <h> Gender and Low SocioEconomic Status <p> Being female no longer counts as diverse , because women for several years now have made up 50% or more of the typical law school entering class . In fact , 2002 marked the first time that , nationwide , more women applied to law school than men ! <p> While being female does not really help your chances of admission , being a single parent who has successfully gotten off welfare just might . This personwhether male or femalehas overcome the challenges of poverty and parenting , and can make a case that his or her experiences will add a different , rich perspective to the study of law . For that reason , law schools tend to look at an applicants economic background : did he or she grow up poor ? Live on welfare ? Work three jobs to pay for college ? Support his or her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no financial help from the family or others ? If you have this sort of background , and you believe it helped you to become what you are today , you may wish to tell your story in the personal statement section of your application . There 's a more detailed discussion of this topic in that section of the CD . <h> GLBT <p> Gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender persons are generally not considered diverse per se , but again GLBT applicants often have compelling stories to tell about their life experiences and challenges . Most U.S. law schools have policies prohibiting discrimination against the GLBT community ; some even offer scholarships for GLBT activism ( whether the activist is straight or gay ) . If you are a GLBT student seeking a law school where you will fit in , you should find many fine choices . As you search the web sites of the law schools , you should come across the anti-discrimination policies of those schools . Pay attention to the support they offer students : Do they have GLBT faculty ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that focuses at least in part on GLBT issues ? A comprehensive listing of law schools policies on these and other issues of concern to GLBT applicants can be found on the LSACs web site at www.lsac.org . Visiting the law schools , of course , is an excellent way for any prospective student to judge whether the law school will be the right fit . <h> Disabled Students <p> Disabled students are used to facing special challenges in pursuing higher education . Obtaining appropriate accommodations on the LSAT exam can be one of them . If you are a disabled student , be sure to read the document on this topic found under the LSAT section of this CD . <p> Not all law schools are equally accommodating to the disabled . For example , some law schools have their own disabled students office , while others house it in the university as a whole , where it may be geared more toward the needs of undergraduates . Some schools spend more money on disability services than others ; some are physically easier to negotiate than others . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a good idea to visit their facilities or at least talk to other disabled students who are already enrolled there . <h> Geography <p> What I like to call " geographic diversity " can help ( or hurt ) a student in the admissions process . I break down geographic diversity into two types : residency and uniqueness . Residency is a straightforward concept : public law schools that are supported by state tax dollars feel an obligation to enroll at least some in-state residents . The percentage of in-state residents can vary widely : the University of Texas typically accepts 90% Texas residents ; the University of Minnesota accepts around 50% ; the University of Virginia accepts somewhere around 42% , and in the past has been quite generous in making outsiders into residents . Some state legislatures mandate the percentage of residents that are to be admitted ; others leave it up to the schools . Some states grant residency easily ; in others , it is very difficult to become an in-state resident for tuition purposes . <h> Age <p> Is being an older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law schools seek students who are mature , who have learned from their life experiences , and who bring interesting attributes to the class . In fact , its almost a disadvantage to be young in the application processmeaning fresh out of college . Being older , on the other hand , can be a great benefit : you 'll have a lot to say on your personal statement , and a lot to offer the entering class . <p> Being an older student is no guarantee of admission , of course , because folks are applying to law school in record numbers , and most of them have some years under their belt . That being said , is any age too old ? I do n't  really think so . It is not uncommon for students to start law school in their 50s . I had one student who was retired , financially comfortable , and who wanted to go to law school to give back to her community by doing non-profit legal work for free . She thought that the law schools might shy away , given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , it sure is nice when someone goes to law school simply to serve the poor and does n't  care about drawing a salary ! Beneficence aside , there are lots of sitting federal judges who are in their 90s and show no sign of stopping . So you really are as young as you feel , I guess . In short , age may make you diverse in some instances ; it is generally not , at the very least , an obstacle to admission . <h> In Sum <p> A " good fit " is perhaps the most important factor in selecting a law school . It is also the most ignored . Students tend to choose law schools based on their prestige , location , or priceimportant considerations , certainly . But if you want a good experience , its critical to find a place where you are comfortable instead of miserable , and where you will like and respect your student colleagues . After all , they will be your professional colleagues soon enough . Finding the right law school for you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you is to embrace this challenge , and choose wisely .

By taking a loan you are using your personal credit to make an investment will result in greater future incomepart of which will be used to repay the loans and the interest . The federal government subsidizes some educational loan programs and pays the interest as long as the borrower remains a student in good standing . In other cases , students are required to pay the interest while still in college . Repaying the loan principal is deferred until the student graduates . Sources and types of loans include these : <p> Federal Perkins Loans This valuable loan program gives the first priority to needy undergraduate students . To be eligible , students must establish a very high need on their student aid application ( FAFSA ) . Because of the limited funding of the program , the maximum annual loan amount is $4,000 for undergraduate students and $6,000 for graduate students . The interest rate on the loan is currently set at 5 percent a year . Interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates or attends school on less than a half-time basis . <p> Federal Family Educational Loan Programs ( FFELP ) There are three different loan programs for FFELP . Two make loans directly to undergraduate or graduate studentsand are known as Stafford Loans . The federal government subsidizes only one of these Stafford Loans . The third loan is a program of loans to the parents of a dependent undergraduate student . The parents are completely responsible for the amount of the loan , plus interest . <p> Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan Program Federally subsidizes Stafford loans start with the ( FAFSA ) . The amount borrowed is set by the governmentcurrently between $2,625 and $5,500 per year for undergraduates . <p> Graduate student loans are up to $8,500 per year . To remain eligible , students must be enrolled on a half- to full-time basis . The federal government pays the interest on these loans as long as the student is enrolled . The liability for interest and principal repayment shifts to the student six months after either graduation or loss of eligibility due to enrollment status . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank that participates in the FFELP program . College or university financial aid offices keep lists of preferred lenders to give you a start . <p> Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program Similar to the subsidized Stafford Loans , unsubsidized loans have the differences of not being strictly need-based . You are also charged interest as a student . Application for the unsubsidized Stafford Loan program is made by filing a FAFSA ; however , eligibility is not determined by need , but rather by the difference between the cost of your college choice and the resources of your student aid package . The college student aid office makes all calculations . The maximum amount of the loans and interest rates for the year are the same as those of the subsidized Stafford Loan program . Interest charges begin the day the loan funds are received . The bank determines loan payment and repayment provisions .

Loan terms , including repayment provisions and interest rates , are more favorable than those of other education loans available . Repayment of PLUS loans begins as soon as the funds are advanced to the borrower . Ask for more information at the college student aid office . <p> Private Loans for College Expenses Consider private loan programs , too . The interest rates and repayment plans are not as low as the federal loan programs , but are still worth considering .

@@42231521 @2231521/ <h> Cover Letter Writing Tips <p> More than just window dressing for your resume , a cover letter is like a partner to that all-important document . Many employers today wo n't even look at your resume if you do n't submit it with a cover letter . Your cover letter gives employers the opportunity to evaluate your ability to communicate -- do you know the proper form for a business letter ? Can you string together coherent sentences ? Are you able to express yourself well on paper ? Your cover letter will give employers insight into all of these things . <p> Here are some things to consider when putting your cover letter together : <p> Tailor it to the position and company to which you are applying -- a cover letter should n't be " canned . " <p> Open by explaining why you are writing and where you heard about the opportunity -- you may want to say something similar to " your recent Daily News advertisement caught my attention . " <p> Be sure to say why you think you would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits or skills the employer wants to see in job applicants , reference those skills in your letter and say how you exemplify them . Mention traits that will set you apart from other candidates . <p> Refer the employer to your resume -- " you can see from my resume that I have the experience you are looking for " may be a good way to do so . Experiment with your own wording . <p> Remember to sign your cover letter . <p> Note " enclosure " or " enc. " several lines after your signature if your resume is enclosed . <p> Helpful Hints for Writing Cover Letters <p> Each letter should be an original : no photocopies . <p> Address the employer by name and title . Research names on organizations ' web sites or in the library . You can also call the company . <p> The goal of your opening is to capture the employer 's attention . You may want to refer to a mutual contact who referred you for the position or present a reason ( e.g. , qualities and skills ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the organization . Remember , an employer may receive hundreds of cover letters . You need to create enough interest in your opening that the employer feels compelled to continue reading . <p> Make your cover letters concise . A cover letter should be one page with three to six paragraphs . <p> The body of your cover letter should highlight your experiences and accomplishments . Focus on the needs of the employer to whom you are writing . You want the reader to believe that hiring you will mean improved services , innovative ideas , greater efficiency , or increased productivity . <p> Your cover letter should ask for something--most often an interview . State how you plan to follow up with the employer . <p> Your closing should briefly summarize the body of the letter . Leave the reader with an important thought to remember you by .

@@42231523 @2231523/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Computer Science <p> Program : MS in Computer Science I grew up in Oscar , Ohio , where I attended Pleasant Meadows High School , a nationally recognized college preparatory institution . Pleasant Meadows is a public school which all academically inclined students throughout the city can attend if they manage to pass an entrance examination . At Pleasant Meadows I was placed in the honors program ; later I took six advanced placement courses , receiving college credit for five of them . I also completed three full years of Greek and two full years of advanced German . I graduated from Pleasant Meadows in the top ten percent of my class . <p> Upon graduating Pleasant Meadows I was accepted to Carillon Cross University . Since my family was of very modest means , I relied heavily on financial aid . I immediately decided to become a chemical engineer , a decision that was not well informed . My first semester at Carillon Cross was promising , but I struggled through the next three years pursuing a career that I eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this experience that my true strengths and interests lay not in applied technology but , rather , in the philosophical constructs of scientific principles . <p> So , it is not surprising that , in reaction to my unsatisfactory engineering experience , I spent the next year and a half in the humanities , completing a B.A. degree in history , which I was awarded in the Spring of 1987 . I excelled during my studies in the history department , but I decided that I did not want to pursue graduate study in the field . While considering career options , I took the LSAT , which strongly tests analytical ability , placing in the 95th percentile . However , I really wanted to pursue a career in the sciences . <p> I knew that I wanted to continue my education , but I was out of money . So , I got a job working for University Development at Carillon Cross as a PC programmer . My job duties were to develop a database reporting system to track potential donors to the university . I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manager of the donor accounting department , but , more importantly , I discovered that I truly enjoyed working with computers . I liked the creative possibilities in programming ; even more , I was intrigued with the process of modeling problems and then implementing different solutions through programming . I realized then that I wanted to learn more about computing . So , I decided to use my tuition waiver benefit to begin to explore the computer engineering/science field . I started to take classes towards a B.S. in computer engineering , but later switched to computer science because I wanted to work more with ideas and less with implementation . I was able to take one course ( sometimes two ) per semester , which will enable me to receive my B.S. this Spring ( 1993 ) . <p> As you can see from my transcript , in all of the courses that I have taken while employed , I have received only letter grades of A or B ( 3.5 GPA ) . Meanwhile , I received two more job promotions and currently hold the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to a programmer/analyst II , but requires extensive knowledge of University Advancement and has managerial responsibilities as well . I spend much of my time programming on an IBM ES9000 mainframe system as well as working with many PC applications . <p> I feel that I have grown tremendously as a person through my employment at Carillon Cross . I have learned a lot about myself ; for instance , I find teaching others to be very rewarding ( something I would like to pursue further along academic lines ) . Although my employment of five years with the university has taught me many valuable skills , I find the work to be unchallenging and devoid of ideas . It pains me to leave the security of a good job and many close friends to go back to school , but , I am very committed to my career goals . <p> My sincerest desire is to become a computer scientist . Specifically , I am interested in exploring how problems can be modeled and solved using artificial intelligence . I also want to learn about human cognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether machines will ever become " intelligent " given the current course of research and reading about such issues as whether a machine can acquire " common sense " ( as discussed in Hubert Dreyfus 's book What Computers Still Ca n't Do ) . I have been exploring many different areas within the domain of artificial intelligence ( such as neural networks , genetic algorithms , and natural language processing ) . The bottom line is that I want to be a part of this exciting field . To that end I would like to come to Indiana University to work towards an M.S. in computer science with an emphasis in natural language processing . <p> I am looking forward to attending Indiana University in the Fall . I recently took the GRE general test and received a 2200 combined score : a 670 in verbal ( 93rd percentile ) , 750 in analytical ( 93rd percentile ) , and a 780 in quantitative ( 92nd percentile ) .

@@42231525 @2231525/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Do You Want to Go to Law School Next Year ? <p> People are applying to law school in record numbers . Applications to law school were up 10 to 30 percent across the nation in 2001 , with an average increase of nearly 20 percent . In 2002 , they were even higher : the number of LSAT test takers on the June 2002 examination was up by another 18 percent , and more people took the October 2002 LSAT test than there were available seats in all of the nations law schools combined ! Some law schools saw a 100% increase in applications in the 2002-03 academic year . Initially , 2004-05 proved to be just as bad , with a record number of people taking the June LSAT exam . However , by the late spring there were some signs that the applicant pool was relaxing : law schools began admitting students off of their wait lists , which had been unheard of in the previous 2-3 years . Still , the demand to attend law school remains very high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to attend law school next year , or if you are already out of school and thinking about attending law school in a year or two , YOU NEED TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER TO WAIT . <h> Why are applications up so much ? <p> The primary reason is that the economy has been relatively stagnant , unemployment is higher , and in the wake of September 11th many industries have been hard hit . The technology sector of the economy is currently weak , and many high tech workers have been laid off . Moreover , job prospects for new college graduates are not as good as they were just a few years ago . To avoid trying to find a job in a tough economy , people flock back to school . They seek to obtain a degree that will help them in their job search while they wait out the bad times . Consequently , applications to law school are sky-high ; applications to college and graduate/professional programs in general are up significantly , too . Indicators suggest that this trend may ease somewhat in 2005-06 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What should I do ? <p> If you are thinking about law school right now , your timing is unfortunate , because the competition is fierce . Still , there is always a place in law school for someone who performs well on the LSAT exam . A person with a good score may have fewer choices this year , but will still be able to attend law school . What is a " good " LSAT score ? It depends primarily on where you want to go . For the University of Minnesota , you generally need a score of 160 or higher to be competitive . For William Mitchell , a score in the mid-150s is in the ballpark . Such a score should make you competitive at Hamline and St. Thomas , too . If you are looking for scholarships to these three schools , a score in the high 150s will make you competitive . Bear in mind , however , that law schools can more easily pick and choose these days , meaning that last years median scores are likely to be somewhat higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low ? <p> Some schools accept students with LSAT scores below 150 , but your options are limited . If you are not happy with your score , you need to think seriously about waiting to apply to law school in this admissions climate . <h> Why wait ? <p> Truthfully , its almost always a good idea to wait awhile between college and law school . Remember , law schools are looking for mature students who know that they want a legal career , and have had relevant experience outside of college . The median age of law school entering classes is around 26 ( yes , 26 ! ) , and two-thirds of those folks have taken time off . Many applicants have earned advanced degrees or have had other careers . So even in a good year , law schools are not necessarily welcoming to graduating college students . <p> In a competitive time , graduating seniors are at even more of a disadvantage . Simply waiting to go to law school is the easiest way to make your application stronger . You will gain maturity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law school applications are cyclical , and we are presently in an upward cycle . In a few years ( how many is uncertain , as it depends on the economy and other factors ) , the number of applications will drop , and the competition will ease . <h> What should I do in the meantime ? <p> The short answer is , almost anything . You do not have to have legal experience or a legal job ; its nice , but certainly not required . You need to do something productive that you can later discuss on your law school applicationeven if that " productive " thing is backpacking around Europe . If you need to be in school , you can consider a masters degree* in some field or , better yet , an ABA-approved paralegal certificate program , which can be completed in as little as four months . If your job has nothing to do with law , you should consider volunteering for a legal organization in your spare time . Any volunteer work that you do will be worthwhile for you personally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than quantitygive your time to one or two groups , rather than a host of them . ( *Generally , I do not recommend obtaining a masters degree unless you really want it or have some substantial justification for it . You can use that year or two to work and earn money for law school , and that will likely help you more than having an advanced degree on your resume . ) <p> If you have your heart set on a law school out of state , move there after graduation . Some states make it tough to claim residency for law school , but if you plan to take one to three years off , you would likely qualify in most of them . You 'll need to check with each school to determine when and how you can become a resident . <h> I just do n't  want to take time off , and my parents do n't  want me to take time off . <p> If this is true , you need to have a heart-to-heart talk with yourself and with your folks . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , is n't it worth the wait ? The old saying is " a dream deferred is better than a dream unrealized . " If law school is not worth the wait , then are you really sure you should be thinking about it in the first place ? Law school requires a huge commitment of time and money ; you should think about this fact very seriously before you make the decision to go . <p> If your folks do not want to wait , ask them to fund your application process . Give them this handout , and inform them that you do not want to spend your hard-earned money unless you have a reasonable chance of success . If they still push you to apply , then let them write the checks to the schools and pay the related fees . If you succeed in being admitted , hooray ! If you do n't  , your initial decision to wait will have been vindicated . Either way , you 're not out any money , and you can apply again when YOU think the time is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising services as an alumnus ? <p> Yes ! Contact us at least six months before you plan to take the LSAT , or a year before you plan to enroll . <h> Should I at least take the LSAT this fall , or should I wait ? <p> The answer to this question is always the same : you should take the LSAT when you are absolutely ready . If you are not ready , do not take it . If you have been studying and feel very prepared , go ahead . Your LSAT score is good for 5 years , so you can take the test now even if you do not plan to apply right away . <p> There is one new LSAT wrinkle for this competitive time . If you are planning to apply to law school this fall , YOU SHOULD TAKE THE OCTOBER LSAT . In the past , our students have been able to take the December LSAT exam and still be competitive . Things are different now . Some admissions committees are advising students to get their completed applications in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st deadline . Applications that come in late are going to be at a severe disadvantage again this year . If a school claims to have rolling admissions , and will accept applications until March or April , please understand that it is highly likely that all of the available seats will be taken early , despite the late deadline . Schools begin to read applications right away , and when the spots are gonewell , they 're gone . Also , the first persons to be admitted are also the first persons to receive financial aid offers . If you apply late in the game , the money will be long gone .

@@42231543 @2231543/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Space Science <p> General Introduction <p> I began my undergraduate study in the Department of Physics at Central China Normal University in September 1998 . During the four years , I devoted myself to the mathematics , physics and computer coursed such as advanced mathematics , classical mechanics , quantum mechanics , statistical mechanics etc . It was my hop that I would be able to build a solid foundation for my future research . My undergraduate study was very successful and my overall GPA was among the top 5% in my class . <p> Academic Performance <p> After graduation in 1992 , I was admitted by Peking University to pursue a Masters Degree in Space Physics . The three-year graduate study at Peking University was fruitful . I took a number of coursed , such as Solar-terrestrial Space Physics , Space Plasma Physics and Ionosphere Physics , etc . In order to enlarge my knowledge background and to satisfy my curiosities to modern science. , I audited and elected many other courses for other majors like General Relativity , Group Theory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to different kinds of professional journals , such as Physics Review , Journal of computational Physic , Journal of Geophysical Research , Solar Physics , Astrophysics , etc . I kept myself well informed of the latest developments in this field , and developed my abilities to read and write English . To get a better understanding of academic research , I attended space physics academic communication meeting in 1992 , and Geophysics Annual Conference in 1993 where many scientists delivered academic reports . I realized that undertaking the research work offers many interesting challenges , and I need to expand my knowledge in my field . <p> Because of my outstanding grades and academic performance , I was honored scholarship in two consecutive years , one is Subject Prize in the 1992-1993 academic year , the other is Guanghua Prize the highest scholarship at Peking University , in the 1993-1994 academic year . <p> Teaching Experience <p> At Central China Normal University , I took general education coursed , such as Psychology , Education and Teaching Methods . At the last semester , I began my teaching internship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of modern experiment instrument , and was widely welcomed by the students . <p> I became a teaching assistant in FORTRAN LLANGUAGE for undergraduate students at this semester at Peking University . In addition to the necessary FORTRAN 77 taught by the major teacher , I presented the students a variety of computer knowledge in C language , computer program design and computer software . I felt very pride when most of my students can operate computer expertly at the end of this semester . <p> Scholastic Aptitude <p> At my second year graduate study , I began to work as a research assistant of Professor Chuanyi Tu , a famous scientist in Space Sciences . He proposed the energy-cascading theory in a new solar wind model , and was awarded VIKRAM SARABHAI prize by COSPAR and ISRO . I modified his theory by considering the dissipation mechanism of the Alfven waves for heliocentric distance R 10R sun and developed a two-fluid model . The mechanism of solar wind acceleration is the basic problem in solar wind model . The purpose of my recent work is to explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism of the heating of the corona . I want to establish the energy-cascading heating effect tow-fluid solar wind model by Alfvenic fluctuations , which can describe the radial evolution of power spectrum of Alfvenic fluctuation . The model includes the solar wind equations and power spectrum equation in the spatial and temporal . The FCT ( flux-corrected-transport ) methods are used to treat the mass equation and the momentum equation . The heat conduction equations as well as the power spectrum equation are treated by an implicit scheme . I devoted myself to the research and have solved most of the established problems independently . <p> This work is collaborated with Professor Hu at University of Science and Technology of China ( USTC ) . This October and November , I took the opportunity to come to USTC to work directly under the guidance of Professor Hu , who is second to none for his achievements in the field of Magneto-hydrodynamics ( MHD ) numerical simulation in china . We discussed many questions about research theories and numerical methods . <p> To determine whether a steady state is reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine some conserved quantities inherent in a steady-state solution to see if they are conserved throughout the domain . Through several weeks hard work in the Space Physics Laboratory of USTC , I achieved satisfactory solutions . The mass flux , momentum flux and energy flux are constant within 5% , 0.5% and 3% . In addition , I also participated in their seminar about nonlinear dynamics , and audited some coursed like chaotic dynamics . I realized that my collaboration with other university especially with USTC will give me a more solid and broad background on mathematics and Physics , and may make it easy for me to go into these fields of my later research . <p> Now , having experienced success and failure in my research work and studies , I have possessed the capacity of carrying research independently and developed my own working habit that somehow we seem to be successful . I believe I hold adequate potential to be further developed . I enjoy my present study and work , which are challenging and desirable . However , I am very eager to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced level in your institute . I love the research work and have aimed at a life time career in science for a long time .

You should discuss your reasons for wishing to transfer to Yale . You may also wish to comment on your academic interests , extracurricular activities , and significant responsibilities outside of school . While many students decide to apply to Yale for its prestige , the motivating factor for me was an innocent summer activity . I learned about Yale last summer when I served on the Executive Committee and taught for a program in New Haven , called Summer bridge New Haven . This program , based out of the Hopkins School , allows high school and college students to mentor and teach inner-city students who can not afford a tuition-based program . Two of my co-workers were Yale students , and they informed me that Yale made major contributions to the program . Moreover , Yale generously offered the use of its facilities , including field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provided invaluable experiences for the students , some of whom had never toured Yale despite living in New Haven their entire lives . Several graduate students helped us gather textbooks and other information for the program 's science classes , one of which I taught during the summer . I was very impressed with Yale 's devotion to the betterment of the New Haven community . It attracts me because community service has always been a major part of my life . Before that summer , I have served programs such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Meriden-Wallingford and a tutoring program for a grammar school in West Philadelphia . <p> Beyond Yale 's intense involvement in the community , another reason I would like to transfer to Yale is because of its acclaimed international relations and economic departments . My interest in economics arose early , as I was the president of the business club at my high school , Choate Rosemary Hall . I also participated in the Fed Challenge , in which Choate selected a team of five economics students to represent the school in a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , through intense research , what monetary policy the Fed should implement in its next Board of Governors meeting . Our performance in the competition won each of us a $4,000 scholarship and a yearlong subscription to Business Week ( McG raw-Hill , the publisher of Business Week , was a sponsor ) . This contest was exciting and sparked my current passion for economics . Hence , Yale 's exceptional economics department would be a wonderful resource for me . <p> In addition to economics , I also enjoy studying languages and the interaction between foreign countries . At Penn , I have attained proficiency in German and am now taking my second semester of Polish . Both Yale 's foreign language and international relations departments are very strong and would greatly enhance my education . <p> Another factor in my decision to apply to Yale as a transfer student has been my father 's illness . My father was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and has begun feeling quite i 'll . As New Haven is near my home in Wallingford , attending Yale would allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with some of the tasks that he can no longer do because of his illness . <p> Though his illness has played some role in my decision , my academic interests in Yale are still the main reasons for my desire to transfer . I have a variety of college interests that I hope to continue at Yale . These include working as an associate for the Daily Pennsylvanian , Penn 's student newspaper , and co-founding the Options and Hedging Strategy Club , an investment club that works in conjunction with Philadelphia investment banking houses and offers Penn students information sessions on investment strategies . I would love the opportunity to work for such a reputable student newspaper as the Yale Daily News and start a similar investment strategy club at Yale . Through my previous experiences with Yale , and based on my current interests , I am certain that Yale and I would be a perfect fit .

Many application deadlines will be in the fall of your senior year . You should discuss the application and the application process with your faculty advisor well ahead of deadlines . <p> The application process for most medical schools is handled by the American Medical College Application Service ( AMCAS ) , a non profit , centralized , processing service . The chief exceptions are Texas state-supported schools , foreign medical schools , and a few private schools , but check the AMCAS instruction booklet 's list of participating schools to make certain of the status of the schools to which you are applying . You can obtain AMCAS application forms and instructions from your Pre-Health Professions faculty advisor or by writing : <p> If you are applying to AMCAS-participating schools , you submit only one set of application materials and official transcripts regardless of the number of schools to which you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which you list the schools you wish to apply to . When the AMCAS transmits your application to a medical school , you will receive an official notification of this transmittal . The schools to which you apply will then contact you if they require additional information . Some colleges charge a fee in addition to that levied by the AMCAS ; check Medical School Admission Requirements . <p> Unless you are applying under the Early Decision Program ( see below ) , application deadline dates vary for AMCAS schools , very often November 1 or December 1 of the year prior to admission . Again , be sure to check Medical School Admission Requirements for specific information . You should consider the deadlines ironclad . You must have completed application materials and the correct service fee on file with the AMCAS by the deadline , or you will not be considered for admission . If you are late by a day you wait until next year . There is a two week extension past the application deadline for AMCAS to receive all official transcripts , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of deadline dates ; two months would not be unreasonable . <p> Read all the information included in the AMCAS application packet carefully before you fill out the application forms . They are nit-pickers and will reject your application if , for instance , your signature on the form is in anything other than black ink or you type any information outside the designated borders . <p> If you are applying to a school which does not participate in AMCAS , write the school 's admission office for an application . Usually , you will receive a preliminary application . If the school is interested in you , they will then request further information , letters of recommendation , etc . Procedures vary , however , so you should consult Medical School Admission Requirements or the school 's catalogue for more specific information .

Even one decade later , I can still recall the first experiment I did in the physics course . When a transmitter in one corner of the lab was connected with electricity , a little bulb connected to a reception antenna in another corner lit up . Though by no means dazzling in itself , this light with its stunning magic ushered me as if into a wonderland , a world replete with intriguing mysteries that only belong to the realm of physics .

@@42231559 @2231559/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Labor Relationship and HR Management <p> Sixteen years ago , a little girl had to seek her education by traveling to and fro between her home and school all on her independent efforts . Unskilled in cycling , she used to fall down from the bicycle , and as the family was relocating time and again , she had to attend many different school and in the process she had to adapt herself to different academic environments and expose to different teachers and classmates . But all those difficulties did not in the least hinder her academic development . She undertook her studies with consistent perseverance and accomplished them with very satisfactory results . She did so under the conviction that she could develop herself into an outstanding administrator like her mother . Toward this objective , she chose to concentrate on Human Resource Management during her undergraduate program specializing in Business Administration . At present , on the verge of completing her undergraduate program , she is determined to pursue a more advanced degree program in Human Resources Management ( HRM ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside China where HRM has long been a mature discipline . This girl is the present applicantme . <p> My original interest in management was fostered by my parents , both of them are senior managers . Coming under their influence from my early childhood , I gained some rudimentary understanding of management . However , it has been my systematic education in business administration at the School of Management , XX University . During my studies , I was most intrigued by such core courses as Strategy Management , Probability and Statistics , Macro Economics , Human Resources Management , Business Statistics , Organization Behavior , and Seminars on Human Resources . In learning those essential courses , I have not only developed a comprehensive perception of the fundamental principles of management as an academic discipline but also , more importantly , have become exposed to a variety of important functions that effective HRM can play in enterprise management . In particular , with Chinas institutional transition from centralized planned economy to market economy , I was lucky to become exposed to HRM , a quite novel concept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was all too natural for me to become fascinated by it . And as I delved deeper into its study , I found that my understanding of HRM was characterized by a marked shift , from a superficial and literal understanding to that of the specific research fields and methodologies . <p> Motivated by my strong interest in HRM , I chose my advisor , Prof. x x x , as early as when I was a sophomore in order to receive early guidance in my academic development . In Chinas academic community , the theoretical research on HRM is very much of a virgin land and my advisor was one of a very limited number of pioneering HRM scholars in the country . One of my advisors most important research subjects is XX , which is a little studied field in China . I participated in my advisors research project , which was sponsored by XX . In the project , my responsibility was studying the evaluation of the top management team and its interactivity in Chinese enterprises . The reason for undertaking this research was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great variety of factors determine the results and the effects of the decision-making of the top management team . Among those factors , the intra-evaluation among the members of the management team and their interactivity is undoubtedly the primary element affecting the collective decision-making capacity of the entire team . Under the traditional Chinese cultural background , interpersonal relationships exert a particularly important influence on the communication and interactivity within the team . Under such circumstances , the mutual evaluation , the interactivity or communication among the members of the top management team in Chinese enterprises becomes of special significance . <p> In my actual research , I conducted a questionnaire survey over the participants of a workshop of senior managers at XX University . By quantifying and analyzing relevant data , I came to some tentative conclusions . In terms of team evaluation , it consists of an assessment of the level of intelligence , personal character , role type , and professional skills of the members of the top management team . Regarding the overall interactivity of the team , it includes the level of difficulty inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team as well as the conditions of existence of various teams on the departmental level . So far , my research has made encouraging achievements and a draft treatise has been accomplished and won positive comments from my advisor , and will be used as my B.A. thesis . <p> What is worth mentioning is that , for an administrator , especially one engaged in HRM , it is vital to acquire the skills in interpersonal coordination and in teamwork . With this in mind , I have made conscious efforts to seek some fundamental trainings in those regards . Case analysis and team projects have informed my undergraduate studies in management science . Whether in the management course or marketing course or economics course , I have been trained to develop team spirits and the ability to solve practical problems . I have been required to analyze underlying causes in different cases , construct models and search for solutions . In management trainings , I have come to realize that individual efforts alone are insufficient to reach the prescribed goal and that management is essentially and ultimately a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is true that through the four-year specialized academic training , I have been taught much knowledge of management , especially the theories of HRM . However , such a knowledge is all but tentative , and in need of improvement both in breadth and width . Furthermore , through consulting relevant technical journals and literature , plus my experience of doing a summer internship at XX Ltd , I have gained an understanding of the existing conditions of HRM in my country . Presently , the conscious application of HRM theories has been rather limited . In most enterprises , the so-called HRM is object-oriented rather than human-oriented and this results primarily from a one-sided understanding of the concept of human resource . Such a situation requires us to learn advanced concepts of HRM . <p> Nevertheless , to promote the development of advanced HRM concepts in China should not be simply equated with transplanting them into Chinese context mechanically . It should be noticed that some specifically Chinese cultural factors , with their emphasis on connections , would render such a direct transplantation difficult . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in the west , will have to be modified and adapted to Chinese circumstances before they can be effectively applied . <p> All those factors , combined with my long-time interest , have contributed to my present decision to seek a more advanced education in HRM and XX UniversityXX , I believe , is precisely the institution that can furnish me with such an education . Its School of Management of Labor Relations is reputed for its rich educational tradition , numerous academic elites in the field of management . I would like to concentrate on Human Resources Management , whose objective is to create and disseminate knowledge that fosters a better understanding of the nature of employment and works in modern society , promotes harmony and cooperation between management and labor , and helps to improve employment systems and relationships . The syllabus design attaches equal importance to theoretical instruction and to practical application , which encompasses HR Strategy I : Introduction ; HR Strategy II : Business Functional Areas ; Measurement Issues ; HR Strategy IV : Designing and Implementing Human Capital Strategies in an Era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear in the above , I will not only seek systematic and in-depth study of HRM at your school but also ponder over how western HRM theories can best be made applicable to the special circumstances of the Chinese society . <p> I am convinced that in this era of rapid economic development in China , by the time I finish my graduate program at XX University and return to my country , I will be able to make my due contributions as a HRM specialist to the prosperity of Chinese enterprises and to their participation in the economic globalization.

This is a question that I had long been obsessed with before I got the answer from my aunt , who , after finishing her study in Japan , has come back to China and devoted herself to the career of helping her country to catch up with the developed countries . I realized that the meaning of life lied in dedicating oneself to the progress of society . As a student majoring in international trade and economics , I decided to devote all my life to the career of commercial diplomacy when , two years ago , Prof. Liu Mingwei introduced us to this concept in a course she delivered . <p> As a student of good study habits , I have always been among the top ones in a group , however competitive it might be . I make study plans so that I can use my time scientifically and efficiently . After a plan is fixed , I will stick to it . An example of this is that I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago . I am also able to grasp the most important points of a lecture or a book . Therefore , I study more efficiently than other students . After my entrance into college , these good study habits helped me to absorb knowledge of international trade and economy as much as I could . Among the specialized courses , the one that caught my interest most was the System of International Trade , which was about the WTO system and its agreements , globalization and many hot issues of international trade disputes . Having obtained her Master 's degree in Commercial Diplomacy herself from Monterey Institute of International Studies of the US , Ms. Cheng , the teacher of this course , adopted the American teaching method , putting a lot of emphasis on case studies , mock negotiations , group study and presentation . Attracted by courses like this , I was completed immersed in my study and came to the realization that , without more trained professionals in trade related fields , including commercial diplomacy , China can not take advantage of the economic opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated me into the wonderful world of commercial diplomacy . Besides this , almost all of our specialized courses were taught in English and used English textbooks . And we keep in close contact with students of business in Hong Kong University and Columbia University . Once I even spent two weeks living and studying with a Japanese student . All these experiences enhanced my ability of communicating with people from other cultures . <p> Because of my outstanding performance in study and excellence in English , I was selected by the above-mentioned Prof. Liu to be her research assistant . Prof. Cheng studied in Monterey Institute of International Studies and Stanford University sponsored by Fulbright foundation . His advisor was Professor Geza Feketekuty , one of the founders of Commercial Diplomacy , a new academic subject . Commercial diplomacy was established in 1996 as a pioneering program designed to link traditional policy studies and international business skills in the rapidly evolving field of international trade and commerce . When Prof. Chen returned from the United States , she went on with her research in China , which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hoped I could help him develop this program in China . Now we have our own website - **30;916;TOOLONG , and have collected and translated a large number of foreign materials into Chinese . Now , our research platform is taking shape . Today the development of Commercial diplomacy is only at its infant stage in China . We have a lot of work to do in calling people 's attention to its significance for our country 's development . When doing this , I find my understanding of this subject is deepened , too . <p> Commercial diplomacy , as the term suggests , is the diplomacy related with commerce . It affects the decisions of a government and in turn influences global trade and investment . In the past , commercial diplomacy concerned mainly the negotiation of import taxation and quota , but as a result of globalization , it now covers a much bigger area . The first step of commercial diplomacy is a deep analysis of the factors that may affect the government 's decision . These factors include commercial profits , the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the investors , relevant trade regulations and the role that the media plays in affecting public opinions . Commercial diplomacy has a lot to do with political tactics . Debating skills and strategy of alliance are most important in commercial diplomacy . Commercial diplomats have to make use of debating skills to get the investments that they want or the political support in taxation , export credit and control from the government . Apart from this , commercial diplomats have to be good at the strategy of alliance . Alliance with the government , industrial groups , different interest groups and politically influential money holders will help to achieve the expected result . Besides this , commercial diplomacy also covers negotiation , dispute settlement and arbitration . <p> I realized the backwardness of research in this area in China and the pressing need for development in this field after my study in university and participation in the ICDP CHINA project . In anti-dumping cases , for example , China answered only one third of the accusations against it . This brought heavy economic losses to our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep its promises , trade with other countries according to the WTO regulations and thus bring benefits to both sides will depend upon talents . Encouraged by Prof. Cheng , who is using what he has learned in the US to help China to achieve its goal , I strengthened my resolve to study abroad to be a specialized talent in commercial diplomacy . <p> After all these years of inquiring , I found at last that commercial diplomacy was the life for me . I am proud of the choice I have made because it helps to promote world prosperity and I believe that I can do something for the stable development of world economy .

My excellent academic performance won me the rare privilege to be awarded the SONY Scholarship which was granted to only 100 excellent students in all the universities and colleges in Beijing by Beijing Education Commission . In addition , I received the first prize in the English Speech Contest held by our University and a second prize of Beijing area in the 1998 SONY Cup National Collegians ' Electronic Design Competition with my design works of electronic scoreboard .

Under the supervision of a senior engineer from the Great Dragon Company , I took up the task to research and develop the 34Mb/s Tributary Card . Finally I succeeded in getting four 34Mb/s signals to map into the STM-1 and solved this touchy problem . Traditionally , only three 34Mb/s signals were accessible to STM-1 with the SDH mapping route according to the ITO-T proposal . The bandwidth-carrying utilization ratio in the transmission system of optical telecommunications has thus been greatly enhanced due to this achievement . This card has already been applied to Hunan Photoelectric and Optical Fiber Telecommunication Network and passed the network entry test of telecommunications conducted by the Ministry of Information Industry in China .

During this process , on behalf of our company , I frequently participated in the training and exchanging activities organized by the American Agere Company and the Canadian PMC Company and held at Beijing and Shanghai . This training activity is concerned with the systematic application of SONET optical telecommunication chips , the prospects and development of its most advanced technologies in SDH/SONET/DWDM optical telecommunications .

Since the Canadian Nortel Company showed keen interest in our IMTP project , I went to Hong Kong to take part in a technological exchange activity conducted between Nortel and Hutchison Optel Company on the IMTP project . Meanwhile , I exchanged views with those technical personnel in the Northern Asian and Chinese sector of Nortel on a series of hot topics in the field of telecommunications , such as an intelligent optical transmission system with multi-service access , SDH/SONET technologies , and WDM technology all rolled into one . <p> The trip to Hong Kong really set me thinking .

The development of China 's telecommunication industry urgently calls for a group of young people to study abroad , to master the world 's most sophisticated technologies , and make their due contributions to facilitate China 's telecommunication industry upon completing their degree programs and returning back .

I applied these lessons to caring for my daughter , and provided her with the twenty-four hour a day care that she required .

I was too numbed with pain , however , to focus my thoughts on any plans to enter that field . I instead tried to deal with my grief while providing for my remaining child as a single mother . During the next few years , I worked as a secretary and a beautician , and eventually opened a beauty salon of my own .

Use multiple editors and do NOT rely on computer spell or grammar check . Public Administration minus the l is still a word , but not the word you were likely meaning to say . <p> Tailor your resume for each job - order the bullet points , use their buzz words , appeal to their posting . <p> There is not one right format - Choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a cookie cutter resume - alter templates if you must use them . <p> Format should be easy for the recruiter to quickly scan - 20-60 seconds is all you might get . <p> One page only--recruiters will likely not take time to look at a second page . Do what you can to acknowledge the time restraints for the recruiter . <p> Approximately 70% text 30% white space - make it visually pleasing . <p> 10 or 12 pt for easy readability - do what you can to make life pleasant for the recruiter . <p> We read from top to bottom and left to right--make sure every word entices them to look further . <p> You should order your most impressive credentials from top to bottom . As a new college graduate your degree may very well be your best credential , so Education should be the top subheading . <p> Your name should be largest for ease of reference . <p> Your address does n't sell you so it can be smaller than 10 pts - but make sure it is current and that your email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or voicemail often during the job search . <p> Consider saving your resume as a PDF file - prevent it from looking typewritten when it comes across the wire . The website www.gohtm.com will convert your document for free . <p> Content - Be consistent <p> Generally begin with college experiences , leaving off high school--there are exceptions . <p> Objective statements are n't used much any more--if you choose to use an objective statement make sure it is focused on what you can do for the employer , not what they can do for you . <p> Summaries or profiles are the trend to replace objective statements.briefly make three or four supportable claims that meet the employer 's specific needs as listed on their posting or per your research . <p> Subtitles should easily identify and categorize information contained within your resume--they are an organization tool so make them work for you . <p> Use bold , underlining , italics , and all CAPS to accentuate important items - however , be careful not to misuse or overuse them lest nothing stands out . <p> Be consistent--if your title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should follow the same formatting for the rest of the jobs even if the titles for those are n't as grand . Make your resume easy to reference . <p> Use complete thoughts but not complete sentences . Resumes do not use typical sentence punctuation . <p> When referring to religious experiences use employment terminology not church jargon - volunteer representative teaching over 50 individuals and supervising 10 other volunteers . <p> Focus on transferable skills - waiting 6 tables at a time may not matter for a teaching position , but accuracy under pressure and/or promoting and providing a cheerful environment under challenging circumstances does . <p> Revising - A key to great resumes <p> You know yourself as do your personal friends and family--the recruiter will be a stranger so a stranger 's review of your resume every time you revise it can provide valuable insights on their first impressions . Be sure to ask for an honest evaluation every time you revise . <p> Keep a resume journal/log/list/ which contains ALL your experience . Then draw pertinent information from it for each new job application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will remember or you do n't have enough to write down. )

@@42231573 @2231573/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> GRE Test for Graduate School Admissions <p> General Info <p> GRE General is required by most universities if you are applying to graduate school ( the exceptions are Business School which require GMAT and Law Schools which require LSAT ) . <p> GRE Subject ( Economics , Engineering , History , Mathematics , Physics , etc ) is usually required or highly recommended by schools . If you are applying to Physics Department GRE Physics will be required . If you are applying to Biology Department you will usually have a choice which subject test to take Biology , Math , Physics ( I took Math when I was applying to Biology ) . Some universities would say that GRE Subject is not required , still if you can get high score it is worth to take and submit the test . <p> GRE scores ( both General and Subject ) are very important , admissions committee pays close attention to them . <p> Check out Free Sample Tests and Preparation Materials from ETS <p> Try to take tests in advance . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the admission committee for consideration until I provided percentile of my GRE General score ( when you take computer test you are given exact numbers right away but not the percentile ) -- I do n't think this is generally the case , but still do n't wait until the last moment . Try to take the tests in October-November . <p> GRE General <p> GRE General consists of three sections Quantitative , Analytical and Verbal . The maximum score in each section is 800 . You will have total of 4 sections during the test . One section will be presented twice ( I had two Analytical sections , for example ) . If you have two say Verbal sections only one of them will be counted , the other one is experimental . You wo n't know which one is experimental ( do n't even try : - ) thus you have to work hard on all 4 sections . <p> The test is computer adaptive , so the difficulty of each next question will depend on whether or not you answered correctly the previous question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 of each section . Also , remember to answer all the question , this is better for your final score than leaving unanswered questions <p> Quantitative ( 28 questions , 45 minutes ) This section tests you basic math skills , mostly middle to high school level . Anyone from Phystech , MIFI , etc can easily get 800 ( if you get the score below 700 - shame on you ! ) . See examples . <p> Analytical ( 35 questions , 60 minutes ) This section is not very difficult , but it is quite unusual and time consuming . I think the best way to master it is to practice . In my opinion each person has his own style of logic and its harder to adopt somebody else 's structure than to develop your own . Thus , my advice is practice until you fill fluent in this type of problems and can solve them in the allocated time . Strive for the score of 800 and be proud of yourself if you get the score above 750 . <p> Verbal ( 30 questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us : - ) this is the most difficult section . To do well in it you need to know an incredible number of rarely used English words . Thus , preparation for this test mostly involves training your memory . Of course , you would also need to learn general patterns and structures , get acquainted with tricks to find solutions , etc . I would recommend .... for preparation . Check out GRE Vocabulary Builder and Guru 's GRE Wordlist Memorizer . Strive for the score of 450 , anything above 400 is good , scores 350-390 are acceptable , below 300 is really bad . " My personal relationship with Verbal has always been really tense ( in 1997 I got 380 , in 2000 - 370 ) . My scored did not prevent me from getting admitted to Princeton and MIT , so do n't panic if your score is not perfect . I remember a funny story that happened to me during an interview at Caltech ( in Biology you have to pass an interview before being admitted ) . I came to the professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my scientific interests and then he looked at my test score and said " How come you have 370 in Verbal ? I was thinking you wo n't be able to make a few phrases , but your English is excellent . " : - ) Still try to find patience in yourself and prepare for Verbal , e.g. learn those words ! " <p> GRE Subject <p> The difficulty of this test depends on the subject you choose and on your personal level of knowledge . For example , at MIPT some of my group-mates could easily get 990 in Physics ( which is maximum score ) while others could only get 750 which is non-acceptable for the top schools ( my score in 1997 was 770 ) . When I was applying to Biology my Math score of 890 was considered really good . As a general rule score above 800 are good , above 900 are excellent . Most universities will list average scores for admitted students and these numbers are generally in the range 600-750 . You should understand that these numbers include American students which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win against other foreigners thus for you scores below 750 are no good at all .

@@42231578 @2231578/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Media Management <p> In the present-day world which is becoming increasingly integrated and whose mass communication is experiencing unprecedented development , mass media is , to an important extent , shaping the way people perceive the world . Mass media is also producing an important effect on the way the world develops . My fascination with the media industry originates precisely from its vital importance to society and the possibility that it creates for me as an individual of society to fulfill my role in changing the world and contributing to social development . <p> I came to develop this awareness through my undergraduate education , during which I specialized in the study of journalism , through the extensive internships at such media organizations as XX YOUTH WEEKLY and TRAVEL AND TRADE IN EUROPE , and through my continued involvement in extracurricular activities of student organizations . It has always been my conviction that life is like a piece of clay that is to be shaped and modeled into a work of art by a creative artist . I am determined to shape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor to experience the true beauty of life . My choice of media management as the objective of my lifelong career is precisely a way in which I am to shape my lifeI hope that I can be instrumental to the process of social development through my involvement in media , which is often regarded as the lever and the conscience of society . <p> My motivation for acquiring a Western education is initially derived from the movie Sabrina n which the famous movie star Audrey Hepburn acted the leading role . The story about how the protagonist changed her life through integration into an international environment made me deeply aware of the paramount importance of an international education to the development of a persons career and to the improvement of his or her personal qualities . Now , on the verge of completing my undergraduate program in journalism at XX UNIVERSITY , I plan to undertake a Masters program in European Art and Media Management at the esteemed XX University . The reason I make such a decision is two-folded . There is first my deep-entrenched love for media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of media research education . On top of that is my belief that an advanced program in European Art and Media Management will maximize my understanding of European art and lay a firm foundation for my future career in media industry . The present condition of media development in China and the on-going media reform will create unprecedented possibilities of personal development for an emerging generation of media professionals with international background , education and training . This gives me sufficient reason to believe that the legend of the ugly duckling and the beautiful swan that happened to Sabrina can also happen to me . <p> I believe that to undertake an advanced degree program in media management and , ultimately , to take up media management as my career , I have acquired necessary qualifications in terms of academic foundation , the development of journalistic writing and research ability , the cultivation of relevant management skills , and practical experiences in media management . My undergraduate program focused on economic news and media management and XX is the first university in China to offer such a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial journalists and media administrators for Chinas media community . My education covers foundational courses across two fieldsjournalism and economicsand the courses range from management science , media management and operation , marketing , public relations , international finance , monetary banking , etc . My academic performance is ranked top third in my class . Such an academic foundation , I believe , fits me very nicely for your program , as I will bring with me a broad knowledge background to inform my future studies . <p> To attempt at journalistic writing and get those writings published in various newspapers and magazines has been another important aspect of my undergraduate training . So far , I have published three articles in the XX respectively entitled " No Kinship between MaSanJie and MaLan but Why Look Like Twins ? " ( April 17 , 2002 ) , " The Founders of Red Sorghum Start Anew to Explore the Essence of Chinese Fast Food Industry " ( May 22 , 2002 , cover story ) and " Ouny in XX Undergoes a Facelift to Look Alien " ( June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best news reports of the month , those articles fully demonstrate my journalistic sensitivity and the ability to carry out in-depth analysis into current events . <p> At present , I am engaged in writing my thesis Agenda Setup and the Truth of Media with a view to improving my ability to perform academic research . In this thesis , I focus on the coverage of SARS by leading international media as the point of entry into a detailed analysis of a series of issues in the relationship between reality and the simulated reality conjured up by media reports . One of the objectives of the thesis is to demonstrate that media coverage of the external world can never be a mirror-like faithful and objective representation but can only be a purpose-dominated , selective , and hence tendentious activity . <p> Out of my deep awareness of the empirical nature of media management as a profession , I have made conscious efforts to enhance my practical experience by doing internship at local media companies and taking up important responsibilities of organizing extracurricular activities . XX YOUTH WEEKLY , SPOTLIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EUROPE are the media organizations that I worked with . In addition to internships , I served as vice director of the Intercollegiate Liaison Department of my universitys Students Union and director of the Sports and Entertainment Department of the Art and Communications College . I organized a series of campus events during which I invited leading football players of our country and renowned film directors to interact with students . In performing those responsibilities , I have considerably improved my organizational and interpersonal skills and realized the crucial importance of teamwork to successful management . <p> While applying my knowledge of journalism to practices , I discovered during my internships that problems abound in Chinas media management . The urgency and the necessity to work out those problems constitute important reasons underlying my decision to pursue advanced studies in this field . <p> With Chinas accession into the WTO , foreign media organizations will be allowed to operate commercially in Chinas media market beginning from 2004 . This open-door policy will pose unprecedented challenge to the heretofore self-enclosed Chinese media industry . Some of the major problems facing Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels of income ( almost exclusively relying on advertising ) , low competitiveness resulting from small scale . Therefore , important reforms must be introduced into the Chinese media industry to change its present system and mechanism , the products of conventional planned economy . It is a regret that few Chinese universities offer advanced program in media management and the research into this field is far from mature . Under such circumstances , I turn to your university . I expect to learn advanced knowledge and acquire useful experiences from the western media world . I will first do extensive coursework to lay a solid theoretical groundwork in media management . I will seek opportunities to take part in actual media management and wish to carry out in-depth research on the application of modern information technology to media management . By the time that I return to China , I can make up for Chinese medias deficiency in this aspect . <p> The important challenges that Chinese media faces create important opportunities for every Chinese youth committed to media management . I feel lucky that the most important part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that my life will be made fruitful because of this special historical period .

@@42231588 @2231588/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Design <p> Two roads diverged in a wood , and I took the one less traveled by , and that has made all the difference. --Robert Frost--Have you ever taken the road less traveled ? When you drive home from work , do you ever explore ? Sure , it might take longer than usual , and there may be unpleasant stops along the way , but occasionally you will find an unexpected surprise . By casting aside strict conventions and routines and by taking risks , we can achieve things we never considered or thought possible . I find that many people in our religiously capitalist society only seek the fastest , cheapest , and most efficient route . While some industries hire to increase diversity and thereby innovation , many dare not attempt anything new . In particular , many established architects and developers fear taking chances and fear the risk of failure inherent in untested methods . I , on the other hand , believe that architects must not feel constrained by the past but must follow up on promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-assurance , and courage . In my junior year in college , I doubted the teaching style of my instructor in my first design studio class . I felt as if he pushed his own rigid ideas into the students ' creations and did not allow the students the opportunity to pursue their own original designs . Fearing my intellectual growth might be stunted by his lectures and dissatisfied with his teaching , I basically taught myself design by researching and combing through hundreds of architecture books . Through my own studies , I came to realize that architecture should be learned , not preached . That semester , I further challenged myself by working on a design of my own creation , a design not as signed by my instructor . While it would have been easier to accept the instructor 's lessons and just follow his ideas , I realized that I could never take the easy way again now that I discovered that the beauty of architecture lies in learning it myself . That semester helped formulate my approach towards architecture and influence my design decisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking the guidance and critique of others is essential to good design since others can find what I may have overlooked . One critic who has been particularly crucial to the development of my work is Craig Scott , a Progressive Architecture Awards Winner in 1996 , who worked together with Homa Fardjadi and Sima Fardjadi . Craig was my studio critic during the spring term of 1997 . His instruction helped me achieve a level of design that I could not have attained from books alone . Of greatest importance , he taught me a combination of methodology and theory to the process of creating designs . He taught me to begin with a simple conceptual spatial model , then add site context and programmatic concerns to create an integrated building . The application of a methodology to the design process made my work more structured and rigorous than before . In Craig 's studio , I designed a furniture workshop for downtown Ann Arbor that was chosen as an exhibit in the 1997 Summer Student Exhibition in the University of Michigan . Professors chose the most outstanding projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although this was certainly not a major trophy , the exhibition represented my first accomplishment in the studio and was a milestone in my architectural career .

For that exhibition , entitled " Taking Aim , " each professor chose the best three projects from his/her studio . In the exhibition , the alumni of previous years and students from other architecture schools were invited to share our success . These exhibitions were important to me not only because my designs were chosen , but also because they gave me the opportunity to display my work before the most important critics of all--the general public , which included the students and teachers from different years and different schools .

@@42231597 @2231597/ <h> Sample Personal Letters of Recommendation <p> Because judges may receive dozens or hundreds of applications , they use letters of recommendation to distinguish among the many qualified candidates . Most trial court judges require two letters of recommendation and most appellate judges prefer three . Confirm the required number of recommendations with the judge to whom you are submitting your application . At least one of these letters should be from a law school professor . When deciding who on the faculty you should ask to write your letter of recommendation , remember that the best letters of recommendation come from professors who can speak from personal knowledge of you and your work . You start during your first year to develop relationships with your professors . This will ensure that there are one or two faculty members who know you well enough to write personalized letters of recommendation . If there is a particular professor you would like to have write your letter of recommendation , become actively involved with the professor 's research or try to serve as his or her faculty fellow , enroll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volunteer project . The professor will become acquainted with you and your work and will be in a better position to write a glowing recommendation . Faculty members know that students will be asking for recommendations . Do not hesitate to ask . However , give them plenty of time - at least one month - to prepare the letters . <p> If the professor writing your letter of recommendation offers to let you see the letter , read through it to confirm that it is an accurate portrayal of your character and abilities . If it is not , and you have multiple letters to choose from , use the letters that present you in the best light . Each faculty member is different regarding the number of letters they will send . Ask each professor how many letters it is appropriate to request of them . Most professors have no problem with 20-30 letters since they tend to use the same letter for each judge . However , to maintain good will , the more letters you request , the more you should try to lessen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor does n't have to worry about it ) . <p> You may also consider requesting a letter of recommendation from an attorney who has seen your work . Do not include any recommendations with an attorney from before you entered law school . Again , provide adequate notice to the attorney so that he or she may have sufficient time to complete the recommendation letter . Letters of recommendation can either be sent separately from your application packet or sealed and included with the other application materials . We recommend that you include sealed letters of recommendation in your application packet . This will decrease the possibility that your letters of recommendation become misfiled.

Kay came well prepared to her student teaching experience . Prior to being my student teacher , she was a tutor for several weeks for some of my needier students after school . In this capacity she was consistent , compassionate and reliable . While student teachers are required to spend one hundred hours for field study , Kay had clocked well over double that amount prior to her student teaching experience with me further evidencing her dedication to the teaching profession . This enthusiasm and philosophy of hard work did not wane after she began her formal student teaching in earnest . When she began her student teaching , it was immediately evident that Kay had a love for the profession and a sincere interest in and concern for the students . She was willing to come up with creative lessons that proved to be interesting and educationally effectiive . Furthermore , she spent many hours with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to help one of my less capable readers . Kay has approached any and all aspects of the work involved in teaching my students with eager anticipation . She wrote extremely detailed and well thought out plans in spite of the fact that during this entire student teaching experience she maintained her responsibilities as editor in chief of the Colgate University Maroon News weekly newspaper . In fact , in my thirty years of teaching I have never experienced any student teacher who was better prepared and who worked harder than Kay . Her lessons have been thought out and professional . She was always willing to adjust any parts of her lessons she thought could be improved . Kays classroom management style seemed closer to that of a veteran teacher than to the student teacher she is . Her maturity in dealing with the students was evident and , as a result , commanded real respect from the students . On a practical level , all the papers , quizzes and tests Kay assigned to the students were immediately graded and returned to the students . She maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ethic and her professional concern for her students progress . No time was wasted in her class . While teaching in my classroom Kay took the initiative to create many colorful , creative and effective bulletin boards relating to the work being done and the units studied in class . She became ever more efficient in her teaching , keeping lists of students who owed work on the board as well as announcing the homework assigned each day . Overall , as the chairman of our English department , I would not hesitate to offer Kay a teaching position in our district were we to have an opening . Wherever she decides to accept a teaching position , I know with all confidence that she will do an outstanding job and become an asset to the school district fortunate enough to receive her application for employment Should you desire further information , please contact me at Sherburne-Earlville Central School . <h> Featured Schools <p> University of Phoenix - Associates , Bachelors , Masters &amp; Doctoral Degrees .

This multiple choice based test , which is usually administered in the south , is known for testing a students ability to recall formulas and fundamentals from the aforementioned subjects as well as a students ability to solve graphs . Students are graded on a scale of one ( lowest ) to thirty-six ( highest ) in each of these four categories .

@@42231610 @2231610/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Law School Tuition Costs <p> Obviously , money is a major factor when selecting a law school . Law school is an expensive endeavor for most people . Law school lasts 3 years , and the tuition alone may be as much as $30,000 a year . Moreover , students are generally discouraged from working , particularly during the first year . Furthermore , unlike undergraduate education and most types of graduate programs , there are few opportunities for scholarships , grants , fellowships , work study , and assistantships . If you are a traditional law student , unless your family can afford to pay for law school and they are willing to do so , you will probably have to rely on financial aid . In other words , you will need to borrow the money . Indeed , most law students rely on loans to cover the lions share of law school costs . With this in mind , there are several financial considerations that you should take into account when selecting a law school . <p> Obviously , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tuition . Tuitions can range from as little as $5,800 for in-state tuition at the University of Georgia School of Law , to $29,500 at Harvard Law School . The two most important distinctions in determining tuition are usually private v. public and in-state v. out-of-state . Generally speaking , private schools cost more than public schools . Moreover , public school tuition for in-state students is more expensive than it is for out-of-state students . For example , the tuition for in-state students at UMKC is approximately $11,000 a year for in-state residents , compared to almost $22,000 for non-residents . <p> The other important factor when considering cost is living expenses . Living expenses will vary based on the overall cost of living for the city or town in which the school is located . For example , the University of Georgia School of Law estimates that students will need approximately $8,000 a year to cover room , board , and books in Athens , Georgia . Conversely , Harvard Law Schools estimates that similar expenses in Boston will run approximately $18,000 . <p> After evaluating costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can I pay for it ? For some students , they can either use their own money , a spouses income , or their parents are willing to pay for law school . However , most students must rely on some form of outside funding to pay for law school . As noted above , you will probably have to rely on student loans . You should be able to find some form of student loans to finance law school . The main issue is whether you will be able to repay your loan . The good news is that loan repayment is usually fairly flexible . Often you can repay your loan over a period of up to 30 years . Still , student loan payments can cause an economic hardship if 1 ) the loan is too large ; 2 ) you have a moderate to low salary . As such , you need to think about these two factors before you select your law school . Essentially , you have to estimate how much money you think you will earn . If you think you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular law school , than you can probably afford to pay back the loans , no matter how high . However , if you estimate that you will receive a low salary , then you should reconsider if you know that you would have to take out substantial student loans to cover tuition and expenses . Of course , you are probably thinking that it is almost impossible to determine what your salary will be like . True , there is virtually no way to know for sure how much you will earn over the course of repaying the loan . However , you can use two pieces of information to arrive at a rough guess . The first is the average starting salary of recent graduates from the particular law school of interest . If the starting salaries are relatively high you can probably afford to pay a little more money in student loan payments . The second piece of information is the average starting salary in the type of job in which you are interested . Not all attorneys start out making a six figure salary . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low paying . A rookie prosecutor might make $35,000 to start . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( see http : **29;1029;TOOLONG ) , the median salary of a lawyer 6 months after graduation in 2000 was $51,900 . The median for attorneys working in private practice was $80,000 , compared to $34,000 for a public interest attorney .

@@42231612 @2231612/ 9338 @qwx419338 <h> Behavioral Interviewing Questions and Training <p> Behavioral Interviewing , also referred to as Structured Behavioral Interviewing , is by design a more systematic and standardized process of evaluating job candidates than is typical of the " traditional " interview process . Its primary intent is to increase the success rate of an organizations " good " hires and is , therefore , the form of interview being used more often by a wide variety of recruiting organizations . Behavioral interviewing is based on the " Behavioral Consistency Principle " which essentially states that the best predictor of future performance is past performance in a similar circumstance . Therefore , the questions that are asked of you will tend to focus on behavior , and attempt to evoke how you responded to a variety of specific personal and interpersonal situations and what results occurred from your actions . <p> " How do I Know When I 'm Being Given a Behavioral Interview ? " <p> It is quite possible that the interviewer may make you aware prior to the interview that you should expect a structured or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying whether or not you 're being given a behavioral interview even without prior information . If you hear questions that are asking you to describe or recount specific situations in which you carried out a job-relevant action , and are then asked to describe the consequence or result of your action , you know you 're being behaviorally interviewed . <p> " So What Kinds of Questions Should I Expect ? " <p> Behavioral interviews are designed to assess your " real " ability or skill level in functioning in any number of work related activities by delving into how you functioned in your past jobs or extracurricular activities . As with any sort of interview , there are a number of common behavioral " themes " or " performance dimensions " that most recruiters are likely to be interested in . These include ( but are not limited to ) leadership , interpersonal , communication , multi-tasking , management and cognitive skills , transition ability ( e.g. , personal flexibility , tolerance for ambiguity ) , motivation , decisiveness and commitment . The kinds of inquiries youd hear from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate to be your biggest academic achievement at this point ? <p> What did you do to contribute to that achievement ? <p> Cite an example of when you were faced with an unpleasant task . How did you go about facing it ? <p> Give me the most recent example of a conflict you had with a coworker or a supervisor . How did you handle it ? <p> Describe a situation in which you had to use your communication skills in order to make an important point . <p> Tell me about a time when you had to use a persuasive argument to help someone see things your way . How did you do it ? <p> Share with me an example of an important personal goal which you set , and tell me about how you accomplished it . <p> Have you ever had too many different tasks given to you to complete at the same time ? What was your style in managing these ? <p> We 've all had times when we felt overwhelmed by a project . Give me an example of when this happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Describe a situation in which you showed determination . How did you go about it ? <p> Note that each of the above examples integrates three universal components of a good behavioral inquiry : a particular performance situation or task , an action on your part , and the consequences of your action . <p> " What 's the Best Way to Answer Those Questions ? " <p> Obviously , you 'll have to be able to reflect on specific situations that you encountered while working ( including volunteering and studying ) , then describe how you handled them and what positive results became of your efforts . With that said , it is highly critical that you first do some preparation . For any given job interview , this should begin with an analysis on your part of what you believe to be the most important skills , abilities , and personal qualities needed to successfully fulfill the various responsibilities of the job . Once identified , think carefully about any kind of " working " experience that youve ever had that required you to use these skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish the tasks , and what positive results came about from your diligence . It is often the case that an interviewer will seek a relatively high level of detail in your responses ( e.g. , the conversation you had , the mood of the person you were talking to , your specific thought processes at the time of action , etc . ) . Some behavioral questions are complex and require a multifaceted response , so take your time in constructing your answers . Do n't  worry about pausing during the interview to do so , as recruiters will expect you to give adequate thought to your responses . And do n't  be put off by the fact that the interviewer may be taking voluminous notes as you talk . It is common for recruiters to have to objectively rate you based on exacting measures of your specific responses . <p> " What Else Should I Keep in Mind ? " <p> Although some recent research has demonstrated that structured , behaviorally based interviewing can improve the likelihood of an appropriate hire by more than three times the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that all organizations are using or plan to use this method in making hiring decisions . Assessing a job candidates capability for any given position is a complex task , with a great many intangible factors involved in the process . A companys decision to use one kind of interviewing format over another is due to a variety of factors which include how successful its recruiting efforts have been in the past , what kinds of recruiting strategies recruiters feel most comfortable with , organizational tradition , etc . There seems to be , however , little equivocation that when administered properly structured behavioral interviews work effectively for the companies and organizations using them . Keep in mind as well that preparing for one kind of interviewing strategy should not supplant your preparation for another kind . Traditional interviewing and behavioral interviewing do share common goals and processes ( see our handout titled Traditional Interviews ) , so knowing how to perform in an unstructured interview is important in its own right , but is also of assistance in preparing you for a more structured behavioral interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case that an organization will give you a " hybrid " interview of sorts , with a mixture of structured and unstructured questions . Others may do a preliminary unstructured screening interview , and follow this up with a behavioral interview if you advance past the initial interview . In any case , given the current milieu in recruiting , it is wise that you become fully literate in the language and substance of both the behavioral and traditional interview formats . <p> As with any interview performance , the likelihood is great that your first formal job interview will not go as well or as smoothly as your second , the second not as well or as polished as the third , etc . Play it safe and smart by practicing your interviewing skills and technique well before your first real interview . The Career Planning Center can assist you in doing this through a mock interview . This an opportunity for you to be formally interviewed by a career planning professional who will ask you a series of interview questions as they relate to the job you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enhancing your performance .

I hired him to work for me as a Research Analyst at SRR in July of 1996 . SRR is a full-service marketing research firm whose clients are primarily large radio stations and other music oriented media companies such as Capital Records , and MTV Networks . My roles at SRR include manager of new product development ( research products and the software to analyze the results ) , and internal research consultant ( sampling methodology and multivariate statistical analysis ) . In addition , as a member of the management team at SRR , I am charged with constantly working to find more efficient , cost-effective means of gathering respondent level data and producing our research products . Since joining SRR as a Senior Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development , Hongbin has been a major weapon in my arsenal of tools for accomplishing these tasks . <p> Hongbin is a creative and original thinker . He has native intelligence , great curiosity about people and ideas , and plenty of common sense that he has applied to solving many problems at SRR . In addition , he has demonstrated excellent powers of observation , and an ability to communicate and suggest change in effective but non-threatening ways . To illustrate <p> Early on , Hongbin was assigned to an important research project as a fill-in Project Manager . In this role he was responsible for the technical aspects of creating a computer-based survey questionnaire ( from one given to him by our client services department ) , monitoring the telephone data collection process , and completing the data processing and analysis of the survey results . <p> From the beginning of this assignment , Hongbin began to re-define our expectations of a good project manager . He started by participating in discussions with the client and suggesting and implementing several changes to the script that shortened its length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedence he spent several days working odd hours , observing and monitoring interviewers and supervisors as they began to field this 2000 person study . Within a few days he had shortened and clarified the script even more - removing redundant questions , collapsing multiple questions into one , and improving the flow from question to question and screen-to-screen - all to the great praise of both interviewers and the director of our phone center . He had also observed something about a particular aspect of the interviewing process that was common to all surveys at SRR . He wrote a memo to several managers outlining his proposed change in methodology that clearly demonstrated the value of his idea : an annual cost reduction of close to $50,000 . At the end of the project , he wrote a several page critique of our interviewing and supervisory staff . He described the characteristics and skills employed by the best interviewers he 'd observed and made suggestions for how these skills could be taught to the entire staff . His recommendations were well received and soon implemented by the very manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his contribution and the skill and sensitivity with which he presented his ideas . <p> In processing the survey results , Hongbin also quickly learned to use several advanced statistical techniques including Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis with which he had only a passing knowledge prior to the project . <p> Hongbin has also demonstrated his technical and analytical abilities in helping create a new model for bidding on new business , and in spearheading the development of tool that used a Maximum Likelihood algorithm for ascribing missing respondent data . Recently , Hongbin helped me identify the most desirable qualifications and background of computer programming candidates , and he assisted me in the recruiting and mentoring of two Chinese student interns to this position . They have both made significant contributions in only a few months of employment . <p> Hongbin is not a native English speaker or writer , and thus , he has had to work very hard to clearly communicate his ideas . I have seen him grow in this area tremendously over the last one and half years . His attentive listening and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both self-confident and self-deprecating , and has a great sense of humor that has helped him form strong relationships with subordinates , peers , and members of our management team . Managers in other departments frequently seek his advice , and his name is always at the top of the list when choosing team members to spearhead important company initiatives . <p> In all of these areas , Hongbin Wu has gone beyond expectations , and has out-shined all others in his peer-group at SRR . His efforts were recently rewarded with a promotion to the position of Manager of Research &amp; Development . <p> Hongbin is very likeable and ambitious person .

@@42231622 @2231622/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Biological Statistics <p> If biology is the most exquisite creation by God and mathematics the language that God uses to describe the universe , then biological statistics is a wonderful fusion of the two . I believe that in constructing the great Leviathan by human intellectual enterprise , biological statistics is bound to serve as one of the cornerstones in the development of the life science . To be able to contribute to this grand enterprise has always been my innermost aspiration . <p> My early fascination with mathematics and biology led me to have finished self-studying such college courses of Advanced Mathematics and Organic Chemistry when I was just a high school student . I won the first prize in the XX Provincial Biology Contest and second and third prizes at national mathematics , chemistry , and Physics Olympics contests . <p> My distinguished performance at the highly competitive National College and University Entrance Examination resulted in my admission into XX University where I majored in Automation Control Instruments . A teacher specializing in Applied Mathematics was appointed to act as my advisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coursework in my own specialty , Linear Planning , Nonlinear Planning , Dynamic Planning , Functional Analysis , Mathematical Modeling and other important courses for students of mathematics major . I won first-class scholarships for 4 consecutive years throughout my undergraduate career , becoming one of the five municipal-level outstanding students . In 1997 , as the top-ranking student in my class and the third-ranking student in my department , I graduated cum laude . <p> One special achievement in my undergraduate program was that , winning high appreciation from the professors in charge for my outstanding mathematics cultivation , I was singled out to participate in the All-China Inter-collegiate Mathematics Modeling Contest . For three days , I worked on the modeling of How to Catch Fish in a Sustainable Way . Finally , my plan received unanimous acclaim from the reviewing panel for its originality in conceptualization and rigorous design , winning the first prize in XX Province . <p> Ranking third in the entrance examination , I entered XX Institute of Technology to embark on my Masters program in 1997 . Specializing in Automation Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from required courses , I studied Mathematical Statistics , Fuzzy Mathematics , Numerical Analysis , etc . Meanwhile , I consciously attended many optional courses in computer science , laying a solid foundation in software theory and application development . <p> In order to receive as much academic input as possible , I attended International Symposium on XX Process and Controlled XX Chain and other similar conferences . I also took part in several major research and development projects to accumulate important practical experiences . As project director , I headed the development of Railway Freight Transportation Management System in XX City , which is part of Chinas National 863 Project . In developing the Management Support System of XX , the countrys super large enterprise , I was responsible for data analysis and processing in modeling . My successful modeling not only contributed to the precise prediction of future petroleum yield . It could also generate future plans and suggestions based on analysis and predictions . For this reason , my work was highly evaluated by experts from XX . <p> My wide-ranging R &amp; D experience and academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . When undertaking the graduation project for my Masters program , I took into consideration large enterprises great quantity of raw data and those datas implied information and the relative insufficiency of definite data information . I applied the XX Process Theory , Time Sequence Analysis and other data analytical approaches to realize data management and to provide support for decision-making . In my thesis entitled The Application of Unstable Process Data Modeling in Sales Predictions , I came up with advanced approaches to realize linear unstable data and conducted comprehensive analysis of the non-linear and unstable processes and the implied input variables ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ) . XX Book Mansion , the largest book seller in XX , employed the research findings of my thesis and worked out a management system of sales statistics . My thesis was finally rated as " of first-class quality " by the academic committee for its unique perspectives and rigorous investigations . <p> As the second top ranking student of my department , I became the Outstanding Graduate of 2000 . Since my graduation , I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my employment with XX Telecommunication Company and XX Telecommunication Technology Company , I have worked as technical director and project manager , participating in formulating the XX Management Standards of No. 7 Signal Directions , the National Standards of Local XX System ( the 2nd Edition ) . I have been responsible for developing the XX Management System of No. 7 Signal Directions in XX Province , the first such system in China , followed by that in XX Province . <p> Over the past few years , all the projects I directed have passed at the first appraisal . This has much to do with my solid mathematical foundation and my ability to apply my knowledge of mathematics . The work I have been performing during and after my Masters program has primarily focused on statistical analysis , during which I have build up abundant applied experience . <p> With those academic and career foundations behind me , I am now ready for pursuing statistics in a different field biological statistics . As far as I know , there is still much to be improved in the mathematical analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some methodological issues must be solved , such as the problem in XX analysis . The second is that the modeling of biological and medical statistics still needs to be perfected . In my future studies , I will concentrate on the modeling of biological and medical statistics in which I hope to achieve methodological innovations . It is apparent that the present teaching and research level in biological statistics in China is unlikely to meet my aspiration for a quality education in this field . Only the United States , the country with the most advanced biological research , can allow me to be educated in the most updated theories and practices of biological statistics and enable me to accomplish my academic and career objectives . Therefore , I have chosen to apply for a Ph.D . program in biological statistics in the University of XX . <p> Among many universities , I have singled out your esteemed university as best for my academic pursuit because of the in-depth research it has carried out in biological statistics , strong faculty and teaching facilities , numerous opportunities of academic exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and methodologies . I long to be a part of your university . I expect that under the guidance of reputed professors in this field I can receive systematic education in biology and further enhance my aptitudes in statistics , with special emphasis on keeping abreast with the latest developments in the international academia . I would like to expose myself to the teachings of renowned scholars and experts and participate in extensive academic activities to broaden my mind and to improve my academic qualities . Ultimately , I will synthesize all that I will have learned and seek research opportunities . My objective is that through your program I can build up a solid foundation for an academic career in biological statistics in which I can make important contributions to this exciting field of research .

" How true that is ! One of the main purposes of an interview is to present yourself to a potential employer in a manner that reflects a highly polished and professional image . It is important to keep in mind that the interview is not the time to be making a personal statement about the way you dress . Your goal should be to demonstrate that you respect the interviewer 's values , tastes , and expectations relative to dress and personal manner . Although professional dress and appropriate style may vary slightly depending on job type , work environment and geographical region , there are several key points to keep in mind : <p> For Men A conservative business suit is almost always the rule . A well-tailored or fitted suit jacket and trousers will go a long way in helping you present yourself professionally and confidently . For example : coat sleeve and trouser length should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long . Appropriate size is critical not only for comfort , but also for presenting a " clean " fit , there is no room for sloppiness . <p> Acceptable colors continue to be darker shades and hues including grays , blues ( navy ) , and black . Pattern designs such as pin stripes and plaids are acceptable as long as they are subtle . <p> A plain white or off-white shirt is always a winner . In most cases , either a loose or button-down collar ( oxford cloth ) is fine . Occasionally pastel shades ( blue , pink , yellow , etc. ) are acceptable , as is a pin-stripe design as long as the look is conservative and not flashy . <p> Neckties ... again the word is conservative . Patterns should be uniform and subtle , whether stripes or small dots . Paisley designs are generally acceptable . Deep reds , maroon , blues , navy , grays and black are colors that blend well with dark suits , once again keeping in mind that slight variations may occur due to region and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your coat lapels . <p> Dressing in your best attire for the interview also means having your shoes shined , if not new . Wearing a new suit and tie with an old , dirty pair of shoes that need to be repaired would be like washing and waxing your car without scrubbing the tires and hubcaps . Laced shoes are the general rule ; loafers are too casual , and sneakers and hush puppies should be reserved for Friday night barbecues . The color of your socks should complement or match the rest of your outfit . Argyle and see-through socks are not considered appropriate . Likewise , a leather belt that matches the color of your shoes and has a small buckle is a good choice . <p> For Women Dressing in a conservative business suit is the best way to present a professional image . The suit should fit well and make you feel good about yourself . <p> Studies in social psychology have shown that women have an advantage over men when it comes to selecting colors for professional dress . Although the grays and blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with wearing more of a variety of colors. colors including reds , Women are also usually able to wear various fabrics without appearing unprofessional . <p> Your blouse should complement the suit in a conservative fashion . It should not be too revealing , high around the neck , nor have too many ruffles or frills . White or off-white colors such as cream usually match well with many suit colors . See-through blouses are discouraged for the professional interview . <p> Jewelry should be kept to a minimum and make up is a must but should be minimally applied . Women can usually wear their hair in more styles as long as it is not too wild and brash . Women should not go overboard with bright , flashy nail polish colors , Stockings are a must and should be flesh-toned or colors very close to it . Avoid color or patterns that would be distracting . <p> Shoes should be sensibly selected in a way that is not intended to make a statement . <p> For Men and Women Hair should be of a conservative style and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The currently popular disheveled hairstyles may not be the best way to make points with a professional interviewer . Men who wear beards and mustaches should take extra time to make sure facial hair is neatly trimmed and not too long . Fingernails should be trimmed and hands clean .

These lists are based on suggestions which I consider sensible and which are common to those providing guidance . <p> Do : <p> Prepare an outline of topics you are asked to cover by the graduate schools and others you want to cover and list supporting material under each topic . This information will be useful when you develop the drafts of your statement . Typical topics include professional career goals , academic interests and objectives , research experience , practical experience , special skills , and related personal material about your motivation and reason for choosing a program . <p> When writing your statement , stick to the points requested by each program . If a program stresses research , clinical work , or work experience , emphasize those issues in your statement . Avoid lengthy personal or philosophical discussions unless the instructions specifically ask for them . <p> Look on the web or email the department for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors whose interests match yours ' ? If so , indicate this , as it shows a sign that you have done your homework and are highly motivated . You might use the names of faculty and their research interests as examples of what you would like to do . <p> Follow the instructions about length . Usually programs ask for one page , so try to be concise and stick to this limit . Using small print is not a good solution , better send 1 and 1/2 pages of print 11-12 than one page of print size 8 ( do n't go over two pages though ) . <p> Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active , not a passive voice . <p> Demonstrate everything by example ; do n't say directly , for example , that you 're a persistent person , you must demonstrate it . Writing about specific experiences has a number of advantages : * Specifics keep the reader 's attention more effectively than generalities. * Drawing on situations in your life will distinguish you from other applicants who superficially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your essay is well-organized and everything is linked with continuity and focus . Pay special attention to the first paragraph which should capture the readers interest . <p> Check your grammar , spelling , punctuation , and capitalization carefully . Errors distract from the content of your statement and make admission committee members to assume that your writing ability is weak or you do n't care . <p> Review your essay by asking yourself the following questions : <p> Are my goals well articulated ? <p> Do I explain why I have selected this school and/or program ? <p> Do I demonstrate knowledge of the program ? <p> Do I include interesting details that prove my claims about myself ? <p> Is my tone confident ? <p> Make changes to your statement for each school , read as much as possible about their program so that you can tailor your statement to the program and convince the admissions committee that you will fit well there . <p> Ask as many others as possible to proofread your work for writing stylegrammar , spelling , etc . You should also ask those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , organization , and clarity since they will be aware of what graduate schools are seeking . <p> Use overly common phrases and nonspecific information . For example : " My above qualifications and my placement in the top 10th of my class demonstrate that I have the leadership , organization , and academic ability to succeed well at your school . " This generic statement says nothing specific about you as an individual . When you 're writing , think about whether it 's likely that 100 other people said the same thing you did . The personal statement is your chance to show how unique you are . <p> Repeat information from the application unless you use it to illustrate a point . <p> Try to be funnyyou do n't  know your audience , so humor can backfire . <p> Use statements like " I 've always wanted to be a . . .

If there is something important that happened ( poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected your grades go ahead and state it , but write it affirmatively , that is , in a way that shows your perseverance . <p> Use special fonts or colored paper . <p> Use slang , technical jargon. , long quotations . <p> Write in an arrogant manner . Instead , make it clear that you are confident about your ability , but still eager to learn what the program has to offer . <p> Do or do n't  ? <p> There is mixed opinion about whether to call attention to and explain any of your obvious weaknesses in your essay . Some recommend clarifying any weaknesses on your transcripts or your GRE scores in your essay .

@@42231632 @2231632/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Civil Engineering <p> " The Foolish Old Man Removing a Mountain " is an allegory known to virtually every Chinese . The story tells that in ancient times there was an old foolish man by the name of Yu Gong who was determined to remove the WangWu Mountain , a mountain that blocked him and his family from having access to the outside world , in an attempt to carve out a road leading to the outside world and hence create conditions for his posterity to achieve economic prosperity . The project was a Herculean task and , to make the matter worse , the old man was rather advanced in age . His neighbors all came to dissuade him from the endeavor . But the old mans answer was that if he should die , his children and grandchildren could succeed him . The day would come when the mountain could be removed ultimately . <p> Inconceivable as they are , modern versions of this allegory occur in the frequently impoverished mountain areas in present-day China . The mountain folks resort to primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and usually spend many years , even more than a decade , to open up routes inch by inch in order to have access to the market outside the deep mountains to sell their farm produce , so that their descendants will no longer be confined to the kind of isolated and economically unprivileged life that they are living . As a student with a Masters degree in Road &amp; Railway Engineering , I can never maintain a tranquil state of mind whenever I read of stories of this kind . I tell myself that I have the obligation and responsibility to help halt this dire reality . For this reason , I am determined to seek a Ph . D. program in Communication &amp; Transportation at your esteemed university , a program that will enable me to reward my country with my knowledge of the advanced transportation engineering technology in the world . Of course , I am soberly aware that to be accepted into your highly-respected program I will inevitably be faced with fierce competitions . Nevertheless , my sound academic background , rich work experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my qualifications as a worthy candidate for your program . <p> My choice for Industrial and Civil Airport Construction and Highway Airport Construction and Highway during my undergraduate program at the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture , XX University , seemed to have derived from my family tradition . My father has long been a construction engineer and my interest in civil engineering grew as I saw my father working on construction plans and drawings and picking up bits and pieces of civil engineering knowledge . My academic performance at XX University , which is a key university in the country , has been consistently characterized by top ranking , receiving Student of Excellence award for four consecutive years . My solid and comprehensive academic foundation and outstanding performance came to the attention of the renowned airport construction expert Prof. XXX , under whose direction I undertook my graduation project Design of an Airport Runway . In this project , I completed the overall design of a civil airport together with the airports roadnet . The roadnet design fully met the relevant national standards and the overall airport layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reviewing panel . <p> My undergraduate program was immediately followed by a postgraduate program at XX University , into which I was enrolled in my capacity as the top performer in the entrance examination . On a fiercer lever of competition , I doubled my academic efforts and managed to be among the top five in my class , winning " Class-A " scholarships . My active involvement in research also bore fruits . I published several research papers , including XX , in such central natural science journals as XX and XX . <p> Entitled Study of the Low-Noise Mechanism of the Asphalt Pavement , my Masters thesis focused on those issues : the mechanism of noise production of tyres , the parameters affecting the tyres noise , the noise-absorbing mechanism of asphalt pavement and the pavement configuration parameters affecting the low-noise asphalt pavement . The thesis offered in-depth analysis of the effective voidage of the asphalt pavement and the pavement thickness as major factors in reducing the noise production . The new subject as well as the unique perspectives of my thesis won positive comments from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent research on low-noise asphalt pavement " . <p> My distinguished academic performance and research potential led to my employment with XX Province Expressway Co. , Ltd. which made me responsible for the construction and management of the XX Expressway , a key national project . As a major technical specialist , I was in overall charge of drafting relevant tender documents of pavement , participating in the construction of the roadbed , bridge , and pavement , organizing the spot check of the raw materials for the asphalt pavement , holding meeting to discuss technical details of the asphalt pavement , launching technical trainings and field inspections , implementing the Superpave projects . The accumulation of rich and comprehensive experience in construction and management , and the problem-solving skills , and the ability to work effectively and efficiently , both independently and in teams , are the three most important results I have achieved . Over the past four years , I have been given the " Model Employee " honor in my work performance evaluation . <p> An equally important component of my employment is my independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality Control of SMA and Application of Superpave in XX Kaiyang Expressway were published in XX ( national core journal of highway transportation ) .

The areas of study that I will focus in my proposed Ph.D . program are closely connected with those conditionsthe methods of designing asphalt mixture , predictive evaluation of asphalt pavement performance , quality control of asphalt pavement construction , and the regeneration technology of old asphalt pavement . I expect that through your program I will be extensively exposed to the latest theoretical and technical developments in the world academia and take up fruitful research . If your highly selective program accepts applicants with sound academic performance , rich work experience and promising research potential , I can assert , without any shame of arrogance , that I am exactly the candidate you are looking for . 
@@42231634 @2231634/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Pathology <p> I was born in Northeast China 's Jilin Province , the so-called Manchuria region in the past . It remains an economically underdeveloped region at present . My family was rather impoverished when I was a child . My uncle and aunt devoted great attention to my education . They could hardly make their ends meet , but they squeezed out money to send me to the best local school at the time . As early as three years old , I began to learn how to play a traditional Chinese musical instrument called " pipa " and could manage to play solo among other famous classical melodies the Spring River and Flowers Under Moonlight and the High Mountains and Flowing Rivers . The latter melody was originated more than millennia ago , a famous melody that gave vent to an emotion of seeking for someone keenly appreciative of one 's talent . It struck me with feelings of love and accompanied me all through my high school and university life in my quest for knowledge and ideal . <p> I studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . It was a key school in the province with some nationwide prestige . I was always within the fifth rank in academic performance . In the junior middle school period I was always among the best of successful candidates in provincial contests in English , chemistry , physics and mathematics . At the senior middle school stage I got first prize in chemistry and third prize in mathematics in the national Olympic contests administered in Jilin Province . I am grateful to my middle school for the solid foundation laid in my academic studies . <p> That I selected medical science as my major in college entrance examination was partly because I loved organic chemistry and psychology and more importantly because I had an impulse of emotion on a medical errand during my senior middle school days . My mother once suffered from acute pain in the abdomen . My father and I rushed her to the hospital . A young doctor diagnosed her case as ureteral calculus , and gave her a pain-killing injection , but to no avail . The doctor seemed helpless , and shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently witnessed my mother 's painful facial expression . Right at that time there came a peasant who was bitten by a poisonous snake for first-aid help . But the doctor simply transferred him to another hospital , admitting that he could not cure any snakebite cases . Although my mother and that peasant got cured in the hospital later , the two incidents struck me so deeply with the idea : What a bad need for skillful , experienced and ethical doctors for the sake of mankind ! Since then I made up my mind to study medical science and become a highly qualified doctor . That was why I abandoned the chance of being selected into the Chemical Department of Jilin University without entrance examination because of my distinguished scholastic aptitudes in the senior middle school . That department ranked second in the chemical departments of all universities in China , second only to that of Beijing University . Despite that golden chance , I applied for the medical specialty without any hesitation . " Where there is a will , there is the way . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bachelor-Master degree program through entrance examination with prominent scores . I was awarded a scholarship as an outstanding entrant . This was a turning point in my lifetime . It left me an indelible impression , revelation and self-confidence . It taught me to make every effort to achieve my ideal and never to yield for the sake of an idle life . My conviction was that I would be successful so long as I have an ideal and self-confidence . It 's the extra strength that men can always find within themselves when they know they must . <p> I first studied in the Life Science College of Beijing University and laid down a solid and extensive groundwork in natural science . The strong academic atmosphere fostered in me a spirit to crave for freedom and creation , a strong sense of mission and responsibility . Then I studied in the Medical College , where I grasped a wealth of basic medical knowledge , establishing a foundation for my clinic work in the subsequent years . I played an active role in the collegiate human body science association and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student publication . Finally I studied and practiced in Beijing University 's No. 1 Hospital , an eighty-odd-year-old modernized comprehensive clinical hospital for teaching and scientific research , and a key training base under the Ministry of Health . Here I further expanded my scope of medical knowledge , cultivated in me a spirit for meticulous and sophisticated academic thinking , a strong sense of cooperation and responsibility . <p> I chose as the subject of my graduation thesis the surgical treatment of the unstable degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis . Pain in waist and lower extremities is a common and frequently recurring ailment in China haunting some 22% of the population . In order to produce a well-written thesis , I consulted a large amount of relevant technical literature and undertook many field trips , conducting detailed investigations and collecting important data in order to make my thesis substantial . My supervisor evaluated my thesis as excellent and the propositions that I raised in the thesis are not only of tremendous social benefit , but also displaying its pioneering value among the peers abroad . <p> Meanwhile , I developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , the compass and the reliable cornerstone for clinic work . The discipline seemed to expose me to the vivid scenes of the organic human body fighting against the virus , and to the surgeon rescuing the healthy organisms of the human body . For me , the noblest ideal of life is to be able to save the life of my fellow creatures with my own efforts . The readiness to save another 's life ( sometimes even at the expense of one 's own life ) constitutes for me an especially precious human virtue in this modern world , which is replete with violent confrontations and mutual brutality . What a medical professional can do to compensate for such adversity is by mastering the necessary technical expertise which he can apply for the purpose of alleviating the sufferings of his patients . We can trace pathology back to ancient Greek Hippocrates . It has now ramified into the modern organ pathology , cellular pathology and molecular pathology . With the establishment of many new and marginal faculties , pathology has achieved a breakthrough in its cognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now penetrated into the realm of particles , genetic mutation and chromosome aberration in the cognition of diseases . I am determined to confront this new challenge and stand on the crest of the tide whereby I shall make some meritorious service to mankind . A burning desire is kindled within me to further my medical studies in the United States , the leading country in the world in the development of science and technology . <p> My application for pathology is motivated by the following considerations : 1 . to develop a good command of the latest knowledge in the field of pathology which only the United States can offer ; 2. to be well-trained in the acquisition of advanced research methodology and ideology ; 3. to accumulate sufficient practical experience with which to achieve important breakthroughs and make new discoveries in my chosen field ; 4. to construct a firm basis , both theoretical and empirical , for my future career . In order to realize the foregoing objectives , I intend to include the following activities in my prospective study plan : 1 . mastering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in laboratory work and acquiring advanced research methods ; 3. discovering issues of interest and following the latest development and the literature in the related field ; 4. consulting senior professors for valuable advices and exchanging ideas with my fellow students for the purpose of improving myself in collective activities and offering possible assistance to others ; 5. extensively integrating myself into American society as a whole and expanding my cultural horizons . <p> I cherish great admiration for George Washington who , as Commander in Chief of the colonial armies , led the American people to win a war that most considered impossible . He readily offered his service to his country when the American people most needed him . His selfless contributions to his country derived from his strong sense of national responsibility , his fortitude and his spirit of perseverance . When he retired from his office , he devoted himself to his family and worked as an ordinary farmer on his farm in Mount Vernon . He has reached the state which ancient Chinese sages summarized in the words : " To own the whole empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I admire him for his bravery and self-confidence . At the same time I love the Chinese melody " High Mountains and Flowing Rivers . " In my pursuit for the ultimate meaning of life and for academic ideals , I believe I will find some perceptive minds who will be keenly appreciative of my talent at he homeland of George Washington on the other side of the Pacific Ocean .

When in doubt , dress somewhat more formally than you think would be expected for the job . Be conservative and be detail oriented ( polished shoes , neat hair , non-overpowering cologne or perfume etc . ) First impressions are very important . <p> Poor non-verbal communication - In addition to what you are saying , your non-verbal behavior is very important in an interview . Are you making eye contact ? Are you listening intently when the interviewer is speaking ? Are you giving a firm handshake when you greeted by the interviewer(s) . Are you fidgeting during the interview ? Practice with a friend or in front of a mirror to assess these factors . <p> Poor attitude - Overbearing or self-centered behavior ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very poorly received by interviewers . Ask yourself what can you contribute to the company . What skills and experience would you bring to the job ? <p> Failure to ask questions - Employers will assess your interest in the company and the position by the types of questions you ask .

@@42231636 @2231636/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Automatic Control <p> For twofold reasons I am sincerely grateful to my father who is also my mentor . First , it was he who distilled in me the impulse to adore those who can achieve success from apparently impossible situations . When I was plunged into great despondency for failing to gain admission into the nations most prestigious university at the college entrance examination , my father told the story about how General Wellington who , driven into a mountain cave , drew inspirations from a spider which was patching up its web and re-organized his troops to defeat Napoleon . My father made me convinced that I could be a successful person in my own right . <p> Second , I owe my heartfelt gratitude to my father for the academic interest that he cultivated in me . An electrical engineer himself in the field of industrial control , my father influenced me by encouraging my childhood interest in electricity . Unlike many other parents who simply buy their children electric toys and leave them playing with those toys , my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained the inner workings that produced the sounds and the movements of those toys . As I grew up , he continued his enlightenment of me with his regular " professional lectures " concerning the more sophisticated electrical appliances in our daily environment . His education persisted until I chose to major in electrical engineering during my undergraduate program and came to regard it as a lifelong career objective to which I would dedicate all my intelligence and energy . From the undergraduate education I received at the Information Science and Engineering Department of Shenyang Institute of Technology , I derived useful knowledge from a wide variety of foundational courses in industrial engineering that included Analogical Electronic Circuits , Digital Electronic Circuits , Principles of Microcomputer , Electrical Power and Electronics , Single-Chip Microcomputer . In those courses , I achieved full marks or the highest scores in the entire grade . <p> My theoretical understanding of automatic control came with my studies of classical control theories embodied in such courses as Theory of Modern Control , Theory of Automatic Control , Procedure Control , and Computer Control . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and some methods of system design . With those understandings , I tried my own hands at designing and experimenting with a closed-loop feedback system . However , as I delved deeper into my studies , I came to discover that the classical feedback-based control theories could no longer meet the requirements posed by modern large-scale and complicated systems . Their challenges could only be answered by some database-based , intelligence-oriented theories . Therefore , I purposely self-studied some courses exclusively offered to graduate studentsArtificial Intelligence , Neural Network , Self-Adaptive Control , etc . Although the theories incorporated in those courses could by no means work out all the problems in modern control , their effectiveness in improving production efficiency made me all the more determined to devote myself to the studies in control theories . <p> Various forms of control theory depend heavily on computing tools as represented by mathematics . Without exaggeration , I can say that both mathematics and computer application are precisely the subjects in which I excel . On account of my distinguished mathematical talents , I represented my institute to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I proposed an optimum solution to a steel procurement and transportation plan . In this contest , I won third prize in the whole Liaoning Province . In addition , I self-studied a number of advanced courses like Fuzzy Mathematics and Discrete Mathematics which further widened my horizon and called my attention to the possible trends of automatic control in the future . One of the most important achievements in my undergraduate program is that I spent one year and half doing coursework in the computer specialty as a subsidiary program in order to develop my comprehensive abilities and to improve my computer skills . In those compulsory core courses that are generally acknowledged to be fairly difficult even for computer majors , I achieved the highest scores in my class in Data Structure and Operating Systems . By undergoing systematic trainings , I have become quite familiar with computer hardware structure , working principles , and software programming debugging . I have also made independent efforts in program development by means of VB , VC , Foxpro and Delphi . <p> While attentive to studies in control theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories to practical problem-solving processes because all theories must be put to the test of practices . Since the very beginning of my undergraduate program , I have closely followed the leading international and domestic academic journals in the field of automatic control and the important research papers published in those journals . As a sophomore , I started to help my father with some of his design projects . In the control system that he designed for a cement mixer , I introduced a programmed single-chip computerized controller which , after debugging , was put into application and received very positive comments from the user . For my graduation project , I designed The Automatic Monitoring System for Detecting the Temperature and Humidity of a Tobacco Plant . With the help of a PC and a single-chip microcomputer , I designed a 3-phase system in connection with the **26;1127;TOOLONG system . Demonstrating obvious practical values , the system can conduct automatic monitoring of the environmental parameters in the four workshops of the tobacco plant .

Even when there is a limited number of " advanced " systems , they are mere copies of foreign models that are on the point of being outmoded by international standards . This indicates how China lags behind international levels of advanced technology . As we all know , the most important factors in automation are system modeling and analysis . It is essential to ensure , through analysis , the stability and optimum effect of the system even when there are many uncertainties . In this regard , we need cutting-edge technology and mature theories .

The Automatic Control Specialty in the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering covers a wide range of programs in Artificial Intelligence , Neural Network , Robotics , the Modeling and Analysis of Large-Scale Dynamic Systems , etc . The application of those important fields of knowledge will ultimately produce important impacts on the technological advances in automation and control . Those fields are also the areas in which I am very interested . I would like to apply for a Ph.D . program in automatic control . As a matter of fact , Purdue University is also the university from which Chinas leading scientist Deng Jiaxian graduated . That is why it attracts me so much . A Chinese proverb says , " If you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision . " I believe this axiom applies to my case perfectly . By " the most commanding height " , I mean that an education at Purdue University will endow me with the most advanced theories and expertise in my chosen field .

European people attempted at any cost to acquire the technology of porcelain making and at last achieved the satisfaction of this goal from a priest named Francois-Xavier DEntrecolles , thus the present variety and brilliance of chinaware in both China and the West . Nevertheless , in an era of electronics and information today , China has fell far behind the advanced countries in the field of information materials science and engineering , in its research and application as well . As a graduate majored in physics and technology of electronic thin films , I am eager to trace the footprints of Francois-Xavier DEntrecolles so as to bring the advanced technology of material engineering to China by means of studying in your prestigious university for Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dream of being a useful scholar to my motherland . <p> University of XX is a world-famous university and especially well-known for her intellectual strength in the area of material engineering with her irresistible magnetic power pulling excellent students from all over the world to her . Therefore I justify clear realization of the sharp competition I am confronted with . But with a fine background of education in specialty , a firm foundation in theoretical study , the practical skill in experiment , and the cultured ability to engage myself in independent research work , I have the confidence to meet the challenge from other rival applicants . <p> In University of XX of China , which enrolls brilliant students from various areas in China with her strength in the area of material science , I accomplished my undergraduate study in the specialty of magnetic materials and components and my graduate study in physics and technology of electronic thin films , in the period of which I kept to be the top student in my class and was awarded the school fellowship every year . I was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Benefiting from the strict training in my university , I gained fair acquaintance with the knowledge and theories in my specialty . Meanwhile , I read various journals and magazines at home and abroad , following the footsteps of the development of new theories and technology . I tried my best to participate in possible experimental work and research work , cultivate my skills in the use , maintenance , and modification of vacuum-evaporation equipment and pulse-laser- deposition equipment , and attend academic workshops and symposiums . The modulation rate of the BST voltage controlled thin film variable capacitor I produced reaches the level of 80% , approximate to the highest level in record so far . <p> My achievement was highly appreciated by relevant scholars and specialists and I have been invited to participate in various programs experiments . As a result of my persistent effort , I have published " BST Voltage Controlled Microwave Electronic Components " and " STO Pulse-Laser-Deposition Growth of Thin Film " respectively on such kernel academic journals as XX in China , the former article being praised by relevant specialists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on BST thin film in China . " Based upon the confidence of my theoretical background and research capacity , I chose the topic " Production of High-frequency Composite " for my Bachelors thesis . On the basis of extensive collection and absorbing of the recent information on magnetic materials and components , I decided to do my research on the project of compounding Co2Z material by applying Y2O3 and Sr2+ and adopting pre-processing technology , in addition to the control of working procedure and temperature point . In consequence , the improvement of magnetic property of the material . In the oral defense of my thesis , the present specialists concluded that the research , measuring high academic significance , was novel in topic selection , logical in argument , and creative in idea . My Bachelors thesis was chosen as " Excellent Thesis " of the university through critical assessment . <p> At present , I am busy with my Masters thesis " Au/BST/YBCO Ferro-electro Thin Film Voltage Controlled Components .

This achievement is at forefront in China at present . <p> During this period of study and research , I have deeply felt that my country falls far behind the advanced countries in the area of materials science and an intense need to study the advanced theories and technology in the fullest enforced academic institute . Thus I select University of XX where I believe I can realize my dream . In addition to the unparalleled strength in the area of materials science and technology , University of XX boasts the international background with scholars and students from different regions all over the world , the congenial atmosphere of academic research , and the systematic cultivation of creativity in her students .

@@42231641 @2231641/ <p> At the age of 19 , millions of Chinese high school students would be battling for college admissions through a fiercely competitive nationwide entrance examination . Because of the competitiveness of the examination , half of the participants would be eliminated . In sharp contrast , by the time when I am 19 years old next year , I will graduate from one of the best universities in China . As my parents told me , I achieved a score of 190 points in an IQ test at the age of 2 , which was indicative of the potential of a child prodigy . Recognizing and encouraging my special talents , my parents sent me into a special experimental class in a middle school when I was just nine . Throughout my middle and high schools , I maintained outstanding scholastic performance , winning two special prizes at the provincial-level mathematics contests . In 1999 , my special aptitudes qualified me as an undergraduate at the Institute of Computer Science and Information , Hunan University . That year , I was merely 15 years old . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of broad professional knowledge in which my yearning for acquiring in-depth knowledge could be satiated . I chose to specialize in computer science and information because it is a subject that poses high demands on a students ability in mathematics and in logical reasoning , the two areas in which I excel . My love for mathematics , plus my special talents , has enabled me to pass all the core courses in my specialty with much facility . My deep interest in mathematics has also led me to undertake some independent studies in many important courses . Therefore , besides doing excellent coursework , I have allowed my interest to come into full play . <p> In studying each course , I have tried to grasp its essence . For example , in learning Computational Theory , I started with the turning machine and Von Neumann Model , which made me marvel at the logical cogency embodied in those theories . However , as I delved deeper into my studies , I came to realize their inherent flaw of mechanical nature behind their logical cogency . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial intelligence , conventional theories have become infused with new vitality . I came to be interested in AI and through my study of nerve network and knowledge engineering in AI , I realized the superiority of biological intelligence in terms of logical computation over the conventional computation method based on physical circuits . What was even more exciting was that we could exploit this advantage for our own purpose through simulation based on the conventional physical circuitsthe realization of artificial intelligence ! In this way , we can make full use of the intelligence evolved in nature over the past billions of years . This understanding that I developed greatly stimulated my enthusiasm in studying AI and the relevant subject in biology . <p> Such a process replete with the joy of discovery also characterized my learning of many other important courses . For instance , in learning the course Digital Device Designing , I introduced some modification and improvements into an encoding algorithmDes . My good scholastic foundation and my tremendous enthusiasm in coursework led to increasingly satisfactory results in my academic performance . A close examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties adapting to the new academic environment in the first year ( considering the fact that I was just 15 ) , I have been achieving top scores in virtually all the core courses in my grade . <p> Nevertheless , classroom education has only constituted a part of my overall education . For those courses that especially fascinate me , I have resorted to self-education as a means of increasing my knowledge both in breadth and in width . In learning " Group Theory " in Discrete Mathematics , I used the textbook Abstract Algebra that is used by students of mathematics major and read some books written by Western authors in English . In this way , I have gained a close understanding of the underlying theoretical foundation of this course in addition to becoming familiarized with its fundamental principles of application . In the course of my self-education , I have endeavored to gain knowledge not merely through ( text ) books . I have also attempted to obtain valuable guidance from leading experts both at home and abroad through the Internet . For example , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an engineer from the Bell Laboratory and through our constant exchanges he has provided me with much professional instruction and help in my specialty . <p> I am a person who likes to meet challenges . In order to train myself in a comprehensive manner , I took part in all the talent contests that were available to me . For instance , I participated in the Grand Contest of Mathematical Modeling for College Students Nationwide and the Mathematical Modeling Contest of American Students . In the first contest , my task was to solve problems in angiogram . Based on my research experience in this contest , I have written a treatise . In the second contest , I received Honorable Mention . Especially worth mentioning is that in the process of modeling I conducted some relatively thorough study of a problem of deciphering genetic codes . In searching for a solution to this problem , I came to realize the tremendous practical value of Bioinformatics and its huge potential of development . This constitutes the primary motivation of my choosing Bioinformatics as the specialty in my prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attention to approximately a dozen of prizes that I won in various contests including the First Prize for the National English Contest for College Students and many honors I received such as one of the Ten Most Distinguished College Students of Hunan Province . <p> In order to apply the knowledge I have learned to realistic situations and to enhance my problem-solving skills , I participated in a research project launched by the Modern Distance Learning Technology Standard Committee of Chinas Ministry of Education . In this project , I was made responsible for Task 13 &amp; 14the construction of mathematical models . In undertaking those two tasks , I introduced the project response theory in Bioinformatics which helped solve the problem of framing modeling standards . I have completed two research papers based on my findings in this project , one of which is entitled The Fuzzy Nerve Network for Task Model and Task Application . These two papers have been submitted to an academic journal and are expected to be published soon . I have several experiences similar to this one ( please refer to my Resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs , I have been exposed to many aspects of Bioinformatics while learning computation theories and artificial intelligence . This exposure has permitted me to become aware of the close relationship between computer and biology . In addition , I have always been fascinated with biology . Those two factors have prompted me to choose bioinformatics as my area of specialization in the prospective degree program . <p> For four years , I have been following closely the relevant information concerning the leading research institutes in the world in the field of Bioinformatics . To the best of my knowledge , the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics ( BIG ) affiliated to the Division of Health Sciences and Technology ( HST ) jointly launched by Harvard and MIT conducts research that is of leading standard in the world . As two top-ranking universities in the world , Harvard and MIT are the two sacred palaces of science that every student committed to a life of science naturally yearns to enter . In order to gain admission into such a sacred palace to develop myself into a well-trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for applying for an advanced degree program in BIG and have tried consciously to improve myself in various aspects so that I can meet those challenging requirements .

@@42231645 @2231645/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> How and When Do I Apply to Law School <p> n order to apply to law school , you need to take an exam and have your transcripts and pertinent college records forwarded to each school that you will apply to . This process is basically done for you by the LSAC , the Law School Admissions Council , a non-profit organization headquartered in Newtown , New Jersey . The LSACs members consist of all of the law schools in the United States ( 187 ) and Canada ( 15 ) . <p> The LSAC creates , administers , and scores the Law School Admissions Test , or LSAT . The test is given four times a year : in June , October , December , and February . Test dates are set at least two years in advance ; you can look up the dates for upcoming tests at the LSAC web site , www.lsac.org . <p> The LSAC sends your LSAT test score to all of the law schools to which you have chosen to apply . In addition , the LSAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see about you . This service is called the LSDAS , the Law School Data Assembly Service . Its really more of a service to the law schools than to you , the applicant . The LSDAS process is not optional , as virtually all law schools require you to use it . The law schools like the service because it presents applicant information to them in a uniform manner , from one source . <p> The way it works is this : You sign up for the LSDAS service and pay the required fee . You can sign up at the same time you register for the LSAT , or later , but at some point you have to do it . Then you send them your transcripts and any other required information . Next , the LSDAS prepares a report on you . It includes their own calculation of your GPA , how your GPA compares to other SCSU graduates , a list of colleges you attended , photocopies of all of your college transcripts , etc . Essentially the LSDAS service puts together the data package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is also a separate service offered by the LSAC , the Letter of Recommendation Service . The same folks who compile your college data will also collect , photocopy , and distribute your letters of recommendation . This is a very popular service , and easy to use . It is good for general letters , and can now be used for school-specific ones . <p> All of these services are bundled together and remain good for 5 years . Thus , once you sign up for the LSAT exam , the LSDAS data service , and the Letter of Recommendation Service , your registration in all of them lasts for 5 years . This is particularly nice if you do not plan to go to law school right awayeverything sits waiting for you until you tell the LSAC where you want your file to be sent . <p> The process of applying to law school has become much more streamlined and electronic in the last 5 years . You can expect this trend to continue . All ABA-approved law schools now have their applications on-line ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use their on-line application process . You can register for all of the LSAC services on-line , too , and pay the fees with a credit card . Almost 90% of applicants are now using the Letter Service , too . Currently , the service stores up to 4 letters for you . <p> The LSAC offers one-stop shopping for applications . Once you sign up for the LSDAS service , you will have access to all of the law schools ' applications online . You can select the ones you want , fill them out , and send them to the law schools electronically . In fact , some schools today require you to submit your application and supporting materials this way . <p> The only thing that will NOT be electronic anytime soon is the LSAT exam . This will continue to be a pencil and paper examination scored by computer . Other testing organizations have experimented with on-line testing , with decidedly mixed results . For this reason , the LSAT will continue to be given and taken in person . The test changes periodically ; LSAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component to it . For changes to the test , consult the lsac.org web site or your pre-law advisor . <h> FAQs : <p> Do I need to send LSDAS a transcript from every school I attended , including the Community College where I took just one class over the summer ? <p> Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Any college credit you earned must be reported to the LSDAS . You need to send transcripts from all undergraduate institutionsno exceptions ! Failure to inform the LSDAS of all of you institutions is considered academic fraud ; in fact , it is the most common type of academic fraud . The LSDAS calculates your GPA based on all of your grades . If you leave out a few grades , your GPA calculation will be incorrect . If you attended college 20 years ago and flunked out , and today are a stellar straight-A student , you still must report all of your grades . The law school will receive your transcripts and will know what happened , or you can choose to explain your old low grades in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools will understand this situationit is common . What they will not understand or accept is someone who tries to hide ( or forgets to report ) certain grades . You must report all institutions you attended and provide the transcripts from each of them . <p> Why does the LSDAS calculate a GPA for me , and what can I do about it ? <p> Remember , this service is mainly for the law schools . They want one source , and only one source , providing a GPA . Your college GPA is also reported as it appears on your transcripts . But the LSDAS GPA is considered somewhat more accurate because it incorporates all of the grades you received at all of the colleges you attended ( including community colleges ) into one score , and it uses the same formula for everyone . There is basically nothing you can do to get out of this system or change their calculation of your GPA . You can appeal if you feel the calculation was inaccurate , but appeals are rarely successful . If you think your GPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can include an explanation in your application materials . <p> Are school-specific letters better ? <p> Yes and no . Letters of recommendation are down on the list of important admissions factors , after the LSAT score , GPA , and personal statement . They are usually used in close calls , or to differentiate folks in the " middle of the pack . " If you have someone who knows you well who can personalize your letter ( like an alum from the particular law school ) , that 's great . Send his or her letter separately to that law school . If you simply want to change the heading on each letter to reflect the name of another school , it is not really necessary to do so , and the general or generic letter will do . These letters are n't  really personalized , after all . A truly personal letter is one tailored to a particular school for a particular reason . Most of your letters will not be of this type , but if you have one , then use it . Remember to waive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters are considered much more credible . For more information , see the section of this CD on letters of recommendation . <p> What if I think my LSAT score is wrong , or if I need to explain a low score ? <p> You can request that your exam be re-scored by the LSAC . If your score is low , you may need to explain why in a separate statement included with your application . Generally it is better to do this in a separate statement , rather than in your personal statement . 
@@42231646 @2231646/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Economic Law <p> It was totally unexpected that a traffic accident that occurred to me changed the entire course of my life . In an early summer morning in 1994 , I , then busily involved in preparing for high school entrance examination , was knocked down from behind by a taxi on my way to school . I was seriously injured and instantly lost consciousness . The following year saw me receiving medical treatment and during this seemingly interminable period of therapy I not only had to endure the tremendous physical agonies and the miseries of suspending my normal education but also had to experience , as victim of the accident , the difficulties and helplessness of instituting legal procedures against the accident-causing taxi-driver . The imperfections of Chinas legal system made the claims difficult to materialize . Ultimately I should be grateful to the lawyer who represented me in the case . It was he who , with his professional expertise , protected my legitimate rights . This experience exposed me to the usefulness of law , which in turn ignited my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeking to ride the tide of the times in an era of reforms and opening-up , I chose International Economic Law as my major . Growing up in ShenZhen , Chinas first special economic zone , I witnessed how this former fishing village became an international metropolis in China with the most vibrant economy and modern atmosphere . I grew to be particularly interested in all the laws related to economy . Therefore , when I entered college , without any hesitation I chose to specialize in International Economic Law . Out of my interest in and love for economic law , I devoted myself to the reading of many erudite legal works which helped me establish a solid theoretical foundation . On the other hand , all the courses in my specialty exposed me to a wide variety of in-depth knowledge . Law of Corporation , International Investment Law , International Trade Law and WTO Law are some of the courses that fascinated me most . My studies of those laws allowed me to appreciate the comprehensive and well-developed legal systems in the United States and in other advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in the economic field , appears to be woefully underdeveloped . This comparative gap has all the more aroused a sense of urgency on my part to seek academic excellence so that when the day comes for me to make my own contributions I might be better equipped to offer my knowledge and talents . In the course of the four-year undergraduate studies , I have stayed among the top 5% students in my class of 68 undergraduates and my overall GPA and my specialty-related GPA have reached 3.4 and 3.6 respectively . My numerous scholarships and honors also attested to my excellence and academic achievements . <p> But the real benefit I have achieved in the university is not awards and honors , but a much-broadened vision . I am clearly aware that , as a student of law , it is imperative for me to be closely connected to the world of reality , as law is a discipline that requires practical application and we are bound to become the shapers of future society . Guided by this understanding , I took every chance to go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have always served as one of the ministers of the Universitys Students Union and this position has trained me to work with greater determination , greater enthusiasm and more methodically . As I myself have undergone special experiences of helplessness and personal difficulties , I actively participated in the activities of Mutual Welfare Association and Tutor Group . My hope is that by those activities I may benefit the society of which I am a part , and show concern for the weak and the needy . In addition , my participation in the speech contests organized by College Debating Team significantly improved my oral expressiveness and instant logical reasoning ability . I know that I will benefit from those experiences for a long time to come . <p> My professional strengths , however , go way beyond my excellent academic records . Every summer vacation became the best opportunity for me to undertake internships to improve myself . I was lucky to have come under the guidance of three important " mentors " , three lawyers who specialized in criminal lawsuits , civil lawsuits and real estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The more I practiced , the more I felt that the tremendous gap between the American laws and the Chinese laws is impossible to be abridged within a short time . Chinas political and social system is very different from Western countries . China , as a new WTO member , has just started changing from planned economy to market economy . Naturally , it is unrealistic for western countries to require Chinese government to abide by strictly western regulations represented by market economy . Thus for China , to construct a legal framework in strict accordance with WTO regulations has become the most urgent problem . The precondition for meeting this challenge is to redefine the government-market relationship so as to allow Chinese companies to withstand the tests of international economy in the absence of traditional governmental protection and to expand themselves by taking advantage of the huge international market . Chinas Economic Law , which fulfills part of Constitutional functions , will make a unique contribution if it can redefine the relationship . It will create the flowering of economic legislation . For Chinas legal system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in the field of protecting the intellectual property rights . Moreover , Chinas accession into the WTO means that China will face more international trade disputes . China is rather backward in the legislation concerning the dispute-solving mechanism , a fact which has resulted in the unfair treatment against Chinese companies by Western countries in the name of " anti-dumping " . This situation calls for the emergence of a number of legal professionals who have a profound knowledge both of English language , international economic law , the actual conditions in China , the mode of operation of international laws and legal systems . <p> Under such circumstances , in order for China to adapt its legal system and some of its social practices to the conventions of the international community , it is imperative that we learn from and borrow from the legal system and legal ideology of the United States , the country with the best developed legal system , as well as other developed western countries . Therefore , I am eager to undertake a degree program of Doctor in Jurisprudence in a prestigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China with such a quality education . Although it is no easy job for a girl like me to leave my home to pursue the rather challenging JD program , I have full confidence to overcome all sorts of difficulties . I had already learned to be independent and self-reliant as a little girl because both my father and my mother left for Hong Kong when I was very young , leaving me on the mainland . As a teenager , I had to take care of myself , doing all the house work besides keeping up with my studies . I used to cry a lot but soon I drew inspirations from the example of Mrs. Thatcher , the former British prime minister . In this way , I have developed a strong self-motivation in whatever I do and the determination to do it well . I believe that those important personal qualities will contribute to my making major achievements in my future career . <p> The faculty of the Law School of your prestigious university ranks as top 15th among all the American laws schools and ranks top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by your law school is diversified and rationally organized . Law of Corporation and Law of Intellectual Property fall within the range of my interest , for the current research in China lags far behind the advanced international level . In addition , I very much appreciate the opportunities of practice that are offered in the form of externships and internships by your school . Those fascinating features have made me all the more determined to seek a quality education at your school because I believe that in such an advantageous academic environment , based on my industry and talents , I am bound to make some important achievements in my prospective degree program . I can also envision a successful career in China after completing my degree program . My area of interest will be foreign trade law and international economic law . By providing professional legal consultations to Chinese businesses and studying specifically Chinese legal issues in international business , I will be able to apply the knowledge that I acquire from the United States to the practical problems in China . <p> The foregoing statement represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice her comfortable yet mediocre life in her native country in favor of challenges and the attainment of new objectives .

The application of electric system plays a very important role not only in national production , but also in people 's lives and other aspects . But it is true that our domestic core technology and equipment in this field have long relied on the import .

@@42231653 @2231653/ <p> Most of what people " know " about the world , as suggested by Americas early journalistic commentator Walter Lippman , comes not so much from personal experience as through mass media . Clearly , we live in a world that is saturated with images created by the media and our understanding of this world can only be relatively true , or can infinitely approach the truth , but can never be equated with the truth itself . In a certain sense , the media shapes our perceptions about the world . Therefore , once furnished with the power of mass media , we are furnished with a decisive edge in challenging the society . These ideas have promoted me to deeply appreciate the active role of media in terms of constructing a virtual world , and evoked my interest in theories of communication . Through years of rewarding study and work , this appreciation and interest have grown into a conviction that the construction of a wise , exuberant and responsible media will be my life-long devotion . <p> My academic research on mass media set sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , I made a comparative study concerning the reports on the Kosovo War by CNN World News and CCTV the similarities and dissimilarities of the programs and styles in addressing the same topic . This comparison was then echoed by a demonstration of the audiences different attitudes towards the same war under the influence of different media . Correspondingly , I drew a conclusion that the attitude of the government is an insurmountable gulf fixed in front of the media , and suggested that in order to build a favorable image of the government , the official media should achieve its end by effective combination of true information rather than evading sensitive and hot issues . <p> This conclusion has again and again been confirmed during my three-year dedicated work in the News Center of CCTV . Today in a time of numerous means of communication , it is impossible to evade or wall up any information . To do so is only to impair the credibility of the official media and deprive it of public adherence to what they advocate . Any government that intends to win public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicize these stands , and guide the public opinion through professional media strategies that are likely to be accepted by the audience . This is in the reformation of Chinas news system an urgent undertaking that we should spare no effort to accomplish . <p> My experience in CCTV , the largest and most authoritative TV station in China has armed me with substantial knowledge and skills to contribute to this undertaking . I witnessed the whole process of TV news reformation in China and made my way through from a journalist and editor to a director and editor-in-chief . From living broadcast of significant events to painstaking editing of informative news , news magazines and special editions , I engaged myself in making all kinds of TV programs , which covered almost all aspects of Chinas reformation and development , among them the reformation of the public sector , the entry into the WTO , the bid for the 2008 Olympics , and the National Peoples Congress and People 's Political Consultative Conference every year . Furthermore , the cultural programs I made as a director of CCTV Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary China , which allowed me to develop keen enthusiasm in the studies of media culture , cross cultures communication and international communication . With these , I achieved a transition from practical work to theoretical studies and a shift from microcosmic operation to macrocosmic judgment . Because the editors are directly involved in the making of programs with the ultimate audience in mind , I kept examining my work and the relationship between media , media environment and the audience , with a vision of the whole program , even the whole media . Consequently , how to take full advantages of the media in China has become a question I am frequently concerned with , which is out of the reach of specific and microcosmic operations like news reports and program making . <p> Nowadays , emerging communication technologies are accelerating transformations in the mass society , while the impact of mass media on individuals , society and culture is increasingly prominent . Yet , compared with the situation in the west , the mass media industry in China is still fettered by too many problems . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the industry can be guided by the most recent theoretical achievements are pressing tasks calling for solutions . On the other hand , in a context of media globalization , excessive information of foreign cultures in the media presentation of the world may result in a social crisis of cultural identity . The exploration of favorable ways of opening up the Chinese media , or the market-oriented reformation of the Chinese media , requires due attention . A mastery of the up-to-date theoretic achievements in the field of world news communication is for sure to be helpful in solving the problems that Chinas media is facing or is to face . <p> Therefore , I hope to pursue a further education in the U.S. , which boasts the most advanced media research worldwide . My main research interest is the impact of media and communication . More specifically , I would like to focus on the intercultural studies in mass communication . It is undeniable that media produce significant impact on the recipients cultural identification . Many countries in the world are confronted with the crisis of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media in those countries tend to present an overwhelming amount of foreign culture at the expense of their national culture , causing the recipients to regard foreign culture and values unconsciously as a standard against which to measure their national cultural values . This problem is especially serious for developing countries under the general framework of media globalization . How to evaluate both the positive and the negative impacts of foreign cultural influences and to strike a mutually reciprocal balance and reconciliation between indigenous and imported cultures will be a fascinating issue for research . <p> Another issue related to intercultural studies in mass communication that interests me is exploring possible ways of opening the domestic media market of developing countries , especially a country like China , to international media giants and foreign capital . Although the commercialization of Chinas media does not represent the entirety of Chinas media reform , it nevertheless constitutes an important part of the reform . China has the greatest media market in the world but for a long time in the past all media in China have been put under the authoritarian ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WTO , there have been countless outcries for the elimination of government control over media . It is inevitable that international capital would flow into Chinas media market . The United States National Geography Channel and Discovery Channel have already been introduced into China . Given the historical and ideological background of Chinese society , it will be a very delicate issue how to react to the encroachment of international media and international capital . With respect to their international counterparts , should Chinese media simply reject , or compete again , or cooperate ? What are some of the feasible modes of commercial operations ? <p> The United States will provide an ideal academic environment for me since in the U.S. , research of media impact is nearly identical to that of mass media , and remains the interdisciplinary subject of all researches on communication . Moreover , some American institutions have surveyed several times about the impact of mass media on the culture identity , which fits my research interest and purpose perfectly . I aim to get a profound comprehension of the reality and history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to grasp advanced research methods and theories in my concerned field , so that I can overlook the Chinese media industry from a higher perspective , commit myself to its development , and promote Chinas media onto a way leading to wisdom , exuberance and responsibility .

@@42231659 @2231659/ 9336 @qwx419336 <h> LSAT Test <h> LSAT Reading Comprehension <p> The LSAT Reading Comprehension measures your ability to read , analyze , and evaluate a written passage so at to consolidate critical information from the text . <p> Below is a sample reading passage for LSAT : <p> Coral reefs are one of the most fragile , biologically complex , and diverse marine ecosystem on Earth . This ecosystem is one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere : how do clear , and thus nutrient-poor , waters support such prolific and productive communities ? Part of the answer lies within the tissues of the corals themselves . <p> Symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanthellae carry out photosynthesis using the metabolic wastes of the coral thereby producing food for themselves , for their corals , hosts , and even for other members of the reef community . This symbiotic process allows organisms in the reef community to use sparse nutrient resources efficiently . Unfortunately for coral reefs , however , a variety of human activities are causing worldwide degradation of shallow marine habitats by adding nutrients to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal and manufacturing that creates waste by-products all increase nutrient loads in these waters . Typical symptoms of reef decline are destabilized herbivore populations and an increasing abundance of algae and filter-feeding animals . <p> Declines in reef communities are consistent with observations that nutrient input is increasing in direct proportion to growing human populations , thereby threatening reef communities sensitive to subtle changes in nutrient input to their waters . <p> And below are sample questions following the reading passage : <p> 1 . The passage is primarily concerned with ( A ) describing the effects of human activities on algae in coral reefs ( B ) explaining how human activities are posing a threat to coral reef communities ( C ) discussing the process by which coral reefs deteriorate in nutrient-poor waters ( D ) explaining how coral reefs produce food for themselves ( E ) describing the abundance of algae and filter-feeding animals in coral reef areas <p> 2 . The passage suggests which of the following about coral reef communities ? ( A ) Coral reef communities may actually be more likely to thrive in waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nutrients on which coral reef communities thrive are only found in shallow waters . ( C ) Human population growth has led to changing ocean temperatures , which threatens coral reef communities . ( D ) The growth of coral reef communities tends to destabilize underwater herbivore populations . ( E ) Coral reef communities are more complex and diverse than most ecosystems located on dry land . <p> 3 . The author refers to " filter-feeding animals " ( line 20 ) in order to ( A ) provide an example of a characteristic sign of reef deterioration ( B ) explain how reef communities acquire sustenance for survival ( C ) identify a factor that helps herbivore populations thrive ( D ) indicate a cause of decreasing nutrient input in waters that reefs inhabit ( E ) identify members of coral reef communities that rely on coral reefs for nutrients <p> 4 . According to the passage , which of the following is a factor that is threatening the survival of coral reef communities ? ( A ) The waters they inhabit contain few nutrient resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae ( C ) The degraded waters of their marine habitats have reduced their ability to carry out photosynthesis ( D ) They are too biologically complex to survive in habitats with minimal nutrient input . ( E ) Waste by-products result in an increase in nutrient input to reef communities . <p> 5 . It can be inferred from the passage that the author describes coral reef communities as paradoxical most likely for which of the following reasons ? ( A ) They are thriving even though human activities have depleted the nutrients in their environment . ( B ) They are able to survive in spite of an overabundance of algae inhabiting their waters . ( C ) They are able to survive in an environment with limited food resources . ( D ) Their metabolic wastes contribute to the degradation of the waters that they inhabit . ( E ) They are declining even when the water surrounding them remains clear . <p> Answers with Explanation : <p> 1 . This question asks you to identify the primary concerns of the passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral reefs survive in nutrient-poor waters . The second paragraph states that human activities are adding nutrients to shallow marine habitats , thus threatening the survival of coral reef communities . Choices A and E can be eliminated because an increase in algae and filter-feeding animals is mentioned in the context of the passages larger concern with the negative effects of human activities on coral reefs . Choice C is incorrect because the first paragraph of the passage explains how coral reefs survive in nutrient-poor waters ; the deterioration of coral reef communities has occurred as a result of the increase in nutrients in their habitats . Choice D can be eliminated because the first paragraph states that symbiotic cells of algae known as zooxanethellae produce food for coral reef communities . <p> 2 . This question asks you to identify what the passage suggests about coral reef communities . The best answer is A. The first paragraph of the passage describes how coral reef communities have survived in nutrient-poor waters . Lines 21-22 go on to state that recent " Declines in reef communities are consistent wit observations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reefs . Thus , the passage suggests that coral reef communities are more likely to survive in nutrient-poor waters . Both B and C can be eliminated because the passage does not state that human population growth has led to changing ocean temperature , nor does it state that the nutrients on which coral reef communities thrive are found only in shallow waters . Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that destabilized herbivore populations are a symptom of the decline of coral reef communities rather than a result of the growth of coral reef communities . Choice E can also be eliminated because the first sentence of the passage states that coral reefs " are one of the most fragile , biologically complex , and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth " ; it does not , however , discuss the complexity of coral reefs communities in the context of ecosystems on dry land . <p> 3 . This question asks you to identify the purpose of the authors reference to filter-feeding animals . The best answer is A. In the second paragraph , the author asserts than human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing reef decline . In lines 18-20 , the author identifies " an increasing abundance of filter-feeding animals " as a typical symptom of this decline . Choice B can be eliminated because the way in which reef communities acquire sustenance for survival is described in the first paragraph of the passage , prior to the authors reference to filter-feeding animals . Choice C is not the correct answer because filter-feeding animals are not identified as a factor that helps herbivore populations survive ; in fact , destabilized herbivore populations and an increase in filter-feeding animals are signs of coral reef decline . Choice D can be eliminated because the passage indicates that an increase in filter-feeding animals is a symptom of coral reef decline that is brought about by an increase in nutrient input in coral reef habitats , not a decrease in nutrient input . Choice E can be eliminated also because the passage does not mention filter-feeding animals in order to identify coral reef community members that rely on coral reefs for sustenance . <p> 4 . This question asks you to identify a factor , mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral reef communities . The best answer is E. In lines 16-18 , the author indicates that waste by-products created by manufacturing increase the nutrient input in coral reef habitats . In lines 21-25 , the author states that the increase in nutrient input is threatening the coral reef communities . Choice A can be eliminated because the first paragraph of the passage indicates that coral reef communities have thrived in nutrient-poor waters . Choice B can be eliminated because the second paragraph of the passage indicates that there has been an increase in the nutrient input in their habits , not a decline . Choice C is not the correct answer . Although the passage does indicate that the waters of coral reefs marine habitats have become degraded , the passage does not state that this degradation reduces the ability of coral reef communities to carry out photosynthesis . Choice D is incorrect because the passage does indicate that coral reef communities are complex , but it also states that they have been able to thrive in nutrient-poor waters . <p> 5 . To answer this question , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference about why the author labels coral reef communities as paradoxical . The bet answer is C. In line 3 , the author calls coral reefs " one of the fascinating paradoxes of the biosphere . " The author goes on to explain the nature of this paradox : the " prolific and productive " coral reef communities survive in nutrient-poor waters . Choice A contradicts information presented in the passage . The second paragraph indicates that human activities have increased , not decreased , the nutrients in coral reef communities waters , and that this increase has threatened the survival of such communities . Choice B does not present a reason why the author describes coral reef communities as paradoxical . In addition , lines 18-20 of the passage indicate that an abundance of algae is a symptom of reef decline , not reef survival . Choice D does not describe a paradox , and it misrepresents information presented in the passage . Lines 7-10 indicate that the metabolic wastes of coral reefs are used by zooxanthellae to carry out photosynthesis , thereby sustaining themselves and the coral reefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lines 2-5 indicate that coral reef communities thrive in " clear , and thus nutrient-poor , waters .

@@42231661 @2231661/ <h> SAT Prep Tips : SAT Tips <p> Tests make up a large percentage of most students ' grades . They also cause a lot of grief because of this fact . Do you want to conquer that nervous grief ? Read on . <p> The Main Things to Remember Before You Dig Into the Material <p> 1 . Give yourself plenty of time . If a test is on Friday and you study for only five minutes on Wednesday all the while knowing that you 'll be really busy on Thursday night , you 're not setting yourself up for success . You need to plan to review a little bit ( ten-fifteen minutes ) Mon. -Wed. nights and then on Thursday night , you should study anywhere from thirty minutes to four or five hours or more , depending on the difficulty and length of the test . For example quiz might take thirty minutes to study for and a final would take longer than that . The main thing is to not rush yourself because studying takes time . <p> 2 . Make sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been doing homework for an hour already and take a ten minute break to clear your head you 'll be much better off than if you just keep on studying . Keep something fun at your desk or workspace and time yourself . Give yourself ten minutes to play with the silly putty or to doodle . When your time is up , go back to work . <p> 3 . Realize when it 's time to stop and go to bed . If you still do n't get trigonometric functions at 1:30 AM , and you 've been studying for four hours already , it 's time to call it quits and get some sleep . When you 're really tired like that , you 'll hit a wall and you 'll know it . My advice is if you can deal with late studying , go for it , but if you ca n't , do n't waste your time . Get some rest and wake up early so you can study when you 're refreshed . <p> General Study Tips <p> 1 . When you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to read messy notes when you 're studying for a test . You should also keep your notes in some kind of order . For example-chapter three notes go here , chapter four notes go there. , etc . This will make things a whole lot easier for you when the test comes up . 2 . Make sure that your workspace is neat and that the area you are in is quiet and non-distracting . If a TV or loud radio is on you will get distracted , so do n't even try it . <p> 3 . Make sure that you have everything you need to study before you leave school . Make a mental checklist of all the things that you need . It 's awfully hard to study with no information . <p> 4 . Before you start really memorizing or working out problems , you 've got to read over your notes , the chapter in your textbook , any worksheets you have had and all other important materials . This will make studying significantly easier . There have been many times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something carefully for the second time . It might take a while to read everything , but the bounty will be plentiful . <p> 5 . When you 're studying for a fact-ridden test like math , after you 've read the material , write up a fact sheet . The purpose for doing this is twofold . First of all , when you write things out , you get more familiar with them and secondly , you can bring it to school and study it all day before the test .

@@42231666 @2231666/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Architectural Design <p> It is once said that architecture is frozen music , and a nice building is a beautiful poem ever composed on the fragrant ground . The artistic glamour and practical applicability make it a perfect combination of both beauty and practicality . In the long history of mankind 's development , pieces of magnificent movements have been constantly composed , and scores of exquisite verses have been written . This is reflected in those marvelous structures as from China 's Great Wall to the Parthenon in ancient Greece , and from the Great Arena in ancient Rome to Egyptian Pyramids . All these breathtaking and soul-stirring wonders , as a token of human civilization , have blended the most magnificent element in the universe with the inexhaustible creative ability of mankind . <p> As a little girl , I was deeply attracted by these architectural wonders shown on books . At that time , I was frequently perplexed by one question -- " How could it be if these wonders were constructed and erected on the horizon bit by bit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I began to try putting up these splendid buildings with my little and delicate hands , using toy bricks as the materials . It was from that time on that my desire to explore the secret of architecture started to sprout . Along with my growing up , the young sapling of architecture keeps growing in my mind , eventually turning into the direction of my pursuit . In 1990 , I was recommended for admission to one of the best departments of architecture in XXX University , thus starting a pilgrimage to the magnificent palace of architectural arts . As far as the five-year study of my undergraduate courses is concerned , I regard it as a process of fundamental education in which architectural theories and approaches to both classical and modern architecture are comprehensively taught . By virtue of my keen interest and diligence in acquiring knowledge , during the five-year studies in the university , I have made excellent achievements in my academic studies as the top four in our grade respecting academic scores . <p> From my point of view , the five-year study is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous and happy spiritual journey as well . I am deeply absorbed in the infinite space for imagination rendered by architecture in the aspects of its structure , form , color and material . No matter what I have learned is about basic cartography , model-making , or understanding the architectural thoughts put forward by both eastern and western masters on architecture through my own practice and experiments , I can always find delight in studies and a passion for creation . In the artistic palace of architecture , I persist in my learning with untiring vigor and take heart 's content to roam in the treasure-house of architectural arts constructed by those respectable predecessors in the field of architecture . Meanwhile , I have also learned to enjoy the joys brought about by architectural designing and put my heart into it through my personal practice . Therefore , by applying my in-depth studying of theories to practice , I have benefited a great deal in my academic studies . <p> Although my remarkable achievements and an excellent graduation dissertation have helped to bring my five-year academic studies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge spurs me on to pursue an advanced and further study for a master 's degree . While doing my M.A. programs , based on my previous solid foundation of professional knowledge , I continued to make a thorough and profound probe into theoretical learning on architecture . During this period of time , I have made a systematic study of the architectural thoughts and ideas advanced by Smith , Foster and Zumthor . Such a systematic theoretical study has thus enabled a tentative and personal viewpoint on architecture to take shape . Along with it also goes my deep interest in the development history of China 's modern architecture , which results in my final decision to take this subject as the orientation of my M.A. dissertation . After in-depth and meticulous investigation and survey on the development history of China 's modern architecture , I have completed my dissertation entitled " XXX " . In this dissertation , I have managed to probe into the impact and influences exerted by the western trend of thoughts in modern architecture 's development on China 's traditional architecture complex , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern architecture . Moreover , the present coexistence state of multi-elements embodied in China 's architectural industry is also analyzed in the last part of my paper . My supervisor spoke highly of my dissertation due to its unique perspective , and my paper also won the honorary title , " The Excellent Dissertation " . Apart from this dissertation , I have also pondered over environment-friendly buildings , and then sorted out my thinking results regarding this problem into a paper which was later published in a domestic periodical " XXXXX " ? <p> Upon my graduation , my supervisor had once invited me to retain to work in the university and continued my research on the same subject . However , I realized that I need more practice and experimental experience , despite the fact that I have a fairly solid foundation on my theoretical training . As far as an architect is concerned , experience is the source of inspiration . Bearing this thought in mind , I began to work for one of the best architectural companies in China . During my two years ' working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of which have been highly appraised . For instance , the scheme of the XXX , in which I have taken part in designing , won the first prize in the Contest of Project Schemes . A large quantity of practice has thus helped to check my architectural ideas . Nevertheless , this has also revealed some weak points existing in China 's present architectural industry considering the aspect of its theories , particularly the lack of necessary guidance by applying theory to practical designing . This insufficiency of theoretical guidance will inevitably result in an artistic height hard for the designed buildings to reach . Such acknowledgment has finally facilitated my thought of pursuing an advanced study abroad . By doing so , I hope I can make a thorough and deeper study of advanced theories and methods of western architecture , thus promoting my design ability to a higher level . <p> One essential inadequacy in China 's current architectural design is that architects tend to be overly occupied with the external shape and structure of a building . They overlook the application of new construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new construction materials . For example , steel structures are beginning to be widely applied on domestic buildings , but few architects have developed a sufficient command of the relevant knowledge in this field , resulting in their relatively low designing level when such steel structures are involved . This is an area that a truly well-trained architect can achieve important breakthroughs . Therefore , I also plan to concentrate my future studies on this area . <p> As I was coming to the bottom line of this personal statement , I could n't help thinking of the little and delicate hands when I was a young girl , together with the scene of my putting up those toy bricks with those little hands . At that time , I must have imagined that , someday in the future , the once clumsy little hands would sure grow stronger and more creative , and would ultimately write the most beautiful architectural poems from the ground .

" Two flaw detectors were diagnosed by professional maintenance worker as " beyond repair " and I was required to repair them . My advisor was too busy to provide me with adequate guidance and the only surviving blueprints proved that they did not actually match with the circuits in those machines . <p> For me , the only way out of this dilemma was to draw up a totally new circuit pattern by examining all the components one by one . In order to prevent the seriously outdated circuit board from incurring any irreversible damages , I did not remove any component from the circuit board in the entire process of re-establishing the circuit pattern . To make matters worse , the signal interferences from different circuit components made my precise determination of the circuit difficult . For nearly a month , I was in a constant state of anxiety . As long as I felt sober enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses in my mind . Over-fatigue resulted in my contraction of serious cerebral ischemia . Nevertheless , my hard efforts paid offthe two detectors were saved and were put into use again . <p> Although this research experience happened outside the field of wireless communication , it nevertheless testifies to my academic dedication . As an undergraduate majoring in measurement technology &amp; instrument at the College of Communication Engineering of XX University , arguably the best university in Northeaster China , I have always regarded the attainment of academic excellence and the improvement of practical abilities as my primary objectives . For the past three years in my rewarding undergraduate program , I have developed a systematic command of specialized knowledge in my major , laying a solid foundation in communication engineering . Communication engineering has a special appeal to me because , by applying proper processing to the collected signals , we can retransmit the signals and in the process exercise control over those signals to produce desired effects . As I like to perform analysis and design , I have a genuine interest in the subject . Courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principles of Communication , and Signals and Systems remain my favorites . With quite satisfactory academic performance in almost all the specialized courses , I am ranked top 3 of my class . For my distinguished academic performance , I have been awarded first-class scholarship for three consecutive years . <p> As a student of communication engineering , I have paid special attention to developing my aptitudes in mathematics and in computer science and technology , two important subjects that will prove extremely crucial to wireless systems . Prior to my university education , I have excelled in mathematics throughout my primary and middle schools , and I have continued to develop this talent in XX University . In the mathematical modeling contest launched by my university early this year , I won the first prize and , in September , representing my university , I participated in the nationwide contest of mathematical modeling for university students in which I won the third prize . Besides mathematics , courses in computer science and technology such as Principles of Computer Composition and Microcomputer Interface Technique have enriched my knowledge buildup as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved my creative thinking and hands-on abilities . <p> Not contented with acquiring knowledge simply from formal academic education , I have tried to venture beyond the campus into the larger world to apply and test my knowledge . In the first semester as a junior student , and at the strong recommendation of my advisor , I participated in the development of XX for the XX Plant . By carefully studying the overall design plan , I realized that , as the system is to be applied to a wide variety of environments , it must maintain high performance under different conditions of temperature , humidity , pollution and vibration . I collected a large amount of technical literature concerning relevant components from libraries and local manufacturers , comparing and verifying the technical parameters of individual types of components . In the circuit design , I consciously expanded the range of the working conditions that the main modules apply to , thereby providing sound hardware basis for the realization of the entire system . So far , the system has been put into actual operation . <p> Having savored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become increasingly aware of the importance of developing my research capacity as an engineering student . At present , I am making extensive research for completing my graduation project XX . The MPEG-4 technology is a live subject for many research teams on video technology and existing bibliography indicates that mature systems have not yet been developed in China . For an undergraduate like me , this is a rather challenging task . Underlying this project is my strong interest in real-time network transmission technology . <p> Now , on the verge of completing my undergraduate program and having a solid foundation in communication engineering , I would like to apply for a Masters program in XX . In China , wireless communication is dominated by 2G technology whereas in XX 3G technology has become rather popular and in some countries even 4 G technology has been used , allowing the transmission of large quantities of data with greatly improved quality . As the central technology in wireless communication , wireless systems will determine the future trends of communication technology . I wish to receive more advanced education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field in China five years from now . <p> In my proposed program , I would like to concentrate on ( a ) Information Theory and Communication Theory ( specifically source-channel coding , coding for wireless communications , space-time coding , detection and estimation ) , ( b ) Audio-Visual Mobile Internetworking , and ( c ) 4G Wireless Infrastructure and Blue-Tooth Wireless . The key courses I plan to attend include Digital Communication , Introduction to Signal Theory , Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling , Wireless Networks , and Antenna Theory . I would like to identify Prof. XX as my potential advisor , from whom I can learn a lot in Information Theory and Communication Theory . <p> As captain of our Colleges basketball team , I am fully aware of the importance of leadership , teamwork , and indefatigable will in achieving success in any undertaking .

My extensive knowledge of physics and mathematical modeling proved to be very useful in understanding the principles that underlie biological phenomena in cells . Consequently , one of my research project involves the investigation of cytoplasmic membrane structure and another deals with study of potassium channels in cardio myocytes . <p> I carried out my first research project in biophysics at Lebedev Physical Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences in the biokinetics research group under the guidance of Prof. A. The ultimate goal of our research was to check the change in permeability of lipid bilayer for O2 , glucose , K+ , Na+ , Ca++ and in membrane structure of the human cells under pressure . Working in this laboratory I performed a number of experiments , got acquainted with laboratory equipment and further studied mathematical modeling of biological processes .

This laboratory deals primarily with treatments of atrial flutter and fibrillation . Specifically , we investigate the new Russian Class III antiarythmic drug Nibentan . It was invented in collaboration with this laboratory and is currently being used in clinics . Our current aim is to improve the existing formula . For the last year I have been investigating the effects of Nibentan and other drugs on the potassium ion channels of guinea pig and rabbit atrial and sinoatrial cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique . By May of 2000 I will have enough results in order to defend a masters thesis one year ahead of time . <p> After graduation I plan to continue my scientific career in the field of cell physiology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial situation Russian laboratories can not afford .

In the middle of this small 10-square meter studio is a double-CPU computer which I assembled during my high school years according to the technical specifications I downloaded from the Internet . In it , I used the then most advanced Windows NT operating system , whose speed and functions remain quite ideal even to this day . In a huge cabinet over my computer system are displayed over 100 electronic gadgets and models that I designed in my elementary school , each consisting of hundreds of spare parts and components , along with many computer magazines and books by domestic and foreign publishers . It was in this very studio that I once worked for 18 hours each day for an entire week during which I produced a two-minute animation for the Konka Multimedia Grand Competition ( launched by Chinas biggest producer of home appliances KONKA Group ) and walked away with a third-class prize . Now , by using the same computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both my determination to obtain admission into your prestigious university and my passion for computer science , as well as strong interest in achieving success in my future research and in project execution . My philosophy of life is " Fighting for My Dream " . I realize that my mental faculty is my gift and that the determination to fight is the guarantee for exercising this gift to the fullest possible extent and for achieving the ultimate success . <p> First and foremost , I am most indebted to my father , an experienced engineer , whose enlightenment in my early education played a key role in developing my intelligence and who created important conditions for me to learning computer knowledge at a very early stage . In 1989 when I just entered the third grade in elementary school and when computer was by no means popularized , I passed the most rigorous screening test to join my schools Computer Olympics Class . Within one year , I mastered all the fundamental computer knowledge and excelled the elder students to represent our school in a all city computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional receptivity and wide-range exposure to computer knowledge always distinguished me from the rest of my classmates . Not merely a " specialist " in computer hardware , I self-studied the then latest programming language Visual Basic 2.0 with which I translated my ideas into reality one by one . I made it a habit of formulating specific learning tasks and then attempting to seek problem-oriented answers by reading relevant books and consulting professional knowledge from my father and the Masters students under his supervision . With even more remarkable progress in both hardware and software , I naturally selected the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China as the place in which I could develop my scholastic potential in computer science to the full . <p> My formal university education allowed me to bring my interest in and my passion for computer into full play , on both theoretical and practical levels . I endeavored to absorb every technical detail of computer technology behind the textbooks without letting one off . Meanwhile , I paid close attention to the integration of knowledge drawn from different courses . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Software Engineering , Principles of Microcomputer , Computer Networks , Mobile Computing Systems and Applications , Computer Graphics LabModeling , Animation , and Rendering of 3-D Scenes , Multimedia Databases &amp; Data Mining , Networking : Advanced Network Services , and Mobile and Wireless Networking , I was able to arrive at new levels of understanding and application of computer technology . What made especially proud of myself is the fact that I have far surpassed my classmates by achieving straight As in all the core courses . In order to supplement my classroom education and to keep myself abreast with the latest computer technology , I devoted myself , with a sort of computer mania , to learning two courses Microsoft Certified System Engineer ( MCSE ) and Microsoft Certified Database Administrator ( MCDBA ) as early as the first year of my undergraduate program . With due efforts , I obtained very high scores ( over 90 points ) in two most difficult examinations in MCDBA and was the first student in the School of Automation Engineering to have received MSCE and MCDBA certificates ( for the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university have proved eligible ) . <p> Attending various lectures and academic conferences and participating in diverse contests have also enabled me to improve my professional level and to exchange with others . My vision becomes widened and my analytical competence sharpened . My creativity and experiment skills are enhanced through the actual process of solving problems . In the HuaWei-Cup Contest , my teams assignment was to design a portable digital oscillograph which involved hardware design , interface design , and software design . This complicated project presented many technical and design problems , but the newly-organized group solved them one by one by means of close cooperation and collective wisdom . In working on the most difficult problem-the oscillograph-computer connection , we first planned to use the serial interface . However , due to the extremely high sampling speed of the oscillograph , the low transmission speed of the serial interface made it impossible to complete the data transmission in time . I consulted relevant technical literature and came up with two proposals . One alternative was to reduce the volume in the transmitted data so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconciled . Another alternative was to use USB interface to increase the transmission speed . Ultimately , the problem was solved with the desired effect and the project was successfully completed , winning positive evaluations from our teachers . <p> Even though I am assured of a lucrative employment upon my graduation , I have nevertheless decided to continue with advanced studies in the United States . Even at a very young age , my mind used to be replete with many novel ideas , many of which have been translated into reality . It dismayed me to find that as new ideas keep emerging , my existing knowledge and abilities prove gravely inadequate to materialize them . To achieve a breakthrough , it is imperative for me to seek professional trainings in the country with the most advanced computer technology , especially to learn scientific and systematic methodologies for analyzing and solving problems . In my future study plan for a Ph.D . program at the Carnegie Mellon University ( CMU ) , I wish to focus on the following areascomputer graphics , robotics , computer vision , motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a research subject that has achieved relative breadth and width so far . Within its framework , computer vision , sometimes dabbed as the " eye of the robots " , will play a vital role in enhancing the intelligence of future robots . I am really fascinated by this field . On the other hand , I had experience of using the motion documents developed with motion capture technology in producing my animated characters . The documents significantly simplified the entire process of animation production and also made the pictures much more vivid . With this tentative knowledge and experience in motion capture , I am all the more interested in delving ever deeper into this field until complete mastery .

@@42231673 @2231673/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Biomaterials <p> It is my belief that life should be a constant process of self-transcendence and an attempt to arrive at new heights . In this quest for personal fulfillment , the advent of every single day constitutes a new starting point for me . With this belief , I have made important achievements in the days gone by . It is again with this belief that I have forced myself to embark on a new journey of challenges . <p> I graduated from the Department of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine of China Agriculture University . For me , university education constituted a palace of knowledge in which I was able to enrich myself with all the foundational knowledge in my specialty . The persistent efforts with which I devoted myself to my studies and the effective study strategies enabled me to achieve No.1 class rank for three consecutive years , with particularly outstanding performance in the courses of my specialty . Especially worth mentioning is my special interest in English learning throughout the four-year undergraduate program . I acted as chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning has helped me acquire sound English proficiency , an ability which has benefited me tremendously in my later-day studies and research . At the same time , through English learning , I developed my comprehensive qualities . <p> If my 4-year undergraduate program is merely a process of laying a sound foundation in basic knowledge in my specialty , the 3-year graduate program that I subsequently pursued at the university became a period in which my academic interests and creativity were allowed to fully develop and come into initial fruition . I succeeded in switching from Veterinary Medicine to Biomedical Engineering . The most significant accomplishment I achieved in my graduate program was a pioneering research I carried out regarding the blood compatibility materials in the graduation project . In this research , I first summarized the existing problems in the prevalent blood compatibility materials , such as the differing degree of bloods binding on the surface of the material , the possibility of the material to damage some of the blood components , and the rejection reaction of the host organism . Then I analyzed in detail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood compatibility . For instance , one of the most important reasons is the concentration of a large quantity of carbohydrate in the outer layer of the inner membrane of the blood vessel . The carbohydrate is in a state of unusual water absorption and expansion ( ? ? ? ) , whose water molecule is in the same quasi-structure condition as the water molecule in the blood vessel , thereby resulting in the extremely low level of interface energy between the inner membrane and the blood . Eventually , based on careful analysis of the structural properties of the blood vessels inner membrane and the cytomembrane , I proposed a bold idea of using polymer/liquid crystal composite membrane as the material for the blood compatibility . <p> A great number of subsequent experiments excitingly proved that this material , which bears close resemblance to the structure of the blood vessels inwall , possesses excellent blood compatibility . This discovery not only provided a better blood compatibility material but also opened up a new area in the research of blood compatibility material . Finally , on the basis of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its originality , received quite high ratings from the specialists in the field . Again , based on its research findings , I published five research papers in both domestic and international academic journals including Biomaterials . In addition , I succeeded in applying for one patent ( No . ZL98 1 22268.4 ) and winning an award for state-level research achievement . Finally , as a special honor , I was appointed as the sole representative of a total of 900 graduate students of our university to be awarded a scholarship for the Outstanding Graduate Student of the Year . <p> The successes I achieved in the academic research during my graduate studies significantly aroused my zeal for taking up research as my lifelong pursuit . After graduation , I worked at the Animal Health Technology Center attached to Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Science where I was engaged in the development of animal drugs and products of feed additives . For four years , as the technical expert of the center , I developed a total of 13 new products and a few of those products , like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , have become the centers most important profit-making product . Those involvements have considerably increased my rich experience in drug development . <p> While involved in the development of veterinary medicine , I have also participated in a number of important research projects . In 1998 , I completed the project Research on the Effect of Domestic Salinomycin on Pig Growth sponsored by the Science and Technology Committee Foundation of Guangdong Province . As the leading member of the research team , I was responsible for the data collection and data analysis and processing . By the concerted efforts of mine and my collaborators , the project was not only successfully carried out but also was awarded the First Prize of Science and Technology Progress by Guangdong Feed Industry Office . Meanwhile , I published the research findings of this project in the form of two research papers in the core journals of Chinas animal husbandry science . In addition , I was a member of the two other research projects funded by Guangdong Provincial Government and the Foundation of the Academy of Agricultural Science of Guangdong Province . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 10 research papers in both domestic and international journals . On account of my outstanding research achievements , I was awarded the honor Top Ten Young Scientist of the Academy of Agricultural Science of Guangdong Province . <p> In retrospection of my research career , I find that I seem to be getting closer and closer to my childhood dream of becoming a fruitful scientist . But I am equally aware that the intellectual world I am entering is a world of infinite unraveled mysteries . The science of biomaterials is an multidisciplinary subject which synthesizes the research findings in biology , medicine , chemistry , and material science . Correspondingly , over the past decade , my research interests have changed from medical science through polymer materials and to drug development . This cross-disciplinary research experience has significantly broadened my ken of knowledge , knowledge that would prove extremely instrumental to my proposed study in biomaterials . <p> A Ph . D. Program in Biomaterials in what I apply for and all the past research achievements that I have made are my qualifications for applying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , I am acutely aware that challenges abound in many areas of biomaterial research .

Like many scientists , I believe that science should be in direct service of mankind . For me , the science of biomaterial is a discipline that is much more immediately contribute to the welfare of human beings , especially so in this new millennium which is often designated as the Century of Biotechnology .

" My first reaction on reading Ezra Pounds 1916 poem In a Station of the Metro was that of outrage . Is it a poem by any definition ? If it is a poem , how is it to be interpreted and understood ? And finally , what are the implications that this poem has produced for the twentieth- century American literature ? <p> My initial bewilderment subsided as I realized that there must a raison detre behind this apparently bizarre literary phenomenon . What I should do is to put this poem into the context of the American literary evolution and literary history . At least , the poem raises an important challenge . It requires me to understand some of the crucial changes that must be happening around the turn of the last century . <p> My subsequent studies indicate that this poem represents part of the larger literary movement known as Imagism , which included such theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy Lowell , Ezra Pound , etc . The movement was a direct reaction to the late Victorian poetry , which had become extremely artificial , emptily " rhetorical " and " ornamental " . To address such problems , it was necessary to loosen the metrical pattern and bring it back closer to the rhythms of ordinary speech . Consequently , the " imagist " movement had a great deal to do with promoting experiments with free verse , advocating among many creeds the need " to allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject " and " to produce poetry that is hard and clear , never blurred nor indefinite . " When Archibald MacLeish said in his Ars Poetica ( 1926 ) that " A poem should not mean / But be " , he had similar concerns in his mind . Imagism , minor as it is as a literary movement , triggered important changes in literary criticism , introducing the notion of internal studies as embodied by New Criticism to substitute the conventional critical practices . <p> The foregoing incident is but one instance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student like me , it has at least two important implications . First , a literary work must not be treated in isolation . It interacts with what is written before it and after it and this historical perspective is one way in which we may add to our interpretation . Second , it is important to be acquainted with relevant literary theories when interpreting a given literary work . <p> A student majoring in English ( &amp; International Trade ) at the English Department of XX University , I grew increasingly interested in literature during the second half of my undergraduate program . Of course , I was trained to be a student of English language in the first place and as such I received the standard academic training typical of a student of English major . For the first two years , I primarily had intensive trainings in basic English language skills by attending courses in advanced listening , writing , reading and oral communication . My distinguished academic performance is demonstrated by the four consecutive first-class and second-class scholarships I won from 1999 to 2003 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus-wide English composition contest and in 2002 the first prize in the translation contest . Another indicator of my scholastic achievements is the honor of Outstanding Graduate of XX Province that I received by the time I completed my undergraduate program . <p> I started reading English novels as soon as I began my undergraduate program . But I primarily used it as a way to increase my vocabulary and to improve my reading comprehension . Since the second year in my undergraduate program , our curriculum included five major courses related to Anglo-American literature and culture : Selected Readings in English Literature , Selected Readings in American Literature , Introduction to European Culture , The History of English and American Literature , Selected Readings in English &amp; American Fictions . Those courses provided me with a cultural and historical framework with which to understand Anglo-American literature and to know their interrelationships .

In this thesis , I examined different groups of imagery that T. S. Eliot employed to externalize his central ideas and emotions . I also analyzed the theoretical justifications for his virtually excessive use of imagery by tracing it to his theory of " Objective Correlative " that he proposed in Hamlet and His Problems , a critical essay contained in The Sacred Wood ( 1920 ) . <p> In an extracurricular event , students in our department put on Shakespeares drama Romeo and Juliet and I was the performer-director .

@@42231680 @2231680/ <h> Free Sample Personal Statement in Structural Engineering <p> A simple bridge truss was the first structure I ever analyzed . The simple combination of beams that could hold cars , trains , and trucks over a long spans of water fascinated me . Having the tools to analyze the loads on the truss further increased my interest in structures . I encountered the bridge in a textbook for my first engineering class . <p> Knowing that the professor , Mr. John Doe , was a tough teacher , I asked him for the textbook so I could study and get ready for the class over the summer . Just arrived from Belize , I was determined to succeed . In class we learned about forces on simple members and then we put the members together to form a simple truss . At this point I had almost decided that structural engineering was the career for me . From there the class just took off : We went on to frames , distributed loads , considered friction ; basically we were incorporating real world considerations into structural members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . <p> At UC my classes were even more advanced . In my analysis and design classes , I especially enjoyed studying steel design because we not only learned the use of the load resistance factor design but also applied that knowledge I designed a four-story building . The professor was a practicing engineer , and he always related the subject to real life steel structures he had engineered , for example , the SB Medical Center , an all steel building with a base isolated campus . This is the kind of project on which I would like to work , designing the structure and considering how the building will respond to ground motion . After two quarters of structural analysis , I had come as close as possible to analyzing real world structures . <p> Looking back I realize , I had learned great tools for structural analysis , but my " tool box " was still inadequate . I lacked a very important tool : finite element analysis . According to my professor , finite element analysis has revolutionized structural analysis . <p> Although I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in structural engineering . While working at Caltrans as a student volunteer , I reviewed computer grading output for streets under construction . The computer suggested numbers for the road grading , and I had to plot the numbers and make sure there were no abrupt grade changes so the water can drain off easily to the sides of the road . It was exciting to know that I was the last checkpoint before the whole project went for approval . It was enjoyable working on something real Main Street but I was somewhat disappointed I did not have the chance to work on any structures . <p> At UC I volunteered through the Student Research Program to work in the geotechnical library . I worked directly with a doctoral student and helped him to develop a geotechnical data base for the local area . I interpreted the data Caltrans had collected and recorded it in a form accessible to the computer and easy to read . It took hours to finish the job , but I enjoyed the precision involved so I did not mind putting in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired me to continue the project during the summer . Working on this project also showed me the importance of soils in determining buildings responses to earthquakes and awakened my interest in the response of skyscrapers to seismic stress and movement . <p> At First Choice U , I plan to enroll in the structural engineering and geomechanics program . In this program I hope to draw on my structural analysis and geotechnical research background as a foundation for studying more advanced concepts . I am particularly interested in researching the ties between the structural engineering , geomechanics , and applied mechanics . I believe research is necessary to acquire data and formulate theories , but it is just as important to know how to apply those theories and use that data in the real world . I hope to be involved in some structurally related research at First Choice U. I am particularly interested in two research facilities : The Structures and Composites Laboratory and the Earthquake Engineering Center . <p> After completing my degree in engineering and working on engineering projects , I know I want to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mr. Does class . I also know , however , that designing structures of a complexity that appeals to me requires " more tools in my toolbox . " Those I can acquire only by continuing my education . To be competent and competitive I will need a masters degree . After completing my degree , I would like to work for an American engineering consulting firm and engineer complex structures and tall buildings , perhaps focusing on the problems surrounding designing for earthquakes . My long- term goals is to return to Belize and found my own engineering consulting firm there . <p> Structural engineering will allow me to pursue a career where I can be creatively involved in problem-solving and design functional structures , like the simple truss bridge that initially captivated me in Mr. Does class . My classes , work at Caltrans , and internship in geotechnical engineering have increased my knowledge of and interest in structural engineering since I first looked at the textbook shortly after my arrival in the U.S. A masters degree will give me the up-to-date tools and knowledge to be competitive and competent .

Try to understand all there is to understand about a book so that you will be in a better position to answer questions about it . Have at least two essay topics prepared before you take a test . Even if you do n't have to write an essay , the topics that you have chosen are most likely topics that your teacher wants to test your understanding of . Make sure that you are really comfortable with the topics that you have chosen and can give at least two examples from the book that back up your assertion . For example , you might be asked to write an essay on any character that you thought acted as a dramatic catalyst in the play Macbeth . If you followed the advice above , all the hard work would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test . You would have already picked out your two or three characters from the book to focus in on , and most likely , at least one of them acted as a catalyst in some way . You could pick the Three Witches , Lady Macbeth , even King Duncan himself-as long as you have some proof to back it up . ( Always read the instructions carefully on a test because your teacher might just want you to discuss major characters , in which case your beautiful essay on Banquo 's son being a catalyst would not count . ) Give examples like : <p> " An example of how Lady Macbeth is a catalyst in the play is when she convinces Macbeth to kill the king .

Nevertheless , my interest in different cultures flourished during my childhood and adolescence in New Mexico . The beauty and breathtakingly scenic landscape of this state is enriched with the pronounced cultural diversity brought about by Pueblo , Hopi and Navajo nations and a large Hispanic population that represents close to 50% of state . When I was in kindergarten I attended a bilingual school in Lemitar , a small town in southern New Mexico . Most of the children at this school were Hispanic . This allowed me at a very early age to experience a language and culture different from mine . My father has always had a keen interest in people from other countries and cultural backgrounds . As a librarian , my father has always encouraged me to read not only Western Philosophy , but Eastern Philosophy as well . In addition , he inspired me to see life from a different perspective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have always been a non-traditional and unconventional student . I went to a high school with a curriculum that was as challenging for me as any course I have taken in college . This high school was unique because we studied everything from the origin of Western Civilization to modern-day Western thought . Another unique feature of this school was that at the end of our senior year we had to give an oral presentation in front of a host of panelists from St. John 's College in Santa Fe , New Mexico . This experience helped me develop my ability to think critically and present a cogent thesis . It forced me to grow not only as a student , but more importantly , as an individual . <p> When I graduated from high school I rebelled against traditional education and decided not to apply to college . This decision was to the great dismay of my parents , who had entered college immediately after high school . With much resistance , I enrolled at Santa Fe Community College . This was just to satisfy my parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I wanted to study and continue to learn , I yearned to reach out to people and find a different mode of study--one which would allow me to understand myself better so that I could relate better to the world around me .

The school provided me with a unique mind/body balance that has helped me become a more well-rounded person . I studied subjects that ranged from Anatomy and Physiology to Yoga and Tai Chi . After graduating , I got a job at the Santa Fe Sport Medicine Institute as a Physical Therapy Assistant . I used Massage techniques to help people who were injured in auto accidents or sporting events . This type of work allowed me to directly help people-- the people I massaged told me that the pain they experienced prior to the massage had subsided . Relieving the pains of these people nurtured in me a sense of purpose .

At 22 , I had saved up some money and now decided to go live in Asia to experience a Chinese culture first-hand , and to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese . My desire to go to Asia was spawned by a genuine interest in reconciling differences I found between Eastern and Western cultures . Similarly , I wanted to pursue this experience because it would provide me with a unique opportunity to broaden the perspective I had on the world as a whole . This is how I ended living in Taichung , Taiwan and visiting mainland China . <p> When I arrived in Taiwan , I remember getting off the airplane and hearing everyone speaking Chinese .

However , I refused to be paid for the training . The school was so impressed by this that after I completed the training , they appointed me director of the English Language program . I was astounded by the generosity and honesty that I received from the people in Taiwan . This was a truly remarkable experience . <p> In Taiwan , I lived with a Chinese family .

Luck has nothing to do with success . " Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above ? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position . <p> I fully agree with the claim that there is no correlation between success and luck . Moreover , I understand success to refer to one 's ability to achieve the predominant part of his goals in his lifetime , which in turn leads to a correlation between success and income since the accomplishment of such a natural goal as to provide a good future for your loved ones demands the means .

The reasons and examples listed below will strengthen my point of view . <p> First of all , considering an education and a career as key factors of success , one will choose to pursue a degree from a college or a university . One wishing to be admitted to the university will have to take several tests . It is doubtful that someone will be so lucky that knowing nothing , he could pass the test with a high score . A low score means failure , and that test taker will not likely be admitted .

For instance , I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend . This company was later closed because of bankruptcy . The cause of bankruptcy was wrong strategies and decisions made by the owner . After the failure , he went to a university and worked for another company so that he could obtain experience and become a successful businessman .

Among other things , it gives you a good chance to review your accomplishments for the interview . You will probably be impressed with what you have accomplished . <p> It MUST BE PERFECT . No typos , misspellings or grammatical mistakes . One of the biggest complaints among employers is the lack of communication skills . This is an opportunity to show off your communications skills with a well-written , concise resume . <p> ONE PAGE . I suggest that you start with several pages and then trim it down to one page . <p> The most important stuff ( most impressive ) should appear closer to the top of the page . <p> Put your best foot forward . Do not lie , but do not volunteer negative information . <p> What style should I use ? Whatever style makes you look the best . For example , if you have a lot of gaps in your work history that are difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Put yourself in the reviewers shoes . For example , try to anticipate questions that might arise in their minds . <p> Work experience : If you are applying to an internship position , it is very understandable that you do not have an extensive work history . But do not omit work history ; even if it is was not a technical job . For example : If you had a job " flipping burgers " last summer , but you did it well , showing up for work on time every day , being awarded employee of the month , or perhaps even showing some initiative ( finding a more efficient way of flipping burgers ) that would look good on this resume . In work experiences you should make it clear what your responsibilities were . Be specific . " Managed a purchasing budget of three thousand dollars " , " Supervised six people . " etc . <p> Academic record . If your GPA is above 3.0 , this should be in on your resume . If you have won any awards in college or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyon club student of the month etc . <p> Courses : Do not simply list course numbers ! ( Physics 150 , Math 211 , etc . ) Give descriptive name ( Electronics , Calculus , etc ) For this internship resume you may want to list the grade you received in the course if it is a B or higher . If you made the top 1,2 , or 3 grade in the class you can also mention this . Skills : Give this one a lot of thought ! You probably have skills you are not aware of . Be specific when possible . Rather than saying " familiar with milling machines " , say " certified machinist . " Always list any certifications licenses , military training , etc . Again , be specific . Make it as clear as possible exactly what your level of skill is . <p> Analytical skills : These can probably be deduced from what math courses you have taken but do not forget things like ; error analysis ( laboratory ) , computer simulations , specific analytical skills from the math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Other skills : particularly if you can give specific examples .

Clubs : Participation in clubs is good to include on your resume , particularly if you served in a leadership role ( President , vice president , etc. of Society of Physics Students for example . ) It shows , among other things that you have initiative to do things , even when not required . You should include the dates of involvement . <p> Hobbies : If included at all , it should be near the bottom ( unimportant ) of your resume . You may want to include things like mechanical tinkering , or member of the American Radio Relay League . Remember , this is a professional resume ; so including personal information may not be advisable . This may open the door for what would otherwise be inappropriate questions during the interview . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to my seven children " . The interviewer may feel justified in follow up on this and asking how your future job may fit in with this commitment . <p> References : It is standard practice to end the resume with the " References available upon request . " Make sure you have your references lined up so you can quickly respond to a reference request . You should make sure your references are ready and willing to give you a strong reference . Some organizations/companies will simply want to contact the references by telephone . Others may want a formal , letter of recommendation . Some letters of recommendation are confidential and sent directly to the organization/company or delivered by the applicant in a sealed envelope . Others are less formal . It is a good idea to have letters of recommendation with you when you go to interview , unless of course they are confidential letters of recommendation . In any case you should have a typed list of references with you when you go to interview . References should be professional references , not personal references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and title(s) Position in organization Work Address Work telephone number email address context in which they knew you ( supervisor , professor , etc. ) how long they knew you You should ask your physics faculty advisor to review the resume for content . <p> You should ask the CSUSB career development center to review it for style and format .

The center also offers many other services and I STRONGLY recommend that you go by and see them . <p> COVER LETTER The resume should be accompanied by a cover letter . To Whom It May Concern : Address your letter to a specific person if at all possible ! <p> The cover letter should be concise . Again , one page . <p> The cover letter should be perfect . Here grammar is more important than in the resume . <p> Make it very clear which job or internship position you are applying for . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about themselves and an advertisement of their specific abilities . Also , you can look at the position description for key skills the employer is looking for that you can highlight about yourself . <p> Put yourself in the reviewers shoes .

For example , if you have a " foreign sounding " name , you may want to convince the reviewer that you have an excellent command of the English language . <p> It is ok to drop names . If you meet the president of the company and she suggested that you send in a resume YOU SHOULD CERTAINLY MENTION THIS . If you know someone else or if there is a former CSUSB graduate working for the organization you can mention his or her name . Warn them first though before you do . <p> In the cover letter you should also make it clear that you are familiar with the organization and what it is that they do . Point out to them what you can bring to the position . " What can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a great place to use all those passive words like ; confident , self-starter , problem identifier , problem solver , decision maker , etc . <p> In the cover letter you should let them know that you will be following up . Following up in one week should be good . You may actually want to check with a secretary much sooner to make sure the resume was received . <p> WHERE , WHEN AND HOW TO USE THE RESUME <p> Now that you have a quality resume you should use it . <p> Mail submission : Make sure your cover letter is signed with an original signature . If the organization you are submitting to is one of your top choices , you may want to send it express mail . It gives added recognition . <p> Electronic submission . When electronically submitting your resume I suggest that that you submit it in generic formats . The resume and cover letter and resume should appear as plain text in the body of the email . Also include , as an attachment a PDF version of both and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the text what format the attachments are in . Most modern word processors will automatically generate PDF and HTML versions . You should also send a hard copy by mail . Some organizations/companies may be reluctant to open email attachments for fear of being infected by a computer virus . <p> Fax submission . You should follow-up fax submissions with a telephone call to make sure it is received . Again , you should mail a hard copy . The quality of a fax submission is highly dependent on the quality of the receiving fax machine . Your pretty resume may come out looking horrible . Therefore , it is very important that you mail a hard copy .

So , let your essays create a three dimensional portrait of yourself . <p> You 'll of course like to show the readers that you 're a leader , a good team worker , mature , and self-aware . If you can , show a sense of humor . Even better , take whatever it is that makes you different ( professional saxophone skills , an alpinist 's love of heights , a passion for Buddhist sculpture , etc. ) and bring it forward . This is what the reader will likely remember , and this might well be the point that gives you an advantage over people with professional profiles similar to yours . <p> Avoid arrogance at all costs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confidence and poise . A good rule of thumb : you know yourself , but you ca n't assume much about others . Thus , you can be " smart " but you want to avoid claiming you are the " smartest " ( even if you are ) . <p> What Motivates You ? <p> Now that the admissions readers have a sense of who you are , they will want to know why . What values have made you who you are ? A need to achieve ? A passion for your sector ? Why are you a high achiever ? Why have you made the life choices reflected in your education and professional history ? All of these points will give a very strong indication of the values you will bring into the program . <p> What Are Your Goals ? <p> Just as important as the Who and the Why , the Where ( are you going ) will show the reader that you have a professional project that fits ( indeed , necessitates ) a top MBA program . Further , the reader will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dossier to get a feel for how likely you are to succeed . <p> " But wait a minute ! " you might say , " I want a top MBA for the professional options it will bring . Plus , I need two years in a stimulating academic environment to explore new interests and try new things . How can anyone expect me to present a well thought-out career plan ? " This is a valid point , and in fact relatively few MBAs actually realize the grand plans presented in their dossiers . Nonetheless , a well-thought out plan , displaying knowledge , research , a sense of self understanding , and some common sense , is a crucial confidence-builder . Like a business plan , your professional project must convince people to invest in you . <p> So what should you discuss ? First , you should be able to state clearly and succinctly a post-MBA career objective and a slightly broader goal for MBA + five years . A good example might be something like , " I intend to pursue a career in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my HR experience and language skills to become an acknowledged expert in the field of international HR management . In five years time , I 'll either reach partner level , or leave the firm to become chief of HR for a Fortune 500 global corporation . " <p> Once you have your professional objectives clear and on the table , you 'll want to construct a logical bridge connected where you are now professionally , an MBA , the specific program to which you 're applying , and your post-MBA objective . Explain why an MBA is necessary for you to reach your goal . Why you have to study now . And why Kellogg is the only , best place to go . Make your logic inexorable ! <p> How Well You Communicate ? <p> All of that is already a lot to accomplish in a set of rather brief essays . In fact , the strict length guidelines imposed by the admissions offices are in part a challenge to test your written communication skills . While good business writing can not be taught in a few lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , to the point , and grammatically correct . Do n't waste your words ( and the readers ' time ) , and do n't leave readers scratching their heads trying to figure out what you mean to say . <p> Make it persuasive , positive , and personal . Your dossier works like a business plan , remember ? So make your essays persuasive that you are worth the risk of admitting you . Next , even if you 've had a tough life do n't whine about it . Let these difficulties serve as chances for you to exhibit positive achievements . And as for the future , why do an MBA if you 're not optimistic ? <p> Show , do n't tell . Straightforward claims ( " I 'm a super hard worker ! " ) are often hard to believe and come across as arrogant or worse . Instead , substantiate your claims through anecdotes ( that one-month project you headed with a one-week deadline ) . Stories are interesting ; they are remembered ; most importantly , they communicate the same message as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How Serious You Are ? <p> Admissions officers definitely use your essays as a gauge of your ATD Quotient ( Attention To Detail ) . Make certain your essays show more than a weekend 's work , that there are absolutely no typos , and of course that they are your own work rather than something you downloaded off the Net . By now , you must realize that the Personal Statement is , all by itself , a big project . Schedule at least eight weeks to get them written . 
@@42231693 @2231693/ <h> Drop in SAT scores blamed on TV , teaching , ethnic diversity <p> This year 's incoming college freshmen read and write worse than any class in the modern history of the Scholastic Aptitude Test , according to results released Monday . Even math scores on the SAT -- which had increased during the last decade -- dropped this year . The test , though controversial because of its constricting format , is nevertheless still considered an important barometer of college readiness . And what the barometer is saying is that student academic performance has declined dramatically , particularly in verbal skills . <p> The cause ? Experts cite a variety of factors , including television and poor teaching . But most important , especially in California , might be the increased diversity among the test-takers . The Associated Press quoted US Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander on Monday as saying : " The simple fact is that even our best students generally do n't know enough and ca n't do enough to assure success in tomorrow 's world . " <p> The nation 's verbal scores dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national averages were first calculated in 1969 . The math score also dropped two points , to 474 . The combined score -- 896 -- was the lowest since 1983 . <p> The maximum score for each section is 800 ; the minimum is 200 . California 's average verbal score dropped four points to 415 , an all-time low . The math score dipped two points to 482 . As in past years , California 's verbal scores were lower than the national average , but math scores were higher . That reflects the large number of immigrant students in the state who frequently enter schools with limited English ability but good math skills . Translated into real performance , the scores mean the average American student could answer only 42 percent of the questions in the test 's verbal section this year . Two decades ago , the average student could answer 48 percent . <p> " It 's hard to find the good news , although I think there is some , " said Robert G. Cameron , senior research associate for the College Board , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the decline is that more students -- particularly more minority students -- are taking the test . Of the 1 million students from the Class of 1991 who took the test , 28 percent were minorities , up from 11 percent in 1973 . Because many minority students go to poor schools and some grew up speaking a language other than English , their scores can bring down the average , Cameron said . <p> Yet their decision to take the test is indeed good news , Cameron said . " Presumably , then , more are aspiring to and therefore entering college , providing diversity . " <p> Cameron said he suspects that verbal scores also are declining because students today read less and less -- both in school and out . Television has become their medium . <p> And he called it " quite possible " that schools are n't doing as good a job as they used to . State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig said the scores concerned him . " The real problem , I think , is that the verbal scores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that California districts encourage students to take the SAT even if they do n't believe they will do well . " So some kids are trying this that normally never even tried it before , " he said . <p> And although a higher percentage of seniors in California take the test than nationwide , he noted , the state 's average combined score is above the national average . <p> College Board President Donald M.

@@42231701 @2231701/ 9338 @qwx419338 <h> Interviewing <p> It is the day of the interview . Unless you are experienced , you will probably be nervous and wishing you could just get your old life back . Here are some tips for combating nerves and avoiding some of the pitfalls . <p> Traditional Interview <p> Non-Traditional <p> The Traditional Interview <p> Review your answers to possible questions the night before if this is your first interview . Then try to get a good night 's sleep . This will help fix your answers in your mind . <p> Wake up in plenty of time to have a good breakfast and get ready . Running late or not eating always increases stress . <p> Plan to arrive about a half-hour early unless you will be very close to the place of your interview . Traffic and unfamiliar routes may cause delay . <p> Arrive at the place of your interview at least 10-15 minutes early . You can use the extra time to walk around , observe , and check your appearance . <p> Tell yourself how much you are looking forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't matter if you do n't believe yourself at first . Keep saying it mentally and your brain will believe you eventually . <p> Introduce yourself to the greeter and state your purpose . Be sure to smile and say something pleasant , but do not get too informal . Greeters are often used by interviewers to provide additional information about you . The greeter will probably direct you to a chair to wait . This is a perfect time to read some company literature that you have brought with you or that you see in the office . <p> When the interviewer calls you or comes to meet you , be sure that you are ready to shake hands immediately . If your hands are sweaty , use a handkerchief to dry them as you are picking up the items you brought with you . <p> When the interviewer introduces him or herself , use the name immediately so you will remember it . <p> When you enter the room , you may be asked to sit or you may be introduced to other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of their names and shake their hands . Remember to smile . <p> When you sit , you can take out your notebook that has the questions you would like to ask at the end of the interview . You may also jot down notes during the interview , but keep your notes brief and infrequent so your attention does not stray from the questions . If a notebook would be too distracting to you , either put in on your lap or another surface , or wait to get it until you need your questions . <p> Remember , sit comfortably with good posture just like you have practiced . <p> If you are interviewing with more than one person , do not panic . The interviewers usually take turns , so you can focus on the person asking you the question if you are nervous . As you become more comfortable , establish eye contact with the rest of the group when you are answering . Begin and end your answer with the person asking the question . <p> Remember , you are looking forward to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interviewer will usually begin by telling you about the company , the interview process , or both to help you relax . If that does not happen or if you are nervous anyway , take a breath , smile , and answer the question . If the words do not come easily , you can admit you are nervous because you want to do well . An experienced interviewer will try to break the tension for you by saying something to make you laugh , by telling you to take your time , or by asking questions to help you fill in the blanks . You can also do this for yourself by saying something like , " This is my first interview and I thought I was ready . Then you asked the first question . " There is nothing like a little laughter to help break the tension . <p> Remember , maintain eye contact , but do n't stare . Looking down or away occasionally , or leaning forward to show interest , helps add liveliness to the interview . <p> When the interviewer is finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . Ask a few that are important to you , but do n't overdo it . The interviewer may resent it if you delay the interviewing schedule . <p> Before you leave , tell the recruiter that you are interested in their position ( if you are ) , and ask what the next step is if that was not covered previously . Shake hands again and thank him , her , or them for the opportunity . It is also appropriate to ask for a business card . <p> The Non-Traditional Interview This type of interview may include a standard interview , but also include a meal or cocktail party , or it may be a group interview where more than one candidate is being interviewed . Whatever the venue , remember that it is an interview . It is easy to get distracted if the interview is in a non-standard format . <p> If your interview includes food and/or drinks , the interviewer is observing how you handle social situations . See the section on dining etiquette if you need to brush up . Talk to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postive impression you are trying to make . <p> If your interview is a group interview , you may need to collaborate to solve a problem , or take a leadership role , be a creative problem-solver , or a group enabler . Play to your strengths , but be be an obvious contributor . The interviewer is judging your group skills under pressure . <p> Many interviews these days are being conducted by telephone . The format will be similar to a traditional interview with some important differences . Be sure that you have disabled call waiting if possible , and ask anyone who lives with you to provide quiet while you are on the phone . You must use your voice to create a positive impression because the interviewer can not see you . You may have to be more descriptive than usual and you can not use a gesture to convey a meaning . The great thing is that you do not have to dress up or travel and you can have notes to assist you . However , you have to take care that your answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper frantically to find the points you want to make . Some recruiters are even arranging interviews at locations where a camera allows the interviewer and interviewee to see each other while they are talking by phone . Of course you have to dress up for those . <p> If you are being asked by the interviewer to meet in a hotel room , suggest a neutral site , such as the lobby or a meeting room , or ask someone to go with you . Do n't take a chance .

@@42231703 @2231703/ 9337 @qwx419337 9336 @qwx419336 <h> Writing for Business <p> There are generally three types of writing you will perform in a business setting : letters , memos , and formal reports . You will also spend a fair amount of time filling out forms , but I 'm not including that here . Letters , at least business letters , are used for formal communications , generally outside the organization . However , a general rule of thumb is a business letter deserves a business letter in reply , even though the originator and recipient are within the same organization . Memo 's are generally short , intended to remain inside the organization , to provide information to the recipient ( e.g. , a change in policy ) . Lastly , you will also write formal reports . These are generally discussions of analysis and recommendations . Please note , I 've also identified a short list of suggestions that will help improve your writing . <p> Business Letters <p> Poe suggests five general guidelines to letter writing : <p> Do n't Waste Words <p> Consider the following statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your note under date of March 20 , we have considered the matter carefully and are pleased to tell you that we will be willing to allow you an additional ninety days to make payment on your note . 46 words <p> Now consider the revision suggested by Poe : <p> We are pleased to allow you an additional ninety days to pay your note dated March 20. 17 words <p> Keep the language Lively and Simple <p> A quote from Poe : <p> When you 're writing a letter , express yourself pretty much as you would if you were facing your reader . Would you say to your boss : " My analytical evaluation of the incentive play that has been instituted revealed myriad discrepancies and inconsistencies , with the inevitable result that serous inequities prevail among personnel " ? Of course you would n't ! Here is probably what you say : " I 've studied our present incentive plan carefully , and I think some changes are in order . What bothers me most is about it is that the plan is very fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Stuffy , overblown language has become so common that a name has been coined for it : federalese . This is because federal government writers have a special fondness for abstruse expressions ( abstruse is a federalese word that means hard to understand ) .... Even when you know that the person you are writing to is highly literate , it 's still a good idea to chose the simple word over the showy word &amp;emdash ; not because the read wo n't understand you , but because conversational writing is livelier and more interesting to read. ( pp. 11-12 ) <p> Personalize your Letters <p> Take an extra five minutes and include something about the person in the letter . We all recognize impersonal form letters when we receive them . And yours are just as easy to spot . If you do have a form letter , leave space for additional information . Keep track of contacts likes/dislikes . Almost any good personal information manager ( PIM ) has an address book with space for comments . This can be an invaluable resource for adding life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again , a short list from Poe : <p> Stress what you can do -- not what you ca n't . <p> Do n't tell the client " I ca n't " ..... tell them " I will " or " I suggest " <p> Stay away from negative words and phrases . <p> Had you read our advertisement carefully , you would know that a year 's experience is required of all applicant 's . <p> versus : <p> As noted in our ad , a year 's experience is required for this position . <p> While you would probably enjoy writing the more negatively phrased response , do n't . A brief moment of satisfaction is not worth it . <p> Do more than you have to . Currently our hospital does not sell durable medical equipment to individuals . However , I 've enclosed a copy of the yellow pages listings of companies who would be able to help you . <p> Time your letters for best results . <p> Time is a luxury most of us wish we had more off . When you receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a week , acknowledge it , and explain when you will have the information requested . <p> NOTE : Sometimes it is a good idea to let a week or more go by before you respond . How many of you want to hear that you did n't get the job within a day of submitting an application ? Would you believe that the company really read your rn++sumn++ ? <p> Use Correct Letter Form <p> Blocked or semi-blocked ? The answer depends on the company . I personally use a Full-Blocked style of letter writing . This means that everything , from the date , the recipients mailing address , the body of the letter , and complimentary close and signature is flush left . I find I make fewer mistakes that way . Most word processors available today have a variety of templates to assist you in writing correct business letters , some of which even create a personal letterhead for your use .

@@42231709 @2231709/ <h> Sample Personal Statement for Thermal-Fluid Sciences <p> When I proceed to write this Personal Statement , I repeatedly ask myself two questions . The first is , " what is the ultimate motive for my pursuing an advanced degree program in thermal fluid sciences in a country far away from my own ? " To answer this question , it necessarily implies that at the age of 30 , I , a female engineer , have to relinquish my present career with its stable income , give up my comfortable way of life and bid farewell to my family members and long-time friends . Yet , my belief is that all my efforts and sacrifices will pay off , because making such a choice is the best way to fulfill my ideal of becoming an accomplished scientist in the field of Chinese mechanical engineering . My six-year-long work experience has removed much of my rashness . Instead of wearing away my passion for questing for self-actualization and fulfillment , it has made me increasingly mature in thought . I am soberly aware of what I am doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this sober self-knowledge has all the more reinforced my courage and determination to pursue my vision and destiny . <p> The second question I pose to myself is : " In the field of mechanical engineering which is essentially male-dominated , what is my comparative advantage as an applicant who graduated from XX University of Commerce , a university which is not as prestigious as , say , XX University ? " The answer to this question is an extended one , which is to be found in the following part of my Personal Statement . <p> The achievement of a top academic performance in my 4-year undergraduate program in the Department of Refrigeration Engineering is the solid foundation and the starting-point for my present application for a more advanced degree program in mechanical engineering . My strong academic interest , combined with dedicated efforts to coursework and effective learning strategies , rewarded me with a very high GPA ( 3.46 ) , ranking first in a class of 32 students . Throughout the four years , I won almost all categories of scholarships and honors , soliciting admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the class . <p> I believe that , as far as my application is concerned , my greatest advantage lies in my 6-year rich experience of working at the forefront of large-scale projects , involved in the testing , maintenance , and spare parts planning for refrigeration and thermal conduction machinery . When I graduated cum laude from my undergraduate program in 1997 , I was given the privilege of embarking on a Masters program waived of entrance examination . But considering the fact that the second-phase project of XX Nuclear Power Plant , one of Chinas key national projects at that time , called for a large number of talents specializing in refrigeration engineering , I decided to give up the Masters program and set to work on the installation and testing of the Power Plants No. 1 generating unit . <p> For three years from 1997 to 2000 , whether in cold winter or in the scorching summer , I worked indefatigably , leaving my footprints at one construction site after another consisting of sets of large-scale refrigerating units . The on-the-spot installation and debugging helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the configuration and the working principles of refrigerating equipment . At the same time , by studying a large amount of technical literature concerning advanced foreign equipment , I compiled detailed and comprehensive standards equipment maintenance . <p> Since 2000 , I have been engaged in the preparing and planning of the spare parts for equipment maintenance . Even though I have no relevant and mature experiences of spare parts management to borrow from for a typical nuclear power plant , I have done much creative and fundamental work by preparing a spare-parts database for all the plants 600 equipment systems . I launched and organized the implementation of the coding project for more than 60000 spare parts and completed the spare-parts plan for the first major equipment replacement for the No. 1 generating unit in the plants phase-II construction . Busy as I have been , I have never ceased to make efforts to improve my professional knowledge and expertise . I have been to XX and elsewhere to attend seminars , workshops and training programs where I exchanged experiences with XX experts from Britain , South Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power plant . This allowed me to be exposed to the cutting-edge knowledge and technology in my area of specialization and to constantly enhance my professional standards . <p> One important product from my 6-year work experience is my development of sound teamwork and a rigorous scientific research attitude . We know that for a large-scale project like the XX Nuclear Power Plants phase-II construction , it is absolutely impossible for any single individual to realize the integration of the power networks and the subsequent power generation . The job that I have been responsible for is directly related to the issue of project safety , especially that of nuclear safety . This requires me to be constantly on the alert , be meticulous to the minutest detail and have a strong sense of responsibility . I believe that such a kind of mentality as I have developed will be very conducive to my future study and academic research . <p> As I have described in the foregoing text , a solid professional foundation , precious work experience , strong team spirit and a rigorous scientific attitude are what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely based on those factors that I am convinced that I will fruitfully complete my proposed program and have an even more fruitful career in the future . <p> University of XX , which is ranked 25 in mechanical engineering , is exactly where I would like to undertake my study . I wish to concentrate on Thermal-Fluid Sciences , with special stress on new refrigerating and air-conditioning technology and on modern ecologically-friendly energy-saving technology . I believe that the University of XX will give the best education I can expect in mechanical engineering that may facilitate greater achievements in my future career
