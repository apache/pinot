I think the system i 'm getting blocks all xbl connections when in RGH mode anyways , so i should be ok <p> So can you explain what 's the point in doing this method of running the games like GOD if you can just run FSD and loaded the games from the GAME tab from the HD anyway ? <p> If you boot the official MS dash with the RGH hack off you will not get banned . <p> However if the RGH hack is on even if you are not in FSD and on the MS dash you will be banned before you connect to Xbox Live <p> Its for people who do n't  use FSD , i use the MS dash on my Jtag so i can just have my main profile signed in and use it like a normal console . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Gotchya ! So this is the way you have your system setup is ..... <p> A dummy profile auto signed in ( offline ) on boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with your Live ( offline ) account ? <p> And this method will not write anything to your profile its should n't so MS can see it ? Or is it only if you run FSD at anytime is writes stuff to a profile it shouldnt , the normal xbox dash does n't  do this ? But obviously you 'll want a dummy profile signed in when you do this step ..... <p> Gotchya ! So they way you have your system setup is ..... <p> " You not want to load up NEX 2 GOD this application converts installed games ( NXE ) to Games on Demand games ( GoDs ) which will play without the disc been present in the console . <p> I have a quickboot shortcut to NXE2God so i can launch it from the Microsoft Dashboard , if you do n't  you will need to launch it with XEX Menu or Freestyle Dash . " <p> Yes you can sign your profile in on the MS dash fine , the reason i have a dummy profile signing in is that i have FSD set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the Xbox animation when it powers on . That will take me directly to FSD so i can FTP content to the console . <p> And yes i have a quick boot shortcut to NXE2God in the Demo 's folder , I can also load XEX Menu and other homebrew from there . <p> As long as you do n't  have your live profile signed in when playing any homebrew you are fine . <p> insane , I am kind of fooked up in here . I have a profile with 30+k gamerscore . If I make my ixtreme flashed console into a dualboot RGH can I play the games using that profile only ? My confusion is , I want to have the games played with that profile , and occasionally want to sign in to live ( with RGH off ) . Is this possible ? And if I play an ISO in offline and then connect to live ( with rgh off ) will there be any problem with achievements update ? <p> So this will take up the full 7 odd GB on the HD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was 7GB , i then used exiso to extract the file from the iso file , when it finished the folder for raiden was only 480 odd meg big ! ! <p> I 'm thinking over going over to using NXE instead of FSD .

@@21398815 @1398815/ <p> This tutorial will tech you how to transfer a Game Boy save game from either a real Game Boy cartridge or emulator to the virtual console version of that game on the Nintendo 3DS . Although this should work for any Game Boy game which has a virtual console released on the 3DS i 'm going to focus on the original Pokemon games . <p> Later this year when Pokemon Moon and Pokemon Sun are released you will be able to transfer Pokemon from from the virtual console versions of Pokemon Red , Blue , Yellow or Green to Pokemon Moon and Pokemon Sun . This is the first time you will have officially been able to trade Pokemon from the first generation games to the current generation . <p> If you have never played the original Pokemon Red , Blue , Yellow or Green this is likely not a major thing , however if you have your original save game from 16 years ago like I do , or 20 years ago if your in Japan then it will be pretty cool to transfer Pokemon you caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game which will allow you to battle over the internet . <p> What do I need to transfer my Pokemon save games from my real Game Boy cartridge or emulator to my 3DS ? <p> GameBoy emulator capable of exporting a " battery file " version of your save . VBA-M is capable of this and will be used in this tutorial . <p> OptionalA Game Boy Transferer 2 , this is only required if you wish to use a save game from an original Game Boy cartridge , follow this link for instructions on dumping a save from a cartridge , then come back to this guide once you have your save . <p> Notes before getting started : <p> It 's beyond the scope of this tutorial to teach you how to hack your 3DS , if your on firmware 9.2 or below you can hack your 3DS very easily . I have an old tutorial which goes through the process of hacking a 3DS or 3DS XL using the gateway flash card , however newer free solutions exist now , i 'd suggest you look in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can auto boot in to this when the 3DS is powered on , so very convenient when setup . <p> This tutorial presumes you have a hacked your 3DS and have basic knowledge of using a hacked 3DS , if you have a hacked 3DS and do not have SaveDataFiler installed , you can download it here , simply install the CIA like any other using BigBlueBox or another CIA installer . SaveDataFiler will then appear as an application on your home screen . <p> Let 's get started ! <p> Transferring Your Pokemon Save Games To The 3DS : <p> 1 . First you need to have started a playing the Pokemon virtual console game you wish to restore your old save game to , if you have n't simply start playing the game and save it after the introduction . <p> 2 . Load up SaveDataFiler <p> 3 . On the user tab scroll down until you see 01710 , 01711 or 01712 , these are the save games for your Pokemon games . <p> 10 . Open this folder and you should see a file called sav.dat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file extension to a . sav and it will be usable with a Game Boy emulator . <p> 11 . Keep the above folder open , you now want to find the save game you wish to transfer to the 3DS . <p> I have dumped my saves from my actual GameBoy cartridges using the Game Boy Transferer 2 , however saves from emulators will also work perfectly fine . <p> Note : the save game you are transferring must be 32KB ( 32,768 bytes ) . If your save game is larger it will show up as corrupted on the 3DS . <p> 12 . As you can see below my Pokemon Yellow save is the correct size , however my Pokemon Red Save is slight larger : <p> 13 . I will teach you how to ensure your save game is compatible , even if your save game is the correct size it will not hurt to follow the process below to be 100% sure . <p> As in the screenshot above ensure your Rom / Save are named the same and load your save up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 . Once you are in game go to Files &gt; Export &gt; Battery file <p> 15 . Name and save this exported file , it 's important the file type you export here is a . sav <p> 16 . As you can see my savegame is now the correct file size to be used on the Nintendo 3DS - 32KB ( 32,768 bytes ) <p> 17 . Rename this to sav and change the file extension to . dat , then simply copy the sav.dat to the folder on the 3DS 's SD card you opened earlier , overwriting the existing sav.dat <p> 18 . Now put the SD card back in to the 3DS , power the 3DS on and load SaveDataFiler again , this time selecting the SD tab and highlighting the savegame you wish to restore , if you have multiple the last save you backed up will be at the bottom of the list , which will likely be the save you want to restore . We can confirm this as we know " 00001710 " is the save I 'd for Pokemon Red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import this save back to the 3DS <p> 19 . Press " A " to confirm the import , this will overwrite the current save game with the save game from your original cartridge or emulator <p> 20 . All been well the save game will import fine <p> 21 . That 's it , you can now use your savegame from your original Game Boy cartridge or emulator on your 3DS 's virtual console copy of the game ! <p> Above : My 16 year old Pokemon Red save in use on the Nintendo 3DS re-release of Pokemon Red , with the same save game still on my original Game Boy . <p> I cant imagine too many people have their original Pokemon saves all these years on , i 'm amazed the battery in my game cartridges are still working after more than 16 years . I actually dumped my save games from the cartridges 6-7 years ago , however my Pokemon Red and Yellow cartridges are still going strong today in 2016 ! <p> I hope this helps someone who wishes to transfer a GameBoy save to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon and Sun once released . <p> If you have any questions do ask and I will do my best to try and help , I hope I have explained the process in enough detail however . <p> I remember back when I was young my friend 's used to always have rumours on how to get a Mew , a popular one was he was hiding under a truck by the SS Anne from what I remember .

I remember reading about it on a random Geocities page that you could use a GameShark device and a bunch of codes to make Mew appear . I had a Game Genie instead , and was too young to understand most of the instructions on that page and mixed up GameShark and Game Genie , so I tried for several hours to do something with the Game Genie but noting happened , haha . <p> I eventually managed to get a GameShark for my GameBoy , shops around here did n't really have stuff like that . I half think I persuaded my Dad to order it from a magazine for my birthday or something . Likewise i remember printing a massive list of codes off a Geocities website too . <p> I can still remember the code to turn all wild Pokemon in to Mew ! 0115D8CF - I guess I must have used that code a lot haha . <p> So I followed this guide to the letter with my copy of Blue and my copy of Yellow . I ended up getting the notification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the only option was to start a new game . Any ideas ? <p> /CENTER So I followed this guide to the letter with my copy of Blue and my copy of Yellow . I ended up getting the notification for both games that my save file had been corrupt and then the only option was to start a new game . Any ideas ? 64320 @qwx264320 <p> I presume you exported the save file from an emulator ? even if the file size is exact this will certainly help if you did n't do this step : <p> Also in window are you showing file extensions ? if not you could have renamed the file save.dat.dat which would also cause issues . <p> Hi , I had a huge problem for a while doing this , and I want to share how I fixed it . First of all the problem was n't a corrupted file . After importing the game with the new sav.dat file , NOTHING changed on my save file , no corrupt save file , no error message in savedatafiler . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state feature . Also , the virtual console would automatically do a save state when closing the game , and relaunching that save state when re-opening it , totally ignoring the save I just imported . <p> I realized there was a difference between the usersavedata content in this thread and mine . In the folder where the save is located , besides my sav.dat file , I had 2 dat files " rsm1.dat " and rsm2.dat " , instead of having the securevalue.dat as shown in the example . Those 2 files were actually the save state file the virtual console was using . <p> Guess what I did ... I deleted both of them . When re-importing , the game file was corrupted ... BUT it kept my sav.dat file intact ! Game started off from the beginning ( instead of the resume save state ) , and I could use the ACTUAL " CONTINUE " of my sav.dat file . <p> Thanks for sharing your experience MasterHoover , hopefully that will be of help with others ! It 's not something i encountered ( i did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) however thanks for taking the time to provide a solution for anyone else who has that issue ! <p> Cool , I did n't even realize you had made a guide for doing this . Last February a basically figured it out myself through trial and error . <p> I can make a suggestion though . Since you need to use a much older computer with a parallel port to use the GameBoy Transfer 2 , this may be pretty complicated for many people if they want to backup from their original cartridges . Basically how I backup my GB/GBC savefiles is with a Mega Memory Card , then restore it onto my EverDrive GB with the respective rom , which I then take the savefile from the SD card . People always say it 's impossible to use a MMC with an Everdrive , but all you have to do is just keep the MMC switched off until you select the rom . After loading the rom , while you see the " GAMEBOY " boot screen , you switch on the MMC . Other types of flascarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those USB flashcarts . <p> Unfortunately my MMC started crapping out and made it very difficult to use , and now it wo n't hold saves at all anymore , I assume due to overuse or age . It will get the job done though and backup all GB/GBC saves for anyone who buys one . I was just doing a lot of back and forth between cart and computer , and I think that wore it out . <p> When I bought the MMC back in 2014 , it cost me $7 . Now they 're unfortunately pretty costly since more people are wanting them to preserve their old GB/GBC saves . I did recently buy a BrainBoy back in September , which basically does the same thing as a MMC , but I 'm not sure if I can use it on an EverDrive since it has no switch . I have n't tried it yet . They are still super cheap though , so it 's at least worth a buy to preserve your save . However , someone told me about this device , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for a parallel port or flashcart/everdrive . All of these options will be somewhat costly if you do n't already have any of these , but in the end it 's much cheaper and easier than finding a computer with a parallel port . <p> All last year I wanted to make a video guide of this sometime before SM or the PokeBank update were released , but I have n't had the motivation to spend time making it . <p> I spent around 30 USD on mine and it works perfectly . It does n't come with a USB cable but I was able to use my PS3 's controller cable to back up my Pokemon Silver save directly to my PC . No mega memory or dealing with a parallel port or any of that nonsense and it 's cheaper than the other option listed above . <p> I spent around 30 USD on mine and it works perfectly .

Thanks . I 'd also recommend it over the other options as well . I 'll buy one if I happen to need to dump GB/GBC saves again . I pretty much play those exclusively with the EverDrive now so I do n't need to worry about batteries crapping out on me . Though I still plan to keep holding on to my cartridge collection . I do n't think the BrainBoy would work with my EverDrive anyway without having a switch . <p> Basically how I backup my GB/GBC savefiles is with a Mega Memory Card , then restore it onto my EverDrive GB with the respective rom , which I then take the savefile from the SD card .

I do actually have one of those Mega memory devices too . I got that many years before the GB Transferer 2 to backup my saves incase the worst happened , knowing i couldnt get it on my PC at that time but it was better than nothing .

@@21398816 @1398816/ <p> If you 've ever tried to play online with a Nintendo Switch behind a pfSense or similar router/firewall , you will likely find out of the box it does n't quite work alright . Everytime you try to go online on either Splatoon , Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or even Fast RMX you 'll just get constant errors when trying to join with the Error Code ' 2618-0516 ' Unable to connect to the other user 's console / NAT Traversal Process has failed . <p> This is due to pfSense 's out of the box security model with randomizing ports on outgoing connections . It can be easily resolved though by taking the following steps in your Router Config : <p> Assuming you are using the out of the box setup you will have your router at 192.168.1.1 and a DHCP server running which is handing IP 's out between **27;96;TOOLONG . If you are using a different setup , adjust the below steps accordingly . <p> Browse to Services &gt; DHCP Server &gt; LAN and then scroll down to " DHCP Static Mappings for this Interface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your Nintendo Switch 's Mac , you can get it from by going on the Nintendo Switch 's Settings application and selecting ' Internet ' and Connection Status . Please remember , if you use an ethernet adaptor when in the Dock you will have a different MAC address for ethernet vs wireless . If you intend to use both methods , you should repeat this for each . <p> In the example I used , I gave my Nintendo Switch the IP of 192.168.1.13 because it is within the subnet of the Router 's LAN interface but outside of the normal DHCP Pool of random addresses ( 100-200 ) meaning the Switch can always have it . <p> Apply the changes once done in pfSense , and hard reboot the Nintendo Switch ( Press and hold power until the Power Options display and select ' Power Off ' as oppose to ' Sleep ' as this will turn off the network interface ) . Then boot up your Switch fresh and you should find it gets its new IP address . <p> Next up , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pfSense . To do this , browse to Firewall &gt; NAT like so and then select the Outbound Tab as seen below . <p> You need to then select ' Hybrid Outbound NAT ' and click Save and then Apply the changes . <p> The Mapping section just underneath should now become available and you can click the Green ' Add ' button to setup your Static Port rule . <p> For the rule , you will need to add the Nintendo Switch 's IP to the ' Source ' , tick the ' Static Port ' in the Translation area and then give your rule a nice description . Then you can Save the rule and then click the Apply button to set the rules live on your pfSense box . <p> All going well , you should now be able to join other users games when playing on the Nintendo Switch . <p> However , all is not over - You currently wo n't be able to host your own games doing this setup . But that 's solvable in the next step . <p> Enabling UPnP <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet clever protocol which can be used on your home network which allows devices to request ports be opened on demand on the firewall / NAT to allow the Switch to make itself connectable to the wider world which in turn let 's you become the host on games or host your own private sessions for friends . <p> To enable it in pfSense all you need to do is browse to Services &gt; UPnP &amp; NAT-PMP and enable it : <p> Tick the ' Enable ' box , as well as UPnP and NAT-PMP specific boxes . You will need to make sure the External Interface is set to WAN and your local network ( LAN ) interface is selected at the bottom as seen above . <p> Click Save at the bottom and the UPnP Service will start . <p> Summary and NAT Types <p> Once these changes are made , you should find no problem connecting to Games or hosting your own on your Nintendo Switch . <p> An interesting point is that Nintendo has added ' NAT Types ' to the Nintendo Switch which can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one out of the box with pfSense ; my NAT Type was D and I was unable to join games without getting the 2618-0516 Error . After making the changes in this guide , I got it to C when just doing the Static Port and could join other games and I got it to B once UPnP was also enabled and could also host my own games to . <p> After doing some digging , it seems NAT Type A which is perfect can only be achieved when there is no Firewall or NAT taking place ( ie ; the Nintendo Switch is directly connected to the internet with an external IP address ) . As such , a Grade B is the best you can expect when the Switch is behind any Router sharing an IP address and is a good enough grade to both join and host online games when playing on the Nintendo Switch . <p> I hope this guide helps , and any questions please drop below and we will do our best to assist <p> if without pfsense i can not solve the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt;. &lt; i have try every method that suggested when i search through google ( set the ip at DMZ , port forwading the port 165535 ) enable UPnP. i solve it for 2 days but i 'm still current having NAT TYPE D seriously i do n't  know what to do anymore ............... 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21398821 @1398821/ <p> It 's now possible hack the Wii U and setup a homebrew channel which is capable of loading Wii U homebrew applications and games from the SD card . <p> This is very easy to setup once you know how , you essentially need to copy some files to the SD card inside your Wii U , then visit a webpage that will exploit the Wii U for you via the web browser . <p> May 2016 - Updated for Firmware 5.5.1 . Since i created this tutorial newer Wii U firmware versions have become hackable and the hack has become a lot more stable . I have updated the tutorial to reflect this . <p> Currently you can hack any Wii U on the latest firmware which is version 5.5.1 at the time of writing ( May 2016 ) , a complete list of Wii U firmware versions supported by this tutorial are : <p> 5.5.1 <p> 5.5 <p> 5.4 <p> 5.3.2 <p> 5.1.0 <p> 5.0.0 <p> 4.1.0 <p> 4.0.0 <p> 3.1.0 <p> 3.0.0 <p> 2.1.0 <p> I 've created a video that shows how your homebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup : <p> ? <p> Below is a step by step tutorial below that will easily allow you to exploit your Wii U.Getting started setting up the homebrew channel on the Wii U : <p> To get started you will need the following : <p> Wii U on one of the hackable firmwares listed above . <p> SD Card that is FAT32 formatted . <p> A way to block the Wii U from accessing the internet , however remain on your home network . <p> 1 . It 's presumed you already have a Wii U that is exploitable if your following this tutorial , at present all Wii U 's can be hacked that . However for reference in the future the bundles listed in the " show button " below were released before or when 5.3.2 was the current firmware so should be exploitable : <p> 3 . This is really important ! ! You must do this step and block your Wii U from updating , their is an easy way for if your home router is unable to block website , however if your home router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's update servers on your home router instead so you are not relying on anyone else to do so . <p> To block updates on your home router is where some basic knowledge of networking and your home network setup would be a great benefit , you should be able to do this somewhere on your routers configuration page if you have a good router . Look for something like access restrictions , this is where it becomes hard to give a one solution fits all answer as home networks can be setup in many different ways using many 1000 's of different routers which all have different configuration options . <p> If you can block websites or hostnames on your router you need to block the following : <p> **31;191;TOOLONG <p> nus.cdn.shop.wii.com <p> **29;224;TOOLONG <p> **25;255;TOOLONG <p> **27;282;TOOLONG <p> c.shop.nintendowifi.net <p> cbvc.nintendo.net <p> cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net <p> Once you have blocked the following hostnames on your router if you try visit one of the above addresses on your computer 's web browser after blocking the addresses you should see an error stating the site ca n't be accessed as the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> On your SD Card you should have a folder called wiiuapps - inside the app 's folder should be a folder for each homebrew app that contains it 's files , if you wish to download some additional app 's at a later date all you need to do is copy them in to this folder . <p> I have included the following homebrew applications , all should work on firmwares up to 5.5.1 : <p> Hid To Vpad - Emulates the Wii U gamepad input using various USB HID devices , such as a GameCube , Wii U Pro Controller , PS3 controller and so on <p> Homebrew Launcher - Loads all the other homebrew applications in this list <p> IOSU OTP ( 5.5.1 only ) - Allows you to obtain your Wii U 's unique OPT via an IOSU exploit , this could be useful in the future for Custom Firmware or better hacks than we currently have . ( Photograph your TV to save this , and do not share with anyone else ) . <p> Loadiine GX2 - Allows you to load out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NNU Patcher - Allows you to start the Nintendo eShop on an older firmware , if you have your firmware spoofed to the latest firmware available . <p> Our Loader - Allows you to load games discs from other regions ( Region free game loader ) <p> Saviine - dumps and injects savegames of any title that is entered over network to a PC application . <p> Snake - Clone of the classic Nokia snake game on the Wii U <p> Space Game V2 Beta - Space shooter game for the Wii U <p> U Paint - You can paint using the Wii U 's touch screen gamepad <p> Wup Installer - installs public titles such as game updates , can also spoof your firmware to the latest version <p> Loading the Homebrew Launcher on Wii U : <p> To load the homebrew launcher we are going to exploit the web browser on the Wii U , so load the web browser up : <p> When the web browser loads up close any web pages that might be open , you should see the favorite bookmarks page : <p> Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this brings up the bookmark editor . Click on the first bookmark to edit it : <p> Type in a easy to remember name such as " Wii U Homebrew Launcher " , then below for the address type wiiu.insanenutter.com and click done : <p> Now before continuing press the home button to quit the Wii U 's web browser , this will save the bookmark you just added so you do n't need to keep adding it every time you want to exploit the Wii U. Load the web browser again and click on the " Wii U Homebrew Launcher " bookmark you added : <p> This is where things can get tricky as the Wii U can crash many times before you get the exploit to run correctly for the first time . <p> However the good news is once the exploit has launched successfully on your Wii U once , it will usually launch on the first attempt after that . All you can do is keep trying to launch the exploit if it fails or the Wii U crashes . <p> Some tips i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cache up by randomly browsing the internet , for example the Digiex Forums . Then quit the Wii U Browser , Load the system settings , then quit the system settings . This will save anything you can done in the browser since the Wii U was powered on . <p> I got Nimrod to test this on his 5.5.1 Wii U and he was able to load the Homebrew Channel on his first try , in comparison on 5.3.2 the very first time i tried it took me 50+ attempts , totaling around an hour and a half . I 'd suggest you put a TV show on and just keep trying , as you can see from the video I posted the Homebrew Launcher now works first time , near enough every time . <p> Others have not been as lucky , in general though I have found the exploit to be quite reliable once i managed to launch it first time . It can be randomly unreliable though , however it 's the best we currently have . <p> When the exploit triggers , the Homebrew Launcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your Wii U. <p> Any homebrew applications on your SD card under the wiiuapps folder will be displayed here : <p> You can click on your homebrew applications to read more information about them or load them : <p> To exit out of a homebrew application press the home button in the middle of the Wii U gamepad , this will take you back to the homebrew launcher so you can load another homebrew application . <p> If you press the home button when on the Homebrew Launcher menu it will take you to the Mii Maker , you can quit back to the Wii U 's home screen from here . <p> If you wish to re-load the Homebrew Launcher menu again you can simply do so by loading the Mii Maker from the Wii U 's home screen . The Mii maker is patched in memory to load the Homebrew Launcher until the Wii U is powered off , meaning you do not need to go through the process of loading the web browser exploit again until you power the Wii U off . <p> After powering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Homebrew Launcher you must load the web browser again , click on the bookmark you saved for the Homebrew launcher and go through the process of triggering the exploit again . It should trigger a lot easier now , most of the time it will trigger on the first or second attempt for me , more often than not the first . <p> It 's now possible to permanently install the Homebrew Launcher to the Wii U 's Home Screen , now you have a working Homebrew entry point you can now follow this tutorial Wii U Permanent Homebrew Channel / Launcher Install , the end result been you no longer have to launch Homebrew from the Wii U 's web browser . The added benefit is the boot rate is 100% successful every time . <p> Q : I have returned to the home screen but not powered my Wii U off , how can I re launch the homebrew menu ? A : Simply load the Mii Maker , you will not actually load the Mii Maker but the homebrew menu instead . This however is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wii U is powered off , this is why you need to run the exploit again via the web browser the next time you wish to use the homebrew menu again . <p> All apps are the are the latest version available with full 5.5.1 support as of 16th October 2016 . <p> Some apps below will only work on 5.5.1 such as IOSU OTP , at this point in time you should update to 5.5.1 if you have not already done so , their is now reason to be on a lower firmware version at this point . Updating to 5.5.1 in the future might be difficult once Nintendo releases a new update . I am on 5.5.1 and all the homebrew apps below work perfectly fine . <p> You can now use the Wii U Homebrew App store to update any of the apps below directly from the Wii U , an even download additional homebrew apps as they become available . <p> Hid To Vpad - Emulates the Wii U gamepad input using various USB HID devices , such as a GameCube , Wii U Pro Controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loads all the other homebrew applications in this list <p> IOSU OTP ( 5.5.1 only ) - Allows you to obtain your Wii U 's unique OPT via an IOSU exploit , this could be useful in the future for Custom Firmware or better hacks than we currently have .

I have updated the tutorial to reflect this along with my http : //wiiu.insanenutter.com exploit mirror . <p> If you have previously followed this tutorial and are using my exploit mirror you will need to update your homebrew launcher version , this is included in the Homebrew Starter Pack , linked to above . <p> Thanks for the tutorial !

Thanks 64320 @qwx264320 <p> What happens after that ? has the Wii U crashed ? <p> Can you confirm the Homebrew Launcher files are on the correct place on your SD card and the SD Card is FAT32 formatted ? <p> New member here and new to the whole Wii U stuff . I have a question " Insanenutter " in the tutorial you have other files and the Boot.elf file , do we need all these files or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this so I can use my other games on my SD card . <p> So I have a few questions on this . To start I 'm running on 5.5.1 and I have a FAT32 formatted SD card with all the necessary files . I also shut down the Wii U 's ability to update via the DNS . Yet I still run into some problems . <p> 1 ) Should I have my SD card inserted before I run the exploit , or does it need to run the exploit first ? <p> 2 ) I am also getting a black screen upon running the exploit , but I am not sure if the black screen is because I am doing it right or wrong . I decided to fill up my browser cache , but I am not sure how much I should exactly do that . I went to about 8 different sites but I do n't know if I need to do it more . It is just unsettling to think I may have to sit here 50+ times when it may not be set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit or should the exploit run immediately . <p> 3 ) I feel as though I am missing a step somewhere . I know the kernel exploit involves terminal commands and this seems to not require such steps . <p> 4 ) As of June 5th , is the exploit still up and running ? I know this was updated in May but anything could have happened in a month 's time . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

These guys and many others are the reason we have Wii U Homebrew today ! <p> Now i have one question . Maybe i 'm too blind to see it . I 've installed the permanent homebrew launcher channel and also the iosu Sysnand ( CFW ) . So , now , when i turn on my Wii U it 's in the normal SysNAND . First of all i push the DS Game ( Homebrew Launcher Icon ) . The HBC starts . Next step i will start the CFW Booter . So . Now i am at the iosu ( SysNAND CFW ) . At this SysNAND CFW there is also the icon of the Homebrew Launcher . When i push this button again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When i start the HBL Icon from the CFW , which one of the Homebrewlaunchers will be loaded ? The one from the normal SysNAND or the one from SysNAND CFW ? Or it does n't matter and it is the same ? <p> in example : In CFW when i open the internetbrowser and go to the loadiine website and load the HBL . Is this the same HBL , like it will be , when i start it from the SysNAND CFW over the DS Game ( Homebrew Launcher Icon ) ? ? ? <p> The Homebrew Launcher should be running in your CFW nand , easiest way to confirm this would be to arrange your home screen differently on both nands and exit the Homebrew Launcher and you should find your back to your CFW nand . <p> Is it possible to get different Homescreens for both Nands ? When i will create a folder at the CFW Nand , it will also be there at the normal SysNAND . I thought this will work on Rednand . Maybe this does n't work at CFW . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFW / Rednand / Emunand , this will un link them . However be aware you will not be able to use anything installed on one nand on the other then . I personally do n't  think you need a CFW / Rednand / Emunand at this point , not just for using homebrew anyway . <p> You need to buy the game , if you install the game with WUP installer you have no legit licence for the game , meaning it will not work on your sysnand without running another exploit first , defeating the point of even doing this for easier access to homebrew . <p> And can I install haxchi with a WUP installer game and then install CBHC with it to boot with CFW ? Or should I buy the game ? I know it 's complicated but the economy in my country is n't good and I ca n't buy a ds game right now . I do n't want to wait a lot because maybe nintendo will release an update . Thanks for being patient with me . <p> If you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Nintendo Wii U Homebrew Channel Hack Guide . You can load CFW from the Homebrew Launcher , however you are stuck with launching it from the web browser every time , not as convenient , however totally free . <p> If you want to use Haxchi , CBHC or any other hack involving a DS game you have to purchase a supported DS game from the Eshop . <p> The 33c3 hacking conference starts in a few days time , their is going to be a talk on the Wii U , so you never know if you can wait a few days more Wii U hacks might be released .

Normally you can only use Microsoft approved hard drives which are significantly more expensive , costing up to 3x the price of a normal 2.5 " SATA hard drive . <p> This tutorial focuses on hacking a 250gb drive , which was the largest drive possible in 2009 when i created this tutorial , however it is now possible to hack drives of the following sizes : 500gb , 320gb , 250gb , 120gb , 60gb and 20gb . Simply follow this tutorial and download the security sector that matches the size of the hard drive you wish to hack . <p> 500GB security sector added on 04/03/2014 <p> 320GB security sector added on 20/09/2011 <p> The Backstory : <p> After having a 20gb drive for the last 4 years and getting annoyed about having to constantly delete stuff I did something about it . I purchased a nice 250gb laptop hard drive for -30 and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think doing your own drive is the way to go as Microsoft charge -89.99 just for the 120gig drive here in the UK , at that price I could make 3x 250gig drives for the same price ! <p> This guide will show you how I did that , its worth mentioning that you can also hack a 20gb , 60gb and 120gb , 250gb , 320gb and 500gb drives , however when creating this tutorial 250gb was the largest drive possible to hack . I personally think hacking a 500gb drive is now best value for money . <p> Note to Xbox 360 Slim owners : <p> If you have an Xbox 360 slim you can also hack a hard drive using this guide and connect it directly to the console , have a look at the end of the guide for information on how to connect your hacked drive to an Xbox 360 slim . <p> Let 's hack an Xbox 360 hard drive : <p> Ok let 's get started , first you will need to buy a hard drive to use in the Xbox 360 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Digital drive series : LONG ... <p> Be sure to rename the HDDSS250GB.BIN to HDDSS.BIN if you are hacking a 250gb drive or HDDSS320.bin to HDDSS.BIN if you are hacking a 320gb drive . <p> The end result should be something like this , do n't worry you will not have an UNDO.BIN yet . <p> Hacking the Western Digital hard drive to work in the Xbox 360 : <p> You will need to shut down your pc now , I would advise you disconnect all the other hard drive in your computer just to stop you accidently hacking the wrong drive ! <p> Now connect the hard drive you want to hack to your computer : <p> Power your computer back on , before you carry on it might be an idea to enter you bios configuration and ensure the SATA operation mode is set to ATA or disable AHCI depending on the options you have . On some motherboards this can also be called legacy or enhanced , if you are presented with this you want to set it to legacy . This will vary depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most common cause for people not been able to flash there drives . <p> Now tell your computer to to boot from the usb drive , this will be different depending on your motherboard , on my pc I have to press F11 then select the drive I wish to boot from . <p> You will find yourself at a dosprompt , type hddhackr and press enter . <p> All been well hddhackr will have listed all the drives in your system , in my case the drive I want to hack is number 5 . <p> After entering the number you will be asked if you want to dump , flash or restore the firmware , select F to flash . <p> Type in the name of the security sector you want to flash , this will be HDDSS.BIN if you have followed this tutorial . <p> You will get a message saying that the information in file HDDSS.BIN does not match the drive 's firmware info . Do you want to flash the Xbox 360 compatible firmware . <p> Say yes to this : <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition 0/2/3 ( HddHackrv1.30 will not display any message about partitioning , this is normal ) <p> Again say yes to this , you drive should now be hacked , congratulations ! <p> An UNDO.BIN will have been saved on your USB drive , keep this safe as you will need it for if you ever want to restore the drive back to normal . <p> Opening the 360 drive enclosure : <p> Now you need to open your Xbox 360 hard drive , you will need a Torx T6 screwdriver to do this . <p> You can now remove the top , the mechanism to lock/unlock the HDD-bay on your Xbox 360 console might fall out do n't worry it 's easy enough its put back together , just look how it is in my photo below . <p> Now you have 4 more screws to remove , these require a Torx T10 screwdriver , you can then remove the metal case . <p> Now you can unplug the power and sata cable from the drive , then slide it out pulling the drive gentily up as you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Restoring the Xbox Classic Emulator and User Content : <p> If you want to restore the Xbox 1 emulator to your newly hacked drive or your save games you will need to connect your old 360 drive to your computer and boot windows . <p> If you do n't  have an old hard drive or simply want to save some time you can download a copy of Hoffmans partition 2 which he uploaded here <p> We are going to backup the Xbox 1 emulator so you will still be able to play Xbox 1 games on the 360 . <p> To do this select Drive &gt; Backup Partition 2 and save the backup . <p> If you want to backup your profiles , saves , arcade games , demos , dlc and videos you basically want to dump your Partition 3 &gt; Content folder , I had to dump a few folders at the time because Xplorer 360 had random crashes for me . <p> When windows has loaded up again load Xplorer 360 Extreme again , remembering to run it with administrator rights and select Drive &gt; Restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old 20gig drive . <p> It is important you just close Xplorer360 after that , massing about with anything else will corrupt Partition 3 . <p> After you have restored any content you can now shut your pc down and put the hard drive drive in your 360 's drive enclosure , it might be an idea to test everything is working correctly before re assembling the enclosure . <p> The hacked drive : <p> Connecting to the Xbox 360 slim : <p> It is also possible to use your hacked drive in the new Xbox 360 slim , with the slim you are not required to insert the hard drive in any enclosure , you can simply connect it to the console . <p> First open the panel at the side , the entry way is on the right side as you look at the Xbox .

Thanks again for the info , much appreciated by my bank balance ! ! <p> I have folowed your great tutorial to the letter and get stuck at the same point every time . I get to the part where you hit f for flash and get a message enter file name for sector 16-22 ( e.g. HDDSS.BIN ) : This is different to your screen shot " You will get a message saying that the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info .

Data on screen on boot is displayed and drive is found on 0XE800 as pri master . I have disconected all other drives for this operation . Hope you can help . <p> I just did this it worked out pretty well . Some notes from when i did it . <p> I had an 8 gig thumb drive . I had to use fat32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . <p> The xplorer 360 app gave me alot of issues and did n't seem to work to well for me . I assume this might be from me using it under windows 7 64 bit pro . <p> Just in case , I had a buddy at work with a spare 360 and transfer cable and was nice enough to lend it to me . So when i was done preping the 250 gig drive . I put the old 20 gig back and backed up on the spare drive my friend had . I poped the 250 gig drive in . It showed half of the drive was used . I assumed this was from trying to restore partition 2 and my content from my 20 through xplorer 360 . I formatted the 250 gig drive in the xbox 360 utilities in the console . It asked me for my serial number for my xbox . I inputted the serial number in and bing all my space back . Tried an old xbox 1st gen game and it did n't work . I then swaped the drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed up on it ) and used the transfer cable . When it was done . everything worked i had my old data and xbox 1st gen games worked no problem . <p> The transfer cables are free if you order them from microsoft and a spare 20 gig drive in a case is 20-30 american on ebay usually . If the second half of the tutorial gives you crap this may be another option to try . <p> when i get to f i hit enter and get a message that asks me to enter file name for sector 16-22 e.g hddss.bin , this file is on my stick so type this in and get another message that tell me that that hddss.bin is not present .

@@21398826 @1398826/ <p> This guide will talk you through the settings needed to resolve the Nintendo Wii U Online Mode when playing behind a pfSense Router/Firewall . This has been tested as working on Mario Kart 8 , Super Smash Bros and Splatoon . <p> When attempting to play any game online on the Nintendo Wii U ; you may be presented with the following error : Error Code : 118-0519 - Unable to connect to partner 's device . <p> Ultimately the problem pfSense and online gaming has is that out of the box , pfSense 's security model is more aligned to a business environment . Specifically , it wo n't let devices open there own ports on the firewall , and it randomly changes the outgoing port when your devices go across the WAN . This causes terrible problems with the Wii U connecting to other Wii U 's which is needed for online mode . <p> The fix has two stages which are documented below to get you back online . <p> Static Ports <p> This fix will stop the pfSense Firewall from editing your ports on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nintendo Wii U a static IP address to allow us to make permanent firewall changes . <p> Log into the Web Interface on your pfSense box , and browse to Services &gt; DHCP Server &gt; LAN and scroll to the bottom where the Static Mapping are . Click the add button and add your Wii U like so : <p> If you do n't know your Wii U 's MAC address , you can get it from the Settings app on the Wii U directly , just go to Settings &gt; Internet &gt; View MAC Address . <p> The IP you give your Wii U should be within the subnet your LAN interface is operating in , but outside the pool your DHCP server hands out leases to . If you are using pfSense out the box without changes , your LAN will be 192.168.1. x and your DHCP pool should be 192.168.1.100-200 . So any IP between 192.168.1.2-99 should be fine . In my example above I did 15 . <p> Once done , click save and Apply the changes . Your Wii U will not immediately get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expired - but you can speed the process up now by physically unplugging the Wii U from the power and then reloading it , it will then ask pfSense for an IP and get its new Static one . <p> The next step is for us to make the Static Port Rule . To do this , browse to Firewall &gt; NAT and then select the Outbound Tab which is highlighted Red below : <p> You need to change the tick box from ' Automatic ' to ' Hybrid ' and click Save and Apply . <p> You will then be able to add rules below it in Mappings . Click ' Add ' to create the new Mapping . <p> You need to enter the Wii U 's new static IP in the Source Area , tick the ' Static Port ' option in Translation and finally give your rule a nice new name . <p> That 's all there is to it , as per before make sure to click Save and Apply on the Firewall . Any new connections from now that go across the pfSense rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ports changed and you will be able to connect to other 's devices . <p> Enabling UPnP <p> This next step is optional , but is highly recommended to ensure you do n't get a ' Strict NAT ' limiting the number of players you can play with on the Nintendo Network as well as allowing you to host your own games . <p> UPnP is a protocol which can be enabled on the pfSense box which allows devices to request there own port forwards on demand . It is n't recommended in a business environment where security is key as it puts the trust into all the devices on your network ; but assuming as your wanting to play on the Nintendo Wii U means your likely in a home user situation where it 's quite common to have UPnP enabled ( most consumer routers do ) . <p> To enable it , browse to Services &gt; UPnP &amp; NAT-PMP : <p> Make sure your External Interface is set to WAN , and your local to LAN . Once done , save your settings and you are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are able to play games across the Nintendo Network from your Wii U. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Now , I always say that the X-Clamp fix is n't a permanent solution . My advice , is to bit the bullet and send in the xbox to get it fixed , the right way . <p> Here we go : <p> 1 ) Call up Xbox Support - 1-800-4-MY-XBOX or 1-800-469-9269 2 ) You will hear the annoying lady talk , and she gives you some " departments " to choose from . One would think that since you want to get your 360 repaired , you would choose the repair center , right ? WRONG ! ! Pick Technical Support . The repair center wont re-register your 360 without the previous owner information . 3 ) Go through the options until you get to a live agent . When he answers , the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; " I recently purchased a Xbox 360 second hand and would like to register it in my name . " I suggest you do not mention it has red ring ! He should say okay , he will get information from you , put you on hold , and then it should be done ! BAM ! It should now be registered to you ! 4 ) Now that does n't get it repaired , so the next step is to go to xbox website ( since there are no outside links I wont give you the address , but it is easy to figure out xbox ; than something many sites have after the address ... ) Choose xbox support -&gt; Repair console ( under console management on the support page ) -&gt; Register a new console -&gt; fill in the same information you gave the agent . When you select done , you should go to the repair page where you can select how you want to get the console to them , this part is self explanatory . You did it ! <p> Just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind will do ! Does n't matter if it is modded , or you tried the X-Clamp fix . They will fix it as long as there is a sticker ! ( I have heard people say they sent them in with not warranty sticker and they got repaired , so if you do n't have a sticker , it is worth a shot to send it in ! ) <p> Works in USA &amp; UK so far ! <p> Here is a simple reminder:If you are having trouble . Take a deep breath and follow this . <p> This time do not say is Red Rings of Death , instead called the agency again and say that your xbox 360 will not run anymore , you get an error on the screen " System Failure , etc. " pretend to follow the steps the agency says and still say you have the same problem , they will suggest you for a repair and for " FREE " , that is how i did it . <p> I just did this walkthrough , and received a FREE repair on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , told the tech about the system failure with code E74 , and promptly turned around the free repair . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21398833 @1398833/ <p> This step by step guide will talk you through a working setup for allowing Multiple Xbox One 's in the same network to get a fully Open NAT and be able to play together in the same games/parties all behind a pfSense Router/Firewall . <p> pfSense is a great piece of software for running on your own hardware ( or theirs ) to make a secure and high throughput Router at home . I myself found that with the growing number of IoT devices and wireless devices in my home that no matter what consumer router I used , it just struggled under the load . As more and more devices get online from Alexa 's , Google Home , Lightbulbs , Alarms , Sensors and the lot ; that you may find yourself in a similar situation and needing something with a bit more power behind your Internet Routing which is where pfSense is perfect . However out of the box , working with Xbox One 's ( and 360 's ) with Xbox Live is a nightmare , you get a Strict NAT by default . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum and other blogs , you may get yourself in a position where you can get one or two open ; however you then find problems joining eachothers games if you have more than one Xbox for example . <p> This guide was put together by two of our own members who both use pfSense , and both have a number of Xbox 's . We did like everyone else and tried to ask for help on pfSense forums , browsed so many sites but could never find one perfect guide which actually works with the latest version of pfSense ( 2.3. x ) . Many of the guides either referred to the previous pfSense ( 2.2. x ) which has a totally different GUI and setup phase and in some cases when on the official pfSense forum got told a lot of rubbish including that its the Xbox 's fault or that enabling IPv6 is the answer ( It 's not , more information later ) . So here we are , we solved it ourselves and fully documented it and in this guide will not only get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to play together in the same Games/Parties to in homes where multiple Xbox 's are in use . <p> This has been fully tested on the latest pfSense at time of writing ( 2.3.3-release-p17 ) and in multiple setups . I for example , run it on a Dedicated hardware using a PPPoE connection ( So like BT Infinity , Sky Fibre etc ) and the other author uses it in a Virtual Environment ( Esxi ) and uses a more traditional cable modem . Both of us have managed to achieve this ; so we know it works in the real world . <p> Essential , there is three components required to achieve a successful open NAT and we will talk you through each one ; one by one below . So let 's begin ! <p> Static IP 's and Static Port <p> The first part to getting an Xbox One or 360 online is to give it some Static Port rules on the outbound NAT . This mean that if an Xbox goes out to the internet on port 3307 for example , the Router will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the NAT . Changing the port is done as a security feature ; however it causes the Xbox trouble when its connecting back and fourth between services and players . <p> To achieve this , first we need to give all the Xbox 's in the home a static IP address . If you are using DHCP to automatically hand out IP 's its simple to give the Xbox a static one . First browse to Services &gt; DHCP Server like so and make sure you are displaying it for the LAN in question ( if you have multiple ) : <p> Then scroll to the bottom and click ' Add ' under Static Mappings . You can then proceed to give your Xbox a dedicated IP every time it asks . Say for example you used the out the box pfSense settings which means your LAN is on the 192.168.1. x range , and gives Dynamic IP 's out on 100-200 . You could like I 've done in the example below give it a static IP of 192.168.1.10 as it is outside the default pool , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the box . <p> If you do n't know the Xbox 's MAC Address , you can get it by firing up the Xbox and going into Network Settings and it will display it to you . <p> Set the static IP and click Save and apply the changes . You may need to hard reset your Xbox for it to ask for a new IP straight away ( Hold power button for 10 seconds ) . Once it 's back online , check again in its Network Settings and make sure its using the new IP you assigned it . <p> The next step is to allow Static Ports on your NAT . To do this , browse to Firewall &gt; NAT . Once it 's loaded , make sure to click on Outbound like below : <p> You need to change the mode for Outbound from automatic , to Hybrid like shown above . <p> Once done , on the Mappings just below it , click Add to Create a new one . This is where you will be defining the Static Port rule on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below example , you will see the rule I made . Place the Xbox 's IP in the Source Port and then under Translation make sure to tick the Static Port like so : <p> Finish it off by giving the Rule a name and click Save . You can then apply the changes . <p> You will need to either repeat this for other devices/IP 's , or you could for example use the Alias Feature if you wanted to do one rule for them all like below by using Firewall &gt; Aliases feature . This is totally optional however and makes no sense if you only have one . <p> This then allows one rule for them all by setting it in the NAT Firewall Rule : <p> Either way , once done , you should end up with your rule in the Outbound NAT like so : <p> You are now set and ready to proceed to the next step below . <p> UPnP / NAT-PMP <p> UPnP is a solution made many years ago which is now pretty much a standard for home networking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Port Forward automatically from the Router . NAT-PMP is an improvement on the standard further ; however tends to live more on Apple based products at the moment . The Xbox One fully supports both of these protocols . <p> Again I must stress ; if you do n't have only trusted devices in your home network ; turning this on does have its risk as it effectively overrules any Firewall based restrictions you may have allowing any devices to make itself public on a specific port on your WAN . In a business environment again it is a no go which is why pfSense does not have it on by default ; but in your own home assuming you look after all your devices and trust those connected it is safe to turn on . It is turned on by default on most home routers . <p> To turn it on , go to Services &gt; UPnP &amp; NAT-PMP and enable the three tick boxes like so : <p> Make sure your interface is selected as your LAN and your External Interface is set to your WAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your Xbox can now open the ports it needs on demand . There is alternatives like manually opening the known ports ; however this does n't work when you have Multiple Xbox 's in your own home as they can not use the same ports . The way this works , is if Xbox 1 is using one of the ports , Xbox 2 will then pick another allowing both to keep an Open NAT at all times . <p> NAT Reflection <p> NAT Reflection is a vital component for when you have more than one Xbox One or 360 in the same home wishing to join eachothers games and parties . If you however only have one , you can skip this step . <p> To understand the problem here 's the scenario . You host a game of Destiny and your IP is say 80.80.80.80 . Someone else in your house then fires up there Xbox and tries to join your game by the friends list . Xbox Live will tell your friend to join via say for example 80.80.80.80:5456 which is your external IP and Port to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players outside your home will connect ) . Their Xbox will then connect to that via the pfSense Router ; however the router will end up going out of the local LAN and looping back into itself via the external WAN . Out of the box , pfSense will block this on the grounds of security of trying to traverse internal connections across the WAN . The same applies to parties and other network services . <p> The only way around this , is to enable a feature called NAT Reflection . Some people would argue this is a security risk ; however pretty much every consumer router allows it out of the box . In a business environment where security is key ( which is where pfSense is aimed ) its understandable to block it . So please make your own judgement on this . <p> Out of the box , pfSense supports two modes , one is called Pure NAT in which the firewall rules are re-written to allow it and the behaviour is accepted and one is called NAT + Proxy in which a helper daemon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and sends it back down the LAN interface . Both work , however Pure NAT is the preferred if it works in your environment due to less overhead . <p> Scroll down to Network Address Translation and change NAT Reflection from disabled to Pure NAT . You also need to tick the box ' Enable Automatic outbound NAT for Reflection ' like so : <p> Once done , click Save . At this point , you need to flush all the routes from the pfSense and also hard reset your Xbox . The best thing to do here is go and press the power button on the Xbox for 10 Seconds so it FULLY turns off ( not just sleep mode where the network is still active ) . Then tell your pfSense box to Reboot and then fire up your Xbox . You should then find you can join eachothers games and parties like normal . <p> If however you find problems ; you should full back to the backup option which is ' NAT + Proxy ' . This works better in examples where the rules load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more ; but wo n't likely cause an issue in most builds . Then repeat the step above resetting both your pfSense Box and your Xbox . <p> Summary <p> Once you have completed all three Steps , you should be good to go and find all the Xbox 's in your home network are all reporting OPEN NAT Types and play together in online gaming . <p> For the more advanced users out there , you could consider using the learnings from this guide and build a different setup . One idea which we have tested ourselves is to make a second LAN interface ( assuming your pfSense has another NIC free ) and making these changes for the Xbox ONLY on that specific LAN . That way you can mix and match the security for your network ; by having business grade security on your normal devices , and having the Xbox 's in there own LAN network with the changes detailed in this guide to make it more like a home router . <p> Another interesting point is as the IPv6 Roll out continues , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current speed of ISP 's across the world rolling out it looks like it will be another good five or six years until we are at that stage . However the benefit of IPv6 is every device in the home can have its own external IP address , taking away all the Port Forwarding / NAT related issues . The Xbox One does support IPv6 out the box ; but unlike what some unhelpful members on the pfSense forum keep saying - that is n't the solution for pfSense and Xbox Live right now . Unless every player in your Game , plus every Party member plus the Game Server itself is using and has an open IPv6 - the Xbox will always fall back to IPv4 so having your IPv4 NAT Open is essential right now in Xbox Live . <p> Final interesting point - This may very well also work for the Playstation 4 ( PS4 ) . However neither of us own one ( let alone two ) to test with it and make sure it works perfectly . So if anyone reading this does have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know in the comments and we can always update the guide with Playstation specifics . Reading about it on the internet though ; it does seem to have similar issues on pfSense and it is likely this setup will also work for them . <p> Hope this helps , and of course any questions just ask below and we will be happy to help ! Credits to Digiex Member @InsaneNutter to ; for his part in helping with the setup and testing with his also . <p> I have set up static ports , upnp , nat reflection , static dhcp mapping , and have a separate vlan for the consoles . I tried both on 2.3.4 and 2.4 . For whatever reason , the PS4 's will not dynamically assign another port for use whenever another PS4 is using it . <p> I can clear all port mappings , turn on one PS4 and see UPnP at work on the status page , then turn on a second PS4 , but no new port mapping is made . This makes it so I ca n't play either Ghost Recon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may end up downgrading to 2.2.6 and trying that if I ca n't fix it . <p> It turns out , there 's an issue with routing UPnP traffic on VLAN 's either through the consumer netgear switches I have , or through pfSense itself , or maybe even due to virtualization setup . I 've reverted back temporarily to no VLAN 's until I can sort it out . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

I used to have a connection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click next when asked for the ISP 's name . <p> On the Ethernet settings select the options to " Manually set an IP address " and " Automatically disconnect " <p> On the next screen assign the GameCube an IP address , this must be in the same subnet as your computer . In the screenshot below my GameCube has been given the IP address 192.168.1.10 , for any IP in the 192.168.1. x range the subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0 . <p> The " Default router " and " Primary DNS " has to be the IP address of your computer , to find out your computers IP address press the Windows Key + R and type CMD in to the run box and press ok . You should now see the command prompt . <p> Here type ipconfig /all to find out the IP address of your computer <p> As you can see my computers IP address is 192.168.1.10 so that is what must be entered for the " Default router " and " Primary DNS " on the GameCubes network options . <p> Next just leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , then return to the game . <p> Now you are back on the main menu , select online game and select a character and confirm the selection . If you do n't  have any characters you will need to create one . <p> Now leave the GameCube on the next screen . <p> Download the Ripper Package and unzip it , if you plan to use PSO a lot to run applications such as NGCDEV Ripper on the GameCube it might be an idea to save your settings , if so just load " Save Username.bat " and select accept on the GameCube , it should then save your network access settings to the character so you do n't  need to go through that all again . <p> If you have already done that open " ngcdevr02.ini " <p> In here change GCIP to the IP address of your GameCube and the Gateway to the IP of your computer and save the settings . <p> Next load ngcdev-conf.exe , a command prompt window should flash up for a second then close , do n't  worry that 's updated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now simply load " Load GameCube Ripper.bat " <p> Your PC should now be waiting for a connection from the GameCube <p> Select agree on PSO , the game will then load and the PC will send over the ripper application which will be loaded on the GameCube . <p> When asked to " Press A to stop disc " do so and you will be asked to insert an original disc , this is the disc you want to rip to your computer , do so and press A again . <p> You will now be given a link to download an ISO of the game from your GameCube <p> Type that in to your web browser of choice <p> Enter the name of the game and select save <p> An ISO image of the game in your GameCube will be downloaded to your computer . <p> It should take around 10 minutes for the game to download to your computer <p> During that time a message saying streaming should be displayed on your TV <p> When the backup is complete you will be told so <p> That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can use with the Dolphin Emulator or simply burn and keep safe . <p> You can then go on to backup more games if you wish , when you are done simply switch the GameCube off . <p> Next time you want to backup a game simply load the GameCube ripper application on your computer and select Online Game on the main menu as Phantasy Star and go through the process of connecting to the internet . <p> It works as according to the tutorial , except for some reason I am downloading the ISO to my computer at 10KB per second , which means it 'll take about 1.5 days to download the full 1.4GB file . It says in your tutorial that it should take about 10 minutes to download the game , so what would be causing me to download the ISO at such a slower speed ? <p> I tried it using the Gamecube Ripper Package that you provided and I also tried it using the PSUL application as outlined in another tutorial , and it also began downloading extremely slow , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because both the Gamecube and my laptop were attached to the same linksys router via ethernet cables . <p> I tried on Firefox and Google Chrome , I do n't think the specific browser should make a difference in how the HTTP protocol is working . I have a feeling that it could be the firewall which is a concept I am totally unfamiliar with so I will have to figure out how to disable that in my Linksys router . <p> One trouble I had with your tutorial is I could n't figure out what the IP address of my Gamecube was . I eventually figured it out literally by trial and error . I plugged in another computer to the network and figured out that IP by typing " ipconfig /all " into a Command Prompt window which gave me 192.168.1.5 , and since the Gamecube was plugged in before it , I tried 192.168.1.4 and it worked . The crossover cable idea of yours seems like it would be a good one although I do n't have a crossover cable right now unfortunately . The other tutorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative method but with that I also might have trouble figuring out what the IP address of the Gamecube would be . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21398848 @1398848/ <p> First your going to download your games from wherever you get your stuff . I personally use newsgroups , it seems to be the fastest and most reliable source for getting anything . You need to check the game first to see what kind of rip it is . Straight rips of the games do n't work yet so you need to find the ones that can be patched , or if your lucky already patched . This tutorial will show you how to patch the games if needed . The easiest way to check what kinda rip is to check the . nfo file that comes with almost every game . <p> Types Of Rips : -Straight Rips : At this time these are impossible to do anything with . I group by the name of Pi has been releasing these lately . They are of no use at the current time though . <p> -Xtreme Rips ( Not Patched ) : These are good rips that just need to be patched with the correct . bin file . I 'll explain where to get these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then burn it and it 'll boot no problem . <p> -Xtreme Rips ( Pre Patched ) : These files are the easiest to use , they come in . rar format like both other rips , the difference is you just have to unrar and burn . No patching required . This is the fastest way . <p> Note : Skip to step 2 if you have a prepatched iso . <p> 1 . Your going to have to patch the game to work correctly , without a patch the XBox360 wo n't know how to handle the game . Your going to need XBOX360 SS Merger 1.5o to do this . Open the program and load your iso . When it asks to check the MD5 hit yes , it 'll take a few minutes , its a pretty big file.It will then produce an MD5 number for you . You want to load your ss.bin file that came with the game , if it did n't  come with the game visit xbox360 bin files xbox games at ubclass.org to get the ss.bin file you need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match , that is the correct file you need to patch . Hit the big huge button on the right side of the program to patch the file . Again , this will take a few minutes , it 's a huge file.It will then tell you it 's finish and you can load the file that it outputs . <p> 2 . Open up Clone CD , anything above version 5 should work . Simply hit the second button to open and image file and select your new iso . It should load without problem . You will need a dual layered DVD+R to burn , your 360 wo n't read any other format correctly . Also , make sure you burn at 2x or close as possible so your game is readable and does n't skip . This is very important . <p> 3 . Put the game in your XBox360 and enjoy . You can even play on XBox Live without a single problem . <p> If you want to actually tinker with the files then a Jtag is mandatory though if you just want to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it looks like you just wanted to see the signed code by Microsoft . <p> hello ( i know i know a HORRIBLE BUMP ) but well , I want to develop games ( I currently use UDK and Blender , with Max for some of the work ) but I was wanting to open the Xbox games FILES on my computer , basically so I can look at their coding , and learn from it ( purely educational ) I do n't  want to make burned copys , I do n't  want to be able to play them , but I 'm sure I would be able to open the files , if I could only SEE them , which I believe means they are hidden within the ISO , so maybe there 's some way to view the files on a comp ? just so I can look at how they made stuff , what programs they used , and the general coding in the game ? 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21398849 @1398849/ <p> The PSP Custom Firmware 6.39 Pro B8 will work on all PSP models from the original PSP to the PSP Go , all you need is to be running the official 6.39 firmware to install and use this custom firmware . <p> When custom firmware is on your PSP you can use emulators , homebrew applications and even backup your games to the memory stick . This allows you to easily carry around more than one game , and helps to save your PSP 's battery as it does not need to power the UMD drive when playing games . <p> You can only permanently install this firmware on a PSP 1000 or a PSP 2000 that is not an 88 v3 version . However its very easy to re load the custom firmware on a 88V3 PSP 2000 , PSP 3000 or PSP Go . I will cover finding out your PSP version later in this guide . <p> Copy the program to your PSP &gt; Game folder like you did with the custom firmware installer , then load PSP Ident up on your PSP . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PSP , the screenshot below is from my PSP 1000 . <p> We can see that my PSP is a 1.2 the 1 been a PSP 1000 and it has a 79 V3 motherboard , which is capable of having custom firmware permanently flashed to it . <p> Remember you can only permanently install this firmware on a PSP 1000 or a PSP 2000 that is not an 88 v3 version . <p> If you can permanently flash custom firmware : <p> Copy the CIPLFlasher from the Pro B8 firmware you downloaded to the PSP &gt; Game folder on the memory card , then run the application from your PSP to make the custom firmware permanent . <p> You can now power your PSP off and still have custom firmware when you power it on again . <p> If you can not permanently flash custom firmware : <p> Copy the FastRecovery folders to the memory card , if you power your PSP off simply run this application again to enable custom firmware . The custom firmware will stick until you power your PSP off . <p> End result : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my PSP 1000 and a friends PSP 2000 ( Non 88v3 ) . If you are unsure about anything just use the PROUPDATE and enjoy custom frimware . If you ever power your PSP off fully just use the fast recovery program , there is little risk to your PSP doing this . <p> As 6.39 is the latest official PSP firmware you will be able to play any game released to date , you will also be able to connect to the PSN and buy stuff . Best of both worlds I think you will agree <p> When you have this custom frimware installed you should be able to press " select " when on the XBM menu . A list of options should appear , if you set the USB mode to the PSP 's UMD drive and connect the PSP to the PC with a USB cable you will be able to go in to my computer , select the PSP drive and copy an ISO of the disc to your PC . <p> That 's how I have backed up all my games anyway . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i did . If you need any help post back and ill find my PSP out and double check . <p> As for downloading games we are not a Warez site so can not really provide links here .

@@21398855 @1398855/ <h> can not update or play new game xbox 360 <p> Hello , I am new in the xbox gaming . My friend give me is old 360 but it crack . i have buy game like mass effect 3 and batman arkham city . but to play it need a update . my x-box is not able to proceed the update ( imagine because it crack ) . <p> You can look inside , if its modified you will have a glitch chip or some wires soldered for the jtag hack , however you should be able to tell by what is on the console . E.g. do you have any home-brew apps ? <p> You could download , unzip and burn this ISO to a disc , if your console can load XEX Menu from it then you have a Jtag / RGH console . <p> An even simpler way to know which mod u have no need of opening the case or complex stuff . <p> Simple when your Xbox is on standby ( its standby when the xbox is off but power is connected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it on stand by press the button which ejects/opens ur Dvd drive tray then u console will most likely turn on ( Do not press the powerbutton ) if u wait for a while you will see the screen turn blue and some big text saying " XELL RELOADED " or " Xell " anything like that if u do see this happen u have a Rgh/Jtag console . <p> If it turns on like normal Xbox and goes to the Xbox dashbord its a normal box with a flashed drive . <p> Remember that really old versions of Xell do not work over HDMI so you might get a black screen depending on the version of Xell and how the console is connected to the TV . However you will know what type of mod your console has either way . <p> SO i have test both of your solution : burn this ISO to a disc : did not work Admhaider solution : it turns on like normal Xbox and goes to the Xbox dashboard . it plug with cable 2 red , white blue and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed drive . <p> Do i need to make other test or we are sure that is this type of crack . <p> You have a flashed drive , however because the console is on the 9199 dashboard when you update the DVD drive is going to be flashed with newer stock firmware capable of reading newer games . This means when you update you essentially will not have a modified console . You will only be able to play originals . <p> Most likely the console will need the DVD drive flashing back to the stock firmware , so it can then be updated . To do this will vary from console to console , however you need to follow the Jungle Flasher tutorial here : Simple File Sharing and Storage . <p> Your not going to do this without some sort of PC / Laptop unfortunately , " 74850C , 83850C , 83850C v2 , 93450C " are various Xbox 360 drives / firmware , you can see which drive you have by looking on the top of the Xbox 's disc drive . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

A Jtagged console can use any 2.5 " SATA hard drive , the make , model and size do not matter . <p> Unlike upgrading the hard drive on a console that is not Jtagged no hacking with Hddhackr is required , we are now going to remove the old drive from the 360 's hard drive enclosure and swap it with the drive you wish to upgrade to . <p> Opening the 360 drive enclosure <p> You will need a Torx T6 screwdriver to do this . <p> You can now remove the top , the mechanism to lock/unlock the HDD-bay on your Xbox 360 console might fall out do n't worry it 's easy enough its put back together , just look how it is in my photo below . <p> Now you have 4 more screws to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then remove the metal case . <p> Now you can unplug the power and sata cable from the drive , then slide it out pulling the drive gentily up as you do so . <p> Now you want to insert the new drive in to the 360 caddy / enclosure , depending on the size of the 2.5 " drive you might need to snap the 4 prongs off the 360 's drive enclosure as seen in the photo below . <p> 9.5 mm drives will fit in the enclosure without having the prongs snapped off , however the slightly larger 12.5 mm drives will require them to be removed . To remove simply bend them and they should snap off with ease , the enclosure will still re assemble fine without them do n't worry . <p> After you have re assembled the enclosure connect the drive to your console , power it up and go to the memory management screen . <p> All been well you should have an unformatted hard drive show up , if your Jtagged console is Jasper with 256 or 512mb of internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the internal storage , you can tell them apart by the icon , as seen in the photo below . <p> Highlight the new drive , press Y to go in to device options and format the drive . You will be asked to enter your consoles serial number . <p> The new drive formatted : <p> Now we are going to restore the backwards compatibility partition , to make this as easy as possible for beginners I have created a CD with the applications and files you will need to do this . <p> When the disc has burned put it in your 360 , it will be read as a Mixed Media Disc , go to the Game Library and you should see XEX Menu 1.1 , load it up . ( Select exit if you are asked to sign a profile in ) <p> When XEX menu has loaded press the right shoulder button , this should display all the files on the CD <p> The Xbox 1 emulator is now restored , this will let you run Xbox 1 games and some Xbox 1 homebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , all we need to do now is restore the avatars . <p> **This is the risky part that could potentially brick your console if you do n't listen , so pay attention ! ** <p> To restore your avatars you need to run the official Microsoft dashboard update for the version of the dashboard your Jtagged 360 is running , To find out what version your console is running go to : System Settings &gt; Console Settings &gt; System Info <p> Here we can see my console is running the 9199 dashboard so I MUST run the official 9199 update to restore my avatars . <p> If i was to run a dashboard update newer than 9199 it would also update the 360 and not just restore the avatars like we want . If this was to happen the update would patch the exploit the jtag hack uses and blow an e-fuse . It would only be possible to recover from this if you had removed the R9T3 resistor when Jtagging the console . So think about what you are doing and you will be fine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do check , at the time of posting 9199 is the latest dashboard . <p> To restore your avatars you can either copy the relevant update to a FAT32 formatted USB drive or burn a DVD with the update on . Which ever you choose to do ensure a folder called $SystemUpdate is in the root the the USB drive or DVD with the system update files inside this folder , this can be seen in the screenshot below : <p> After doing so ensure the Xbox 360 is on the dashboard , then connect the USB drive with the update on to the Xbox 360 or insert the DVD with update on . You will then have to then switch the console off , power it back on and your avatars should be restored . <p> I think that should cover everything , hopefully your Jtagged Xbox 360 should have a nice large hard drive with a working Xbox 1 emulator and avatars . You could get to the end result of this tutorial in several different ways , I have tried to make this tutorial as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any questions or problems do feel free to ask and I will do my best to help . <p> is this process is for a NEW HDD only ? I want to upgrade my laptop HDD size , and at the same time use it for my Jtag. its already define with partitions , data and FS(NTFS) .. can i just reformat it via the console @ use the above tool to erase previous configuration ? <p> i want to upgrade the internal 360 hard drive , and have the 12611 dash with FSD 2.1. apart from the swaping of the drives , what update would i need to do to restore the avatars and then ultimately restore FSD 2.1 on the new drive . <p> As for Freestyle how do you copy stuff to your 360 ? Just copy it off the old hard drive and back on to the new one . You could use XEX Menu ( included with the ISO in my post ) to copy it to a USB drive , then copy it back to your new hard drive . <p> hey i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system update and i wan na use my kinect so i 'm sure that does too . i 'm scared to un jtag my box so i have dash version 2.0.13146.0. so i download the official 2.0.13146.0 update with avatar and load it into my box and it WONT de jtag my system right ? i just got it today and spent good money i do n't  wan na brick it so please let me know . thx in advance ! <p> Yes that will be fine , you have the same system update as the dashboard you are on so it will just restore the avatars / kinect data . You will be fine , just NEVER run a newer system update otherwise you will not have a Jtag anymore . <p> thx ill do that . also i loaded the hacked hdd backward compat cd and did everything and it freezes on white xbox logo while loading any xbox1 . xbe. i believe i read someone say that they could have disabled xbox1 compat in the freeboot settings while flashing it . would u happin to know how i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what version of freeboot i have and how would i flash it . first time with jtag and i did n't  do it myslef i bought it like this last night . thx again ! 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21398857 @1398857/ <h> How to fix Xbox 360 hard drive after connecting to pc . <p> Note . These tutorials might be useful , i have not personally tested this ... These problems are rare and might help some people who have problems after simply connecting the hdd to the pc. -rick <p> Intro Ok , so if you 're reading this you probably connected your original **25;311;TOOLONG hdd to your PC , wanting to use Xplorer360 to dump data and probably upgrade to a bigger HDD or add remove some data . But when you connected your original **25;338;TOOLONG HDD back to your xbox .... all of a sudden it does n't recognize the disk . <p> I got this rude shock when i tried upgrading from my 20GB HDD to a 120GB HDD . I was simply not going to accept that my original HDD , that i just read data off , no longer works on my xbox . I could n't accept how it is possible that some people experience this problem , some do n't . There is a tutorial floating around on how to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't going to shell out more money to fix this problem . If the PC broke it , the PC can fix itWhat happened ? So here 's the answer : <p> The problem is not Xplorer360 , let 's get that straight right off the bat . The culprit is your motherboard . You see , when you connect your HDD to your PC , your motherboard created a HPA . A HPA is a protected area of your HDD that the motherboard or hardware vendor can use to store vital data . Some motherboards will do this , some wo n't , hence why some people experience the problem and some do n't . This change is enough for your xbox to have a hissy-fit and not want to play nice with the hard drive anymore . <p> You may have tried to connect that broken HDD to another PC , and use Xplorer360 to do a full image restore on the disk and still fail . The reason is , even though your 2nd pc may not create the HPA automatically , the HPA that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HPA affects the LBA size , so the XBOX sees a smaller disk than it originally did , hence why it does n't recognize it . So , to give you an example , my Gigabyte motherboard ( ICH9R chipset ) , changed my LBA : from : 39,070,080 to : 39,067,967 ( these values will be different for 60GB and 120GB drives ) <p> So to change it back i tried using multiple programs to access the HPA and remove it . The problem was that once i restarted the computer the HPA came back and my LBA size was once again changed . And this is the part i could n't work out , how to keep the LBA the same , even after restart . Then I though of a brilliant idea ( brilliant meaning it could potentially damage your motherboard - but it just might work i tried removing the HDD right after the program unlocked the HPA and changed the LBA size . And voila ! ! ! ! It works ! ! <p> So 1 more bit of theory before we get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disks or larger ? The reason is simple . If you bought a 160GB disk like me and flashed it with 120GB HDD ss.bin , you have these HPA security sectors on your hard disk , your xbox just does n't know about them . The HPA sectors are created at the end of your hard disk . and since the XBox can only see the first 120GB , it does n't care what 's on the 121st GB , 122GB etc etc ... <p> Here are three step by step tutorials . One for those who used their 20GB hdd 's in their laptops or PC 's thinking they 'll never be able to use them in their XBOX 360 's again , the second is for people who still have all their data on their 20GB hdd just want to get the 360 to identify it and finally the last if for those people that created a full drive backup image ( which you though stuffed up your drive ) . <p> Unzip and load the program , be sure to right click and run as an administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system as FAT <p> Tick quick format and Create bootable drive <p> Select the box with 3 dots and choose the USB Drive Boot FilesMS-DOS folder as the location . <p> Hit start and you will have a bootable usb drive within a few seconds . <p> -credit insanenutter <p> Once you download WinHex , install it , register and get a " Specialist " license . Burn the MHDD iso with Nero , ImgBurn , whatever your favorite burning software is .

@@21398860 @1398860/ <p> On the SoYouStart control panel you can fresh install Esxi 5.0 , however this is quite an old version with 5.1 and 5.5 being released . However , you can upgrade it within just a few minutes without waiting for OVH to release a pre-made installer for them . All that 's required is an SSH client ( like Putty on Windows , or Terminal on Mac ) and a few commands . <p> Let 's get started : <p> First of all , SSH into your Esxi installation using Putty ( or Terminal ) . <p> Your notice the first attempt I did , I got a broken pipe ( Errno 32 ) on VMwarelockertoolslight <p> This was due to the fact the server was running VM 's ( or the vSphere connection ) at the time . To get past this , I put the server into Maintenance Mode using the vSphere client as below : <p> Then give it another go , you should then get a successful response like on my second attempt on the first screenshot . <p> Update : If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box into Maintenace Mode with the below command : <p> Code : <p> vim-cmd **29;365;TOOLONG <p> Now stop just a moment before you reboot the box and enjoy your new 5.5 installation . Sadly 5.5 out of the box does n't have the network card ( NIC ) drivers needed for your SYS-E32 server . If you rebooted now it would be a disaster and you would n't be able to get it back online without reinstallation . <p> However an awesome community member called Chilly has compiled the latest Intel drivers for ESXi 5.5 which can be installed , just do the below : <p> First of all , enable CommunitySupported VIB 's to be installed by running the below command : <p> At this stage , you can successfully type reboot ' and let your box reboot itself onto 5.5 . All going well , in a couple of minutes you can connect your vSphere client to your box and get the nice error messaging saying you need to update your client to 5.5 .

@@21398864 @1398864/ <p> First you need a USB memory stick that has been formatted by the Xbox 360 , if you have a USB stick connect it to the Xbox 360 and go to Memory in system settings and format the drive for use in the Xbox 360 . <p> If you right click you can select the Inject button to inject a downloaded title update in to the USB memory stick . <p> The title update will now be injected , aslong as the USB memory stick is in your Xbox 360 the game will now use the title update if no hard drive is connected to the console . <p> Extract a title update to the USB memory stick <p> This is exactly the same as above , however instead of injecting a title update you want to select a title update from the cache folder , right click and select extract . <p> Checking you have extracted the correct file <p> This is the annoying bit now , as you will notice the folder is full of temp files and title updates , if you are wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out which update is which . <p> My suggestion would be to dump the everything in Cache folder to your PC then delete it from your Xbox 360 , go on Xbox Live , Play the game you want the title update for and let it download . <p> You should only have the title update for that game in the Cache folder , you can then dump it to the desktop . After you can add the contents of your cache folder back to your hard drive if you wish . <p> You might need to copy the COMDLG32.OCX from the 360 Tool folder to your WindowsSystem32 folder then right click on the . exe and run it as an administrator to get it to work correctly . That 's the only way I could get the tool to work correctly on Windows 7 64bit . <p> You can then open the title update and see information about the title update you extracted as seen in the screenshot below . <p> Hopefully you extracted the update you wanted ! <p> If you have downloaded a Title Update from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title updates with us . <p> Unlike Demos it is not easy for the few uploaders here at Digiex to get title updates as it requires the person to own the game let 's be honest we do n't all have 100 's of Xbox 360 games ! <p> With demos anyone can download them from the market place , which makes getting the demos people want a lot easier than title updates . <p> once i injected the update on the usb drive how do i apply the update on the xbox 360 ? 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Same problem here . My 360 's banned and I 'm currently playing the Career Mode of Fight Night Round 4 . Alas FNR4 has a bug that wo n't let me pass beyond a certain date in the game ( crash ) although i have injected my usb-stick with the most recent TU .

The PAL version has the title i 'd of 4B4E0801 and the NTSC version has the title I 'd of 4B4E0805 , you need the title update for the copy of the game you are playing . <p> AFAIK you do n't have to , just let the USB drive connected to your xbox to make use of the title update , you do n't  need to copy it to your hard drive and you do n't  need to disconnect your hard drive either . thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ... <p> Well , I followed every step , but it is n't working . I formated the usb drive in the 360 . I injected the New Vegas update , following the instructions . I took off my hdd , connected the drive in the console .

Still freezing when I try to enter in certain buildings ( Nelson barrack , Atomic Wrangler top flor ... ) <p> So put my hdd back , installed the NV on it . It keeps asking for the disc to play . Alright , I put the disc . Then I check the version : still 1.0. x . Checked ongame again . Still freezing . <p> I remove my HDD , then I put the update for New Vegas on my usb using that program and injecting and adding in the update . Then I turn on my 360 , plug in the USB and boot up New Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I tried with all updates , even tried them all on the usb at once and nothing . <p> One thing though , if you remove the HDD , how is the update/patch supposed to save ? <p> You wo n't be prompted to update because its already updated . The only time you would be get a message for updating is if you were on XBL without the newest title update .

Anything you have downloaded from dodgy websites would have to be updated by the person who originally owned the item , then re uploaded . <p> ok i see . can i use content ive purchased from live profile on my jtag if it is a different profile ? so yarisswap is made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found quite a few downloads and a whole site dedicated to avatar item downloads. there 's no way to make those work ? <p> Yes just patch it with your XUID and Profile I 'd in Yaris Swap and it should work as the content from your retail console is up to date . The content your downloading has probably not been updated so will not work with the newer dashboards . <p> YarisSwap is made to unlock content and remove i 'd 's from content . Yaris was an arcade game released years ago which worked on any console as the full game , because Jtags can run unsigned code ( for example modified games ) you can modify content such as arcade games / dlc and " swap " some data from Yaris , allowing content to act as the full game . This only works on Jtags as normal consoles can not run unsigned code . <p> so i transfered all my avatar items to my jtag and changed all the xuids to my jtags ids. the only thing that went through was the GoW lancer prop . would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go through ( mostly halo helmets and suits ) . ps i tryed going into memory **29;396;TOOLONG editor&gt; and deleted the cache . still the rest of my avatar items are not showing up <p> What update is your retail and jtag on . From what it sounds like , your retail is after avatar updates while your jtag is pre avatar updates , which would probably by why only a prop worked and not clothes . <p> my retail is on the most current dash and my jtag ( 2.0.13146.0 ) has avatars. why would my gow lancer prop show up and not my other items ? is it because they might be awards from halo i have not done on my jtag ? also my full gold master chief armor is not showing up does that need a new dash update to be compatible ? <p> Hi , I ' ' m new in the Xbox world and specifically in the Jtag consoles .

So today I downloaded all the xboxmarket avatar items ( yes someone managed to compile well over 10 000 avatar items ) and also the 360 Content Manager program . <p> My doubts are where to go from here ? Where should I place the avatar items I want ( because I read that putting them all is not a good idea will make the console very slow ) and how to use them ? Can I use them straight away in my profile ( note that my profile is not on Xboxlive yet ) or should I login into live first ? 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Usually 23.976 . If you know you have a constant framerate , leave this at Same as Source . If you have a source with a variable framerate , you may have to try encoding at both 23.976 and 29.97 to see what looks better . In most of my cases , 23.976 has usually been the choice for sources with variable framerates . Note , Vidcoder may tell you ( in the blue box ) that the input framerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know or find out that it is variable , and Vidcoder says input is 29.97 , 23.976 may actually look better . So bottom line , if you have a variable framerate source , choosing same as source will probably break compatibility with various media streamers . Therefore you are forced to choose between 23.976 or 29.97 . Although 9 times out of 10 , I have gone with 23.976 ... you should still test encoding , trying each one . - Target Size : Depends .

I have an Intel i7 ( quad core / hyperthreading / turbo boost ) with 8gb of ddr3 ram . It really helps to have a powerful processor for encoding . With my system and these settings , I get an average encoding speed of about 12-15fps . A two-pass encode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me it 's worth it . <p> These settings create very high quality videos with an acceptable file size ( higher settings = better picture and better compression ) . So my computer basically always has Vidcoder running . If these settings are just too much for your computer to handle , and you ca n't get a new computer : ) , the first setting you may want to adjust down is the Motion Estimation Range . 32 is kind of overkill . Higher values are good for high action videos . But you can get away alright with the default which is 16 . You will see an increase in speed if you lower this value . <p> Then I would next maybe drop Subpixel Motion Estimation from 10 to 9 . If you still need to boost your speed , you could try lowering your Reference Frames and Maximum B-Frames from 8 to 6 or even lower . Just remember , you may then have to compensate for less compression and up your target size . You could also turn on Turbo First-Pass . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Choose your Target Size : <p> So how do we know what target size to use ? After all , different video sources require different bitrates ( thus different sizes ) to achieve the same quality . An old grainy video may need a higher bitrate and require a larger size . Every video is a little different and we should n't take a " one-sizefits- all " approach . The standard of old was : 350mb for a 1 hour ( actually around 45 min without commercials ) show . And forget 5.1 audio ... that took up too much space . It was 2-channel mp3 128 bitrate . I do n't know how this precedent got started , but I could strangle whoever came up with this . 350mb is almost never enough to create a good looking video ... even with the high compressing x264 codec . Perhaps it was because then you could fit two ( blocky looking ) episodes on one cd ( 700mb ) . Well , we no longer rely on cd 's . We have hard drives and flash drives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about quality over size . Especially if you plan on streaming your files to a TV . <p> x264 comes with a setting called " Constant Quality " , often referred to as CRF . This is a great feature . Basically , you set it at a value , and then let the encoder figure out what bitrate/size is needed to attain that quality . There are a couple benefits . One is that you do n't have to do 2-pass which takes longer . CRF does everything in 1 pass . Also , you do n't have to guess the bitrate or target size . The encoder will figure that out and will smartly give you the desired quality every time . It is an amazing feature , and I have no idea how it works . But that 's besides the point . I usually use CRF for my movies . I generally do n't care how big the size is of my movie files . However I do care about the quality . So I pick my quality setting and let the encoder figure everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally like to predict my target size so I can be consistent with all episodes of every season across the board . And after all , generally t.v. episodes within a series require about the same bitrate to maintain the same quality , since the original sources are very similar . <p> Here 's how I go about determining what target size to use : <p> With each new series , I begin with some lengthy experimenting . I try to take a random sample ... a few episodes from different DVDs and from different seasons . I begin by encoding each episode 3 different times with CRF levels of 18.5 , 19 , and 19.5 . These numbers should all give a pretty good acceptable quality . I always do 18.5 with my movies , but 19 is a pretty good rule for standard DVDs . ( For Bluray , you can get away with higher CRF values like 22 or 23 ) . Then I see what kind of sizes I get . You will see that they vary , but usually by not too much . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same quality as an episode that may require 50-75 more mb 's . <p> Examine the sizes of the resulting files and pick an average . You will get a feel for how large you should go . I usually find that it hovers any where from 450 - 600mb ... sometimes more , especially if you include multiple audio tracks . And remember , a lot of the compression , and thus size , is based on your x264 settings . For example , say you use a Subpixel Motion Estimation of 8 for one encode and 10 for another ... on the same episode/file , but you choose the same CRF value of 18.5 for both . The one where you set the SME at 8 will be a larger output file than the one you set at 10 . Because the encoder was told to maintain the same quality . So at 10 , it could keep the same quality with a lower bitrate because it had more compression . But an SME of 8 required a higher bitrate to maintain the same quality . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , the smaller file size you will need to maintain the same quality . <p> I think that about covers everything . If you want to add subtitles , I generally do this after the fact . I use Vsrip to create the individual episodes . idx/.sub files and then use Subrip to convert them to . srt . Then I mux them into the mkv file with mkvmerge gui . <p> About specifying size , I was working on the idea of putting as much possible bitrate as you can get for the max size I am basing my conversions on , as long as it does not exceed the original bitrate , of course . <p> Because of specific reasons of my mkv player , which sometimes wo n't play DTS audio tracks , what I always do is convert DTS to Dolby 5.1 , @ 640 kbps . I think this is a very minor sacrifice to get more " space " to increase bitrate or to get at least to 10000Mbps , which I think is a good figure for that spec . So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the space for the future Dolby tracks . Am I right in doing so ? <p> What I do with the audio , after extracting it , is use Avisynth to convert it to AC3 . This has been working quite well for years . Then I add it on the final merge , where I also put the subtitles . <p> One thing that happened on my last conversion was weird too : I specified a final size , and when conversion was done Vidcoder had changed that size to a much smaller one . My size target was 7400 and it ended up with 4533 . Any reason why that might happen ? <p> In spite of playing fine , all videos I have been converting using this setup got me a warning on my LG BD390 player : this movie may not be playable properly . <p> This is the player I use to play my mkv files with , and it 's the only way I view my videos with . It 's the most practical I have experienced , and I did try using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what item might fire this warning I mention above . It 's not something in the original file , it 's in the processed file . I do n't care trying different setups by splitting the video in 1 minute pieces , but at least I would like to have some guidance . <p> OK . What I did now is , using Mediainfo advanced data , compare encoding settings of the original and the one I 'm outputting using the settings you propose . <p> Then I deleted the values that were the same and left just those that were different . <p> What I wonder is what should I do about them . Should I change those that I can , as I 'm not sure changing them will improve anything , or would it ? Some of them are not listed as options on VC 's setup , so what should I do about them ? <p> A few things worry me : <p> 1 ) As I 'm changing bitrate by establishing the file size , is there anything I should compensate with ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . <p> 3 ) Several places I am looking at work with PC viewing as their reference , where monitor sizes are not that large . My reference are plasma monitors , larger than 50 " , even if now I have a 42 " . <p> As apparently I misplaced my old High Profile setup , I went all over it again following your instructions at the beginning . And I am processing a video as we speak . <p> What I 'm finding a bit long are the ETA for this film I 'm processing , which is 15H 32min. which usually ends up longer than that . If I recall , my previous conversions took about 8 hours to accomplish , and the hardware is the same . <p> So maybe I should change some setting to get things more manageable without sacrificing quality . <p> I 've attached my settings I used for some recent 1080p Blu-ray encodes . These were used on some 1h 30min ( ish ) movies , these settings probably took about 6-8 hours to encode the movie on a Core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select constant quality and enter 10 or 12 and see what quality of encode you get them , encoding to a constant quality is supposed to be a lot quicker , however i prefer to know the file size i 'm going to end up with . <p> Hope that 's some help anyway , i 'm no expert , i 've just found the settings i 've attached work well for me. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

That 's the only way I could get the tool to work correctly on Windows 7 64bit . <p> You can then see information about the title update you extracted as seen in the screenshot below . <p> Hopefully you extracted the update you wanted , if you do n't want to use my suggestion above for easily getting the update your after just keep extracting them until you find the one you are after . <p> Dumping a downloaded title update to the 360 hard drive . <p> This is the simple process of opening your hard drive in Xplorer360 as demonstrated earlier in this guide then right clicking on the Cache folder and selecting insert file . <p> Do this and find the file you want , it will then be injected to the 360 hard drive . <p> That 's all ! <p> If you have downloaded a Title Update from Digiex or found this guide useful please consider sharing your title updates with us . <p> Unlike Demos it is not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates as it requires the person to own the game let 's be honest we do n't all have 100 's of Xbox 360 games ! <p> With demos anyone can download them from the market place , which makes getting the demos people want a lot easier than title updates . <p> I tried connecting my 60Gb HDD to my PC using Xplorer360 and it would not recognize the Partition 3 . <p> I found a program called Xport ( V2.12 I think ) and it not only works with the 60Gb HDD , but seems to tell you what the Folders and Files are in real English , in Brackets at the end of the File/Folder name . <p> This may help with distinguishing what update you are looking for on the HDD . <p> I joined digiex specifically because of the title updates and am looking to contribute to the effort . I have a few questions though . <p> 1 . ) In going through my cache , I found updates for arcade games I did not have ; they were demos that came preinstalled . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , should these be submitted ? <p> 2 . ) In going through the cache , I could not find the updates for a few games I know I have ( Halo 3 , Left 4 Dead ) . If the cache does not store the updates permanently , is there much point copying them into the cache like this ? Or did I miss something ? I only looked at files beginning with " TU " . <p> You can get arcade game updates from just playing the trials , so feel free to upload them i 'm sure people will appreciate it . <p> As for some updates not been there , items in the Cache folder are like temp files on your computer they could be deleted at any time . I think there is even an option on the 360 dashboard to clear the cache so that 's probably what 's happened there . <p> The main reason people want title update is you often need the same title update as your friends have to play system link games . The update could fix an annoying bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Its really up to you if you feel the need to use them or not . <p> Right , but if copying an update from the PC to the HDD does n't permanently install the update on the XBox , is there much point in this ? The only game I have seen that makes it clear what version it is is Halo 3 . Do I constantly have to be using the XPort/Xplorer360 to look at the cache to see what updates I have ? <p> If you have a problem with a game that an update fix 's ( Worms 2 for example ) or want to play system link with an updated game ( Halo 3 / Halo Wars ) then yes , if not then no you do n't  really have use for the update . <p> The majority of updates should just stay on your console so i would n't worry too much about checking . <p> OK . I guess this is kind of a new subject . One problem with these updates is that it 's being harder than it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep looking for the changelogs and post them in the title updates section if/when I find them . I 'll keep playing around with it and post updates and I hope others will do the same . <p> Ok , I 've learned a little more that about title updates that I want to share with everyone . <p> 1 . You do not need the full version of an arcade game to get the updates for it . However , simply downloading the trial is not enough to get the update . You must start the game while signed in to XBox Live . If there is an update , you will be prompted to download it . <p> 2 . Most arcade games do not have updates . Of the arcade games I tested , between one third and one half had updates . <p> 3 . It does appear that updates installed into the cache are permanently stored . I have opened my HDD 's cache a second time to install updates and found that updates I had put in had been copied to the Content folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . However , there are a few sources you can try if you want the changelog : the discussion forum for the game , online strategy guides , and wikis ( usually only for series or very popular games ) . <p> *** Edited 01-16-10 : added the following *** <p> 5 . Digiex does not support apostrophes ( ' ) in filenames . Everything up to and including that character is dropped . <p> 1 .

Thankfully there is a way around this . <p> First you will need to download Fat32Formatter which is provided at the bottom . <p> Open FAT32Formatter , be sure to run Admin rights . <p> Pick your portable hard drive that you would like to make FAT32 with over the 32GB limit . My portable hard drive is a Sea Gate so obviously that 's what I 'm choosing . <p> After that you can choose the allocation size you would like FAT32 partition to be , remember that 1024MB is equivalent to 1GB . I already made my partition of 97GB as you can see . There is no limit to the size of partition you can make FAT32 ( in reasonable standards ) . <p> After you format the desired partition to FAT32 you can start ripping/moving games to the partition . Its worth noting that this will not get rid of the 4GB limit restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Make partition in diskpart ( or Disk Manager if you prefer ) 2 ) Format it as NTFS , or do n't format it at all , does n't matter . 3 ) Assign it a drive letter ( can be done either way ) 4 ) fat32format E ( where E is the drive letter you just assigned ) 5 ) Verify your drive letter is correct before pressing y to confirm format . <p> <p> Word of note : <p> The Windows 2000/XP installation program and filesystem creation tool imposes a limitation of 32 GiB . However , both systems can read and write to FAT32 file systems of any size . This limitation is by design and according to Microsoft was imposed because many tasks on a very large FAT32 file system become slow and inefficient . <p> This is true , and can be witnessed by formating a large volume with a small cluster size . For example , formatting 60gb with 512 byte clusters induces a horrible lag ( tested with VHD Disk Image ) . Larger cluster sizes are faster ( both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , with 64k clusters , a 1k txt file will occupy 64k of space ) <p> The XBox 360 DOES support 64k clusters .

Switching the region is useful if you have a PAL Xbox , as when you switch to the NTSC region the Xbox is then capable of outputting at 480p , 720p and 1080i with the use of the component cables . <p> This is great for homebrew apps such as XBMC as they will upscale video to 720p so SD content will look a lot nicer on your HDTV . Some , but not many Xbox games also support 720p , such as Soul Calibur 2 . Many games will play perfectly in 480p however , which looks a lot more clear on a modern HDTV. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21398888 @1398888/ <p> As you may know once you are banned from Xbox live if you use that banned console to play games and then put your HDD back into an unbanned console your profile shows as corrupted and you have to recover Gamertag from Xbox LIVE . In doing this though you lose any achievements you may have obtained on the banned Xbox . I have found a way to un-corrupt the profile without Recovering . <p> Step 1 : First thing you want to do is get a back-up of your current profile . You can skip this step and go to Step 3 B if you already have achievements on your banned console you wish to transfer to an unbanned . This is also just a precaution and can be skipped if you do n't wish to make a back up . <p> Either connect your hard drive to your PC through the Data Cable or disassemble the hard drive and connect using normal Sata connections . <p> Under this will be several folders Starting with " E " . These folder names are your profile I 'd so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if there is only one profile it will be easiest . <p> Expand your E folder , " FFFE07D1 " , then " 000100000 " <p> Now you will see your Profile file , Drag this file onto your desktop or any where you can find it . <p> Step 2 : Now make a back up just in case something goes wrong . Right click on the file you just dragged from the hard drive . Click copy . Right click again and click paste . you can then rename this file what ever you want just remember it is the Original . I would suggest just adding ORG or BAK to the end of the file name . <p> Step 3 : A : For use with a previously recovered Gamertag that is not corrupted You can now put your Hard drive onto your banned console . I would suggest either just playing a game or getting an easy achievement to test . Then move on to Step 4 . <p> B : For those with a still corrupted Gamertag If you have a Corrupted Gamertag that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have it add those achievements to your online gamerscore . Just remember not to recover your gamertag from LIVE untill after you have fixed this original corrupted one . Doing so will prevent you from ever being able to add those achievements to your gamerscore . <p> Step 4 : Once you are ready to move your Profile back to a Unbanned Console hook the hard drive back up to the PC . Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 . This new profile will have all the achievements you just obtained on it . <p> Step 7 : Open Xplorer360 , open you hard drive . Navigate to where your profile is stored . Drag the file you you have edited onto the Xplorer360 window . Tell it to replace the file if asked . Disconnect hard drive from PC and reconnect to Xbox . <p> It may take up to 30 minutes before your new score is seen by friends or on XBOX.com . <p> This must be done each time hard drive is connected to a banned console . Its a bit of a pain but does make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned console . <p> To fix a game save , just extract it using " Xplorer360 " . Then use " CON Flag Remover " to fix it . Then make sure its all ok using " Xbox 360 Hash Block Calculator " .

I followed the tutorial and loaded my fixed profile on to the new xbox with a mem stick . Profile read as ok - after trying to sign in to live - go to profile and it now reads Corrupted . <p> That 's probably the problem , it would appear the profile is partly corrupted if you can not view the actual achievements . I 'm not sure how that can be fixed really . Do you still have a backup of the offline profile before you converted it to a live profile , maybe you could check that and see if the achievements are viewable and try again . <p> hey everybody and hey InsaneNutter ! Been lurking here for quite a while and i would like to thank you , InsaneNutter , for your awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) ! I am contemplating buying a cheap used unbanned 360 from ebay to play live again . I will most likely buy an arcade edition , because i do already use a 320GB drive in my banned console with my main profile on it . So i guess Arcade for 70bucks G will do it for me .... my question is now : do i have to do the same steps as mentioned here ? are all my savegames and achievements from my after-banned time corrupt ? because i was using the original 20GB HDD the time i 've been banned . ( that was like 2009 or so ) a couple of days ago , i made a 320GB HDD my new Xbox360 hard drive and copied all my stuff on it from the old HDD. so if i understood this right , the information that the saves and achievements are corrupted is stored in the saves/achievement themselves ? so i have to unflag e very single save i have made since 2009 ? even the ones i made with original games ? ( just completed GOW2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that all my stuff is on a new hard drive that had no connection to my ban now , changes nothing ? <p> Yup basically you need to un-flag everything , including any profiles on that console . Anything that console touches will become corrupt if the console changes it ( aka you save a game , unlock an achievement and so on ) <p> Hey , i bought a second console like mentioned and i have some questions again right now i am backupping and flag removing my profile and savegames from the banned xbox. let 's say i remove the flags from the gamerscore profile and the gears of war 3 savegame and copy them back on the HDD. if i put the HDD back in my banned xbox and play another game , like Portal , the savegame from GOW3 should not be touched by the xbox am i right ? so if i put the HDD in the unbanned Xbox to play GOW3 afterwards , the saves are still unflagged because the banned xbox did n't  change them ? ( The GOW3 saves , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made with the banned xbox. to sum this up : do i only have to unflag the saves i make with the banned xbox , to be able to play them on my original xbox ? what happens with corrupted saves from my banned xbox that i do n't  use in the unbanned box ? do they get removed ? can i use the corrupt saves again in my banned box ? <p> Gears 3 saves to the profile , although does create checkpoint save files ( i think anyway ) so you will have to uncorrupt your profile every time you do anything on the banned console . I think you will only need to re un-corrupt saves the banned console touches , i ca n't be 100% as i do n't  have a banned console . <p> Corrupt save games will just not show up on the legit console in game , they will still be there if you look under the " memory " option in system settings . <p> hey , just wanted to say that the Gears 3 checkpoints seem to be corrupted after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the profile file and from the checkpoints and data file in the gears 3 folder , nothing helped . but i am still able to choose the chapters i already played and start them over new , so i guess it works ok at least for me <p> edit : of course i ran the hash block calc over every file after unflagging them <p> just to let everyone know this also works with a usb u do n't  need the transfer cable unless u want 2 get it 2 an unbanned consol but other than that u can do everything else then save over the old corrupted profile on the usb &amp; it works grate 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

It 's almost certain if you signed in to live and played Gears of War 2 you would be flagged up but if you 're playing a game that 's out in stores as long as it 's a perfect rip you will probably be fine ... however if your silly enough to mod your 360 and go on live with a pirated game you have to be prepared to get banned . <p> That 's what I 've gathered from reading websites such as Xbox-Scene and Maxconsole anyway . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen in previews and videos the game looks to be a worthy purchase . If the story ends on a cliffhanger and they do n't make a third game I 'll be most annoyed . Heck if Gears 1 did n't get a sequel I would 've been annoyed as the ending was very open . <p> The solution for all us people that are dieng to play gears of war 2 or other games that you downlaod weeks before release is to get a modded xbox 360 console but also having a legit xbox 360 . With 2 diffrent gamertags so if yoou get banned in the modded 360 you wont care because you still have a legit 360 to play online with . That 's if you can afford it and i do n't  see the point of getting a modded 360 as you would still get to play the games on the release date and i do n't  mind paying because the people who made the game deserve it for creating such a great game . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21398895 @1398895/ <p> Packet sniffing your Xbox 360 enables you to see what is going on when the Xbox 360 is communicating with the Xbox servers over the internet . So why would you want to do this ? well one reason is you can obtain the dashboard updates which allows for beta updates to be achieved , you can also find out the address of streaming video on the 360 dashboard and download those too . <p> How to packet sniff your Xbox 360 : <p> To packet sniff the Xbox 360 you will need : <p> A computer with two network connections , one can be wireless and wired or you can have two wired connections . <p> An Xbox 360 connected to the computer via a network cable <p> We are going to share your computers internet connection to the Xbox 360 , this will allow us to run an application on the computer called Wireshark which can sniff the packets of data going over your computers network connections . <p> Setting up your computer to share the internet to the Xbox 360 : <p> Go in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet connection <p> Click properties , then on the sharing tab and tick " Allow other network users to through this computers internet connection " <p> When you click ok you should see the computer is sharing the internet connection to the network connection the 360 is connected to <p> After you have installed Wireshark load it up and capture the packets ( packet sniff ) the network connection which is connecting the Xbox 360 to your computer , as can be seen in the screenshot below . <p> Once this is running connect to Xbox Live , update when asked to update your dashboard say yes and update as normal . The files the Xbox 360 requests and download will be logged as the packets of data are passing through your computer to the Xbox 360 , allowing Wireshark to sniff and log them . <p> When the update process has finished you can stop logging . It would be a good idea to go File &gt; Save and save all the captured packets . <p> If you click the " info " section section you can sort the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloaded from the same location . <p> Now you can press CTRL + F , select string and filter by GET , this will find all the files the Xbox 360 requested to GET ( download ) when updating the dashboard . <p> Example : <p> You can see in the screenshot **34;469;TOOLONG is located at LONG ... to download this simply add <p> Now you know how to get the link to a file you can copy + paste that link and download it with your web browser , a download manager or even wget on Linux . <p> You will have a lot of files you need to download if you want the avatar + kinect data , and here comes the tedious boring part . Click on each file you want to download in Wireshark , and press CTRL+M to " mark " it , you will need to do this 100+ times , however you can do this pretty fast by pressing CTRL+M , then the up arrow , followed by CTRL+M again ... and so on , that should only take you a minute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control + click on each bit of info you want to copy . <p> Example of selecting the info we want : <p> After you have done that , Go File &gt; Print and select the options in this screenshot : <p> You will then end up with a text file that contains everything listed you need to download <p> Simply using the Edit &gt; Replace function of notepad , or Find &amp; Replace in Word / your favourite text editor .

( the random numbers in-between will vary from update to update ) to su2007600000000000 <p> Place it in the $SystemUpdate folder and the Xbox 360 will ask your console to update when the USB drive is inserted ( providing your 360 is on an older dashboard version ) <p> Other stuff needs to be done to the other files which i 'm unsure how to do 100% correctly , so the console will not install the avatars / kinect data with the update .

My Xbox 360 is not modded , and I do n't care if it can play online or not since the only time I go online is to update or get demos or videos . I do not want to mod my console or loose that functionality . <p> Is there a program that can edit my profile , assign this content to it , so that when I put in my game in the 360 I have access to it ? If so what is the name of the program and what are the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken advantage of the feature to turn a USB thumb drive into an Xbox 360 memory unit , and I have the file in the appropriate section there .

As the system can run unsigned code you can modify the DLC so it has the licence from a game called Yaris which works on any console , even if that console did not download it from live . <p> However in doing so you break the signature of that DLC package so you need a console that will ignore this , aka a Jtagged console . That 's why people are uploading DLC 's anyway as they run on Jtagged systems . <p> Modified DLC however this will not work on a non hacked console as when you modify the content it breaks the digital signature so the non Jtagged console thinks the content is corrupt . <p> That 's a basic explanation of what is going on anyway , I hope that helps . <p> Once again I thank you for your responses . OK , so let 's say I consider this Jtag thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cost , including hardware , shipping , and the process itself ?

But I managed to fix that using Le Fluffie ! I do n't remember just what I did , but now I have non-corrupted dlc copied to my 360 , however when I start the game the content does n't show up , so I assume we 're back to having to assign it somehow . <p> So my next question is this ... Obviously there is free dlc out there , is it licensed the same way as dlc you pay for ? If not perhaps there is a way to use that info ? <p> Last question is why would I have to be signed in to Xbox Live to use dlc if I was playing offline only ? Remember I do n't play online and I have absolutely no intention of altering my profile for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were to get dlc it would simply be additional content for games I already purchased and which I play offline , usually split-screen multiplayer .

I 've since setup this method for syncing . <p> In this guide I will be using a PC ( Ubuntu Server 14.04 ) , Laptop ( Mac 10.9 ) , and Android ( 4.4.4 ) . Unfortunately this can not be performed on iOS due to app restrictions . <p> Let 's begin ! <p> Install BitTorrent Sync on your PC or Android device . If you are installing BitTorrent Sync to Ubuntu Server then please refer to this guide . <p> I 'd recommend installing BitTorrent Sync to one always online PC , such as a media server . Why ? Because it will make syncing easier between 3 or more devices . Of course you do not have to do this though . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm going to have to start there . <p> PC <p> Configure 1Password to sync with a folder location . Where ? You can pick the location but as you can see in the image below I 've synced 1Password to **41;579;TOOLONG Support/1Password **25;622;TOOLONG <p> Now to start syncing the 1Password.agilekeychain folder between multiple devices you will need to launch BitTorrent Sync and click Add Folder , next click Generate . This will give you a unique secret . Now choose the folder where your 1Password data is located . Exactly as you just did in 1Password . Make sure they are both using the exact same location , otherwise it will not sync. ( if your on a Mac the 1Password.agilekeychain folder is treated like a file and you may need to add /1Password.agilekeychain to the end manually ) <p> That 's it ! Your now ready to start syncing . You can either share the unique secret or by scanning the QR code via Connect Mobile . <p> If your setting this up on another PC simply repeat this section and do not generate a new secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other PC device . Then set 1Password to use that data . Its that simple ! <p> Android <p> Now I 'm going to show you how to setup the share you 've just created on Android . Let 's begin , first off let 's get the 1Password.agilekeychain folder on your device . To do this you just load up BitTorrent Sync . Click on the + folder icon . You 'll see a screen like the one below . Now just choose the folder where you wish to store this data . Where ? Again it does not matter . I 'd recommended a SD Card ( if possible ) . Also enable auto sync and press done . You will also need to create the folder 1Password.agilekeychain . <p> The end result will look something like this and you should notice its started syncing ! Congrats , you 've just synced your 1Password data from PC to Android ! <p> Now we just need to configure 1Password to use this data . To begin just open 1Password , you will be greeted with a screen like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use folder ( local storage ) syncing . Then point it to your 1Password.agilekeychain folder . <p> and that 's it ! From this point on your 1Password data will stay synced with your PC ! <p> Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS <p> This is a bit different from a normal PC client as it uses a web interface , although it still remains simple to configure . This is also my always online media server and makes a great place to store my 1Password data . It also means that it will always have the most recent copy of the data . <p> Load up http : //127.0.0.1:8888/ ( adjust IP address / port based on your setup ) and select Add Folder . Select where you would like to store your 1Password data . You will need to create the folder 1Password.agilekeychain and it should look something like this . Be sure to enter your shared secret from before and then just click add . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

It is also highly customizable , allowing the user to set their own menu structure by modifying the Evox.ini configuration file and use custom skins which change the visual style of the dashboard and choose what system information it should display . <p> I am net here and new to consoles too .

For example , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to appear In the menu under Emulators ? I would also like to know how boot to another dashboard , like XBMC , if I choose to . <p> I think you need to FTP emulators in to E : Emus for them to show under emulators on the evox dashboard . <p> To change the dashboard you would need to boot another app / dashboard from your apps folder , which has an FTP server .

@@21398912 @1398912/ <p> Background Information In Windows Vista Microsoft introduced a new kernel security component for the 64-bit editions of windows . Windows mandatory Kernel Mode and Driver Signing states that all modules or drivers designed to run at kernel level have to feature digital signatures . This is designed to increase the security of 64-bit Vista by requiring that the kernel level software is provided by a legitimate publisher . <p> Why you might want to disable driver signing . The reason I disabled driver signing is so I could install up to date chipset and graphics drivers for my laptop . AMD does not provide chipset or graphics drivers for laptops using Windows Vista , the only way to get these drivers is from the laptop 's manufacturer . Usually these drivers will be old and outdated . However it is possible to modify the drivers for desktop computers so you can install up to date drivers on your laptop . Doing this breaks the digital signature on the drivers causing them to be rejected by 64bit editions of Vista unless driver signing is disabled . <p> Things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to stop unauthorised programs and drivers from interfering with the windows kernel , your computer could be seriously at risk if you install drivers from a non trust worthy source . If you experience system instability or random crashes after installing an unsigned driver there 's a good chance this driver is that is causing it and it would be a wise move to remove it . <p> How to Disable Driver Signing It 's quite simple to disable driver signing , all you have to do is load up command prompt .

Thankfully there is a way around this . <p> First you will need to download Fat32Formatter which is provided at the bottom . <p> Open FAT32Formatter , be sure to run Admin rights . <p> Pick your portable hard drive that you would like to make FAT32 with over the 32GB limit . My portable hard drive is a Sea Gate so obviously that 's what I 'm choosing . <p> After that you can choose the allocation size you would like FAT32 partition to be , remember that 1024MB is equivalent to 1GB . I already made my partition of 97GB as you can see . There is no limit to the size of partition you can make FAT32 ( in reasonable standards ) . <p> After you format the desired partition to FAT32 you can start ripping/moving games to the partition . Its worth noting that this will not get rid of the 4GB limit restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Make partition in diskpart ( or Disk Manager if you prefer ) 2 ) Format it as NTFS , or do n't format it at all , does n't matter . 3 ) Assign it a drive letter ( can be done either way ) 4 ) fat32format E ( where E is the drive letter you just assigned ) 5 ) Verify your drive letter is correct before pressing y to confirm format . <p> <p> Word of note : <p> The Windows 2000/XP installation program and filesystem creation tool imposes a limitation of 32 GiB . However , both systems can read and write to FAT32 file systems of any size . This limitation is by design and according to Microsoft was imposed because many tasks on a very large FAT32 file system become slow and inefficient . <p> This is true , and can be witnessed by formating a large volume with a small cluster size . For example , formatting 60gb with 512 byte clusters induces a horrible lag ( tested with VHD Disk Image ) .

It 's almost certain if you signed in to live and played Gears of War 2 you would be flagged up but if you 're playing a game that 's out in stores as long as it 's a perfect rip you will probably be fine ... however if your silly enough to mod your 360 and go on live with a pirated game you have to be prepared to get banned . <p> That 's what I 've gathered from reading websites such as Xbox-Scene and Maxconsole anyway . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen in previews and videos the game looks to be a worthy purchase . If the story ends on a cliffhanger and they do n't make a third game I 'll be most annoyed . Heck if Gears 1 did n't get a sequel I would 've been annoyed as the ending was very open . <p> The solution for all us people that are dieng to play gears of war 2 or other games that you downlaod weeks before release is to get a modded xbox 360 console but also having a legit xbox 360 . With 2 diffrent gamertags so if yoou get banned in the modded 360 you wont care because you still have a legit 360 to play online with . That 's if you can afford it and i do n't  see the point of getting a modded 360 as you would still get to play the games on the release date and i do n't  mind paying because the people who made the game deserve it for creating such a great game . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21398939 @1398939/ <h> How to setup 1Password syncing with BitTorrent Sync <p> Do you have 1Password on Android or PC and are having trouble keeping them synced ? Then follow this guide ! <p> I 've recently switched from iOS to Android . I wanted to sync my 1Password between my Mac and Android but it appears Wi-Fi sync is not available for Android . I 've since setup this method for syncing . <p> In this guide I will be using a PC ( Ubuntu Server 14.04 ) , Laptop ( Mac 10.9 ) , and Android ( 4.4.4 ) . Unfortunately this can not be performed on iOS due to app restrictions . <p> Let 's begin ! <p> Install BitTorrent Sync on your PC or Android device . If you are installing BitTorrent Sync to Ubuntu Server then please refer to this guide . <p> I 'd recommend installing BitTorrent Sync to one always online PC , such as a media server . Why ? Because it will make syncing easier between 3 or more devices . Of course you do not have to do this though . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm going to have to start there . <p> PC <p> Configure 1Password to sync with a folder location . Where ? You can pick the location but as you can see in the image below I 've synced 1Password to **41;693;TOOLONG Support/1Password **25;736;TOOLONG <p> Now to start syncing the 1Password.agilekeychain folder between multiple devices you will need to launch BitTorrent Sync and click Add Folder , next click Generate . This will give you a unique secret . Now choose the folder where your 1Password data is located . Exactly as you just did in 1Password . Make sure they are both using the exact same location , otherwise it will not sync. ( if your on a Mac the 1Password.agilekeychain folder is treated like a file and you may need to add /1Password.agilekeychain to the end manually ) <p> That 's it ! Your now ready to start syncing . You can either share the unique secret or by scanning the QR code via Connect Mobile . <p> If your setting this up on another PC simply repeat this section and do not generate a new secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other PC device . Then set 1Password to use that data . Its that simple ! <p> Android <p> Now I 'm going to show you how to setup the share you 've just created on Android . Let 's begin , first off let 's get the 1Password.agilekeychain folder on your device . To do this you just load up BitTorrent Sync . Click on the + folder icon . You 'll see a screen like the one below . Now just choose the folder where you wish to store this data . Where ? Again it does not matter . I 'd recommended a SD Card ( if possible ) . Also enable auto sync and press done . You will also need to create the folder 1Password.agilekeychain . <p> The end result will look something like this and you should notice its started syncing ! Congrats , you 've just synced your 1Password data from PC to Android ! <p> Now we just need to configure 1Password to use this data . To begin just open 1Password , you will be greeted with a screen like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use folder ( local storage ) syncing . Then point it to your 1Password.agilekeychain folder . <p> and that 's it ! From this point on your 1Password data will stay synced with your PC ! <p> Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS <p> This is a bit different from a normal PC client as it uses a web interface , although it still remains simple to configure . This is also my always online media server and makes a great place to store my 1Password data . It also means that it will always have the most recent copy of the data . <p> Load up http : //127.0.0.1:8888/ ( adjust IP address / port based on your setup ) and select Add Folder . Select where you would like to store your 1Password data . You will need to create the folder 1Password.agilekeychain and it should look something like this . Be sure to enter your shared secret from before and then just click add . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21398940 @1398940/ <p> Background Information In Windows Vista Microsoft introduced a new kernel security component for the 64-bit editions of windows . Windows mandatory Kernel Mode and Driver Signing states that all modules or drivers designed to run at kernel level have to feature digital signatures . This is designed to increase the security of 64-bit Vista by requiring that the kernel level software is provided by a legitimate publisher . <p> Why you might want to disable driver signing . The reason I disabled driver signing is so I could install up to date chipset and graphics drivers for my laptop . AMD does not provide chipset or graphics drivers for laptops using Windows Vista , the only way to get these drivers is from the laptop 's manufacturer . Usually these drivers will be old and outdated . However it is possible to modify the drivers for desktop computers so you can install up to date drivers on your laptop . Doing this breaks the digital signature on the drivers causing them to be rejected by 64bit editions of Vista unless driver signing is disabled . <p> Things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to stop unauthorised programs and drivers from interfering with the windows kernel , your computer could be seriously at risk if you install drivers from a non trust worthy source . If you experience system instability or random crashes after installing an unsigned driver there 's a good chance this driver is that is causing it and it would be a wise move to remove it . <p> How to Disable Driver Signing It 's quite simple to disable driver signing , all you have to do is load up command prompt . This can be done typing cmd in the search box and pressing enter , or from the shortcut in the start menu . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

How to use ------------ HddHacker supports two flashing modes , Auto and Manual . Typing HddHackr at a DOS prompt will start auto mode . In auto mode all hard drives will be detected automatically . In manual mode you can enter all the parameters used for flashing by hand . The following help screen is displayed if you start HddHacker with a wrong number of arguments : HDDHACKR CDFR PORT DRIVE POS SECTOR FILE RESTORE FILE C : Create Partitions 0/2/3 D : Dump sector 16-22 from XBOX360 HDD to file F : Flash Western Digital firmware R : Restore Western Digital firmware PORT : Port to send command to e.g. 09F0 DRIVE POS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sector dump file e.g. HDDSS.BIN RESTORE FILE : Firmware restore file e.g. UNDO.BIN Example for create , dump , flash and restore : HDDHACKR C 09F0 A0 HDDHACKR D 09F0 A0 HDDSS.BIN HDDHACKR F 09F0 A0 HDDSS.BIN UNDO.BIN HDDHACKR R 09F0 A0 UNDO.BIN Explanation of the Parameters **31;866;TOOLONG CDFR --------- - this will set the mode of operation , it is recommended to first try to dump the XBOX360 hard drive data , if the dump will fail , it is highly unlikely that a flash or restore will succeed on the Western Digital drive PORT -------- - the port to which the Hard Drive is connected , a port number should always be entered in hexadecimal and have 4 hex digits , valid ports are : 01F0 , 09F0 , ..... - this option can be used if your PCI adapter card or on board SATA ports are not identified by the auto mode DRIVE POS ------------- - on SATA ports this value is always A0 , cause you can only connect a master drive to a SATA port , so for SATA you will always type A0 here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file better known as HDDSS.BIN RESTORE FILE ---------------- - name of the firmware restore file e.g. UNDO.BIN **text file modified by rick , DIGIEX.NET** If your drive is bricked , you can attempt recovery . This may or may not work , i have not tested it personally . Look for this section below * Vendor Intro Power Brute for misflashed drives * Using HddHacker in manual mode **32;899;TOOLONG * Dumping the HDDSS.BIN file * Boot to MS-DOS from a writeable medium ( like a floppy or UBS Stick ) . Connect an *original* Xbox360 HDD to your SATA controller . Make sure it is the only SATA device that is connected . Now run ' HDDHACKR D PORT A0 HDDSS.BIN ' and it will create the file ' HDDSS.BIN ' and save it to the path you 've started HddHacker from . * Creating Partitions 0/2/3 * In auto-mode the Partition 0/2/3 will be created automaticly to make the drive compatible with " Xplorer360 " and XBOX360 Console . In manual-mode you have to type ' HDDHACKR C PORT A0 ' . * Flashing your Western Digital drive * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . Boot to MS-DOS again . Type ' HDDHACKR F PORT A0 HDDSS.BIN UNDO.BIN ' from the same path you have saved the HDDSS.BIN file to . This will create an ' UNDO.BIN ' file that you need if you want to undo the hack and flash your firmware back to the original state . * Restoring your WD to original state * If you do n't want to use your modded WD HDD in your XBOX360 anymore and you want to flash it back to its original size/state , then you can now do so . Boot to MS-DOS and run ' HDDHACKR R PORT A0 UNDO.BIN ' . This will use the UNDO.BIN file you created before to restore the drive to its original state . * Vendor Intro Power Brute for misflashed drives * To enter the recovery mode you should boot to MS-DOS , connect your hard drive to PC and type ' HDDHACKR R PORT A0 UNDO.BIN ' . If the hard drive is misflashed you will be prompted with : " Western Digital Vendor Intro failed on port PORT " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y/N ) ? " Press YES , disconnect the hard drive from power and connect it again . You should get Status 0x50 and the drive will be reflashed . FAQ ----- Q. Is it true that in several cases , booting PC with connected HDD will change LBA size of my hard drive and it will no longer work in x360 ? A. Yes , most modern mainboard/BIOS manufacturer modify LBA size , they cut the harddrive for HPA and store additional BIOS data at the end of a hard disk . So if you have such mainboard that uses this technology , do not have the a hard drive powered on during BIOS detection , it will break XBOX360 compatibility . To get the x360 compatibility back , simply reflash the HDDSS.BIN . Q. I heard lot of people having problems with the new 2010 models . Does it matter wich moddel I have ? ? ? ? A. The 2010 drive are the same , lots of people have hacked them perfectly . 99% of problems appear to be SATA chipset or BIOS configuration . Q. Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my x360 ? A. No . The information on sector 16 is signed and ca n't be changed . You can only use the size where you have a valid signature for . In otherwords , if a bigger HDD comes out , then you can use that signature . Q. With which HDD 's does this work ? A. As of version 1.25 , it now works with all sizes and versions of the WesternDigital Scorpio Series . Q. Do I need the same size WD HDD as the size on sector 16 states ? A. No . You can use bigger HDD 's , but you ca n't use more than the size stated in sector 16 . You can NOT use smaller HDD 's than the size on sector 16 states . For example , you can use a 40GB HDD with a sector 16 from a 20GB HDD , but not the other way around of course . Q. Can I use the HDD in my PC again ? A. Of course . The tool comes with an ' restore ' option , that will restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40GB WD HDD , you used HDDSS.BIN from a valid xbox360 20GB HDD , so the tool will transform your 40GB HDD into a 20GB HDD . However , you can restore it to 40GB anytime you want with the restore option . Q. I lost my UNDO.BIN file , can I use it from another drive ? A. There 's no guarantee this will work . It might kill your drive . Using a UNDO.BIN from a different model ( e.g. LAT/RST ) will kill your drive for sure . Q. I have a XBOX360 Core/Arcade version and want to use this hack to buy a cheap HDD . But how do i connect it ? A. If you do n't have a Premium/Elite , you can make the HDD internal . One great tutorial that will show you how to do this : LONG ... Q. The tool does n't detect my HDD ! A. First , make sure you are running it from real MS-DOS , not from a DOS box under windows . If the HddHacker does not autodetect your SATA controller then let us know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already exists . A. If you previously made an UNDO.BIN file , then you should keep that one . There 's no need to create another one . Keep in mind that the UNDO.BIN represents the current state of the drive . Q. Could you do this for my Seagate , Maxtor , Samsung or whatever drive too ? A. Yes , but I do n't have plans to do so . It is a lot of work to convert this tool for usage with other brands and do n't think it is worth the trouble . Q. Where can I donate ? A. Nowhere .

I then undid everything and trried to used the 250GB HDDSS.bin was told the same thing drive is formated and will work in xbox 360 again did not show up . i then tried to use the hex editor with windows vista . i get an error the the drive ca n't be done dur to bad sector or wirong peremissions ect i am running as administrator still get error . I do n't  know what else to try , PLEASE HELP <p> hmm I had an issue somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever REALLY format . If you can manage to get it hooked up to your computer again you run a windows xp installation disk . Then use the delete partition option for the drive in question . Like completely wipe it out with that . Then you may be able to start over with the tutorial . <p> Or even just cross your fingers and try to put it into the xbox after erasing the drive . Since the drive will be COMPLETELY blank the xbox might recognize it and request to format it . This is all theoretical I have n't tried it myself , but hey even if it does n't work that fluently at least you 'll have a completely wiped drive and partition ; which will leave you in a much better position than I think you 're in now . <p> No problem . Again though make sure you use a windows xp installation disk I 'm not so sure any partition programs will do it properly . I could be wrong , but As before at least you 'll have a completely wiped drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of being stuck up a creek with no paddle . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Luckily , PayPal is one of the methods I can actually use unlike Amazon Payments that Kickstarter requires you to use . <p> However , some questions have been bothering me . <p> 1 : How widespread is this crowdfund ? Is it posted on any place besides Digiex and ProjectPokemon in attempts to spread the news ? 2 : Have any negotiations with the seller been made or tried ? Preservation is a cause where people often feel generous about . <p> 1 . The problem we have is it 's against the rules of many forums to have anything to do with roms , which makes this even more difficult to spread the word about this project in communities that might be interested . Even PerojectPokemon is against that , however theSLAYER is a super moderator on there so might be able to come to an arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're not too bothered on Digiex as long as the content was never commercially sold , however if we did get a DMCA request we would have to comply with that .

Contact has been made with the seller to obtain this is legit and fully working , however no negotiations on price have tried to be made .

If everyone chip in an amount , it 'll be easier to achieve the intended $1,500 to grab it and dump it . <p> I strongly doubt they 'd be willing to just dump the cartridge and send the rom , or to let someone show up and dump it themselves . If they 're selling it for $1.5k , I think it 's clear they 're after profit and not charity . If someone 's really interested in having it , they could buy it off them for $1.5k , or he could give them the rom for free and then he gets nothing because they wo n't care to buy it anymore . Same deal if someone went to their house and dumped it themselves .

If anyone can help me or point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated <p> There is no real difference between 12611 and 12625 for Jtag users . For non Jtagged consoles new AP2.5 checks for games were added and the option to boot to disc again was brought back . AP2.5 does not matter to Jtag users , neither does booting to the disc as you can boot to anything you like when using DashLaunch . <p> With that in mind I would recommend upgrading to 12611 and install DashLaunch 2.21 which will allow your console to play all games that need 12625 as it ignores the version checks . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hard work for you , at the moment that will get you on 9199,12611 or 12625 . <p> Thank you for the reply I greatly appreciate it !

@@21398993 @1398993/ <p> 13599 ( or anything later ) is the version which re-flashed the DVD drive . <p> So your DVD drive probably has been flashed with the new firmware by Microsoft as your on 13599 , which means the console much has been flashed after that , so updating to the latest dashboard *should work* <p> However if you have a really old version of " LT " i ca n't guarantee you will be able to play any newer games without re-flashing the DVD drive . <p> Your current dash is over 5 years out of date , so it 's really hard to say anything and be 100% sure . At a guess you should n't be any worse off , however update at your own risk , i ca n't promise everything will be ok . <p> Thank you for your reply . It is really nice of you to help a newbie like me . I have 2 questions more if you do n't mind . 1 ) . Is there a way i can check the flash version/LT version without opening the console ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they the same , but 2 different names ? 2 ) . Are you saying no updates after version 13599 modified /re flashed the DVD ? <p> 1 . Unless you have the files from when the console was flashed theirs no way i know of to tell . 2 . Microsoft only released one updated DVD drive firmware , however if your console does n't have the updated DVD firmware every new update will try and flash the DVD drive . However if that 's already happened no update will try re-flash it again . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

I did not however have a hdd that I could back up data from , so I skipped the original Xbox emulator step .

No fatx drive was detected on either computer ( both laptops ) . I 've tried both xplorer extreme 2 and xplorer 250 , still nothing : same as before no fatx drive . Tried running as admin on both laptops , tried turning uac off in win 7 , still same : no fatx drive . I formatted my 360hdd in the 360 and tried all steps and options again on both computers , still no fatx drive located . The drive is good , been using after upgrade for months with no problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thread , I thought I posted twice , but there has been no post from me show up in the thread . I 've dug around on Google and within other threads to try and find an answer , but all I keep seeing as a response for everyone 's fatx issue is run as admin , or compatibility mode , or both , which I have already tried . Since I formatted the hdd inside the 360 it should show up when I connect , only xp says a drive was connected , but it does n't show up otherwise . I 'm going to start from scratch with hddhackr , but if the drive wo n't show in Windows anyway then fixing the emulator partition is still a dead end . I do n't know what I 'm missing !

Thank you for a great tutorial and everything else you 've done on here ! <p> If partition 2 is n't showing up you may need to back up your data ( using xplorer 360 or any other methods ) and then use the create partitions option in hddhackr. xplorer 360 original is for managing 20gb drives and restoring partition 2. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Its more easy to recommend a TV with a price in mind , a good starting point is the thread Munky linked you to where we were talking about cheap but good TV 's the other week . <p> Nutter , that 's a 32 incher right ?

A lot of this is due to our decision to allow all our content and downloads be available to everyone without having to be forced to registration .

It was hard enough doing Microsoft Points as we have had to limit it to four regions with slightly different amounts for each prize . Somethings like amazon which would be great , would be terribly hard to give out as we could n't buy a gift card for day someone in Canada with our Amazon UK accounts . <p> The other solution is perhaps a cash prize paid by Paypal , but for some reason giving away cash just feels weird compared to an actual prize ( like a gift card ) . We may consider more selected prizes like Amazon UK / US only , and then say for the winners if they are not in that region they can receive PayPal or Microsoft Points instead as compensation , but let 's review it once we see if this January Giveaway is a success . At the moment the reaction seems a little mixed , there 's been a few people doing a some things towards the prizes , but not the major activity that was hoped meaning the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are willing to commit .

@@21399017 @1399017/ <h> How to hack a 250gb sata drive to work in the Xbox 360 using a Mac Apple , OSX <p> I can verify that you definitely can use a Mac to flash the drive . In my case , the SATA PCI card I ordered off eBay never arrived ( it 's been over 30 days now-coming from Hong Kong ) , so i got tired of waiting and decided to see if I could use one of my Macs . <p> There are 2 ways that I know of at this time , for flashing on a Mac . Easiest ( and most expensive ) : Buy the Xecuter USB Pro from Team Xecuter ( $60 ) and use it under Bootcamp Least Expensive : Use rEFIt to boot from a bootable DOS flash drive <p> All the information needed it already out there , but it 's a pain gathering it all together and working out the kinks . Hopefully , this saves someone else some time . <p> The hardest part for me was finding a Mac that could boot from DOS on a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , but I suspect most recent Macs will work just fine . <p> I tried 2 models . A late 2007 MacBook ( 2,1 ) did NOT work . A 2009 Mac Mini did work . However , anyone who 's taken a Mac Mini apart will know what a complete pain in the @ss it can be to swap the hard drive ( although it 's a whole lot easier than the older iBooks ) . I recommend finding a more recent Mac Laptop instead , or even a Mac Pro , which would obviously be the ideal option . <p> 10 ) You 'll then see a icon for the flash drive ( I think the label says something about " legacy OS " ) . Select that . <p> 11 ) Run hddhackr and follow the rest of the tutorial to flash the drive . <p> 12 ) After turning off the computer , put the flashed drive in a USB or Firewire enclosure , replace the Mac 's hard drive , and boot into Bootcamp . <p> 13 ) Follow the rest of the tutorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a ) Based on all the problems people have reported with hddhackr 1.30 , I used 1.25 . Worked like a charm . b ) After flashing the drive , I put it in my Xbox and reformatted before restoring partition 2 , just in case . c ) I used Hoffman 's partition 2 , since I did n't have an existing Xbox drive . d ) rEFIt does not seem to work properly if you have a Bootcamp partition on the Mac . No matter what other legacy OS partition you select , the Mac will always boot up from the Bootcamp partition , if it 's attached . Yet another reason to make sure no other hard drive is attached , other than the one you 're going to flash . e ) It 's also possible to partition the flash drive so that rEFIt is on the 2nd partition , eliminating the need for a CD . However , the software for creating the bootable flash drive that 's linked in this tutorial does not allow for a partitioned flash drive . You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used the CD because it was the easiest . f ) Some anti-malware software may complain that Xplorer 360 Extreme is malware . That 's because so many copies of this on the various file share sites ARE infected . Make sure you only get it from the link in the tutorial , and scan it before using . You may have to turn off you anti-malware software to use it . g ) My Win XP setup complained that a . dll file was missing , whenever I tried to run Xplorer 360 Extreme . A quick search of the . dll ( ca n't recall the name ) gave me a link to a downloadable copy from a reputable site . I put the file in the same folder as the application , and it worked just fine . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Technically , there are only 192 viewable fuses . Fusesets 00 and 01 These are burned at the factory , after the console is manufactured , they show whether the console is a devkit or not . They also disable CPU JTAG after the console 's flash is programed . Fuseset 02 This is the lockdown counter for the 2BL/CB ( The 2nd Bootloader , stored in NAND Flash ) One of these are burned everytime the console updates it 's bootloader ( Which is n't very often ) this is the reason that there is no way to recover a JTAG that has been updated to 2.0.8***.0 , even is you have the CPU key , ( 2BL is encrypted with the CPU/1BL key , but is signed with Microsoft 's private key so you ca n't change the lockdown counter in the NAND . The bootloader will fail signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CPU key . These start out as all zero 's , and are burned presumably at random when the console boots for the first time , they are used to encrypt the keyvault , and the bootloader sections . The CPU key is unique to each console , and is sometimes refered to as the " per-box key " To find the CPU key , add fusesets 03 , and 05 , OR 04 and 06 . For example , this console 's CPU key would be " **32;1000;TOOLONG . " Fusesets 07-11 These make up the console 's " Lockdown Counter . " They are blown after each dashboard update starting with the update from 4532/4548 to 4598 . They prevent a previous version of the dashboard from being run on an updated console . There are enough eFUSEs in this section for Microsoft to update the console roughly 80 times . The lockdown counter of this console is at FFFF00000 ... , this means that it has recieved 4 dashboard updates since 2.0.4548.0 ran on it . Microsoft originally intended to only blow an eFUSE when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerability in 4532 and 4548 ) but has now decided to blow an eFUSE with every update since the update to 4598 . In the NAND 's 6BL(CF) section , there is another lockdown counter that should match the one of the eFUSEs . If it does n't match , the console will panic on boot , and will show a RRoD . Now , here 's the good part ! If we know the CPU key of the console , we can decrypt the 6BL , and change the lockdown counter in the NAND to match the one on the console , and therefore run an older dashboard . Since the 6BL is n't signed with Microsoft 's private key , we can edit it as we please , so long as we have our CPU key .

So I need someone to recommend me0 a legit working converter for . bin files to PSP EBOOT.PBP files . <p> Open the . exe Then choose the interface you wish to use ( I always use Classic because I find it 's a lot easier and gives the same results ) Select the " ISO/PBP file " dropdown and find the ISO , IMG or BIN of the PSX game you wish to convert . Once selected all of the left hand side should be auto-filled for you except the output folder ... simply select the folder you would like the completed file to end up in. *NOTE : long file names and/or foreign characters may corrupt the data , shorten the Game Title and Main Game title if needed . *NOTE : this would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " auto-create folder on convert " select create game title folder ( this makes it easier to locate your PSX games if you convert quite a few , if you do n't tick this it will save the eboot.pbp in a folder named after the PSX games serial number .... and THAT is a faff ! ! ! Save the options Now ... the right hand set of dropdowns allows you to select various images and videos to accompany your game icon . I usually only use the first one " ICON IMAGE " as this is all you need to easily identify your game from the PSP 's XMB . The files must be saved as stated eg. for the icon image the file must be ICON0.PNG NOW .... click convert . this should n't take long .... it also compresses the original PSX file ... usually around 30% but I 've had games that have compressed in excess of 80% ! <p> Now open the output folder ( the one you selected for the game to be saved in after converting ) , You should see a folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " EBOOT.PBP " file . Keep the EBOOT in the named folder and drag the folder into PSP/GAME of your memory stick . eg. PSP/GAME/Crash Bandicoot/Eboot.pbp <p> Now start your PSP .... go to game on your Memory stick and your PSX game should be there with the ICON you selected ( and any other added pics/movies ) <p> Once the game is loaded you are able to toggle various options by pressed the home button , such as screen size , disc speed , key config . In regards to screen size I find if you select " custom " then holding " L " until the screen goes as small as possible before resizing with " R " , this will give you the largest most correct aspect . <p> This program will also allow you to reverse the process and extract the EBOOT back into BIN and CUE format , simply select the Eboot , the output folder and the click " Extract ISO " 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

You will need a different email address to the one you currently use for your account . When it comes to Country of Residence , you will need to select the region of eShop you wish to browse ; in this case I am using Japan as it has a number of games and demos not available in the US/Europe at time of writing including Dragon Quest Heroes I &amp; II . <p> Once done , you will get to the final stage which is to confirm you email address .

@@21399033 @1399033/ <h> PS4 Block Updates / Block Access To the PSN IP and Host Name List <p> Before connecting your PS4 to your home network I would advise blocking the PSN servers , this will stop the PS4 from downloading the latest system update from the PSN which it will do automatically , the good news is that the PS4 will not automatically install updates unless you have set it to do so when sleeping in the system settings . Even if the PS4 has downloaded an update , once PSN access is blocked it will not nag you about installing an update . <p> How exactly you will block access to the PSN depends on your router , basic routers provided by your ISP might well not be able to do this . <p> Below are the following hostnames PS4 's on firmware 1.76 use to access various parts of the PSN , addition hosts could well be present in later PS4 updates , however I only have one PS4 on 1.76 to test with . <p> You need to block the following host names on your router , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sony 's server , however still allow internet access : <p> It will be impossible for me to show you exactly how to do this on your home network , as many 1000 's of different routers / network setup 's exist.How Did I Block My PS4 From Accessing The PSN On My Router ? <p> First I have my router set to assign my PS4 a static IP address , this means my PS4 will always have the same IP address on my network . I have then added the PS4 's IP address on my local network to an list ( alias ) called PS4 consoles . <p> I have then created another list which contains all the host names for the PSN above , this is called PS4 Servers . <p> Finally I have created a rule which blocks all IPV4 traffic from the PS4 Consoles going to the PS4 servers , as can be seen below : <p> The end result is my PS4 still has internet access , it just ca n't talk to Sony 's servers . I 'm using pfSense as my router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two network cards . pfSense can be downloaded for free here : pfSense download <p> Conclusion : <p> I hope that gives you some idea how you can go about blocking internet access on your PS4 , yet still keep the PS4 connected to your home network . It 's impossible to create a guide that will work for everyone , due to their been many many 1000 's of different home network setups out there .

@@21399034 @1399034/ <p> This is the easiest solution for people who have limited networking knowledge to block their Wii U from updating when connected to the internet . <p> Essentially we are going to use a 3rd party DNS server to block Wii U updates , instead of your own router . A DNS server is like the phone book of all devices on the internet . When your computer / games console asks the DNS server where digiex.net is located for example , the DNS server responds and tells your computer / games console the IP address of digiex.net . <p> We are going to use a special DNS server that allows any normal internet traffic on your Wii U , however when certain Nintendo servers are requested which contain updates the DNS server will tell your Wii U the server does n't exist , meaning the Wii U will not be able to update . <p> The IP address of this DNS server is 107.211.140.065 , this is also known as the TubeHax DNS . The DNS server is run by Smealum who is a respected 3DS hacker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exploited on the Nintendo 3DS , however it can also block the Wii U from updating it 's self . <p> If you know how to change the DNS settings on your Wii U then you simply want to change the DNS servers to the following : <p> Note 1 : As of 26/01/17 the previous DNS servers are no longer working , neither is the Chncdcksn Hax dns server : 104.236.072.203 . So change your primary DNS server to 35.164.240.189 if you have previously followed this tutorial . <p> You have a choice of various working DNS servers to block updates , the current working servers are : <p> 035.164.240.189 ( DNS-U ) <p> 168.235.092.108 ( ns3.titledb.com , hosted in LA ) <p> 081.004.127.020 ( ns2.titledb.com , hosted in Netherlands ) <p> I have used the DNS-U server in this tutorial , but you can use any . <p> Note 2:If you have more than one network connection configured on your Wii U , you must change the DNS settings for all connections . <p> If you are unsure on how to do this I have created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the System settings on the Wii U : <p> Click on Internet : <p> Click on connect to the internet : <p> If you have no internet connection set-up you will have to go though the process of setting a connection up , if it 's a wireless connection you will be asked to choose the wireles as network and enter the key to connect to the network , you then want to look for the DNS settings as your doing this . <p> If you already have a connection setup on the Wii U or a wired connection , then click the Connection List in the top right hand corner : <p> Choose your connection , if you have multiple i 'd personally delete all but one , however you can have more than one connection you just need to be 101% sure you change the DNS settings on all the connection 's setup on the Wii U : <p> Note : the 107.211.140.065 DNS server shown in the screenshot no longer works , so use 35.164.240.189as mentioned above instead . <p> Now go back : <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above for all connections configured on the Wii U , when finished go back again : <p> That 's it you are done , Wii U updates should now be blocked , remember you are trusting a third party to keep your updates blocked by doing this .

It 's also very likely the battery which keeps your save game alive in your game cartridge has long since run dry . <p> However 17 and a half years later it appears the battery inside @Trebor 's Pokemon Blue cartridge still works and all his Pokemon from 1999 are intact . This really surprised us both , as Trebor had n't touched the game for easily the last 15 years . <p> As Trebor had loaned me all his past Pokemon games to help with my living Pokedex progress I thought i 'd make the effort to save his original Pokemon from over 17 years ago to say thanks ! <p> This post is going to show what was impossible until recently , trading original Pokemon from Red , Blue , Yellow and Green all the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do this we are going to have to use 3rd party tools , so in one sense you ca n't 100% legitimately do this only using only Nintendo issued hardware and tools , however the end result will be indistinguishable from the Nintendo approved way . <p> First thing first I imagined the battery in the Pokemon Blue cartridge could fail at any second , so before i did anything i backed up the save on to my GameBoy Mega Memory card . This is great as a temp backup , however does n't allow us to do anything other than restore the save back to the cartridge it came from . <p> So once I knew I could recover from what ever i did after this point i hooked the Pokemon Blue game up to my Gameboy Transferer 2 . I purchased this device years ago to backup my own GameBoy save games so I could use them with emulators and most importantly preserve them . You can also dump roms of your games with this and write them back to GameBoy flash cards , however i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is where things get a bit more complex , you might notice the the Gameboy Transferer 2 uses a parallel port ( printer port ) to connect to a PC , modern PC 's simply do not have this legacy connector anymore . <p> Luckily I still have our familys first ever PC back from 1998 , the last time this was powered on was in 2010 when i needed a PC with a parallel port , so I was unsure if it would actually still work , however it did ! <p> The younger me taught myself how to upgrade and build a PC using this computer , so it 's seen a lot of abuse over the years . <p> The PC was a Pentium 2 @ 300mhz , 128mb of ram , 4MB ATI Rage Pro GPU with an 8gb hard drive , however the motherboard failed about a year after we got it , so we ended up getting a new motherboard that could take both the Pentium 2 processor we had and newer ones up to 900mhz . So a few years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ram up to 512mb and added a Nvidia RIVA TNT 2 GPU to it , so despite its age this PC can actually run Windows XP pretty well , which is perfect for use with hardware like the Gameboy Transferer 2 . <p> Everything still appeared to work nicely the GB Smart Writer software was able to recognise the Pokemon Blue game , so by clicking " Down Sram " i can download the save game to the PC . <p> I also dumped a rom of Pokemon Blue and checked I could load the save i 'd dumped in an emulator , which i could ! So i then copied the save on to my Home Server so I could access it on my main PC running Windows 10 . <p> A bit off topic , however I was impressed an old Nvidia RIVA TNT2 could output at my monitors native resolution of 1920x1200 : <p> So now now the hard bit is done , the save is backed up and no longer at the mercy of a 17 year old battery : <p> Next using a 3DS that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game I backed up and inject that in to the Virtual Console re-release of Pokemon Blue on the Nintendo 3DS . <p> With the save game from the physical Pokemon Blue cartridge now on the Virtual Console version of Pokemon Blue on the 3DS I can simply use the Poke Transporter application to import the Pokemon on to PokeBank , as far as the 3DS is concerned these Pokemon could have been caught yesterday , not 17 years ago : <p> Once transported to PokeBank the Pokemon can be moved on to any GEN 7 Pokemon game , which is currently just Pokemon Sun and Moon . <p> So there we have it , @Trebor 's 17 and a half year old Pokemon are now waiting on my Pokemon Moon game to be traded to his Pokemon Sun game : <p> I thought i 'd do a little blog to show people it is indeed possible to trade your old GameBoy Pokemon to GEN 7 . <p> Now you might well be thinking this is all well and good , however i do n't happen to own an almost 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's impossible to buy the Gameboy Transferer 2 even if I did . <p> All is not lost however , keep an eye on this Tindie project , someone has created a modern GameBoy cartridge reader that works over USB , on Windows 10 . This has been out of stock for a while , however it seems the designer is expecting to have more stock for sale within the next couple of days . <p> I do n't know about Gen. II using weaker batteries , but Gen. I carts only had to worry about keeping the power on for the battery-backed SRAM , while Gen. II games also had to run a clock 24/7 . That would lead to them likely running out much earlier . <p> Both my Gold and Silver pretty much had dead batteries on arrival ( I got them used ) , did n't bother me too much since I only really want them for collection purposes anyway . That was a handful of years ago . Red and Green both seem to be doing okay , though I am almost positive they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they were in storage and never used . They hold save files for more than 5-10 minutes though , where Blue loses its save file after a few minutes if even . And Green is likely nearly 20 years old ! ( Though to be fair , I have no idea whether Red or Green ever had their internal batteries changed . They were n't advertised as such , at least . ) <p> My Crystal was also fine last I had checked a few months ago , but I went back through all of them to check while writing up this reply and , well , it 's dead now too . <p> My Red is still working today which really does surprise me . My Yellow and Gold we 're still working a couple of years ago , i 'd have to find it out now and check if it still is . Based on other peoples experiences i 'd be amazed if it still was . <p> I 've owned Red , Yellow and Gold since release , my Pokemon Gold was imported from America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that around 7 months before it was released in Europe . <p> I 'm still hoping for a virtual console release of Gold / Silver / Crystal so I can import my save from the GameBoy , although I would actually like to play though Crystal as it would be great to play a GEN 2 game again . <p> I 've seen someone has created a hacked VC version of the GEN 2 games for the 3DS , complete with WiFi trading so i might install that as its a close as we 're going to get anytime soon i imagine ! <p> That looks pretty interesting too and also supports GBA carts . It can also re-write those fake Pokemon games Ebay is flooded with by the looks of it , so could make for a very cheap flash card if you happen to have a fake Pokemon game about . The downside is it costs more , however you get more functionality . <p> Both seem good solutions and really depends what you are after , i use my DS Lite for writing to my GBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i purely needed something modern that could handle GB / GBC games , so the J.Rodrigo Cart Flasher for GameBoy was the perfect upgrade for me . <p> It is great to see multiple people are working on modern solutions for very old hardware such as the GB Transferer 2 though . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Once on your PC you can rip any useless files out the backed up game ( such as system updates , other languages ) then compress the image so it 's as small as possible . <p> You can then copy the game back to your PSP and play it directly from the memory card , this is useful as you can easily carry many games around on your PSP , it will also help to improve battery life as the PSP does not need to power the UMD drive . <p> Yes , place the ISO folder inside of the GAME folder and place said ISO/CSO files inside the ISO folder . <p> Depending if the thread is old , some of those emulators are probably really outdated .

This works on normal consoles <p> If you are using one with a modded profile then you still need to have the profile on your HDD or a USB . All the other rules still apply with launching the game , but the game is just not on your HDD so you can save some room on it <p> Once you have everything installed and ready to go follow the steps below to get it to work <p> Making the Folder Needed <p> Okay so first what you will want to do is make these folders ( in the order its made and into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> For Xbox 360 games you will need to have a folder titled 00007000 <p> For Original Xbox Games you will need to have a folder titled 00005000 <p> For Arcade Games you will need to have a folder titled 000D0000 <p> For DLC you will need to have a folder titled 00000002 ( this will go inside the folder with the game I 'd with one of the folders above ) <p> Extracting GoD from HDD with correct Folders <p> Okay so you will need to extract your GoD from your HDD ( Unless you have downloaded it from somewhere . If so skip the first step of this . ) Unfortunately Horizon only gets the GoD and makes the last folder and file for it so you will need to make the other 2 needed ( not a big deal . takes 2 seconds ) <p> First open Horizon and go to the Tools Tab and choose Title I 'd Finder . Type in the game you are extracting from . For me it is Monopoly Streets . Once you find it , click on the game and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next you will need to make a folder inside the 0000000000000000 Folder we made earlier . Name that folder the Title I 'd you just copied . After that make another folder inside of the title i 'd folder and name it 00007000 ( that 's 4 zeros , 7 , then 3 zeros or depending on what you are extracting into that folder i mentioned in the spoiler above ) . <p> If you have downloaded the GoD , then drag the folder with the game I 'd into the 0000000000000000 folder and skip the rest of this spoiler <p> The folders in the Data folder we made should now look like this ( or depending on what you are extracting into that folder i mentioned in the spoiler above ) <p> Now its time to place the GoD you just extracted into the 00007000 folder ( or depending on what you are extracting into that folder i mentioned in the spoiler above ) . <p> Open your HDD in horizon and go to the GoD you wish to extract . Now extract it and the place you want to extract it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what you are extracting into that folder i mentioned in the spoiler above ) . Once it finishes you should get this message from horizon ( the long list of letters and numbers will very on the game you extracted . But if they 're long like this it is correct ) <p> Making Data Folder Into ISO <p> Now you will need to open DoISO . <p> Go to the little bubble with the " ... " inside it and click on that <p> Select the Data folder and hit ok <p> Should now look like this <p> Now hit the start button , name it " Data.iso " without the quotation marks and it will create the ISO for you . <p> Burning the ISO to a disc <p> Ok now we burn the ISO to the disc ( make sure the disc is big enough ) <p> Open up ImgBurn and choose write image file <p> Now go to tools , then settings , then go to the right tab and make your settings like mine <p> Now exit out of the settings and go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by click this and going to where your ISO is saved <p> Now that you 've selected that , make sure you have your disc in and everything that is boxed below is like mine <p> Now hit write and let it write . It will take a while for it to finish depending on what you are putting on the disc . <p> You 're not done yet ! You still need to verify the disc ( do not skip the process ) <p> Also even though it says that it is 100% done and the green bar is filled , ITS NOT Look at the picture below <p> Once that finishes you will get a message and your disc tray will pop out . <p> Close your disc tray again and then hit ok <p> If your disc tray does n't  pop out then check to see if that green bar is moving again . If so then you are good . Wait for it to finish verifying . <p> You will then get a nice little jingle and a message will pop up . Click Ok and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disc in your xbox and go to your Game Library and you will see it there . If you are using a modded profile then launch the game how you would with the modded profile . <p> If you are using your account that bought it then just launch the game and play ! ! ? 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399045 @1399045/ <p> The NowTV box is just a rebranded Roku LT ( which usually retails for around -40 ) however sadly Sky choose to block third party apps which compete with it 's service , with this guide I 'll show you how to enable the developer mode and get around Sky 's restriction and get Plex up and running in no time . This can be achieved in about 10 minutes . <p> Before you begin this guide , I will assume you have already purchased your NowTV box , but if not , for only -9.99 delivered you might as well order one ( or a few , hehe ! ) and allow Sky to subsidize your Plex viewing habits . You can buy them at this link : https : //shop.nowtv.com <p> Step 1 : Registering a free NowTV account . <p> To even get the NowTV box setup , you need to setup an account with Sky . They will try and push you into giving away credit card details in the promise of a free 30 day trial ( which they hope you forget to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you follow these steps you can avoid all that ( and even get away with fake details ) : <p> Scroll down and Select the 30 day free Movies Trial ( ignore the Sports Day Pass ) : <p> Next you 're asked for some details . I filled in a random name for this step as well as a username and password . It does ask for an email address for this step and I did use an old email of mine but they never asked to verify it so you could get away with entering any old/fake email address here . <p> On the next page , it will suddenly ask you for a credit card and billing address . I do not wish to give this to Sky so at this stage I just closed the page . But rest assured the account is still made and usable ! <p> Job done , your account is made but you did n't have to give any details away and is now ready for the NowTV box . <p> Step 2 : Connecting up and Configure your NowTV Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and connect it up to your TV . <p> When you first boot it up , it will ask for your wireless network details then performs some software updates . Once these are completed you need to login with your newely created account before your device completes setup and boots up . <p> Step 3 : Enabling Developer Mode and Install Plex <p> First thing 's first , your need to download Plex to your PC . I 've compiled the latest Plex for Roku from Github ready for use , which you can download here : <p> Write down the address which is shown , or take a picture ( this is important ! ) <p> Next press OK ' on the Enable installer ' option presented and agree to the developer agreement that appears ( you have to pretend to read it all , so just hold the down button until its fully scrolled and press ok ) . You will need to agree one final time on the pop up box and your NowTV box will restart . <p> Once it 's reloaded and back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to the address which was shown to you earlier . If you got it correct , you will be presented with the below screen : <p> Select Browse ' and select the zip file you downloaded earlier . Select install and all going well you will be presented with the below : <p> Now take a look at your TV and you should see the below : <p> Your all set , Plex is installed onto your NowTV box . Think of the bright side of this , Sky have subsized your Plex media habits by giving you a Roku box at a dirt cheap price ! <p> Down the line if you ever want to complete another update , you will need to repeat the process with the web browser and loading a zip . Sadly as Plex was installed via the developer route it can not be updated via the Channel Store like normal apps . <p> Does adding this app void any terms and conditions that they have etc . <p> I 'd like to add the app and stream my movies etc. back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I can not guarantee you in a court of law that it 's not against there terms and conditions , but they left the Developer Mode enabled which allows you to compile your own apps so they would struggle to claim a breach of any contract or conditions . Your using the device as it was given to you . <p> APII 've built up a custom API specifically for the UK version of Netflix and it 's available at **31;1185;TOOLONG . The data is currently sourced from TheTVDB and TheMovieDB with Freebase providing the IMDB i 'd 's that are used as the primary link between the services . I 'll add more documentation on the API soon . <p> NotesWhilst most of the show information is accurate there may a couple instances where this is not the case . I 'm currrently working on a frontend to flag these issues and deal with any inconsistances . <p> There 's a new version out ( 2.8.2 ) but this also turns it into a paid app with a 30 day trial How does this effect us NowTV users ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we side loaded ours and did n't  get it through the store there 'll be no record of that So are we stuck on this version now , unable to upgrade ?

The end result will be you have a clean rom of your Nintendo DS game which can be used on an emulator , or on an Nintendo DS flashcard for convenience . <p> Creating a rom of your Nintendo DS game is easy enough to do , however because the Nintendo DS is 12 years old it 's very likely your home wireless network will be using security which is not compatible with the Nintendo DS , which does complicate the process a bit . <p> I will do my best to try and assist you with lowering your wireless network security so you can get your Nintendo DS connected .

@@21399054 @1399054/ <p> The initial import itself was nice and simple and straight forward . However as Digiex has been going since vBulletin 2. x , it 's gone through so many board migrations ( VB 2. x &gt; VB 3. x &gt; VB 4. x &gt; XenForo 1. x ) that a lot of posts were becoming really broken like using BB Code for Videos which did n't  exist , or formatting links in a weird way so dispite us getting it back online in less than a day , it 's 3 months later and I 'm still finding a lot of manual post edits to fix everything which I have easily sunk over 150 hours into <p> 100% worth it though , forum is finally mobile responsive and a hell of a lot more user friendly . <p> Glad to see a long term Digiex'er checking back in , you 've been a member for 9 years ! <p> I 've been here at least a dozen times since the beginning of the year and honestly did n't realize you guys switched to a different forum until today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've only been on 3 forums that used to run VB , but the owners switched to Xen at some point , but they did n't migrate anything ... just wiped the slate clean and started new . I did n't know if there was some sort of script or plugin or whatever that was used to switch to a different forum . You are one dedicated to human to put that much time into the editing of posts/threads and stuff . <p> I think the fact you did n't notice for quite a while is a credit to how well the transition went . <p> We did start planning the migration around July last year , apart from a few problems with our MySQL configuration the import of VB database to Xen we n't really well . <p> To be honest I was really impressed with just how much data was able to be imported in to Xen , even down to little things like additional registration questions we ask ( what consoles do you own for example ) how many thanks a member had , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying other communities have just scrapped all their content and started over , that would n't have been something we ever considered . <p> More than anything i 'd agree with Nimrod that the hardest part was manually editing old posts ( partially the tutorials / download sections ) to fix broken links , images and such . Nimrod was like a machine doing that and really did get a massive chunk of that done . <p> I did find some cases where some members had posted some really good guides , but posted the images on imgshack or another image hoster for example which had deleted the images . I did go as far as looking on archive.org to see if the images had been cached there for really good content , which some had so i was able to attach them to the post again on Digiex . <p> Overall to anyone reading this and thinking about migrating from a legacy VB forum to something more modern , i 'd say just go for it . Just ensure your old URL 's redirect to the new ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linkbacks you might have from other sites will still work . <p> From migrating to Xen some of the features / changes O like are : <p> Responsive site - the forum is now responsive , meaning it will adapt to the screen size of the device your browsing on . Something that was just not possible with VB 4 and is now a Google ranking factor . <p> Threaded private messages - the amount of times i got 3 or 4 pm 's on VB 4 because it was hard for people to see if a message had been sent or not . <p> Alerts - I like that Xen can notify you when someone quotes your post , likes it , or even tags you in a comment . <p> PHP 7 support - no need to run old versions of PHP for everything to work correctly . <p> Edit history - if a post gets edited its now possible to see all the revisions of that post . Handy when updating a tutorial . <p> Post attachments - I generally feel this is just a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet how it is these days i like we can now offer our security conscious members additional security , especially useful for admins / moderators . <p> Actively developed platform - We were basically suck in 2011 on VB4 , do n't  get me wrong at the time VB4 was really nice , however VB 5 just never seemed a viable upgrade . I get the impression theirs no real direction with where vBulletin is heading anymore . VB5 almost seems like staring again as it is , mods we used to add functionality on VB4 are no longer developed ( we had some great spam filtering ones ) then the community is n't really behind developing new mods for VB 5 , so your stuck with what you get really . From reading the VB forums it seems every new release introduces additional bugs , going by the public feedback anyway . <p> I think to sum up we liked how far Xen had come within the years we stuck with VB4 and felt confident about their future and the Xen ecosystem . The community is really active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone else has already developed this as an add on , which had actively been updated over multiple years . <p> Ah yes , VB -&gt; Xenforo . As it turns out I 'm a member of another online community ( MacRumors ) that did the same migration . Their theme is completely different from this one , and the migration was not without issues due to the customizations they used on the old forum . Everything seems to be working fine now , forum-wise , over there now .

@@21399058 @1399058/ <h> Step by Step Guide to purchasing Games from US Xbox One Store from any region <p> Step by Step Guide to purchasing content from US Xbox Store from any region ? <p> This Step by Step Guide will take you through how to purchase Game 's from the US online Xbox Store on your Xbox One from outside the US . <p> There are a few reasons you may consider doing this : <p> Take advantage of cheaper game prices from the US Store . Due to the weaker dollar and poor pricing outside the US on the Xbox Store , you can buy games a lot cheaper if you purchase them from the US in Dollars . An example being any newly released Xbox One game cost 's -59 in the UK , where 's in the US it 's $59 , with $59 when transferred at time of writing is only -38 , ( That 's a -21 saving on a game ! ) . <p> Break Launch Dates for regions outside the US . While most publishers are decent these days and appreciate the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are run by backwards idiots who feel European or worldwide users should wait days , if not weeks for a game after the US version has released . One prime example is the upcoming Titanfall published by EA ( Electronic Arts ) , who feel that users in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe should wait 4 days later than their US counter-parts for no apparent reason . <p> Or if you live outside the official Xbox Store supported regions , if you do not have access to the Xbox Store in your native country , you need to attach yourself to one . I 'd recommend based on exchange rates for best value and a bigger range of content that it 's worth attaching yourself to the US store . <p> Before you do this , you will need to be aware of the following requirements : <p> You will need a US Billing Address . This can either be totally made up ( and has been confirmed working by many people ) , or can be a real one . For the purpose of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just incase later down the line Microsoft wanted to verify it ( they have n't yet ) , at least then my US friend can just confirm the address on my behalf . <p> You will need some form of payment which can be used in the US Store . You can use any of the below ( only need one ) - <p> Pre-paid Xbox Store codes in US Dollar 's which can easily be purchased online , or by friends/family who live in the US <p> A PayPal account ( does n't matter if its registered in the UK , Australia or anywhere else ) . <p> A Credit Card which works in US site 's regardless of the billing address not matching ( Some of my UK one 's worked , some did n't so it 's a bit hit and miss ) . <p> However , you DO NOT need a VPN or an American Proxy to complete this . <p> Once you have everything you need , you are ready to go ahead with this guide . You will be shocked how easy this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original Xbox 360 days and opened up accounts to jump between regions on the fly quite easily . Since following this , my UK based Gamertag now has UK and US billing information attached to it allowing me to jump between Stores as and when needed . It also has NOT affected any of my current UK bought games so this at time of writing is perfectly safe to do . <p> This is the easiest step to complete , all you need to do is turn on your Xbox One and open up the Settings Application . In there , select System ' and then select Language &amp; Location ' . Once done , set your current location to the United States like below and press restart : <p> Once done , you 're Xbox One will reboot and connect you to the US Marketplace ! If you attempt to buy anything at this stage , you will find your payment methods do n't exist and it will ask you for new ones . This is because your payment methods and current credit ( if you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry , you have n't lost any money you previously had on your account , if you switch back to your old region you can go ahead and use them . That 's what 's so great about the new region options , you can jump between them on demand . <p> Step 2 : Adding some Payment Methods to the US Store <p> For the next step , we recommend doing this on a web browser as it 's a lot easier . Head on down to Xbox.com and sign in with your account . Once signed in , scroll to the bottom left and you will see your country , select it and it will bring up the Change Locale Screen . <p> Select the United States and the page will refresh . Once this has done , select My Account ' at the top and then select Payment &amp; Billing ' . <p> Please keep an eye at this stage and make sure your location has n't changed back to your original locale . You can either check in the bottom left or look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . <p> If at any time it is n't , you need to switch it back . If you find your browser keeps going back often and making it difficult to proceed , I 'd recommend trying another one , or using Private Browsing mode if your web browser supports it . I find I had this a lot when using Chrome but managed with no problem 's in Firefox ( could be a cookie related issue , but I did n't want to clear all my cookies ) . <p> What I did for this , was ask a US based friend to purchase this ( multiple price points available ) : Newegg.com - Microsoft Xbox Gift Card $60 US ( Email Delivery ) They will usually receive a code in less than an hour and all they need to do is tell you the code and you are all set . Please note however that Newegg requires a US Billing address before completing the order so it will require you to know someone in the US who can do the purchase on your behalf ( unlike Xbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address in some cases for those of you thinking of faking it ! ) . There are sites out there which can sell you US Gift Card 's outside of the US , but they either add a premium to the cost , or do n't look entirely trustworthy . As such I wo n't be linking to any , but if it 's your only choice then by use of a search engine you will find some . If you do find a good priced and trustworthy site to purchase them from , please by all means share with everyone by posting a reply to this Guide . <p> PayPal You can pay with PayPal regardless of the region your PayPal account is made in ( it does n't need a US address or US bank account attached to it ) . You will just be charged in US dollars for purchases and the exchange rate at the time of purchase will factor into the total cost . <p> If you wish to add PayPal then you need to click ' Add PayPal ' on the left hand side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your billing address before it will let you connect with PayPal . Either use your friends/families address if you have one , or alternatively make one up . If you are making one up , please be aware that some US states have sales tax , where others do not . Oregon is a good state to pick if you can which has no US sales tax . If you are struggled to make one up , I 've heard people use Google and find a hotel or restaurant and use their address . Be aware , making one up is entirely at your own risk however ! Try to use a real family or friends address if possible . Once the address is entered just select ' Next ' and go ahead and link it up to your PayPal account . I did this even though my UK account was linked to PayPal with no problem allowing me to use the same PayPal on both my home region , and the US region store . I even left my UK address on the ' Postal address ' on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively if you want to try your credit or debit card , you can select Manage Payment Options and click Add Credit Card ' . Again you will need to put in the billing address and then your details . Just like with PayPal guide as above , be aware of states that have added sales tax and try to avoid them , and if possible try and use a real address of a friend or family member living in the States . Using a non-US credit card here with a fake billing address could cause the payment later to fail when you try to purchase content , so I would usually recommend avoiding this unless it is your only option . I found my Debit Card worked fine , and one of my credit cards did , but the other did n't so it is honestly hit and miss here . <p> That 's it , you are now ready to purchase some content ! <p> Step 3 : Purchase and Download content from the US Store <p> Now you have some payment methods attached and your Xbox One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and purchase content to your heart 's content . Please be aware that while games are region free and not location blocked , you may find Apps and Media may be ( for example Netflix , Hulu , Xbox Video etc ) . However for games so far I 've had no problems . <p> When purchasing games , you can either do it on the website ( though make sure your locale is set correctly as per step 2 ) or via the console ( again make sure it 's pointed to the US store as per step 1 ) . I personally recommend that until the game is fully downloaded onto your Xbox that you keep it set to United States location and for the first time you run the game . The reason I recommend this is because I 've heard reports from some Australian user 's that because they purchased a game that has n't been released in their region yet ( was due for release 2 days later ) it got stuck at 99% downloaded until it was released because their console region was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the console region to US then re-downloading it , it unlocked instantly ( This ONLY affects games not released in your region yet however ) . Once you have run it once , feel free to switch your Xbox 's location ( as per step 1 ) back to your original country and enjoy . <p> Hope this guide helps you , and not only saves you lot 's of cash but also break street dates for those publishers who feel non-US people are n't entitled to enjoy games on launch day ! <p> Extra : Managing your account and balances across regions <p> Just to first note , while this guide talked about the US Store , you can repeat these steps for any other regions to . This includes getting games that only come out in Japan , or by taking advantage of deals in Canada for example . There is no limit to the amount of regions you can add onto your Xbox One account , providing you have a billing address and payment option for each . <p> However , now your account may become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , especially if down the line you wish to remove any payment methods or see your balances without having to constantly switch regions on your console or the Xbox.com website . The good news is that Microsoft has a Commerce site where you can view your balances as well as add and remove payment methods easily per region . <p> Once here , you can change the billing account you wish to modify on the right hand side , as well as Add or Remove payment methods , add pre-paid codes and so fourth with ease . Also if you used a fake billing address for example , here you can change it if you now have a valid one or if you wish to clear it . <p> Any question 's just post below . I 'll keep this guide updated if there is any changes down the line or new discoveries . <p> If you liked this guide and it worked for you , please help spread the word ! The more and more people who have awareness of this , the more we can show to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US and that same-day worldwide releases need to become the standard ( looking at you EA , it 's not the 1990 's anymore ) . Please share the URL to this guide on forums , reddit , social media etc Take a stand for fairness ! <p> I 've seen some questions asked on Reddit and the Xbox forums regarding the legal status and implications of purchasing games from the US Xbox One Store from a different region . As far as I can see there is two entities which are likely to be concerned with this , your local government and Microsoft themselves . I 've done some research and come to the following conclusions that I 've shared below . However it 's important to note these are just my opinions based on the information available and do not form as legal advice . As always , make your own judgement based on the facts that are available . <p> Microsoft <p> The main concern Microsoft will have is regarding fake billing addresses . This is committing fraud to a degree as it is lying on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 6.3 . Billing . By providing Microsoft with a payment method , you represent that you are authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate ; <p> As such , it 's important that you use a real billing address to avoid any breach of the Terms of Use . <p> However in terms of Microsoft Billing terms and conditions , I 've browsed and browsed and can not find anything about restricting where you can spend goods . All it says is you can not use currency from one region in another : <p> You can not use your Microsoft account to make purchases at participating Microsoft online stores that use other currencies . The balance in your account , which is denominated in a specific currency ( like $ or G ) , can only be used at Microsoft stores that accept that currency . For example , if a Microsoft store accepts Euros ( G ) , then you may only use the money in your account if it is denominated in Euros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain currency may only be added to a Microsoft account registered in the jurisdiction that recognizes such currency as an official currency , and then may only be used at Microsoft stores available in that jurisdiction . Your account balance may not be converted to another currency . <p> This is a difficult one , it 's not a glitch at all but could it be considered a loophole for financial gain ? It does offer the opportunity to get games at a reduced price if you are lucky with exchange rates , but the publisher is still getting the full asking price they asked for and importantly a sale . Financial gain could also be defined as you gaining money from it , which you certainly are not unless you count the saving as gaining ( but then depends how you define the term ' financial gain ' - the problem is its so open to Microsoft 's interpretation based on how they want to enforce it ) . If they applied this rule they could ' permanently suspend ' your account but to date this has only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full games for free ( not for people purchasing games in a different region ) . It 's also worth considering if it really could be considered a loophole , it 's something they implemented ( region free and easy region switching ) so that does n't sound like much of a loophole , more intended by design ( though more so for people moving regions than people just switching them on the fly while not actually travelling ) . <p> Also it 's worth me mentioning two important quotes , one that Albert Penello ( Microsoft Director of Marketing ) said in an interview with EuroGamer : <p> " You can use one of the 13 digital marketplaces corresponding to our launch markets , assuming you have a valid payment instrument for those countries . Lots of people in Europe specifically travel , move , and visit family , " he continued before slyly adding " Now , of course , if you were using Pre-Paid cards ... " <p> In addition to buying a disc from a retailer , you can also download games from Xbox Live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , you will be able to play them offline just like you do today . Xbox One games will be playable on any Xbox One console -- there will be no regional restrictions . <p> Based on all the information available on their terms of use on the Xbox site , Microsoft Billing 's website , and the Xbox enforcement page there is no specific mention that this specifically is against their terms and conditions . Combining that with the quote from Albert Penello and the Xbox Wire site as well as the fact that they are the ones that took down the regional lock outs which DID exist with Xbox 360 , I would say it 's safe from Microsoft 's viewpoint providing you have a valid billing address . For those of you making addresses up though , it 's risky but then I guess it would depend on how likely they are to look up your address and try to validate it ( there are millions of members of Xbox Live after all ) . <p> My ultimate advice to play it 100% safe though is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend/family in the US to purchase for you either in retail stores or online via say Newegg , and use that US friend 's address for your US Billing address to be safe if you can . Then in a sense it is no different to you visiting your friend/family and purchasing the game while you are out there . <p> Local Government ( Tax ) <p> This is a difficult one to give advice on because it 's different depending on the country in question . <p> It 's important to understand that if you purchase goods outside your own country , you 're usually liable for some form of ' import tax ' which is added at the border . If you have ever ordered games from Play-Asia or a US store you likely got a bit of bill shock when the bill from the post service arrived ( while this is n't true for goods inside the European Economic Area , it is for goods from regions outside the European Economic Area ) . This is to make up for the fact you did n't pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods in question when buying from a different country . <p> By buying the games ( or should we say , ' goods ' ) from the Xbox Live US Store you are affectively avoiding sales tax / VAT for your purchase ( which is one of the reasons why it 's a lot cheaper for you ) . However as it is all digital flowing over the internet it 's next to impossible for your border control / tax office to know of the purchase and attempt to charge you ' import tax ' . That does n't mean you 're not liable for it , just you have n't got caught . Also , if you paid US sales tax on your games , that does n't make you not liable for import tax in your own country for the record . If you bought goods from a US retail store while aboard , that does n't exclude you from then having to pay your own countries sales tax / VAT on your return . <p> However , this then brings us to a possible loop hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy goods and then bring them back home and never pay the ' import tax ' . This is what 's known as a personal allowance . Providing the goods are not being brought back home with the intent to re-sell , your allowed a set ' amount ' to import free of sales tax / VAT . If you have ever gone on holiday with a smoker , you 're likely to know they tend to bring back as many cigarettes as possible up to a ' personal allowance ' for that very reason . The personal allowance varies per country , but that is one possible ' legal ' reason to say you do n't need to pay any tax . However whenever or not that applies for digital goods when you never visited the country is a whole other question . Sadly if you ever looked deeply into laws , your realise they are terribly out of date when it comes to the modern day and the internet . It 's a difficult one , and one that there is no firm answer for . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One game and brought it back with you , you can play it with no additional tax , but does this apply to your digital games ? <p> Also a key point to know , is looking back at the early days of Steam , on its first few years of launch there was n't regional stores . Purchasing games from Europe or elsewhere in the world results in paying in US dollars and has no sales tax . You did n't see your local government come chasing you for payment for missing sales tax or tax avoidance . That has changed as Steam grew and it now has regional stores with the relevant sales tax but the principle is the same . <p> So ultimately , if you want to play it safe you could always declare your purchase to your relevant tax office / border control , but at the same time I believe there is a very good argument it could come out of your personal allowance . Use your own judgement , and follow the laws of your own country . <p> It 's also worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy currently negotiating the world 's largest free trade agreement . If this ever takes force , then this practice will become entirely legal and protected under law for Europeans ( but still questionable for those not in Europe ) . <p> I 've reserved this post for any questions later down the line . I will keep this updated based on questions posted below on Digiex , or asked across reddit or other forums/sites that link back to here . <p> I 've seen reports that Microsoft are region locking games from different regions , disabling access and showing the error message 0x87de07d1 . Are Microsoft adding region locks ? <p> Sadly these reports were blown out of the water by some news sites with inexperienced news writers who were either focusing on click-baiting users for views or did n't understand the situation . <p> The facts of the situation were as follows : <p> Some eBay sellers were selling a large number of Forza 5 and Dead Rising 3 ' Game ' codes . By game codes , I mean 25 digit codes that you can redeem on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were advertised as region free and for a period of time worked . However sadly 10 days later or so after these were sold people started finding the games were no longer unlocked on their accounts and their Xbox 's were asking them to purchase again displaying the ' 0x87de07d1 ' error . <p> Sadly it appears the codes were not suppose to be region free , but Microsoft made a mistake and instead of just rejecting the code saying ' it 's not valid in your region ' , it accepted them then later ' re-adjusting ' so to speak and invalidating the licenses . In Microsoft 's defense , everyone that contacted them based on the Xbox Forums managed to get a new code issued correctly for their region , and the seller offered refunds ( so actually many of them ended up with free games ... ) . However Microsoft never officially commented on what the long term plan is , are they either going to enforce region locks on full game codes and reject codes upfront , or was it just a bug and there system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free game codes . <p> It 's important to understand the key difference here , this is n't region locking of games or locking down purchasing of games from different regions . It is just locking down pre-paid codes which they already do for other Xbox One codes . For example , I can not redeem a $10 Xbox Live pre-paid code on the European Store Xbox One store . However what I can do , is switch my Store region per the guide on this site to the US store then go ahead and redeem it . It just means making sure codes are redeemed in the correct region . <p> I 've heard Microsoft banned people from downloading games from different regions . Will I get banned for this ? <p> Let 's first clear up the situation : At the time of writing , no one has been banned for switching to a different region and purchasing games . If Microsoft ever changed this stance , trust me I would update this guide straight away and remove it because the last thing I want is for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people purchasing games from the Xbox One US store have a lot of content legally assigned to our gamertags , as well as saved games and years ' worth of achievements . Getting banned would be a terrible situation and one I would like to avoid myself , and avoid anyone going through . <p> In the history of Xbox Live , there was one ban wave which was regarding regions and that was to do with the ' Oman / Bosnia ' glitch . What this involved was actually switching your account to one of those regions which did n't even have an Xbox Live Marketplace , exploiting cached search data and then taking advantage of an Integer overflow to effectively download content which should have cost , for free . <p> To provide further re-assurances , this was the process that involved getting banned for region exploiting : <p> - You have an account in a country with an Xbox Live marketplace . You can browse the marketplace just fine and buy games at whatever your region 's prices are . - You create an account in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to browse the marketplace it wo n't work because there is no marketplace in the country the new account is in. - Because your console has cached search results from a region with a marketplace , you are able to use the search function to access marketplace entries on an account that is supposed to be in a region with no marketplace . - Because those items have no pricing information , they will show up with an insane price . -98295793498734298 Microsoft points ( integer overflow ) . Of course the console will not let you buy this , problem solved . - Uh oh ! Microsoft switched all their pricing to dollars , not points . Problem being that because MS Point prices were signed integers and cash prices are unsigned , some items show up as being free . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> As you can see , this was completing different situation to the current one about legally purchasing with your own money games from a different Xbox One region . That was purposely exploiting a bug in the Xbox 360 Marketplace to steal content and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . <p> Of course , I can not guarantee 100% that they wo n't change there mind down the line and come down on people for purchasing games from the US Region from outside the US , but based on the facts of the last 11 years of Xbox Live and the information I posted up in Implications part of the guide I am of the opinion it 's extremely unlikely . <p> What if I use this workaround to break a street date of a game in my region when it 's not yet released but is in the US ( like Titanfall ) ? <p> This is a good question , and one I can not provide a 100% guaranteed answer . You may have heard in the past when GTAIV released , many people illegally downloaded the game early and got banned which is fair enough , but we also know many legit users who got the game early like Amazon UK customer 's ( who accidentally shipped the game for delivery on Saturday before , not the Tuesday release date ) received both account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a trusted member of Digiex had the disc and receipt to prove they got the game legitimately and played one day before general release and got banned ( with no modifications to his console at all or any other infringement issues ) , and Microsoft were not interested in the evidence to prove it and the ban for " Xbox LIVE account privileges have been permanently suspended due to playof pirated or otherwise illegally obtained titles " was never overturned . <p> However , GTAIV had a worldwide release date so it was n't people taking advantage of other regions to purchase games , That is the main difference . Also GTAIV had so much press coverage and Rockstar did n't want anything from the game leaking early and were using legal methods like DMCA to take down any leaks from people who played early and did n't provide any news sites with review copies before general release . If you are buying a game from the US , it means the games already released somewhere in the world and news sites and gamers will already have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such I personally doubt they will be as motivated to actively ban people for it in other regions . <p> Though it is important to note , Microsoft will be VERY aware that you are playing the game outside of the United States . Your IP address ( Internet address ) will clearly not be American ( unless you use a VPN , but use of a VPN is very much against the Xbox Live Terms of Use so do n't ever do it ! ) . Combined with the fact your game will likely try to connect to the local Xbox Live servers in your region and not the one 's in the US by default ( though this does n't stop you playing it online , you will just end up playing with American 's which is no problem if you speak English ) . So Microsoft WILL know your playing it outside the US and could decide down the line to take action if they so desired . However , there is legitimate reasons this could occur in a few cases , Armed forces members from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Xbox and Microsoft has been very supportive of this . If they used there Xbox Live account 's to purchase games while stationed over sea 's that is a legitimate use . Likewise for any American 's who are traveling oversea 's and took their Xbox with them . However this is one other key difference , although you can have multiple billing accounts in different regions which this guide enables , your ' Microsoft Accounts ' region and your primary Xbox region will be your country of origin unless you have done a full on account migration per the 360 method , they could use this as a detection method when it comes to issuing enforcement action on people playing an unreleased game outside America . <p> I 'm not trying to say do n't do it at all if you want to , there 's a very good chance they will do nothing in terms of enforcement of this for the very reasons that they only cared about leaks in the past and the region free stance discussed all over this guide . But this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchasing games from the US so please do be aware . It 's one thing to do it for cheaper games or to get round censorship ( like in Germany ) , but to do it to break street dates is risky . At the time of writing , those who did this for Rayman Legends , Tomb Raider or Plants vs Zombies : Garden Warfare have not received any bans and the games did work outside the US , however for example with the upcoming Titanfall release , this is the first major game release this is likely to happen on ( though saying that , most major releases from decent publishers have worldwide same-day releases anyways so this would n't be a concern ) . Based on the outcome of the Titanfall release , this will likely set precedent going forward to how Microsoft will handle this situation . <p> Update 16/03/2014 : It 's been confirmed as working fine for Titanfall and no bans have been issued at time of writing . The game downloaded fine and no geo-location blocking took place . <p> Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worked and can I share this with others ? <p> I 've personally tested all the methods of payment listed in the guide to come up with the conclusions I 've written up about . All in all , to make this guide has taken over 15 hours of my time researching , testing and documenting my discoveries so that I can write up here the fact 's of the situations based on my findings . This includes many purchases on Xbox One content I did n't really need or want for the purpose of testing , so ultimately it 's taken 15 hours + my own money to bring you this as it stands . As such , I hope you find it helpful as well as the documentation regarding Implications and FAQ questions very informative . Of course , everything legal is from my own personal view and interpretation of the information available from my research into the issue so please do come to your own conclusion based on the information I have provided ( I am not a lawyer , just a gamer who wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share this with others , but as an author I do have one request I would hope you are able to follow . When sharing this guide , please do not just lift the content by copying and pasting it elsewhere , it 's taken a lot of my own time to complete this guide to the level of detail it currently stands and seeing your hard work ripped away in a 5 second copy and paste job and seeing someone else take credit is a horrible feeling . Therefore please do share this with your friends , family , other gamers , social media and even other websites if you feel its worthy but please link people to my guide here on Digiex instead of lifting the content . In return , I will keep this guide updated with new discoveries as they happen , as well as the changing landscape of Xbox One purchases from different regions ( like if Microsoft change processes in Xbox One updates , change the rules or terms and conditions ) . I will also keep the FAQ up to date based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this thread . I want this to be the most up to date , feature rich and most helpful Step by Step guide and information bank on this topic . Thank you <p> Update 18/03/2014 I 'm purchasing via PayPal and getting the error : " Your purchase ca n't be completed with this payment option . Try a different or new way to pay . " ? <p> It appears shortly after Titanfall released and thousands of people across the internet took advantage of this to get Titanfall 4 days early outsite the US , Microsoft took steps to stop obvious abuse of the system with the PayPal option . As such , they seem to have strengthened the PayPal protections in place , checking the registered PayPal address in the connected account in some cases . As I had a confirmed American address on my account I have had no problems , but I 've seen posts over Reddit for those who do not have a US address suddenly finding they are unable to purchase goods with PayPal recently . <p> Reports are mixed , some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but others are now unable to use it at all since Titanfall . A few people even had their Xbox Live accounts flagged with a ' Risk Block ' due to all the invalid billing addresses they lied with to get this working . When this happens , they got the error message " Your purchase can not be completed at this time . Please try again . " . It 's important to stress there has only been a few incidents with this , and while it could be connected it 's also more likely they suddenly added a new address and payment method and unexpectedly made large purchases which caused the account to be flagged as possibly hacked . If you do end up in this situation , you have to phone Xbox Support and they will confirm a few things and review the account then remove the ' Risk alert ' and allow you to purchase goods again . My advice with this as always is to use a real address because if you have to phone support the last thing you want is a totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . If you do not have pre-paid codes or your own credit card ( which still works perfectly for the record , the issue is only with using PayPal from a different region ) you can still use PayPal to purchase the goods , but you will need to rely on a US based family member or friend . What you do is send them the amount of money via Paypal that you wish to get in Xbox Gift Cards , and when sending them the payment be sure to ticket ' I 'll pay the fee ' , it 's only around an additional dollar . They can then use that PayPal balance to buy gift cards direct from newegg digitally , at the below URL : <p> This way , they do n't need to go into a physical shop and you do n't need to use expensive international bank transfers ( which take days ) . The Gift Cards will come as a code which you can then just redeem on your US Billing Account ( I recommend doing it at the Commerce site as detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ensure your redeeming the code into the correct billing account . <p> I must stress than Newegg do insist on having a US Billing Address , and attempting to use PayPal from outside the US will cause the transaction to fail . Also as a new account ( if your doing it yourself ) your order is more likely to require verification which will fail , vs getting a genuine US based person to purchase it legally for you . <p> It does add an extra hurdle to the process , but still means your using PayPal and your friend does n't have to do anything like banking the money or going to a shop and paying sales tax , they can just use the funds you sent them to directly pay for it on newegg . It takes them up to an hour to get the digital pre-paid code , unless newegg decide to ' verify ' the payment method . This happened to one Digiex member once but they still got the code within 48 hours and has n't happened since . If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could just do it for say $120 ( 2 games ) and just keep the balance on your account . This is also more in line with the Xbox Live Terms and Conditions and is n't fraudulently putting an address on your account , so is most likely a safer option down the line ... <p> Again the codes are delivered electronically , so you get them almost instantly . However unlike Newegg , Amazon do not seem to do much validation and people have used a non-US Amazon account with a made up ' US Shipping address ' added to it to complete the purchase . This is n't as legal as getting a US friend to buy on your behalf from Newegg with PayPal , but it does provide an option for people who do not have access to US based friends to complete the purchase unaided . <p> Tried paying via paypal and got an Error code . Did not work for me : / Follow it step by step as well . <p> Update : I think i got it to work ! I just sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main so i am not paying with my CC , and it just let me buy some micro DLC on ghosts . Tomorrow will be the real test though , will i be able to buy Titanfall ? i freaking hope so <p> Tried paying via paypal and got an Error code . Did not work for me : / Follow it step by step as well . <p> I think i got it to work ! I just sent money to one pay pal account then back to my main so i am not paying with my CC , and it just let me buy some micro DLC on ghosts . Tomorrow will be the real test though , will i be able to buy Titanfall ? i freaking hope so 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Interesting , I 've never had that problem . Though my PayPal account is linked to my bank account so it uses that for funding if I do n't have the balance ( the bank account is n't US at all ) . This could be interesting if this is just related to having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with your account . Do let me know how it goes and I can update the guide if it 's the case and others experience it to . <p> I have created an American billing account , attached my PayPal account to it and changed my location on my XB1 . I have made a trial purchase ( Forza 5 100 tokens , cost $0.99 ) , which went through fine .

@@21399060 @1399060/ <p> Everyone will remember 2016 as the year that 4K and HDR became mainstream . Amazon beat Netflix to it and started producing all its original content in the format and making it available for the masses . The later part of the year and the release of the Grand Tour which at least for International Markets was the biggest win for Amazon further pushed this message as all content was available in 4K with full 10-bit HDR support ( via HDR10 ) . <p> ? <p> However it seems Amazon does n't follow one of the basic principles which its competitor Netflix follows which is to remain out of the hardware wars . To explain , let 's first look at the History . <p> Amazon has had its own hardware business for a number of years , firstly they launched their Kindle range originally which served a purpose of allowing them to sell digital books . This was then followed by them releasing full on Tablets like the Fire HD Tablet which conveniently became one of few Android based releases which purposely did n't come with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went unnoticed by most , but you could already see Amazon at this stage trying to push its complete control . <p> Let 's further this to 2015 ; where Amazon moved into the TV landscape . They launched their own FireTV sticks which again powered by Android , using there own App Store and UI ( entirely hiding the fact that Google coded the entire OS powering it ) . <p> ? <p> At first , it seemed fine . It 's another competitor to the landscape up against the likes of Google Chromecast and Apple TV . Competition was good because it meant more development for them all as they tried to win over customers wallets . However this is where some would say Amazon stepped over the line and started abusing there monopoly . <p> By their own decision , they decided to ONLY release the Amazon Video app which they also own on their own platform , Roku ( who was a niche company which they could buy at any time if it became a problem ) and popular Games Consoles . They completely ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as they were owned by Google and Apple . <p> One could argue that as Games Consoles were not a threat to Amazon as its not a market they are in yet , it allowed them to use them to further gain a foothold into peoples home <p> It get 's worse though , they later decided to avoid ' confusing ' consumers , that the Chromecast and Apple TV 's sold on the Amazon platform must also be removed as they will confuse ' customers ' who expect to be able to watch Amazon Video . There was no confusion ; Amazon purposefully refused to release their own Video App on those Platforms , to then use that as an excuse to then delist them from the Amazon Store . <p> The de-listing did n't just apply to Amazon sold goods , but any third party who used the Amazon platform to sell goods . This was the first major step in a clear anti-competitive move by Amazon to kill the competition using its Monopoly in the online marketplace <p> Let 's be under no illusion ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell what they want . That does n't take into account Amazon has a monopoly ; they are the biggest destination worldwide for electronic goods . Not having your goods on Amazon is like losing 70% of the potential market share . <p> Amazon knew what they were doing and they were doing it on purpose to abuse their market position as the online store of choice for Electronics across the western world <p> A search for Chomecast or Apple TV on Amazon also always came back with a result of the Fire TV Stick at first place . This is n't a search engine algorithm working out of the box , it was a clear abuse of position by redirecting queries . The Product page for the Amazon Fire TV mentions Chromecast or Apple TV no where on the product page - so how could a search engine on Amazon 's site return it unless it was manually forced in ? <p> ? <p> Move forward to 2016/2017 and Amazon are at it again . In 2016 they released an Amazon Fire TV 4K Edition . Another android device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device though does NOT support 60FPS at 4K with HDR due to its cheap usage of HDMI1.4 <p> However to push it 's sales , they continued to refuse to support Amazon Video on the capable Chromecast Ultra ( which supports 4K at 60 FPS and HDR 10-bit which is more than can be said about Amazons own Fire TV ) . <p> It further developed that originally Amazon were going to add 4K and HDR support to the Xbox One S ; the new mid-cycle refresh Microsoft did for the Xbox which added 4K/HDR support . As you can see from the marketing material from Microsoft themselves ; they quote Amazon Video as supporting 4K like Netflix <p> ? <p> However now its 2017 , and this never materialised . It 's yet another move by Amazon of withholding 4K Video Support from Rival platforms . In 2015 they did n't consider Games Console 's a threat it seems in 2017 with the advent of the new 4K Fire TV and Game Controller support Amazon now does . <p> The same applies to both the Playstation 4 Pro which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Amazon or Sony ; it was wildly assumed they would be updated like all the competitors . <p> Let 's look at Netflix - which currently is the market leader . Netflix releases apps on every platform possible - including pretty much every Games Console , every Streaming Device , every TV out there . On each of the platforms they are on , they support everything the device does - so if the TV supports 4K so does Netflix , if it does HDR so does Netflix . They do not want platform exclusivity , they do not have an agenda outside of getting you to view their content on whatever devices you have . <p> Now in the interest of fairness - I must admit if you use the Amazon Video apps on Smart TV 's that have App Stores like Samsung , Sony . Amazon Video does indeed support 4K / HDR videos right now . Though one has to ask - how long will this last ? Right now Amazon do n't produce their own brand of TV 's . <p> However it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing at right now and how they have been introducing their own brand electronics in numerous areas that it 's not long till either Amazon do their own TV 's or at least start bundling ' Fire TV ' built into the TV 's . When that does happen , I can see the exact same battle taking place . <p> A new format will be introduced and you will suddenly find only the official Amazon Fire TV will support it . Though if Amazon keep up there current rate of doing evil to push their own empire you may suddenly find the Apps on Smart TV 's get blocked from 4K/HDR or something similar under the excuse ' Apps must be updated and they are not available on your platform " . <p> Mark my words ; this is a fast changing landscape and I do n't think that idea is farfetched anymore if you include everything they have done up till now . <p> I remember talking about this to a few people a year or so ago before Amazon did the 4K block on Xbox One S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good company and it must be Apple demanding a share of revenues which blocked the Apple TV . Firstly let 's debunk that theory . Amazon have already avoided the revenue share requirement on Apple 's App Store by NOT selling subscriptions in the app ( as seen on the iPad and iPhone apps ) . They could use the exact same logic on the Apple TV application . Secondly , the Chromecast API for casting is free for any developer - no terms , no catches . So that does n't excuse it missing from Chromecast or Apple TV . Lastly , the console market does n't  have the same issues - there 's no revenue share providing subscriptions are n't  sold directly in the app and Microsoft and Sony are very happy with this - as seen by Microsoft promoting Amazon 4K on the Xbox One S commercials . <p> Fast forward to 2017 and suddenly everything is fitting into place . This is n't a theory . this is happening right now . People need to realise that Amazon and the Amazon Video service is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon are doing no better than the old cable / satalite premium TV providers like Sky are . They are using their market share to kill the competition and force you onto there hardware and in turn ; their services . <p> So what can realistic be done about this ? Well first of all , spread the message . Stop giving Amazon Video free publicity to your friends and family and actually call it out for what it is - a company intent to do evil at the cost of good players like Netflix . <p> Secondly ; if it matters to you drop an email to jeff @ amazon.com ( the CEO of Amazon and the mastermind behind all this ) ; he does read emails and pass them onto his executive team . Tell him your a Prime Subscriber who 's fed up with being forced to purchase Fire TV hardware you do n't want or need . The bigger the voice against it , the better for all . <p> Lastly ; I do n't promote piracy - but the good side to this is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware the encryption around Amazon shows has been utterly defeated . On your favourite sources of material if you do download ; you will find 4K / HDR rips of all the Amazon shows which you can download and watch on your device of choice - even a Chromecast or Xbox One S. I do n't encourage piracy so let 's make that clear - but if you have a Prime Subscription and you are being blocked by nasty business practices they would struggle in court without unearthing their monopolist behaviour . <p> Final thought . It 's not going to be long until Amazon and Netflix become so mainstream that they become the new norm for TV . While this does n't help people in the US , Canada or indeed the UK anymore - there is some hope that the EU will get involved . It 's been seen time and time again how the EU is willing to stand up to to monopoly abusing companies and in time video on demand will become regulated due to its widespread reach and you may find Amazon being ordered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope . <p> If you question any of the sources or motives in this article , I also encourage you to do your own research . There is information out their if you search hard enough . A few posts on Reddit , ex-Amazon employees willing to speak up , various investigations by high profile researches who fully took apart various apps and more . <h> Comments <p> Great editorial ! I got Prime Video for The Grand Tour , what annoys me most is that their Xbox One app is region restricted . The app itself is not available here in Finland , had to change my console region to UK to download it . The app works fine , but I can only watch Amazon Originals on it , other content is unavailable . <p> I did some googling and apparently Amazon has had a 4k &amp; HDR capable app ready for Xbox One , some had gotten it as an update in December but they quickly pulled it and emailed the people using it to stop using it and to reinstall to get the old version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media at the time it was Amazon 's choice not to support Prime Video on the Chromecast and it was simply an anti competitive move to use that as an excuse sell them . Amazon are pretty good at responding on social media , however I was simply ignored , for obvious reasons i 'd imagine . <p> I must admit i did generally use Amazon a lot , however regardless of that i never felt the need to pay for Amazon Prime , mainly because i 'm usually not that bothered about my order coming next day and the video side of it does n't work on the devices I would actually watch it on most of the time , so i 'd be simply wasting money . <p> However because i do n't have Amazon Prime , theirs actually a lot of things Amazon randomly refuse to sell me now . The most recent one was the GameCube Controller Adapter for the Wii U. <p> I then discovered places in the UK such as Argos and Currys usually price match Amazon on electrical / entertainment items allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That has actually worked out pretty well for me as theirs an Argos and Currys down the road from where I work , meaning i 've got items cheaper than Amazons best price and been able to pick it up on my way home , getting the item faster than I would have from Amazon . <p> Anyway that 's getting a bit off topic , the point i 'm making is better alternatives to Amazon exist in a lot of areas . I still use Amazon as i 'm not loyal to one shop or service , however it does n't hurt to shop around . It 's pretty obvious Amazon are pushing prime a bit too hard , like Microsoft did with Internet Explorer back in the 90 's , sooner or later i think that will come back to bite them if Amazon carry on in the direction their going . <p> It 's interesting you point piracy out , I know thanks to Amazon Video theirs a lot of DVD / Blu-ray quality rips of content out there of old shows which have never been released on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD or near Blu-ray quality copies are readily available . <p> So as much as I do n't really like Amazon Video , I do like the DRM is weak , so TV show fanatics can archive the best quality copies of their old favorite TV shows , which are simply not possible to purchase on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21399061 @1399061/ <h> Set up an Amiga emulator to play roms / adf images ( How to instructions ) <p> The Amiga is a family of personal computers that was sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s . The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical , audio and multi-tasking abilities . The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers , such as the Commodore 64 , and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts . The best selling model , the Amiga 500 , was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe . <p> Here is a Guide on how to get this Emulator Running Perfect INSTALLATION 1 . ) Extract the AMIGA.rar 2 . ) Install " InstallWinUAE2320 " Emulator 3 . ) Once installed Extract KICKROMS.rar and place the KICKROMS folder to where the Emulator was installed 4 . ) Create a Games Folder and Extract AMIGA GAMES.rar into it and place the folder also where the Emulator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Now the emulator looks tricky but its actualy Very simple ) The first thing you need to do is select the " PATHS " Tab on the left hand side THEN where it says SYSTEM ROMS click the browse icon and GOTO the KICKROMS FOLDER , Once there click the " Select Folder " button at the bottom and it will Find all the Kickroms and tell you what 's avalible . <p> Next Goto Quickstart and here you are able to select what type of Amiga you want to emulate from the drop down menu So select the model tab and Choose A500+ Then where it says Configuration change that to 4MB Fast RAM Configuration <p> Now were Ready choose a game ....

The problem here is to sign in to the PSN you have to update your PS4 . So you might be wondering what you can do ? <p> This is where Settings &gt; User Guide comes in very handy . The PS4 User Guide found under the Settings menu is actually just a web page , this mean 's using some DNS trickery you can make the PS4 load any webpage of your choice , instead of the User Guide . <p> In this tutorial I will show you how to make the User Guide load the PS4 Playground , which is currently capable booting Linux on your PS4 . <p> You have two options on how to proceed here , the easy way , or the harder way : <p> Easy Option - You are relying on someone else to host a DNS server that redirects manuals.playstation.net to a website hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your router to redirect manuals.playstation.net to your own webserver hosting the PS4 Playground . The advantage of this is that you are in total control , however this does require some networking and server setup knowledge which is beyond the scope of this guide to teach you . <p> If you are unsure the easy option is more than good enough to get started with PS4 hacking . <p> Easy Option : <p> On the PS4 go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Setup Internet Connection &gt; <p> Choose either : <p> Use WiFi <p> Use a Lan cable <p> Then for " How do you want to setup the internet connection " choose " Custom " <p> On IP Address Settings choose " Automatic " <p> For DHCP Host Name choose " Do Not Specify " <p> Now for DNS Settings Choose " Manual " <p> Enter 89.108.88.221 as the primary DNS Server <p> MTU Settings should be left on " Automatic " <p> Select " Do not use " for the Proxy Server . <p> That 's it , you can then test the internet connection and exit back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; User Guide the PS4 Playground should now load <p> You are ready to start exploiting your PS4 now ! <p> Harder Option - Redirect manuals.playstation.net to the PS4 Playground on your own router : <p> How you go about doing this will vary depending on your home router , chances are you will not easily be able to do this on a lot of home routers , especially cheap ones provided by your ISP . However if not then the easy alternative i provided above will be fine , this is simply provided for the more technical users , with advanced setups , who might want to setup a totally offline solution . <p> Because of the many 1000 's of potential different home network setup 's it 's impossible to provide a step by step tutorial from start to finish for this harder option , however the hints provided should be enough for more technical users to learn enough about how I created my own setup . <p> Host Override For manuals.playstation.net : <p> On your router you want to create a " Host Override " for manuals.playstation.net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playground . <p> For this you are welcome to use my mirror of the PS4 Playground to test with , this is hosted on the IP address 178.32.55.197 <p> Host : manualsDomain : playstation.netIP : 178.32.55.197 ( This is the IP of the web server on my local network hosting the PS4 Playground ) <p> Now when any device on my network visits manuals.playstation.net , the PS4 Playground is loaded : <p> Presuming the above works iff you want to keep everything the PS4 is accessing within your local network , you now need to setup a webserver on local network . <p> Once your web server is setup add manuals.playstation.net as a website you are hosting . You can then host the PS4 Playground locally , simply using your router to redirect manuals.playstation.net to the IP address of the web server on your local network . <p> Different language settings on the PS4 make the User Manual load a different page , so I simply have 404 errors on my own webserver redirect to the PS4 Playground html files .

I will continueto search and try as I would like to manage to do so without buying the xbox360hard drive transfer cable . I am posting pictures showing all the above : <p> The only other thing i can think is Party Buffalo might not like the folder it 's saved in , as it 's quite a long file path . Maybe copy the . exe to the root of your C : drive and try it from there . <p> Their 's also an app called FatXplorer which is a pad for app , however you get a 7 day trial . All I can think of trying that and see if can get the data copied across with that . I do n't own the app so ca n't really provide any help with that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy your data across presuming it works . <p> I have already tried to put the . exe of Party Buffalo just under the Root ( C and then run it with administrator rights but it did not work ( meaning that it still crashes with the same as always error ) . So I have downloaded the FatXplorer as you suggested and I am trying to find of how I can inject the saved games to the hdd without damaging the hdd ( so I will not need to rehack it ) I know you already said that you do not know the program but I was just wondering if you had an idea of how this could be achieved with the use of FatXplorer . Thank you . <p> I wanted to say that I managed to extract the saved games and Profiles from the original hard drive to the Desktop in my Laptop and then from there to the hacked xbox360 hard drive . Then I connected the hard drive to the xbox360 and first of all recognized the hdd ( 460GB ) and then I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as saved games , then to be sure I installed on the hdd one game ( Metal Gear Solid the Phantom Pain ) and then was also able to continue from my last saved game.So I am excited to see that finally everything works exactly as I imagined it to be , having huge space to install games but also All the saves that I conducted in the past in my old Hdd as well as the ones from the memory stick ( 256Mb ) . One last question , do all different Profiles see the same saved games , and if yes could I delete all my old profiles and just keep one Profile but able to see All the saved games in the Hdd ? Sorry if it is a silly question but I need to know . <p> Each profile has its own save data , in the " Content " folder you copied across the " 0000000000000000 " folder contains the installed / downloaded game data and DLC , then each other folder relates to a different profile you have . <p> Now it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however you usually have to mess about re signing the save game . Another side effect of this is that I can cause you to unlock achievements out of order , or even unlock some achievements without having others unlocked . e.g. finish level 4 without having the achievements for levels 1,2 and 3 . <p> If you play on Xbox Live i would n't do this , as people have been banned for achievement hacking in the past , which is what it will look like your doing if you end up with a situation like i described above . <p> I would n't be interested in the achievements as I do not play in Xbox Live at all . I did not understand what you said about " you usually have to mess about re signing the save game " . <p> I do not exactly know what folders to I have to copy from each Profile and to which exactly place to paste them on the one and only Profile that I intend to keep . <p> If this is not something that you would propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it and I am sure that I will not mesh anything on the hard disk or the Profiles .

I 've followed your step-by-step instructions and at the end I have my windows laptod connected via wifi to my android device , which is running a VPN ( tunnelbear ) and offering a hot spot . Internet connection on laptot seems allright , I even see some sent and received packets , but I have no Internet access from any browser . Even ping does n't work , both to alias and IP addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is related to the fact that I do n't use a router , so that I could n't set the DNS of my client to 192.168.1.1. or similar ; so I tried setting as DNS address on laptop both the smartphone address ( 192.168.1.43 ) or even google DNS ( 8.8.8.8 ) ... but no way , there is no connection . <p> That all looks ok to me , it might be worth asking tunnelbear if they have any DNS servers you can use when connected to the VPN . <p> I have only tested this using OpenVPN Access Server as the VPN server , however when running on a server with a dedicated IP address for the DNS ip address i simply used the servers IP which worked fine . <p> Hello insanenutter , thanks your very much for this helpful thread . I have followed your instructions and they work perfectly . The only thing that I ca n't get working is the " userinit.sh " . I have created the file and stored it in the correct location ( /data/local ) , but it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a custom rom " rXTREME-KK-v.2.1-XXUFNJ1 " on a rooted I9305 . <p> Thank you for this tutorial . It 's awesome , but I really need some help . I 'm on T-Mobile using a rooted HTC One M7 with a custom ROM called ViperOne . <p> I can input all the commands in terminal emulator up to the step where I 'm supposed to enter : <p> ip route add default dev tun0 scope link table 61 <p> Then it comes back with : <p> RTNETLINK answers : File exists . <p> After that it coughs up errors after each line , and I am still getting the tethering upsell screen on my other devices . I am using TORguard VPN service settings with the OpenVPN Android client . The VPN seems to be working as it shows the service 's IP on a DNS leak test on both the phone and PC , but it is still counting PC traffic against my tethering limit . <p> Thank you in advance for any help you can offer . I used to just be able to use a VPN client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten smarter so really need this to work . <p> Thank you for the guide , very useful - I 'm able to make my tethering connection go through my vpn which goes through my mobile internet ... With a bit of wrangling . <p> Do you know of any way to make DHCP work correctly ? Currently , it appears DHCP on the phone is returning the VPN servers IP instead of a local IP ... I want to use this for Chromecast , which does n't like static configurations . <p> Also , I 'm using the built in Android VPN system - I just had to change tun0 with ppp0 . <p> EDIT : I just noticed that if I turn off the VPN , DHCP works and WiFi connects . If I turn the VPN back on , the connection will go through the VPN . This should solve the chromecast issue <p> Thanks for the very useful guide . I 've got it running and it 's all going well . <p> There 's one small annoyance though . I live in a rural area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period or so and then reconnects to a different tower . When that happens , OpenVPN disconnects , the tun0 device disappears , and the wifi tethering then seems to be sent through rmnet0 , causing a tethering block ( and requiring an airplane mode cycle ) . <p> OpenVPN 's ' Seamless Tunnel ' feature sounds like it should stop this from happening , but obviously not . Do you have any ideas how to stop this , perhaps by routing traffic to nowhere if tun0 is not available ( I tried doing this with the metric and the weight parameters but failed ) . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399077 @1399077/ <p> The PSP Custom Firmware 6.61-Pro-C2 will work on all PSP models from the original PSP to the PSP Go and even the E1000 , all you need is to be running the official 6.60 or 6.61 firmware to install and use this custom firmware . <p> Note : On the 15/01/2015 Sony released PSP firmware 6.61 , some three and a half years after the last 6.60 update . It 's of no benefit to you updating to 6.61 after all this time , however the custom firmware has now been updated to support 6.61 . So you can now follow this guide if you happen to have updated to 6.61 . <p> Why would i want to install Custom Firmware on my PSP ? <p> When custom firmware is on your PSP you can use emulators , homebrew applications and even backup your games to the memory stick . This allows you to easily carry around more than one game , and helps to save your PSP 's battery as it does not need to power the UMD drive when playing games . You can also convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All PS1 games are supported , not just games on the PSN . You can also add new features to your PSP via kernel mode background plugins , for example the ability to take screenshots in games . <p> Something to note is that you can only permanently install this firmware on a PSP 1000 or a PSP 2000 that is not an 88 v3 version . However its very easy to re load the custom firmware on a 88V3 PSP 2000 , PSP 3000 , PSP Go or E1000 . I will cover finding out your PSP version later in this guide , all you need to know for now is that if you own a PSP you can follow this guide and get homebrew applications running on your PSP . <p> If the firmware is permanently installed it means your PSP will boot directly in to the custom firmware when powered on , if not it means you will have to enable it again by launching a simple app . This however only needs doing from a cold boot , if you leave the PSP in standby like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) then you will not need to enable it . <p> Regardless of your PSP model you can safely run the PROUPDATE application : <p> After running the update press " X " and the custom firmware will install , all been well your PSP will now be running custom firmware until you power it off . <p> That 's it , it 's a simple as that your PSP is now running custom firmware and can take advantage of all the additional abilities of a hacked PSP , however read on for information on how to permanently flash the custom firmware if supported by your PSP , or how to enable the custom firmware again if you power your PSP off . <p> 3 . Can i permanently flash the custom firmware to my PSP ? <p> Now your PSP can run unsigned code we will find out if you can permanently flash the custom firmware to your PSP . <p> Unzip and copy the program to your PSP &gt; Game folder like you did with the custom firmware installer , then load PSP Ident up on your PSP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your PSP , the screenshot below is from my PSP 1000 : <p> We can see that my PSP is a 1.2 the 1 been a PSP 1000 and it has a 79 V3 motherboard , which is capable of having custom firmware permanently flashed to it . <p> Remember you can only permanently install this firmware on a PSP 1000 or a PSP 2000 that is not an 88 v3 version . <p> 4 . If you can permanently flash custom firmware read on , if not go to 5 . <p> Copy the CIPLFlasher from the Pro C2 firmware you downloaded to the PSP &gt; Game folder on the memory card , then run the application from your PSP to make the custom firmware permanent . <p> You can now power your PSP off and still have custom firmware when you power it on again , that 's is your PSP is permanently hacked . The only thing that will remove this is by upgrading to a newer official firmware , which at the time of writing does not exist . As its been over 2 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more system updates will be released by Sony . <p> 5 . If you can not permanently flash custom firmware : <p> For PSP 's that can not permanently install custom firmware copy the FastRecovery folders to the PSPGame folder memory card . If you ever power your PSP off simply run this application again to enable custom firmware . The custom firmware will stick until you totally power your PSP off . As mentioned earlier when you normally press the power button the PSP will sleep , to totally power the PSP off you need to hold the power button down for 5 seconds . <p> 6 . End result : <p> I have personally tested and made this firmware permanent on my PSP 1000 and a friends PSP 2000 ( Non 88v3 ) . If you are unsure about anything just use the PROUPDATE and enjoy custom firmware . If you ever power your PSP off fully just use the fast recovery program , there is little risk to your PSP doing this . <p> You will be able to play any game released to date on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect to the PSN and buy stuff .

If you then walk past someone else with a 3DS in sleep mode you " StreetPass " that 3DS and the consoles swap information . <p> What is swapped depends on that games you and the person you are StreetPassing have enabled , most people likely have StreetPass enabled for the Mii Plaza which comes pre installed on the 3DS , so if you StreetPass someone who has this enabled you swap Mii characters which can then help you out in the Mii Plaza mini games . <p> On games such as Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire you can StreetPass people and obtain an Eon Ticket , which allows access to the Southern Island , where the Pokemon Latios or Latias can be found . Without StreetPassing someone who already has an Eon Ticket you would not be able to access this area of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The problem with StreetPass <p> Chances are you do n't live in a major city , or take your 3DS everywhere with you , so finding people to randomly StreetPass can be difficult at times . This is especially true if you are looking to StreetPass someone who has a certain item you need for a game , like an Eon Ticket for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire . <p> However with a bit of trickery you can fool your 3DS in to thinking your PC is an Nintendo Zone Hotspot , which are usually found in Starbucks and McDonalds in the US . When you have done this you can StreetPass with people around the world from the comfort of your own home ! <p> Setting up a Windows 7 or Windows 8 PC / Laptop To StreetPass <p> To follow this tutorial you will need : <p> 3DS / 3DS XL / 2DS or a New 3DS XL <p> A PC or Laptop with two network connections running Windows 7 or Windows 8 <p> One network connection must be Ethernet <p> The other network connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internet via the Ethernet connection , so basically connected to your router with an Ethernet cable The Wireless network connection must not be in use , this will become our fake Nintendo Zone Hotspot . <p> You should see something like this in Network Connections , if you have Hyper-V , Vm-Ware or any VPN software installed which create additional network connections , this can cause you problems , so disable them . <p> First download Maccheck and unzip the Maccheck to the root of your C : drive ( or somewhere you can easily access it from ) <p> Next open a Comment Prompt with Administrator Right ( Right click on Command Prompt and click run as Administrator ) <p> You cant to navigate to where Maccheck was saved , for me this was the root of my D : drive , so as you can see below i simply typed maccheck and my wireless network card was checked for comparability .

What i did was deactivate StreetPass on Pokemon Y , which was getting loads of StreetPass 's . Then load the game up and enable StreetPass again for Pokemon Y. This allowed my Pokemon Omega Ruby to start streetpassing people . It appears the last game you enable StreetPass will not actually StreetPass with other people at the moment , so you might need to disable StreetPass on another game and enable it again , so the game you want to use StreetPass with is not the last game you enabled StreetPass on if that makes sense . <p> I got some StreetPasses , now i can no longer get any more : <p> A random problem i have noticed is after getting a batch of StreetPasses I can no longer get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Network Connections . right clicking on your Ethernet connection ( your internet connection ) , go to properties , then clock the sharing tab .

@@21399080 @1399080/ <h> Xbox 360 How to Flash Your HDDSS.bin in Windows <p> First of all , this is NOT a method I would recommend for everyone as you can brick your drive or your computers ' hard drives if you are careless . If you are trying to build a 360 drive from scratch see here first : How to hack a 250gb sata drive to work in the Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Slim It is a fantastic tutorial written by InsaneNutter and should be used first . This tutorial is only for people who can launch HDDhacker , but it refuses to write to or read from your hard drive . This happens sometimes due to sector 16 being blank and HDDhacker thinking it 's a failure to read , not a blank sector . Just make sure it 's not your SATA controller first . <p> This may allow you to use a non Western Digital hard drive in your 360 . I have successfully done this to a Seagate model recently with no issues whatsoever . But do n't count on it to work on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . <p> Now with that out of the way , here 's your standard disclaimer . If this tutorial works for you , great ! If not , you either did something wrong , or you just have bad luck . Do not come complaining to me or blaming me if you break your hardware , you tried to modify it , not me . <p> Anyway let 's get to the good stuff ! <p> Things you will need : a hard drive you want to modify a hddss.bin appropriate to your hard drive a computer running Windows a hex editor , I used Hex Workshop ( do not ask me how to pirate this software , buy it if you like it ) a way to connect your hard drive to your computer ( which you should already have ) a bit of common sense <p> For this tutorial I used a 250gb WD2500BEVS I salvaged from a dead laptop ( Profit ! ) . For my hddss.bin ( signature file , security sector ) I used the 250GB Hard Drive Security Sector available here . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as easily use the drive directly connected via SATA . In fact SATA is a better idea because you still have to create the partitions with HDDhacker . You can find that in the thread by InsaneNutter listed above . Finally I used Windows XP Professional 32bit . This should work in Vista or Windows 7 as well as long as you run your hex editor as administrator . <p> Step 1 ) Connect your drive to your computer As stated above you can connect your new 360 hard drive to your PC in any manner that makes it visible as a device in Windows as seen below . The drive I 'm modifying is highlighted . <p> Step 2 ) Find and open your hex editor Find where you installed your hex editor and open it . Hex Workshop looks like this . <p> Step 3 ) Find your hard drive In Hex Workshop , select the Disk dropdown menu and select Open Drive ( or CTRL+D ) In the Select box , switch to Physical Disks . The first time Hex Workshop is launched , it defaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected Physical Disks . <p> Your 360 hard drive will most likely be the last drive in your list , the size should also help you identify it . Be ABSOLUTELY sure you select your 360 hard drive on this step . If you select another drive , you could potentially lose all of the data or disable any other drive you modify . <p> The Read Only box should not be selected if you wish to write a hddss.bin . If you 're paranoid ( or just extra careful ) you can turn it on while creating your undo.bin . Just remember to turn it off again when writing your hddss.bin <p> In the Target box , choose your backup filename and location . Most users should use undo.bin for ease of use with HDDhacker tutorials . I used hddss250.bin because the drive already had a 250gb hddss.bin on it from a previous modification . For Starting Sector use 16 For Ending Sector use 22 Results should say Sectors : 7 Size 3 KB . If it does n't , you did something wrong . Click OK to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . <p> If you open the 250gb hddss.bin from digiex.net it will look like this : I opened the backup file I made in Hex Workshop , as you can see it 's originally from a Hitachi drive , but works just fine on my WD drive . <p> Step 5 ) Write sectors 16-22Make sure you disk is open with Read Only off this time , or you will not be able to write your sectors . Return to Step 3 if you opened your drive as Read Only . Select the Disk dropdown menu again . Choose Restore Sectors . <p> For Source File choose the appropriate hddss.bin for your drive . For more information about the correct hddss.bin for your drive see InsaneNutters thread . Make sure you set sector 16 as the Starting Sector under Target Range . Results should once again read Sectors : 7 and Size 3 KB . <p> Once you are sure you have the right hddss.bin and Starting Sector set , click Ok . Again this should only take 1 or 2 seconds to complete . <p> Step 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and written a 360 Hard Drive Security Sector to your 360 hard drive , but you still need to create the partitions with HDDhacker ( or a FreeBoot console ) . Return to InsaneNutters thread as listed above to finish the modification . <p> Once you 're all done your drive should look something like this in the Memory menu on your 360 . <p> I find the Microsoft logo does n't show up on FreeBoot consoles so it does n't show up here . I apologize for the poor quality image ; my capture card is lacking . <p> I hope this tutorial helped , remember to see here FIRST as that is the safest method for modifying your hard drive . <p> C to create partitions , as the firmware should already be written . I 'll update it shortly . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Now When it says Partition 0/2/3 created succesfully do I wait until it says Turn off computer ..... or just shut off computer because nothing is showing just a green blinking underscore .... there 's no other option to do anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could easily have found that out by reading the hddhacker thread , or taking a few seconds to read the hddhacker readme file . Please read official documentation before asking attempting modifications . I also did say this tutorial required common sense . <p> I have a Seagate 250G HDD ( ST9250315AS ) and hence I 'm trying this method instead of using hddhackr for flashing . I have followed the instructions from here for flashing using hex workshop . 1 . ) I 've used the Hitachi 250G HDDSS.BIN that is used in the linked tutorial to flash into Sector 16-22. 2 . ) I have created partitions using hddhackr 3 . ) The partitions can be detected using Xplorer360 4 . ) Without any restoration of files or partitions , I 've inserted the SATA HDD into the Xbox 360 slim 's slot <p> But the xbox 360 slim does n't show the drive in the memory unit ... just shows the built-in 4GB . Can you Harcroft please share how you were able to use the Seagate drive ? ? Is there some step that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive ? ? <p> Doing it on other-than-WD drives is a no-go . I tried it with a Seagate drive and it seems that even if I write the 16-22 sectors and create the partitions , the XBOX still would n't recognize it . Also , all WD drives that are flashed via hddhackr are then seen by the computer ( in both Windows and the BIOS ) as Hitachi / Fujitsu ( depending on the hddss.bin file used ) and there 's no way ( yet ) to flash the firmware of a non-WD drive with hddhackr . Other ways of modifying the firmware are n't really known to us mortals , as it implies modifying data in " negative " logical sectors . <p> The xbox must be rejecting the drive when it sees it as Seagate at boot time . Too bad , would 've been great to use non-wd drives laying around . <p> Thank you very muchfor showingthe possible.Just did the samewith Hitachi HTS542580K9SA00 . But there is a significant difference , yesterday accidentally flashed a drive hdddhackr on big brother WD . He even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was Hitachi . hmmm .... <p> Thank you very muchfor showingthe possible.Just did the samewith Hitachi HTS542580K9SA00 . But there is a significant difference , yesterday accidentally flashed a drive hdddhackr on big brother WD . He even changed its name to the BIOS Fujitsu , and here also was Hitachi . hmmm .... <p> I can confirm that this method worked on my Hitachi 0J11562 640GB , thanks Harcroft ! <p> Actually it works in hddhacker as well , I verified both methods . When hddhacker says that it can only operate with WD drives , it asks you if you want to retry flashing . It then says that to resend the flash command , power your drive off/on after hitting enter . It sends a successful flash , all you have to do is restart hddhacker and enter the create partitions command . On a side note , I did n't send the undo.bin command so I 'm not sure whether it works from hddhacker or not . But it does work using Harcroft 's method ! <p> if you do n't have a undo.bin you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx264320 <p> You mean in case I ever want to use the HDD in a PC ?

@@21399081 @1399081/ <p> How to copy files to and from an Xbox One USB Formatted hard drive using a Windows PC ? <p> Background : <p> USB drives configured for the Xbox One use the same NTFS file system your Windows based PC uses , however you need to change the MBR ( Master Boot Record ) on the USB drive to enable a Windows PC to read the drive once it has been configured for use in your Xbox One console . Once you have copied files to / from the drive you then need to change the MBR back so the Xbox One can read the drive again . <p> Thankfully this is easy enough to do with an app called Xbox One External Storage Device Converter , this tutorial will show you how to do this . <p> To start with we will presume you already have an Xbox One formatted USB drive with some content installed on it you wish to access on your PC . <p> Take note here , if you have multiple hard drive inside your PC remember which one is in Xbox mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xbox mode . As you can see in the screenshot below PhysicalDrive3 is in Xbox Mode <p> Right click on the drive in Xbox Mode and select " Enable PC Mode " <p> After enabling PC mode select File &gt; Scan and the Xbox One usb formatted drive should now be in PC mode <p> Safely remove this drive as you would any other USB drive connected to your computer , then disconnect the usb drive from your computer <p> Now reconnect the USB drive , and go to My Computer / This PC ( depending on your version of Windows ) , you will see Windows has now mounted the hard drive your Xbox One console formatted . The Xbox One formats the drives as NTFS . <p> You can now copy content to and from the hard drive just as you would any other internal hard drive <p> More importantly you can extract Xbox One apps and games , like we could do on the Xbox 360 . Below i have copied the Project Spark Beta and my installed Trials Fusion game to the Xbox One formatted USB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my PC . <p> As you can see i can copy files to and from the usb drive with no problems at all . <p> Remember before putting the drive back in your Xbox One to run the Xbox One External Device Converter app again and put the drive back in Xbox One mode , if you do n't  do this the Xbox will want to format the drive again and you will loose any content stored on it . <p> Thanks to Angerwound for this great little app , hopefully this is the start of Xbox One content sharing <p> Note : This does not enable piracy on the Xbox One , you can simply share content as you can with the Xbox 360 , you still require a licence or disc on the console to play any content with DRM . <p> Very cool ! Thanks for putting together the tutorial . Quick question . The other drive listed there ? Is that also an XBOX One external drive ? My code should filter out PC drives . Just want to make sure that 's working . <p> Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers for the app ! I 'm very interested in seeing if content such as Demos ( which i can only guess have no DRM as per the 360 ) can be shared with others . <p> The other drive is an internal drive , i have two so i 'm not totally sure which drive it is . <p> Disk 0 ( GPT ) is a 1TB drive just used for storing data Disk 1 ( MBR ) is a 256gb SSD partitioned for Windows 8 and OSX <p> Hopefully that 's of some help to you , if you need me to provide any more info let me know . <p> Never expected the creator of the app to register here , cheers for the app !

@@21399082 @1399082/ <h> Plex Guide - Restricting content in Plex from different local and remote users <p> Plex is a great way to index and provide libraries of content to all the screens and devices in your home , but sometimes for various reasons you may wish to restrict the content different users can view . Say for example if you have young children in your home and you want them to be able to watch movies but wish to restrict violent or adult movies from them or if you want to download TV Shows specifically for one user temporally but do n't wish for whatever reason to share with everyone else in your home or via the internet . <p> One would have hoped Plex made this easy to do , as it has all the movie / tv information and could easily lock out content based on say Age Restriction , however the feature is n't just there yet . However you can take advantage of MyPlex sharing ( even on your home network with this guide ) to achieve a similar result and lock out different users from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step by step guide on how to achieve this : <p> Step 1 : Signing up for MyPlex <p> Ok , first thing 's first fire up your web browser and navigate to the MyPlex site and create some accounts for you and everyone who will need access to your library . This can be done at : https : **29;1416;TOOLONG <p> When making accounts , if you only intend to use them on your home devices and not fussed about making proper accounts with details ( or if say your making accounts for your children who do n't have email addresses ) you can easily just temporary email addresses or the + trick on Gmail ( ie : myemail+plex1@gmail.com , myemail+plex2@gmail.com ) and make some accounts for family usage . <p> If this is the first time you have made a myplex account , your need to login with the primary account on your actual plex server to assign it as the owner ' . To achieve this , login to your Plex Server via the web interface and in the Settings &gt; MyPlex ' sign in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one that owns the server , so think of it like a Master / Admin account . You do n't need to do this for any of additional accounts you created for family / friends as they will be users , and not owners of the server . <p> Step 2 : Locking down your local access and requiring MyPlex logins <p> Browse to your Plex/Web interface on your local network and click on Settings ' , browse to MyPlex and select the Show Advanced Settings . You will then see the option below Require authentication on local networks ' . Tick this and save your settings . <p> What this does , is stop local users using being able login to your Plex Library without an account . By default Plex will let any local network user in with master access meaning any of the restrictions you make later on will not take affect for users on your local network . <p> Step 3 : Reorganizing your library <p> Ok , so you got accounts and locked down your server . Now you will need to reorganize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to assume you have two libraries ( but you could have more ) , one for Movies and one for TV Shows . In this example I 'm going to show you how to organize Movies , but you can easily repeat this process for TV Shows , Music and other libraries you have . <p> First of all , we need to organize the file structure . So let 's assume you have C : /Movies at the moment , first thing your need to do is make some new folders within that , like All ' , Kids ' , Family ' etc like below <p> Next , you need to move all your content into the relevant folders , which will be locked down . So say you have a Family folder you put all the content in there which you want to share with the Family , then another folder say with your name where your push content you do n't wish to share . The reason for this is that we will make separate libraries for each folder and selectively share them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will need to go back to your Plex Interface and delete your current libraries you have like so : <p> Then you can re-add them one by one by first clicking Add Library and selecting its content : <p> Then selecting the new folder ( with name ) it 's located in by clicking Add Folder ' : <p> Last but not least , give it a nice name . As your making multiple Movie Libraries , I 'd recommend giving them a name like Family " Movies ' or Kids " Movies ' etc . <p> Once done , click Save and the library will begin indexing just the folder you made . <p> Now repeat this process for each folder you made for different access levels , and again for TV Shows and any other library types you have . At the end , you should end up with something similar to the below : <p> You are almost done at this stage , though Plex may take a while to re-index everything based on the size of your library , so could be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific libraries with users <p> So at the moment you have accounts for all your users , and you have specific libraries setup , now it 's time to share those libraries with users . To achieve this you have to go onto the MyPlex website ( not your Plex Server ) and sign in with the master account ( the one your Plex Server is logged in as ) and click on the Server 's tab . <p> Once on there , click on the Shared with x ' other people like above . On the page that loads , look at the bottom where it has Share with server and enter one of your usernames for a user you wish to give access to and then untick the Share all sections ' and select the specific sections you wish this user to have access to like so : <p> Once done , click Share and they will receive an email with a link to click to accept the invitation . Repeat this process with all the users you wish to give access to and set the relevant permissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master account ) have a Premium PlexPass , by doing this you separate out the watched/unwatched per user , meaning no longer will family members mess up your watched status on Movies or TV shows . However if you do n't have premium , this will still be shared amongst all users . <p> Step 5 : Finishing Up <p> Good , you are mostly done now ! Just a few things left to do . One of the first steps required you to lock out un-logged in users on your local network so for every device ( be it a Samsung Smart TV with Plex , an iPad or PC running the Plex app ) you will need to click login and sign into a MyPlex Account . Until you do this , it will not be able to access your library . So for the Kid 's iPad , log it into there account which only has access to Kid-safe Movies etc . <p> For your own devices , log in with the Master account and you will have access to every library . <p> That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission based Plex library ! 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21399084 @1399084/ <h> How to buy an additional Xbox One Power Supply from Xbox Support <p> You might be wondering why would you want to purchase an additional power supply for your Xbox One ? <p> Well if your Xbox One setup is anything like mine its all wired in a unit , up against a wall ( or even attached to a wall in some way ) which is pretty difficult to disconnect anything from which you have connected up over the years . <p> ? <p> So basically i wanted an additional PSU so i could easily move my Xbox One and use it in another room of the house if i desire , or even take it to a friends to have an Xbox Lan . You would think obtaining an additional PSU would be easy enough right ? well you could n't be more wrong . Microsoft do not sell them as an accessory , or will not even let you purchase one on the Xbox Support webpage . <p> Granted if you PSU breaks you can sent it back to Microsoft and get a free replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out right want another they wo n't let you have one ( even if you offer to purchase it ) That leaves random no brand 3rd party power supply 's for the Xbox One which i did n't really want to trust . I guess my experience in building PC 's over the last 15 years has taught me to never purchase a chap PSU . <p> So how can you actually purchase another Xbox One PSU ? <p> The answer is simple , Lie . <p> As bad as that sounds if you call up Xbox Support and tell them a little white lie , basically saying that you have lost your PSU they will offer to sell you another one for around -25 . Even then they will still keep asking you if its broken and you can send it back for a replacement . I honestly can not see why they appear to be against someone having two PSU 's for their Xbox One ? <p> Once you have gone through the process of explaining you have lost your PSU and the person on the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support person will take your card details over the phone and put an order in to have a new PSU shipped to you . <p> Note : You will need to have your Xbox One registered on the Xbox website and provided your Windows Live I 'd before they can process anything for you , they will ask you to confirm the address on your Windows Live I 'd is correct . <p> All been well you will get an email confirming the order and another to let you know it has been shipped : <p> ? <p> I was told it could take up to 28 working days to get my new PSU , however it arrived in the post a couple of days later : <p> ? <p> I really do n't think it should be so hard to get an additional PSU , i certainly should n't need to make an excuse up to be able to purchase one . Surly its better than people purchasing random ones one Ebay which have likely not been tested to any safety standards ? <p> Who knows , however that 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xbox One anyway . Now i can take it to Xbox Lans or use it else where with ease . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21399085 @1399085/ <p> One of the great perks of being a student ( besides the lifestyle ) was that you could get random discounts in most retail shops , as well as good discount on various online stores Including the Apple store and even get Spotify Premium for half price a month ( -4.99 instead of -9.99 ) . However to get most of this , you needed an NUS card which you had to purchase , and had to be renewed every year where it validated your student status with your University . <p> Well I only just noticed there is a new company on the block competing with NUS called Unidays . Unlike NUS , Unidays is free to sign up and offers the discount either via online stores via their website , or via an iOS/Android application which shows your discount eligibility and can be used in retail stores . It has all the big brands , including all the usual Fashion retailers that some students love , but more importantly for us techie people it has the all-important Spotify and Apple store discounts . <p> However more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple means , email address . Most Universities ( and some colleges ) offer their previous students email for life as part of their Alumni service . See the connection here , you can use your lifetime student email address given by your university and sign up for Unidays and get access to all these student discounts again even though you finished University years ago ! <p> Let 's do this <p> Step 1 : Get back into your Student Webmail <p> Figure out if you can login to your student email address . For me it was a case of Googling University Name Webmail ' and logging in . If you do n't know your password , it 's worth googling your University Alumi webpage and confirming if they offer email for life . If they do ( or even if they do n't ) contact the Alumi office over email and ask if you can get access to your email account . No harm in asking and it 's worth it down the line . <p> Sign up for a free account using your University email and verifiy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once done , you should be verified : <p> Step 3 : Enjoy the discount <p> Get back to enjoying student discount both in-store and online ! <p> For online , I 'd recommend taking a look at the discounts for half price Spotify , 15% off Apple Products and 10% off Firebox , The Hut , Myprotein and more . <p> For instore , you need to download the Application for iOS or Android and it will act like an NUS card and give you up to 20% savings in many designer clothes stores . <p> Misc : <p> Every year you need to re-verify your status like NUS . However all you need again is your email address so as far as I can see you can keep doing this every year for a long long time until they notice . <p> Be aware that Unidays is still relatively new , you will find the odd shops that may require an NUS card and not accept Unidays . In time this will likely get better as big brands like Apple now accept Unidays . Also be aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student verification process and require more than an email . Who knows what the future holds . <p> Looking for more ?

Kitkat update : <p> That 's it , you have a unlocked , de-branded Moto G that will get OTA updates as soon as Motorola release them . <p> I think the Moto G is a pretty awesome mid-range phone sold at an entry level smart phone price .

@@21399087 @1399087/ <p> Using external hard drives on the Xbox 360 is a very recent thing compared to hacking hard drives , Microsoft released the 17349 update on April 30 2015 , which allows up to 2TB hard drives connected to a USB port to be configured for Xbox 360 storage . So your on exactly the version you need to be . This is essentially like what was possible with 16gb USB thumb drives , just with a much higher limit . <p> Does this process affect a flashed/modded DVD drive ? More specifically , does this revert the dashboard to an earlier version in which case one would need to update the dashboard ( restoring stock firmware ) to play online again ? <p> And lastly , one could move all content/profiles/etc from the old hard drive to a USB flash drive temporarily then all that would need to be done is backup Partition 2 to enable Xbox 1 games ? This would cover all backing up/restoring correct ? Or are there certain items incapable of being moved to a USB flash drive ? <p> Hope this makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these questions ! <p> I created a bootable USB-Stick with Bootable USB Drive Creator Tool ( where I selected the MS-DOS folder as the location ) .

Usually not changing from AHCI to IDE is the cause of most problems . <p> Also just so your aware the Xbox 360 supports up to 2TB external hard drives for installed games / save these days , so hacking a hard drive is not as essential as it once was depending on what you desire . <p> Maybe I 'll buy another WD5000LPLX and get it 's UNDO.BIN using Hddhackr .

If you want to get into the technicalities that 's really cool but please also explain in simple terms as well so hopefully everyone can learn something . This whole Wii U getting the boot from Nintendo is pretty fascinating if you ask me . <p> The Wii U can play some NDS games via emulation , their is a 3DS emulator for the PC called Citra . It 's possible someone might be able to port that to the Wii U. However the Wii U will probably never be powerful enough to emulate the 3DS at any playable speed . <p> The Wii U can play some NDS games via emulation , their is a 3DS emulator for the PC called Citra .

I like your use of the word probably though . Thanks for this . If we can get it on a pc that leads me to the question if there is anyway to get a pc screen on a Wii U so someone could play 3DS on their pc from their Wii U .. There has got to be more use for this thing it 's like 3x the size of a psp lol <p> High end phones today are more powerful than the Wii U , have more ram than the Wii U and better graphics capabilities than the Wii U. <p> It 's like comparing Apples to Oranges though , by that i mean the architecture is so different you ca n't directly compare a phone to a Wii U. Phones got a lot more powerful which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end devices . <p> The problem you have with the Wii U is that it 's a closed platform with a very small homebrew scene at present . Even hacking the Nintendo DS emulators to play different roms on the Wii U is far from perfect , with many games not working . <p> If the Wii U homebrew scene takes off i 'm sure we could see some interesting uses for the Wii U tablet controller , however sadly the interest on the Wii U seems to be more in easier access to piracy , rather than homebrew development . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

If you have a working backup of your 3DS 's nand you are able to restore this if you are unfortunate enough to brick your 3DS . If you do n't have a nand backup then you are out of luck , you ca n't use a backup from someone else 's console ! <p> You have convinced me it would be a good idea to dump / backup my 3DS 's nand , how can i do this ? <p> Backing up ( dumping ) the system nand on an Nintendo 3DS , 3DS XL , 2DS and New 3DS . <p> To backup your systemnand we are going to use the Gateway Flashcard launcher for this , however do n't worry you do not need to actually have purchased a Gateway flashcard to make use of this feature .

To start ensure you have set up the 3DS to connect to your wireless network , as you will need an internet connection to launch the exploit that will let you dump your nand . <p> 4 .

To make things quicker and easier i personally find editing an existing bookmark is the easiest way to trigger the exploit , to do this press menu : <p> 7 . Then click the bookmarks icon : <p> 8 . Now edit one of the existing bookmarks by clicking the spanner icon next to it , it does n't really matter which one : <p> 9 .

Well my excursions landed me at this website and I found the content , problem is I have n't yet graduated kindergarten apparently in terms of transfering this content from my PC to my XBOX . Tried searching the forums for answers and explainations but after reading some of the postings , I am now left with grey goo seeping out of my ears into a puddle on the floor and a hollow in my head where my brain used to be . Can anyone explain to me how to do this as if I were a 5 year old little girl wondering where babies come from ? <p> You know , I appreciate it , but it seems I 'm too retarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to wreck my 360 in anyway . I guess I 'll just have to wait till someone comes up with a zip drive version my console can recognize and update that way ... if ever . Thanks for the help though . <p> Basically you have two soft mods , one which involves hotswapping the Xbox hard drive with a PC , for that you do have to open the Xbox The other is using a save game exploit , this would be the easiest as you just need to get the modded save game on to a memory card , either by a friend copying it on for you who has a modded Xbox or using an action replay . Then you copy the save to the console and load the hacked save game , you then basically follow the on screen instructions and your console will be soft modded . <p> Buying one of the exploitable games is a very easy way of softmodding , depending where you are from if your willing to send me a memory card and pay for it posting back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to it . That would save you buying a hard to find action reply and a fair bit of money I would think . All you would need to do then is buy a cheap copy of James Bond , or the game you wish to use for the hack. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399107 @1399107/ <p> This guide will take you through how to setup a IPv6 Tunnel with Tunnelbroker.net ( but can also work with other suppliers if desired ) on an Apple Router ( either a Airport Express , Time Capsule or Airport Extreme ) . The benefit of IPv6 is great not only for gaming on Xbox One which supports IPv6 to remove NAT issues , but also for accessing the next generation of network services out of the box in a native configuration ( think , no more port forwarding , no more networking issues caused by poorly built routers ) . Of course , if your ISP was decent in the first place you would n't need a tunnel and would have native IPv6 from them , but this is the next best method which will provide each of your devices with a unique , public IPv6 address while not affecting your current IPv4 setup . I 'll also detail how to put up a Firewall on the router for IPv6 as well as setting up Google 's Public DNS on IPv6 . Let 's begin ! Step 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup an account for you use by clicking Register on the Top left . You are required to give them an account name , email and your address to get them setup , but this is understandable as they are acting like a second ISP for you ( for your IPv6 traffic ! ) . Once your account is made , select Create Regular Tunnel ' on the left hand side ( not the BGP option ) . On the Create new tunnel page you will be presented with the below options : <p> ? <p> Setting up a new Tunnel on Tunnelbroker.net ? <p> You will need to fill in your current IPv4 Endpoint . This is your current IP address ( v4 ) . It will likely be displaying it for you already underneath in the You are viewing from ' however if you are using a web proxy or your ISP provides one for you it may not be your real IPv4 address . In which case , try googling What is my IP ' or look on your router 's settings page to gain this address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick an endpoint . It may suggest one already based on your location but you are welcome to pick any of your choosing . One nice thing to note at this stage , if you pick say a North America location and are based in say Europe , you can use Netflix ( which is IPv6 enabled ) and use it to trick the site into thinking your in America . However picking a server far away from your actual location will slow down your network traffic as any IPv6 traffic will go via their server adding an extra hop in your internet packets . Pick wisely on this ! Once done , click Create tunnel and you are set ! Step 2 : Setting up your Tunnel on your Apple Router Ok , keep the Tunnelbroker site open on your newly created tunnel ( click into it to display it 's settings if it has n't already opened up ) and also open up Airport Utility to edit your Router 's setting . On Airport Utility browse to the Internet Tab and select Internet Options ' at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy the settings from Tunnelbroker to your Airport / Time Capsule device : <p> Mapping TunnelBroker.net Settings to your Apple Router 's Settings ? <p> You will notice that when copying the Server IPv6 Address , Client IPv6 Address and Router /64 that for three of the entries you will need to remove the /64 however keep it for the IPv6 Delegated Prefix . It 's quite a maze to figure out , and took me quite a few tries to get it spot on , so I hope the picture above makes it really easy . Once done , click Save ' and move onto the next step . Step 3 : Setting up IPv6 DNS Great , so now you have a tunnel setup ( but not active yet until you save settings ) . Now it 's time to setup a DNS server which can be connected to over IPv6 . This is important , as without it its unlikely your ever use your IPv6 addresses connecting to websites . For this guide , I used Googles Public DNS servers however you can easily use OpenDNS 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So back on the Internet tab , you will likely see two DNS servers already entered , these are provided by your ISP , you can leave them how they are if you wish , or replace them with Google 's IPv4 DNS servers which are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 . <p> ? <p> ? <p> Setting up IPv6 DNS Entries ? <p> Next up , it 's time to put in two IPv6 DNS server 's , Google 's ones are : 2001:4860:4860 : : 8888 and 2001:4860:4860 : : 8844 Good Job , DNS is setup . One more optional step to go . Step 4 : Optional " Blocking incoming IPv6 connections IPv6 is great , however unless each device in your home network is protected with a firewall and has no open services ( like network shares , SSH servers with weak passwords etc ) you could find by enabling the tunnel you have opened every device to dangers the internet . This is because where before you had one internet address and that was your routers , now every PC is able to do two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , removing its protective barrier . Now you could use this time to sort out each device and make sure it 's safe , however there is a quick way to lock down your IPv6 inbound traffic ( without affecting outbound ) until you are comfortable with each devices setup . On your router 's settings , click on the Network Tab and select Network Options ' at the bottom . You will be presented with the below : <p> Block Incoming IPv6 Connections ? <p> Just tick the Block Incoming IPv6 connections ' . This will put a firewall up on your Router and ensure inbound connections only match outbound and stop people port scanning / connecting directly to your devices uninvited . <p> Finishing Up : <p> Once your happy with all your settings , Click Update ' and all the above steps will be saved to your Apple Router and the device will reboot . All going well , it will come back with a green status light which means the IPv6 tunnel is setup . I 'd recommend refreshing your network connections on your devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given an IPv6 address . You can test connectivity by visiting Test your IPv6 . If it comes back with a yellow light , click it and see what the error message is . Perhaps you entered some details wrong ? Double check and retry . If your still having problems just reply in the comments and hopefully we can get you sorted in no time ! Hope my guide has helped , and welcome to the IPv6 world . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399110 @1399110/ <p> The PS4 has been hacked very early in to the consoles life cycle , thanks to webkit vulnerabilities and FreeBSD exploits . The PS4 's web browser is powered by webkit and the PS4 operating system is based on FreeBSD . <p> Currently you need a PS4 on firmware 1.76 , which was released on the 2nd September 2014 , you can update to 1.76 , however you ca n't downgrade to it . As this firmware was released almost two years ago , chances are the majority of people out there have upgraded well past firmware 1.76 . If you have then you ca n't currently take advantage of the hacks in these tutorials . <p> However , for those who have n't I will teach you how to get started with PS4 hacking and show you a few neat things you can do . <p> Upgrading to 1.76 : <p> First if you have n't already upgraded to 1.76 you can do so offline by downloading the PlayStation 4 System Recovery 1.76 and upgrading from a USB memory stick . <p> Before connecting your PS4 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this will stop the PS4 from downloading the latest system update from the PSN which it will do automatically . <p> The good news is that the PS4 will not automatically install updates unless you have set it to do so when sleeping in the system settings . Even if the PS4 has downloaded an update , once PSN access is blocked it will not nag you about installing an update . <p> On the PS4 you ca n't use the web browser without been signed in to the PSN , however you ca n't sign in to the PSN without updating your PS4 . The good new is when you go to Settings &gt; User Manual this is actually a webpage loaded with the PS4 web browser , giving us a way to load web pages on the PS4 and then exploit the PS4 without been signed in to the PSN . <p> This is where it can get a bit tricky , the easiest way to accomplish this is with a DNS Host Override on your Home Router . However if your home router is not capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosted by a 3rd party . <p> So if you have got this fair you should have prepared your PS4 / Home network to allow your PS4 to easily load the PS4 Playground . Now we can get to the interesting stuff . The first thing I would do from here is learn how to enable the PS4 Debug Settings , which I have created a tutorial for : Enable the PS4 Debug Setting on PS4 Firmware 1.76 Enable Blu-Ray Playback On The PS4 , Without The PSN : <p> Now you have Debug Menu access on your PS4 you can also install PKG files from a USB Memory stick , as it stands at the moment it 's not possible to install unsigned PKG files , only signed ones such as the PT Silent Hills PS4 Demo . However once unsigned PKG files can be installed this could open up some great possibilities , so i 'd still say its a handy thing to learn . <p> Finally the most interesting thing you can currently do on the PS4 is load a full Linux distribution from a USB hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PS4 Linux 0.1.1 by D-ecks . This is essentially Fedora 23 Linux with kernel patches from Fail0verflow and 3d acceleration / Steam support from OsirisX .

@@21399119 @1399119/ <p> This is the ultimate all in one guide to purchasing and bypassing regional lockout 's , as well as getting around delayed worldwide releases across Xbox One , Xbox 360 , Steam , Origin , and Playstation 3/4 online stores . <p> We live in an interconnected world , where physical country borders do n't exist in the world of the modern day internet . Yet sadly , online gaming stores and game publishers have n't caught up , creating a really unbalanced and sometimes even unfair way of gamers being able to legitimately purchase games . We have situations where some regions get games at half the price of others , or where backwards publishers feel Australians or Europeans need to wait an extra few days , even weeks if not months to get access to the same games that people in North America are playing already . <p> While this practice worked in the 1990 's , it does n't work anymore . People do n't care what country other games are from , people regularly play together from across the world and engage in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and seeing half their friends are playing a game like Titanfall a whole 4 days before they can , for half the price is quite frankly , degrading and unfair . <p> Some companies like Microsoft , Bungie and Activision are increasingly starting to release games to the worldwide fan base all at the same time ( Examples being Call of Duty , Halo , Gears of War , the Xbox One , all releasing on the same day in all major markets ) . However , some companies like Sony , or Electronic Arts are run by idiots who have n't managed to adapt to this global connected world . <p> EA for example releases all their games like so:Tuesday " US / Canada ReleaseThursday " European release ( excluding UK , Ireland and Portugal ) , Australia and New ZealandFriday " UK , Ireland , Portugal and any other region 's missing . <p> They say it 's to maximize sales , but for example the UK , US and Australia all share the same language and regularly play in the same gaming clans or talk/discuss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world speaks English . For people to suddenly see their peers , their friends playing games at different days and finding themselves denied is such a bad practice and makes resentment across gamers . <p> Even worse , some counties like Germany ban the release of games which contain violence , or anything that mentions their history in the war . Which means unless users purchase games from another region , they will be denied access to some great video games . <p> Also another point , sometimes prices between regions just seems ridiculous . Some Australian users were being asked to pay $100 for the same game their American friends can pick up for only $60 . Likewise with the UK being asked to spend $90 per game . A lot of it comes down to currency exchange rates and the cost of living in each country , but sometimes it 's just publishers trying to milk other countries , charging the maximum they can get away with . <p> Thankfully , there are ways to break down this virtual borders that Publishers/Stores have placed up , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down with both the Xbox One , Xbox 360 , both Playstation 's ( 3/4 ) and also the two leading PC Stores ( Steam and Origin ) . For each guide , I will cover how to first purchase games in the US based stores , and then secondly how to break the release date for games which do not have a same-day international release . <p> Xbox OneRequirements to Purchase Games at US prices : NoneRequirements to Unlock Games based on US launch date : None <p> Xbox One is hands down the most global friendly console and online store for purchasing games . Purchasing from the US store is as simple as changing a setting on your console , adding a payment method ( which can be PayPal account from anywhere in the world , using pre-paid US Xbox Cards which can be purchased easily on the internet or even a credit card using a fake US billing address ) . <p> Once you have purchased a game from the US Store , the game will unlock regardless of if it 's not available in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use any Geo-location blocking practices on the Xbox One . If later down the line this changes , you can use the VPN guide which is below for the Xbox 360 method . <p> Please also note , the Xbox One does NOT region encode any games , and the PAL/NTSC standard does n't exist in the 720p/1080p world so you will have no problem purchasing games from any region . However for Movies and Music , this is another story as content publishers insist on regional lock-outs . <p> Xbox 360Requirements to Purchase Games at US prices : Secondary account setup with US detailsRequirements to Unlock Games based on US launch date : Secondary account setup with US details , VPN <p> Unlike the Xbox One , the Xbox 360 is a little trickier to break the region locks on . The first and biggest problem is this console has regional locking which is used in a lot of games ( not all however ) . But this does mean you need to do a little research into the game in question to make sure it will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up owning multiple consoles from different regions just to be able to play all the games out there . <p> To purchase games from another region , you have to setup a new Xbox Live account and set the location and billing address to the relevant country . Once this is done , you also need to buy some pre-paid Xbox Live cards for that region in question . Please note , old Microsoft Points cards are usually region locked , as are real currency cards which came out in 2013 . <p> Even once you have gone through all this to get access to purchase games from a different marketplace region , you still need to go ahead and sign up for a VPN service as the download server 's on Xbox 360 Marketplace do check IP 's and will block you downloading from a different country . <p> The one good side to Xbox 360 purchases though , is once the game is purchased on your console every gamertag / users of that console can play it . Therefore purchasing on a secondary account wo n't stop you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> SteamRequirements to Purchase Games at US prices : Friend based in the US , PayPalRequirements to Unlock Games based on US launch date : VPN <p> It 's important to stress with Steam that purchasing a game from the US Store and unlocking a game based on the US launch date are NOT connected . You can purchase games from your local region 's Steam store then just skip to the second part of this guide on how to unlock it based on the US launch . <p> The easiest way to purchase games at the US prices on Steam is to just take advantage of a friend or family member who lives in the United States . Steam supports ' gifting ' of purchases , and does not region lock this allowing someone in the US to purchase a game at their US price and then gift it to your Steam account which could be based in Europe , Australia or even the Middle east . To make it even better , Steam let 's people use PayPal to purchase so it 's just a case of sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to your US based contact who can then just use that balance to pay for the game straight in Steam ( and even refund you any leftover ) . If you do n't have any US friends , there 's plenty of friendly US based Digiex members who will happily help , or ask on your preferred gaming forum . <p> However please take note of the tax comment I made early , while in Europe for example it 's standard for the price of a product in a store to already contain tax , America is a bit weird in that it adds tax only at purchase so a game for $60 could become $68 depending on if your US contact is based in a state that charges VAT/Sales Tax ) . Make sure you factor that in deciding if it 's cheaper to pick up in the US or in your own local region . <p> Now to unlock a game early , based on the US launch date does require the use of the VPN , and I must stress that Steam 's Terms of Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of writing , people have done this trick for years and no one has been banned yet , but ultimately there is a risk and you have been warned . <p> You can get a 2 hour free trial of FlyVPN at the following url : Free Trial VPN Service - Free VPN account and passwordFlyVPNOnce setup , select a US based server and then load up Steam . If the game is released in the US ( regardless of if your account is say European and you bought it on the European store ) it will unlock for you . You do n't have to use FlyVPN , you can use any VPN providers out there that will allow you to use a US based region . <p> It 's important to note , that once you disconnect from the VPN and reconnect Steam from your non-American IP address the game will in most cases RE-LOCK ! The best way to handle this , is once you have the game unlocked , set Steam into Offline Mode and then disconnect the VPN . You can then play offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is one down-side however , by putting Steam into offline mode if the game uses Steamwork 's for multiplayer you will not be able to play online . However if it uses its own online system or a third-parties then there is nothing stopping you from playing online.One final note , I would n't recommend disconnecting from the VPN and re-connecting to Steam off the VPN for at least 12 hours otherwise it will look really suspicious . It 's physically impossible to be say in the US then 5 minutes later be in Europe . If Valve ever investigated your account usage , it will be obvious you used a VPN and that you were n't legitimately in the US at the time of unlock . Be sensible with usage . However like I said early , people have used this trick for many years and Valve to date have n't banned a single person from doing this , or tried to block this loop-hole so they are likely turning a blind eye ( as you have paid after all ) . <p> Just be aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the game is not yet out in your region you will likely be connecting to US based servers which will introduce a bit of unexpected latency . <p> OriginRequirements to Purchase Games at US prices : VPNRequirements to Unlock Games based on US launch date : VPN <p> It 's important to stress with Origin that purchasing a game from the US Store and unlocking a game based on the US launch date are NOT connected . You can purchase games from your local region 's Origin store then just skip to the second part of this guide on how to unlock it based on the US launch . <p> Origin is one of the most challenging one 's , it least for purchasing games . As a game license is tied to an individual user and not sharing amongst all users of your PC , you will not be able to just make a secondary account and then play on your primary ( unless this does n't matter to you ) . Also unlike Steam , gifting across regions does n't exist . <p> But if you wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only would your EA account details need to be registered with a US billing address , but you would also need to use a VPN as well as the store 's use Location blocking tactics . As such , there 's not many people doing this as it 's a lot of haste to save a few bucks ( remember , PC games are a lot cheaper than console games anyways ) but it is possible if your persistent , setup an account with US details and used a US VPN to purchase . <p> Now to unlock a game early , based on the US launch date does require the use of the VPN . <p> You can get a 2 hour free trial of FlyVPN at the following url : Free Trial VPN Service - Free VPN account and passwordFlyVPNOnce setup , select a US based server and then load up Origin . If the game is released in the US ( regardless of if your account is say European and you bought it on the European store ) it will unlock for you . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VPN providers out there that will allow you to use a US based region . <p> However one good side to Origin , is once a game is unlocked at the time of writing they do not have the ability to re-lock . So once you fired up your game for the first time and confirmed it 's working . You can disconnect the VPN , re-log into Origin and play as normal . <p> Just be aware , if the game has online requirements or online servers , as the game is not yet out in your region you will likely be connecting to US based servers which will introduce a bit of unexpected latency . <p> Playstation 3/4Requirements to Purchase Games at US prices : Secondary account setup with US details Requirements to Unlock Games based on US Launch date : Secondary account setup with US details <p> Playstation has always been a lot more region friendly , at least until the Xbox One came out and showed everyone how it should be done . However , it 's still relatively easy to access a different region 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to do is sign up a secondary Playstation account , but this time putting your region as United States and putting a US billing address ( either real or fake ) onto it . Once done , login to it on your console and you will be signed into the US based store . You can either add pre-paid codes which you can easily buy on the internet which you can use to purchase content , or attempt to add your credit card . It 's a bit hit or miss with regards to credit cards , as the billing address does n't match . Some readers have had no problem , while others have struggled . <p> A few other important things to note : The Playstation Store does n't use any geo-location blocking , so a VPN is not required . Games are not region locked , however saved games weirdly usually are . So if you purchase a US copy of the game , you ca n't for some reason then load it into a European copy of the game down the line . Providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Army of Two for example did ! ) , then you will have no problem playing with others in your region on Playstation multiplayer . <p> Please also note you can not switch a region on an account , even if you actually moved countries ! Therefore if your current account is say German , you would have to make a secondary account for the US Store , a third for the Japanese store etc . <p> Hope this guide helps , if anyone has any questions then please just post below and one of us will be happy to help you . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399122 @1399122/ <h> Xbox one day one , help needed to reach dash on lowest firmware without internet . <p> Hey guys , i have just gotten an xbox one which has come with the lowest base firmware . When i start it up it wants to connect to the internet which i do n't  want it to do , i 'd like to get to the dashboard on the lowest firmware i can . Can i use the USB update method with the day one patch on it and install that and achieve what i want from that ? I 'm hoping if that 's the case i can get to the dash without updating to the most recent firmware as i 'd like to keep this thing as low as possible for future exploits . <p> That is basically how the console was on launch day , I imagine you will not be able to play a lot of games and to be quest honest that dashboard is horrible . You can certainly appreciate how much the console has evolved though , or leave it on a low update in case any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply , I purchased this one to keep on a low firmware for when a kernel exploit gets released . Plugged it in and it would n't let me into the dash with out Internet so in glad someone grabbed that day one patch while it was up on micro$hafts website <p> We should have all the major updates on here , a couple of minor updates are missing where the monthly updates was released , then a smaller update a few days after . When an exploit is released the system update that is exploitable should have been archived anyway ! - Xbox One System Update Downloads . <p> I have a feeling it will be a long time until the Xbox One is hacked , however never say never . I 'm certainly looking forward to what it might bring . <p> Hehe yup , I have one on current and another that 's launch day .

I also GBA which I had a flashcard for , that had some pretty good homebrew back then . It was painfully slow writing stuff to the flashcard over a parallel port connection ! <p> It is pretty much mandatory to have two consoles a lot of the time now these days though . However i did get a Wii U last year and have managed to keep it on 5.3.2 , likewise my 3DS is on 9.2 and is running CFW now . <p> As i use my Xbox One online i 'd probably buy a second console once it 's eventually hacked . <p> I did recently buy my mum a 3DS , this came on firmware 2.1.0-4E which was released back in 2011 !

@@21399125 @1399125/ <p> When installing and setting up Apache , PHP and MySQL on my Windows Server box I have a unique problem , I did n't run my own mail server . I got sick of having to deal with spam issues as well as ensuring maximum uptime or end up losing mail . I then decided to take advantage of Google Apps , which allows you to use Google Services for your domains including the Gmail Service , which allows you to have your email handled by Google . What 's best ? You still keep the domain name , so you get all the features of Gmail , but with your own domain name and you still retain full control of users . To see an example of the log on , check out http : //mail.digiex.net . <p> One big problem with this though , how do you configure PHP so it can send mail now that you do n't run the mail service yourself ? In the PHP.ini you can configure to use SMTP to drop off mail but it does n't  offer you many options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as SMTP authentication which yet again , Gmail uses . <p> This is the best part , I found a " Unix fake sendmail " application for Windows , what this does is accepts mail in the same way Unix does , but then passes it onto another mail server and supports SSL and authentication . <p> Configuration <p> Note : If you are intending to use Gmail or Google Apps with Custom Domain , please read this for an update regarding the SSL problems . <p> This configuration will talk you through setting up the service with Gmail using a Custom Domain . If you have not yet done this , you will need to set up Google Apps for your Domain by clicking here . Once you have enabled Gmail for your domain you will need to set up an account for webmaster or whatever email address you intend to use for your PHP Mails . Once the account is created you must log into it once and enable POP3 or IMAP under Settings , this usually then enables SMTP on your Gmail so that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Gmail you will need to do some additional steps like setting up the SMTP server and port . You will need to find these out from your email provider . This does NOT work with Windows Live Domains due to the lack of SMTP.Step 1 - Download and Configure Sendmail <p> The first step is to download Fake Sendmail created by Byron Jones . I have provided a copy which already has SSL supported added in and configured to work with Gmail which can be downloaded by clicking here . <p> You will need to extract it somewhere on your Server . Its recommended you choose somewhere sensible because once set up you will need to reconfigure PHP if you change the path , so do n't bother with your Desktop . If you have locked down Apache and PHP with a seperate locked down user account , that user account with need access to read and run applications in the folder where you store Sendmail . For the purpose of this guide , I have stored it in C : inetpubsendmail <p> Once extracted , open Sendmail.ini in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to customize this configuration to your own . The lines highlighted in red must be changed and configured to your domain settings . Words highlighted in blue should ONLY be changed if you are not using Gmail for your email . <p> Code : <p> ; configuration for fake sendmail ; if this file does n't exist , sendmail.exe will look for the settings in ; the registry , under HKLMSoftwareSendmail sendmail ; you must change mail.mydomain.com to your smtp server , ; or to IIS 's " pickup " directory . ( generally C : InetpubmailrootPickup ) ; emails delivered via IIS 's pickup directory cause sendmail to ; run quicker , but you wo n't get error messages back to the calling ; application .

Its now time to move onto Step 2 . <p> Step 2 - Configuring PHP to use Sendmail <p> You will need to open your PHP configuration ( PHP.ini ) , you will then need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the line which asks for Sendmail path , you may notice it says for Unix only , but ignore this . <p> You have now configured PHP to use your sendmail which should in turn send the mail via your Gmail account ( or whatever account you configured ) . Now its time to test it ... <p> Step 3 - Test <p> You will need to now run a php script under your PHP environment which sends mail via the PHP sendmail command . In my case it was easy to test with vBulletin . <p> Once you have sent the email , check the Inbox for whichever account you sent it in a couple of minutes and the email should be there ! <p> If you received an email , congratulations you have configured your web server perfectly <p> If not , there could be a problem . To help with troubleshooting here 's a few things to check : <p> Check the error log of the PHP script and make sure it did n't  have any problems running the Sendmail command in PHP.Check the error.log in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your SMTP server to send the mailMake sure the receipt is not having email problems , try it with a few people with different mail providers incase there 's a problem there . <p> I 'm having a problem sending mail using fake sendmail , I have a windows 2003 machine with IIS and PHP , <p> If i try to send mail via command line and a script I created in php , it all works fine . <p> If i try to send mail via IIS I get this error : " Could not execute mail delivery program C : **27;1650;TOOLONG -t " <p> Thanks in advance for all your help , Jorge 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Are you sure you configured your php.ini correctly ?

@@21399132 @1399132/ <p> Unblock-us is a great service which allows any device to access media streaming services like Netflix , Hulu and iPlayer from anywhere in the world without needing to use a VPN . It 's a paid for service ( and a little expensive in my view ) but works with more devices than a VPN does ( Apple TV 's , Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 ) as well as all your traditional devices like Phones , Tablets and PCs . <p> Interested in an account ? Get one here : http : //www.unblock-us.com ( They offer a 7 day trial with no payment information needed ) <p> The service works by switching your DNS server on either your device ( via network settings ) or on your router ( to cover all devices in the house ) then when a request is made to Netflix ( or another media service ) , the DNS switches the IP to a reverse proxy which is hosted by Unblock-us which hides your real IP and makes the service think your from the desired region . You may think well a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full VPN and unblock-us is once you actually stream a video from the service , the connection is direct ( not via the reverse proxy which is only used for the logging in / browsing of content ) so your get a much faster service . In most cases with Netflix , your get full HD ( 8mbit streaming ) which is hard to acheive in peak times with most commercial VPN 's which are oversubscribed ( I know , I 've tried a few including BlackVPN and PrivateInternetAccess which at the time of writing are the two most recommended services ) . <p> Now do n't get my wrong , if you are only using it on your PC or Laptop ( or even iPhones or 2.2+ Androids ) where you can easily install and connect to a VPN , its still the better option as it hides the entire journey . Also a VPN is guranteed to work long into the future as its not tricking the service like unblock-us as there is a risk this loop hole could be blocked by updates to Netflix / iPlayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not possible to install and connect to a VPN client ( well , you can use a VPN but it involves connecting to a VPN on your computer or router if supported and then sharing it to your Xbox , but that 's not viable for most people ) . <p> Dangers of using Unblock-us 's DNS servers : <p> There is one catch with unblock-us though which makes me feel uneasy . As your changing your DNS server to theirs for the reverse-proxy to kick in on the relevent services it does mean that every website you browse will involve you connecting to their DNS to request an IP and even though they should reply with the correct IP , it does mean they effectivily know every website you ever visit . They are a private company , and they are not clear on what information they store or capture . They could easily be collecting this data and selling it , or even capturing it for later use . ( Or they could be entire honest and just want to provide you with an excellent service . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better than trusting ) . <p> Using the same method they use to connect you to Netflix US , they could easily at the flick of a button use to replace every advert with their own , or even make you think your connecting to your banks website and logging in when its actually one of their servers . They may not even do this on purpose , but if they got hacked and your using their DNS server your open up to massive abuse . Which is why deep down , I would never recommend anyone changing their DNS to anything besides either their ISP 's , Googles Public ones , or OpenDNS 's public ones . <p> Workaround to use your current DNS server : <p> However , there is a simple way you can keep using your current DNS and make the changes locally to your PC instead to use Unblock-us 's reverse proxies , without a DNS change . This involves editing your PC 's HOST File and making the changes that unblock-us do on their public DNS , to your local PC . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access Netflix US on your PC without any other settings needing to be changed . For this to work though , your Unblock-us account has to be enabled and active for your IP range ( Same as if you were using the DNS . If its not , quickly go to the Homepage and Login and it will become active until your home IP changes next ) <p> However , for this to work on my Jailbroken Apple TV , I had to do a few more HOSTS entries that just the two above . It appears dedicated devices use various API 's and other URL 's to check your IP location . I 've spent a good few hours packet sniffing a PS3 , iPad , Apple TV , Xbox and more and got all the various DNS entries they connected to . Here is the complete list your need to put into your devices HOST file to work with Unblock-us 's reverse proxies ( or router if you can ) : <p> You can do this again for any services you wish to use . To find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their DNS and do a lookup on the domains you need to access , find out the reverse-proxy IP address and then hardcode it into your hosts file and revert back to your normal DNS server . <p> Now with this simple tweak , you can take advantage of their great service , without them tracking your entire internet and with no risk . <p> I 've done this method myself just for Netflix US as that 's all I use their service for . As my Apple TV is jailbroken , I SSH'ed in and made the same change to the HOSTS file . Only devices it does n't work for however would be your games consoles or dedicated units which were n't rooted or jailbroken . Unless you had a really funky router where you could manually add DNS records and make the changes to that instead , but if you had one of those , you would properly know how to make the changes . <p> If you want to share any more IP configurations for different services on Unblock-us or have any questions , please drop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network level instead of just per-device ?

I never clicked that link as being a UK Subscriber to Netflix I 'll never have the option of renting DVD 's , however I 've done a quick lookup and found the HOST file entry for that is : <p> dvd.netflix.com 204.12.200.14 <p> As for iPlayer , Its difficult for me to test this because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one wo n't work because iPlayer will already work for me . I 'll look further into this and see if I can packet sniff all the domains that are used and come up with a host entry records for it . Another one I hope to look into is Hulu to , as I know a lot of people use this for newer shows which are n't on netflix . <p> I 've gone from using a free trial of unblock-us to being a paid user now as I love Netflix US too much to go back to the poor UK content <p> I thought I would try the DNS service but am also wondering about security . Is vnc safer since all can be tunneled with encryption ? If I only apply the dns settings to my Apple TV are there any major risks ? Could they get my iCloud login details for instance ?

If so , the encryption side of a VPN connection would n't matter as it only encrypts the connection between you and your VPN supplier . Your VPN supplier could easily spy on traffic at their end if they desired so please do n't get a VPN thinking its any safer than Unblock-Us 's method . <p> With both Unblock-Us and any VPN they could easily spy on you logging into secures ( that do n't  use HTTPS or another secure method ) , however most important stuff does . The risk is that they could change DNS entries to sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to their server instead of taking you to the real site . In reality its unlikely they ever would as it wound be found at very quickly ( very easy to compare the IP address their DNS gives out over say google 's dns ) and would effectively destroy there business model quickly as everyone would leave . <p> Not saying its impossible , just extremely unlikely . Now I 'm more the paranoid person which is why I wrote this guide so you can use Netflix on their service without changing your DNS if really desired . But using their DNS on a games console or apple tv I have no problem with , but on my PC where I do all my work , I 'd rather not take the risk . <p> Hi Nimrod , Thanks for your reply and yes I did mean VPN . I guess I am a bit paranoid when it comes to this kind of stuff . I also thought that just hooking it up to my Apple TV would be harmless but if were possible to get my iCloud credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done . I could be tracked , my email could be used to reset passwords etc . <p> Hi Nimrod , Thanks for your reply and yes I did mean VPN . I guess I am a bit paranoid when it comes to this kind of stuff .

On my Mac , I just type : nslookup netflix.com 208.122.23.22 Which says to do a look up for netflix.com on the DNS server 208.122.23.22 ( Which is Unblock-US 's DNS ) to get the IP .

Also , do you know if the list you have in the first post includes the api that the WD TV Live would use ?

Though that then defeats the point of this guide which is a solution to do only the relevant URL 's without switching your entire DNS over . <p> As for the WD TV Live , as far as Im aware that should cover it . Though please let me know if it does n't and I can do some more investigation . <p> It 's a DNS proxy that runs on Windows . In the configuration , you can set it up so that it redirects certain requests to certain DNS servers ; you can set it so *. netflix.com and *. netflix.net go to Unblock-us ' server , and everything else goes to your normal DNS server , for instance . <p> Pretty much every non-Windows OS has an available DNS server that you can set up to do the same , and apparently OS X 's DNS client can do this itself . <p> Thank you Nimrod , and other posters . I know there are a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be called in the router ? I have a dlink dir-632 with default firmware , and under the " advanced " settings , there 's an item called " routing " , which I suspect is what I 'm looking for , but the individual settings are n't all clear to me , and the dlink help for the item is not completely helpful : TABLE TR TD ( from dlink help ) <p> Destination IP : The IP address of packets that will take this route . Netmask One bits in the mask specify which bits of the IP address must match . Gateway Specifies the next hop to be taken if this route is used . A gateway of 0.0.0.0 implies there is no next hop , and the IP address matched is directly connected to the router on the interface specified : WAN . Metric The route metric is a value from 1 to 16 that indicates the cost of using this route . A value of 1 is the lowest cost , and 15 is the highest cost . A value of 16 indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to reach a particular destination , computers on your network will select the best route , ignoring unreachable routes . Interface Specifies the interface -- WAN -- that the IP packet must use to transit out of the router , when this route is used . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> /TD /TR /TABLE <p> Is this the right area to set in the router the redirection I was hoping to perform , and if so , what would I input ? Destination IP seems obvious , but others are not . <p> Like Nimrod said , there 's a good chance your router does n't support the feature . My own does n't with the default firmware . DD-WRT , Tomato , OpenWRT , and other third-party firmware does . <p> Acrylic DNS Proxy , or some other software like it , would work though . You would just set that up on your computer ( and with Acrylic , you also need to whitelist your WD TV 's IP or your entire LAN subnet ) , set your WD TV 's DNS server to your computer 's LAN IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through DHCP so all devices are affected ) , and off you go . <p> Yscmjmlw , thank you . While I appreciate your willingness to respond , repeating that there 's a chance my router does n't support a feature does n't really answer the questions .

I 'm not adverse to installing custom firmware , but it would be swell to know if I can achieve what I 'm looking for without changing firmware .

Thank you . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> No , you do n't want the routing interface . You want to control DNS , not routing ( routing controls what happens when you try to communicate with a particular IP address ; DNS controls the resolution of host names to IP addresses ) . I ca n't see any option in there for hosting a DNS server , which is what you need . Tomato firmware , for instance , includes dnsmasq , which is a lightweight DNS server that can probably accomplish what I described using Acrylic for . Most consumer routers do n't have any sort of built-in DNS server . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

It allows me to load my saves , but the gamerscore is stuck at zero and the profile is write-only . No achievements , profile preferences ca n't be saved , and every time I log in it prompts me to create an avatar , then gives " avatar could n't be saved " error . Oh , and it ca n't be transferred nor can I recreate it on another stick . Broken though it is , it seems to be a miracle fluke . <p> Hello guys . My previous xbox 20 GB had a spoofed sammy drive and therefore it was penalized as failed ap25 challenge and after couple of months it was upgraded to lt+ it became useless with e64 error . My gamer profile was 11 MB in size with 20,000+ Gamerscore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC and unflagged and rehashed with con flag remover and xbox 360 hash calculator respectively knowing the fact that each time I put that " cleaned " profile in a flagged/banned console it gets " corrupted " again . Luckily I got a xbox arcade in exchange for my phat ps3 . As I mentioned above I thought I would just have to push the profile in the memory stick and it will be fine on that new console . But it continued to show corrupted profile . I had no idea what to do as it was also cleaned with consaver ( rehashed with new console 's I 'd ) . Then I got this app- Xbox 360 Content locks ( it is found somewhere in this very forum ) . It resets the device I 'd , console I 'd to 0 . I did it and saved it . And only after that my profile showed fine on my new console . Since then no problem so far . <p> The other " corrupted " ( and now cleaned ) game saves like MC : LA run fine on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo album . I just do n't  get if the game save file ( 584 KB ) and the Photo Album ( 3.22MB ) are cleaned with same programs then why the save game showed up its ass just fine while the photo album was still detected as corrupted . I therefore ran the content locks program to reset it to 0 and then the photo album worked . <p> sorry to hear that insanenutter . You have to remove the lock , Null IDs and then resign it under the action tab . MOMENTS AGO I could not make it work my one year ol ' split/second save data ( 68 KB ) , I just removed the locks ( not even set the I 'd 's to Null/0 ) and now the game loads it fine . After using content locks the profile is now smooth fine on the console . Now my achievement is 23300 G , size is 12.64 MB . <p> Maybe you could just create a new offline profile , export the gpd 's ( achivements ) from your old profile and import them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move all the saves to this new offline profile . <p> Here i created a new profile and imported the gpd 's from your corrupt profile <p> For some reason the new profiles gamerscore / avatar does not show up after messing with it <p> However it does show up fine when signed in <p> The program is buggy though , it will only import one game at a time , might be worth looking in to if you can not fix your profile anyway . <p> I do n't  think this would be safe for xbox live as its probably obvious you have messed about with the profile , and i do n't  think the achievements stay in the correct order ( although they are loads of settings so that 's probably possible ) <p> Thanks so much InsaneNutter ! I was planning to do that as a last resort , but the reason I did n't like the idea was someday if I logged back into Live I wanted to be clean with all my achievements updated and any DLC I 'd bought , etc . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My first idea was just to build a file from scratch out of the dumped contents of the profile in Le Fluffie , which resulted in the half-working zombie profile above . <p> My second idea was to create a new profile that did n't have whatever the hell is wrong with my corrupt profile and just overwrite all of its contents with the dumped contents of the corrupt profile . <p> And I finally was able to implement the second idea successfully ! <p> I 'll lay out what I did below in case it helps anyone in the future with a bafflingly corrupt profile . <p> First , extract the contents of my corrupt profile . There is any number of programs that will do this but I used Le Fluffie . I assume Modio will do just as well . <p> Now create a new profile on my 360 . I do n't have a transfer cable so mine was on a USB stick MU . <p> Now take the MU and open it in Modio . Browse to the new profile and start renaming the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , including " Profile I 'd " in the resigner . <p> Then in the resigner , go to the File Contents tab and right click to replace FFFE07D1.gpd and Account with the corrupt profile 's . <p> Finally , I went ahead and opened Le Fluffie to change the Title I 'd ( which corresponds to " File Details " in Modio 's resigner ) just to be extra safe . <p> At this point , the profile was showing up with full gamerscore ! But I knew I was n't finished since the actual gpd files were not inside my profile . I tried Le Fluffie , Profile Editor 2.5 , and exProfile Editor that IN recommended above to import them , but they all re-corrupted my profile . <p> Finally I decided to manually add each gpd file in Modio , which only allows injecting one at a time . I went one by one and made sure I was only adding game files in case the cause of the corruption was in one of the non-game files , added all of them , and then when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to load up a game and unlock an achievement , and bam , reset to zero . <p> Sign out , sign back in , and gamerscore is back to normal . So I tried saving some profile settings , and back to zero again . Damn . <p> NOW , THIS LAST STEP WAS APPARENTLY IMPORTANT IN MY CASE . On a hunch , I deleted the gpd file for FF13 I had in my profile . I specifically Jtagged my Japanese console because stupid FF13 is n't region free , but apparently my profile did n't like the GPD that had been created . I 'll see if it happens again when I go back and play FF13 and edit this post . I did n't delete the game from my profile , just the gdp file . And after resigning and whatnot , the profile worked perfectly . <p> So anyway , once I had my profile back , I tried to edit my achievements in LA Noire , the game I had been playing while my Profile was corrupt ( not to cheat--just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the above programs would do it without corrupting me . So I just gave up and forfeited those achievements for now . But all my past achievements and save files and everything else are back after all this stupid blind poking . <p> All that said , I do n't know what will happen when or if I sign into live again , but I 'm not eager to try it out anytime soon . <p> rrosai ! ! ! I can not thank you enough for posting this info . I was having the same problem you were having , tried EVERYTHING I could find . Went on again today thinking , " What the hell , ca n't hurt to search again . " Found this , tried it , and it worked ! If you do n't mind , I may go post this on other forums ( giving you credit of course ) to help others with this problem . Thank you again ! <p> rrosai - you are the man ! ! ! ! i was having major issues with a corrupt profile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 2 ( which has been a total of 80 hours of my life ) . I used your method above with a few tweaks as the standard methods were not rectifying my corrupt data and all i can say is wow and thank you . <p> MrDudley , can you please exlain how you import your shepard to ME3 ? Brcause I tried to do so but even if I managed to uncorrupt the save file i can only use it in ME2 . However ME3 does not recognise it . I guess it s a console I 'd issue .

@@21399138 @1399138/ <h> Messed up Softmod , trying to recover <p> Hi all . I 'm sunk trying to set up the basement xbox . Unfortunately , the softmod failed and I 'm ' mostly dead ' . <p> I ran the softmod and it failed , so I used the softmod ( SID 5.1x ) to uninstall the softmod . I then re-ran the softmod to try again . That mod again failed - and now when I boot up Splinter Cell I ca n't load the exploit and start over . <p> The machine will boot games , but when the drive is open I get the following error message : <p> If I connect the xbox directly to a router and put a Windows machine on the router I can ftp on port 21 - so I think all is not lost . <p> Unfortunately , I am lost . I do n't have the technical skill to recompile xbmc , etc. but I can follow directions and copy files . I did back up the eeprom data , so it should still be available . <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix my errors ) way to set the machine back to stock so that I can re-run the exploit or is there a set of files I can download/copy to the machine to have xbmc/completed exploit up and running ? <p> Your softmod more likely uses E : Dashboard for the dash . Try tossing XBMC in there . If your shadow C is n't enabled yet , you can use the signed default.xbe from Digiex and FTP that onto the C drive to load XBMC from the folder Insane Nutter provided . See if you have an eeprom backup somewhere on the E drive . As long as you have an eeprom.bin you can fix anything wrong with a softmod . <p> So , the problem appeared to be confused softmod packages in the sense that my machine had both a e : XBMC and e : AppsXBMC directories . I copied the updated , full XBMC executables into both directories ( I 'm not skilled enough to sleuth out which was being pointed to ) and ' poof ' the machine is booting . <p> I chimped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of these on the shelf in the basement ) and nothing - until I realized that this particular Maxtor drive does n't support locking . Once I pulled another drive from the zombie pile the hard disk transplant went beautifully . <p> Removing the original drive , however , exposed the next potential problem - old , leaking capacitors . <p> Is there a cheap way to fix this ( assuming I have a friend with a soldering iron ) ? If so , will I need to remove the motherboard and completely disassemble the box ? <p> Choice two , of course , is to ignore it until it dies - it 's lasted this long and worked , it 's not going to be in use all that often . <p> 1 . Thanks for everyone 's help in getting this working for me 2 . Thanks for your thoughts on the capacitors. 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21399142 @1399142/ <p> It was earlier this year when I sold my xbox . I decided to back up my saves and my profile and avatar items etc . So copied them to my flash drive , formatted for xbox storage of course . I then inserted my flash drive into my PC , opened up USB Xtaf and I did a mistake- I clicked on backup raw drive , under backup , instead of extracting the xbox files separately . At the time I thought I was doing it right . I 've been from forum to forum and can not find a solution.So when you backup the raw drive ( your flash drive formatted for xbox storage ) , it saves the xbox contents to a directory of your choice , on your PC , in a folder titled ' xbox 360 ' . The files in this folder are called ' Data0000 ' files , with literally no file extension . It just says ' file ' under type . I would very much like to be able to open my old Skyrim save file . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injecting them into data cache on my flash drive formatted for xbox storage . But the thing is , each of these ' Data0000 ' files contain the saved games , avatar items etc , meaning they are not those separate files . I really wish I extracted them the right way . I 've tried adding . esx as a file extension but still no change . When I insert my flash drive back into my console , it never detects anything in the storage , even though there is less disk space as the files WERE copied , but they just do n't show , and neither can they be used . <p> I 've tried and tried and tried again . No luck . So basically , how can I use these Data0000 files , which contain my GAME SAVES ? ? <p> Sounds simple enough . Thanks a lot for the answer . However , restoring disk image does n't seem to work . Apparently none of my drives have 360 partitions . Also when I use one of these 2 methods , which of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I select ? In other words which one is the HDD image ? To make the picture a little clearer , the first data file is 512mb , the second is 3.14 and all the others are 1gb , even though I only backed up a few saves and avatar items , along with my profile . Can I not select the folder ? Also do I have to manually create a content folder , then a folder with 16 digits of ' 0 ' ? Or do I just format the flash drive on my console , plug it into my PC , open up Xtaf and try one of these methods ? I do need to open the flash drive in xtaf also right ? <p> I hope you can help me resolve this pal , I really appreciate an answer . Seems nobody has bothered to help so far ! <p> I found this , it seems like the only solution and sounds like it would work . <p> When you setup your flash drive , it creates a folder called " Xbox360 " and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , " Data0001 " seems to be some sort of error checking file , and your save space is split into 1GB files starting with " Data0002 " and continuing in sequence . You can copy this entire folder to your computer ( or burn a backup ) . To restore , setup a new memory stick with the same space allocated . For example , if you used all of an 8GB stick and you need to restore to a new 16GB stick , you must manually select the same size as you created on the 8GB stick . Next , use your computer to overwrite the files starting with " Data0001 " -- do NOT overwrite " Data0000 " which is a system file . Then plug the drive back into the xbox and all your data should be viewable. source : Anyway To Recover A Corrupt Xbox USB Drive ? Archive - Xbox360Achievements.org 64320 @qwx264320 <p> You might be able to skip the xbox usb creation part . If the below does n't work you may have to create the usb drive first on the xbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their normal filenames. 2 . Open your usb drive . 3 . Create a folder titled " Xbox360 " or if your files are already in that folder copy it to a usb. 4 . Open the usb drive in usb xtaf or in the xbox 360. 5 . Copy the desired gamesave to any location . 64318 @qwx264318 <p> OK I think I 'm beginning to get my stupid f*cking head around this complicated sh*t now lol . So when one configures a flash drive for xbox 360 storage , using the console of course , a folder named ' Xbox360 ' is created , containing many data files . The data files , other than the first 2 are all 1gb in space , regardless of what is stored within them , i.e avatar items and saved games . So I tried the methods . I customized my flash drive for less reserved xbox 360 storage , plugged into my PC , copied the ' Xbox360 ' folder on my PC to my flash drive using windows explorer . I merged all data files except data0000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my xbox and found out I had to re-configure the device . Not a surprise . I then tried to open these saves using Xtaf . And it seems to have WORKED ! I do n't see skyrim there at all , only black ops save . I guess it was the other xbox360 folder that contains my skyrim save . Anyway I tried it again and after the transfer I plugged the flash drive into the xbox . It did n't need to be configured . Yay I thought . But neither did it show any save files , not even black ops which I know is on the flash drive . <p> Thing is see , my primary ' xbox360 ' folder contains data files 0000-0016 . But I have n't got the flash drive I used to back up back in February . Right now I only have one flash drive with a 16gb capacity but it 's a couple of mb off from the one I used to backup .. So if I skipped transferring one of these data files to my flash drive it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't thank you enough buddy ! copied my main xbox360 backup file , containing data files up to 0016 on my configured flash drive . After it finally finished transferring ( my flash drive is basic copper technology and therefore very slow speeds ) I opened the drive in Xtaf and I opened up all the content folders , and there it was . <p> ' Save 777 - James Skyrim 257.38.45. exs ' <p> I extracted the save immediately to my desktop . <p> So now , how can I use this save on my xbox , because according to my console there is nothing on my flash drive . But Xtaf knows there is xbox data on there .. Damn technology . If I 'm correct , all I have to do now is reconfigure my flash drive , and use Xtaf to inject the skyrim save file in contents under data partition in another folder titled 0 ( x16 digits ) right ? More importantly I have skyrim save file ! ! <p> Woop woop Problem solved Rick . What I did in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configured flash drive to this way it will automatically create the necessary folders in contents , then I injected my old awesome Skyrim save to the same directory . It 's just hpw I left it <p> Thanks very much for all the help Rick , you are the only one who bothered to help out you know I very much appreciate that ! I would offer you my help if you ever need it , in return , but I doubt I could be of assistance to you as you were to me . <p> Take it easy Rick .

I got it to work and got my son 's Minecraft game saves are back ( I stupidly copied his game save data to my pc so I could use his USB , but then the Xbox would n't see the data once I put it back on the USB ) . I 've searched many blogs , and called GameStop and Xbox trying to find a solution . The directions were a little challenging , but upon rereading it several times the instructions were in fact correct ... it just took me a minute for the light to come on ! Thanks again . My son loves me again ( at least for a short while ! ) . <p> I am having a similar problem with my usb . I used by brothers usb to save my profile on so I could enjoy diablo three on his xbox with a couple of mates . However when I plugged it into his Xbox it wanted me to reconfigure the usb . It is doing the same with my xbox as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the files on my usb ( bothers ) . Just in case I might mess up I used another usb ( my own ) to do the transfer ( do n't want to mess with the original ) . So plugged in usb ( my own ) and configured it with the xbox . Then used took the data 0001 and data0002 and replaced it within the usb ( my own ) . Then inserted the usb ( my own ) into the xbox and it thankfully recognizes it and does n't  want to reconfigure it . BUT the xbox shows no files : - ( <p> I opened usb xtaf to see if I can maybe see my profile is saved under the content . But only gives me these two things E00007B28DDA9CDA Xbox360 dashboard 2.46 MB and ContentCasche.pkg Xbox dashboard 60MB . I do n't see any saved games stuff that resembles my profile . So my question is why cant my xbox see the data and what does the two things in xtaff mean . And if they are not my profile ... then where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please excuse any mistakes I have made . I am here to learn : - ) But also in desperate neeeeed of help . Profile has a lot of hours in it . <p> Sweet thank you for the response : - ) Now I know where the games saves are . But how do I get my xbox to recognize those saved games ? I have been through the whole copying over process of Data 00001 and Data 00002 files but cant seem to get any data to show on the xbox ... <p> Hey Dad , I am in the exact same situation . I know its been awhile but can you share the steps you took to save your sons game saves ? I am struggling to make sense of this . Please ! ! ! 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Ok so I thought I might elaborate on what happened and see if anyone can help me . Like a poster in this thread I hosed my kid 's ext usb drive . Had a 250gb drive that the xbox saw as a 32gd . Pre update , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now support the whole thing I wanted to reformat it . Thinking MS might be halfway smart , I assumed I could copy info of the drive on to a pc , reformat the drive on the xbox and then put the files back.Obviously I llearned that was not possible . <p> After hours of searching I found this place and saw that someone had success using this program . Unfortunately I have not been able to figure out how to make it work . <p> Can anyone help a guy out ? I have the xbox360 folder backed up on my pc , but have yet to be able to get the files back to the reformatted drive . Any help would be greatly appreciated . My son is ready to stop talking to me . <p> okay so i am from brazil and my english is not the best . i did not undestand everything on the replies you got . my USBxtaf does not work properly , i guess . after i copied all " data 000x " ( EXCEPT data 0000 ) i sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Xbox360 " ( so , in there , there are data 0001,2,3,4,5 ) . i tried to connect it to my xbox but it would n't work , and it did NOT asked to reconfiguration. it showed me some of the data has been used , but nothing was there . i connected to the computer again and tried to open the " 360 " file with the Xtaf. there was an error message and it couldnt be completed . so idk what to do now , i know my game saves are there , but its obviously unavailable for me to see it . i would really apreciate if you tell me what you did , and detailed information please because i 'm not used to technology like you guys are hahah ! 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Indeed u r a great help to xbox jtag community ... I have a couple of questions to ask ..... I have upgrade my xbox 360s ( Trinity RGH1.0x - as per xe-build &amp; previous two dumps ) twice i.e from 15457 to 16203 and second time from 16203 to 16747 ... both of the times i did it without any difficulty and at present the console is going great on 16747 ... <p> so my first question is : 1 . Do i really really need to update it 17502 . If i do n't  how many latest games i wont be able to play , and if i do what are the risks ... many ppl are saying that they have faced problems after upgrading 2 . Second and important question is reagarding the RGH nand flash part of your tutorial ...... the last two times , i have used flash 360 and nand flash 360 to write the hacked nand to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write is using xell ... Why is it so ? I am a little hesitant in flashing using Xell ... can u plz comment on these two questions <p> You only really need to upgrade if any new games you wish to play do n't work , or if theirs a new feature you wish to make use of . Most updates to the 360 now are simply Xbox Live related , so for an offline console such as a Jtag or RGH thay are really not essential unless you have a really new game which wo n't work . I think most new games work on much older system versions anyway . <p> From 17349 onwards the 360 officially supports up to 2TB external USB hard drives , meaning you can use them for installed games , save games , DLC and so on . You can use them for games with a Jtag anyway so that might not be that much of a deal to you . That 's the only thing I think you are really missing out on by staying on 16747 . <p> Some RGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why i now advise to use Xell instead . If Nand Flasher Xbox 360 has worked fine for you in the past then it should still work fine now . I 'm just trying to ensure the guide is as safe as possible for people to follow . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

I just ca n't get Vudu to work on either the computer or PS3 and ca n't get Crunchyroll to work on the PS3 . The PS3 is the primary media player in the house and would love to be able to get it working 100% . I have also tried his non-sni method . I 've also followed other people 's dns unblocking diy 's but no one seems to use a PS3 or Crunchyroll and Vudu . These are the Vudu servers I have caught from Unblock-us that are using their service <p> When I forward apicache.vudu.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menu does and no matter what I forward the Vudu PS3 app has error code 1:200 ( being they detected I 'm outside US ) . If I do n't block apicache.vudu.com I can browse the site without issues but when I try to play a movie I get " Could not connect to server . Please try logging in again " . <p> With crunchyroll I have forwarded api.crunchyroll.com and Crunchyroll - Watch Naruto Shippuden , Bleach , Anime Videos and Episodes Free Online , which is all it seems to connect to but there are DNS requests for **25;2049;TOOLONG and img1.ak.crunchyroll.com so i forwarded them as well but sill does n't get done . The PS3 just says " Unable to connect to Crunchyroll . Please check your network connection settings and relaunch the app " . The desktop works fine though . There is a request to **25;2076;TOOLONG ( or something ) but I have n't forwarded that as I do n't need to with unblock-us . <p> So , are there subdomains I 'm missing ? Is anyone here able to help me out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can post a full list of all the subdomains I use ( most from the mentioned guide ) if it will help people create their own dns-unblocking service . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399152 @1399152/ <p> All your basically doing is switching to Google 's DNS servers , so unless your ISP has horribly slow DNS servers you will likely not notice anything . It will not improve your download speeds or anything like that . <p> I 've tried this on my Blu Ray Player and it cut down the load time on streaming services such as Netflix quite considerably . Wait times use to be several minutes to load plus I had buffering issues while watching movies even with 24 gigabit service . Since changing the primary DNS to 8.8.8.8 and secondary DNS or the search domain to 8.8.4.4 Netflix movies loads up in 30 seconds or less and no more buffering issues . I also changed my home computers and wireless devices to the Google public DNS and the wait time for getting a response resolving and loading web pages are much faster . I 've worked in IT for 26 years and this little change has made a very noticeable difference . As far as I 'm concerned I give this DNS change a big thumbs up ! <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently some posters on here may not of experienced the same results I have for one reason or another . When I made the changes . The difference was very noticeable and very positive . Again . This may not help everyone and the results could vary depending on ISP networks and other variables that would cause some users not to see any difference . However , this DNS change turned out very well for me . Before making the change , my DNS was pointed at my router . I 'm using AT&amp;T Uverse and always had problems with their download speeds . Even with the faster speed they had available of 24 megabits , I still had issues with things loading . Not any more though . If the DNS 8.8.8.8 make your life better.use it . I did and I 'm very happy with the results . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399160 @1399160/ <p> Recently when my PC performs LARGE file transfers between drives or during decompression , the PC will reboot . This has been really frustrating . At first I thought it was the RAM , but Memtest shows no errors , rearranging did n't make a difference either . <p> Then I remembered , a month or so back I had an incident where the CPU fan got blocked from turning , and it took me several reboots due to overheating to realise it . <p> Now I 'm thinking that this overheating issue caused problems with the in built memory controller in the CPU , and I do n't think that there is any damage to the motherboard or the RAM . What do you think ? I 'll be purchasing a replacement CPU in the next couple of weeks to confirm this issue , but right now I just want anothers opinion . <p> I had this problem before , and it was with a VIA network adaptor , is the large files going across the network to and from another pc ? 64320 @qwx264320 <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it set up where torrents/downloads download to one specific directory , then once that 's complete I move/copy the files to their corresponding folders , mainly on different drives .

It 's bit bizarre but I can only associate it with the time that the HSF was blocked . <p> Disable automatic restart on failure if it 's on .

I rebuilt Windows about 3 weeks ago from scratch and set up all the drivers , but you never know there may be something that Windows 7 does n't like . <p> I really hope that it 's not the CPU , as I 'd rather get a new video card for my PC and a motherboard for the kids PC , then I can upgrade their video card with my old one , but if it turns out to be a CPU issue , well there goes some of my plans . <p> OK , bit of an update . I ran Ubuntu 9.10 32 bit Live CD last night , it found a stack of bad sectors on one of my hard drives , which I am currently in the process of fixing . From within Ubuntu I moved the files on that drive across to one that had plenty of free space , and NO CRASHES ! Weird . <p> Well thinking that it may be this that 's causing my issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into Windows and ran a test . Prior to testing I also disabled reboot after System Failure , but it still reboot . <p> Here 's some of my current thinking : 1 . Issue is caused by a damaged core in the CPU 2 . Windows 7 default drivers ca n't handle what I do with my PC - However Gigabyte and ATI do n't put out drivers for the chipset , they suggest running the default ones from MS 3 . Something weird with Crossfire ? ? ? - I 'm going to test this tonight . 4 . Bad SATA ports ? - Thanks , Nutter , I 'll be testing this as well fortunately I have 2 free plus the eSATA ports I can use to test . 5 . Bad motherboard , possibly damaged by the overheating issue that I think is the root cause of this whole annoying nightmare . <p> i still would n't rule out overheating , especially if you have 5 hard drives in your PC. if you have a regular house fan ( a large fan that you can plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there while transferring the files . <p> also , do n't  use the fact that the files transferred using ubuntu to rule out a hardware problem . windows vista and windows 7 have some sort of ass-backwards file transferring systems . large files that take 5-6 minutes on XP take me 15-20 min to transfer on vista/7. your power supply can also overheat ( by itself , with nothing wrong with your other hardware ) , which would be a possible cause , if in fact you 're machine is overheating . i 've had it happen several times . <p> i still would n't rule out overheating , especially if you have 5 hard drives in your PC. if you have a regular house fan ( a large fan that you can plug in ) , open your case and have it blow in there while transferring the files . <p> also , do n't  use the fact that the files transferred using ubuntu to rule out a hardware problem . windows vista and windows 7 have some sort of ass-backwards file transferring systems . large files that take 5-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vista/7. 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Overheating now is n't the issue I do n't think , I run SpeedFan on the system to keep an eye on the temps , nothing ever gets above 45c . <p> Now I can use a free " file copy " application to move data around the PC as needed , which works , the real issue comes when I need to decompress large files . <p> Actually come to think about it , this morning I was trying to " reformat " the bad drive when Windows crashed . Rebooted the system , logged back in , went and had a smoke , came back and the system had crashed again . Not sure what happened there , and checking now remotely , it looks like it 's been on since . <p> I 'm also going to run a anti-malware scan tonight and see if maybe I missed something somewhere as well . <p> Not to rule out hardware entirely . But if things worked correctly in ubuntu , it very well could be a software issue . Windows falls over itself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get random freezes and stutters , over 16k of bad sectors . I would n't be surprised if Vista/7 had nasty behavior on corruption . So I reckon running chkdsk on a few of your volumes might help , it 's surprisingly fast if you do n't run thorough checking , chkdsk /F /X should be good enough . Plus , it never hurts . <p> Also , the chipset being damaged sounds feasible , these normally have poor cooling anyway , and I ca n't imagine they handle well in a system that 's overheating , so it may have sustained damage . If a CPU was at all damaged you 'd get some more hardcore problems . <p> I 've still not fully ruled out hardware , but the things look to be pointed more and more at a software issue . <p> Number 1 - running Windows XP under a VM and performing file transfers and decompressing files works fine . The only thing up in the air here is the fact that data is being manipulated over a virtual network and not physically on the PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only this time the VM is Ubuntu 9.10 . Both VM 's are 32 bit , which may be question number 3 .... <p> Number 3 - ran hardware diagnostics within Windows 7 , physical box/non-VM , using SiSoft Sandra and all hardware reported back as no errors . Though the app recommended turning off Acoustic Management on the drives . <p> Next steps : <p> 1 . Disconnect OS drive and install Vista on either a portable drive or on one of the physical drives in the box to see if it suffers the same issues . <p> 2 . If the above shows issues , will try XP , might as well ... <p> 3 . If 1 and 2 have the same problem , I found an older CPU ( AM2 Sempron 3400+ single core ) to test with . <p> Also , the chipset being damaged sounds feasible , these normally have poor cooling anyway , and I ca n't imagine they handle well in a system that 's overheating , so it may have sustained damage . If a CPU was at all damaged you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , you 're probably right about the CPU , but as for cooling for the chipset , have a look at the cooling on the motherboard : <p> Plus my HSF has a duct that directs air over the top most section of the chipset heat sink . <p> Your chipset should definitely be fine . And those testing methods sound perfect , you 're well on your way to a fixed issue by the looks of things . As you 're busy testing software issues and fixes , try updating the chipset drivers , if it 's nForce , which it might be because of the two PCI-E16x , get them from the nvidia website instead .

It then gets worse than you realise they are hot linking ( leeching ) your images direct from your own server , or even worse linking to you to host the large download for their users . Luckily with most Web Servers , you can easily block this so at least if someone is going to steal your content they have to at least host their own images and downloads so you do n't pick up the bill / resources for their theft . I 'm going to detail below the process for use in IIS ( Internet Information Services ) the built in Web Server in Windows in which you can block any file extensions ( say Images , or Downloads ) from being linked to directly , and even use redirect or rewrite rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your website where the original content is from . <p> Preparing Internet Information Services ( IIS ) : <p> For IIS to be able to block this , you need to install the URL Rewrite Module if it 's not already installed . This module is an official Microsoft package so there is no need to worry about any security risks associated with this . If you already have the Web Platform Installer package installed on your IIS you can go ahead and select it from there , or use the link below on the Server to get it installed : <p> Once installed , open you 're Internet Information Services ( IIS ) Manager and browse to the site in question . Click on the newly appeared URL Rewrite Icon : <p> On the right hand side , select Add Rules : <p> Select Inbound Rules , and select Blank Rule and click ok : <p> Give the rule a nice new name , we made two rules ( One for Downloads , and one for Images ) so something like ' Prevent Image Hotlinking ' . Next in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pattern and enter the below in the Pattern area : <p> Code : <p> . *. ( gifjpgpng ) $ <p> Note the file extensions gif , jpg and png . You can edit these to your heart 's content . So if this rule was to block Download you could use rarzip like we did in the below : <p> It 's recommended to ignore case as sometimes you can have either like image.JPG or image.jpg . <p> Next it 's time to set some conditions to trigger this rule . It 's important here we have two rules as this is using the HTTP REFERER flag . One for your own URL and one for blank . This is because some users have privacy settings or tools installed which block the referrer flag being sent in HTTP requests , so we want those users to be able to still view the content ( so we do n't break the site for them ) and of course anyone with your own legitimate URL 's . Effectively we are blocking anyone who both does n't have a blank referrer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's site . <p> Select the ' Add .. ' button in the Conditions area and let 's first add a blank referrer allowed condition like so : <p> This specific rule will allow anyone using HTTP to access the content providing at some point digiex.net is in the URL ( so allows sub domains etc to be used ) . <p> Once done , you should find a series of Conditions added like below ( note for this screenshot , I also added one for https as we have an https site to ) : <p> Actions for the IIS URL Rewrite Hot Link ( Leeching ) Protection Rule : <p> Now onto the fun part , the Actions once these rules have been triggered . Here you can be quite creative in how you wish to deal with those who are leeching your content , or even attempt to convert those users into visitors onto your site . I 'll go through two examples which we have used on Digiex : <p> Action : Redirect <p> We host a lot of downloads on Digiex , and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or waiting times . Sadly a lot of other webmasters abused this and directly linked to our downloads from there pages so we picked up the bill . We needed to stop this , but instead of flat out blocking the downloads or just showing error messages we wanted to engage those visitors clicking on the links that the content was stolen which damages the creditability of the site they were on , and give them a chance to find the original content on our site giving us page views as well as a chance to earn back some of the costs of the download . We did this by setting up a custom page ( which you are welcome to browse at digiex.net/leech.php ) which then contains a custom google search box which gives them a chance to realistically find the original content on our site and likely see the original authors work . <p> In IIS , we then set the Action to Redirect and placed the full URL in like below : <p> You 'll notice we set the redirect type as Temporary . This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we did n't want them to think Leech.php was the permanent home for the download . <p> Once done the rule was enabled , and we saw 20-50 views an hour to our leech.php page showing a lot of sites were directly linking , and our overall page views on our main site increased as users were funnelled into seeing the original content . <p> Action : Rewrite <p> This Action Rule only really works well on images as it hides any redirect/changes to the user and instead on the fly replaces the content . When a website directly links to your images , what you can do is on the fly replace the images just for those users with something like your websites logo , or even a full information picture saying like ' Content stolen , browse at digiex.net ' . It will however not affect any legitimate browses on your own site as the rule is set to accept them . <p> You can set the rule up like below ( note , I used a relative location to the site home ) : <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to go . <p> Please note : If you use any CDN service like Cloudflare , I strongly recommend not setting up an image blocking rule as this will interfere with the CDN and they could cache the wrong image for all users to see . Instead , use the CDN interface to request hot link protection on the images instead of doing it on your web server . <p> I hope this guide helps If you have any questions , feel free to drop them below and I will get back to you . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399174 @1399174/ <h> Tekkit beginner guide for Equivalent Exchange <p> I 've noticed that the Tekkit wiki and the EE ( Equivalent Exchange ) wiki lack a specific guide to EE , and though I should write one . <p> Starting offTypically the first thing you will probably want to do is construct a shelter of some sort . This can really be whatever you want , and most likely wo n't interfere with this guide . The first items you will want are as follows : Diamond , Glowstone , Glass , Obsidian , Redstone , and Tools ( Iron+ ) . Diamond and glowstone are the hardest to achieve , but you may be able to procure some from another player . ( If you ask me in-game ( dionvc ) , I can definitely give you some . ) You will need to get some coal and iron first . These items are not too hard to find , and should not be a problem . Once you have the coal and iron , make an iron pickaxe . You will need this to mine diamonds , glowstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ObsidianIt does n't matter which order you find the two in . My recommendation would be to get glowstone first . On this server , you will need to go to the survival world ( /w survival ) to go to the nether . While in the nether , be careful and avoid dangerous situations . You will need 28 glowstone dust ( 7 Glowstone blocks ) to ensure you will not be returning to the nether ( although more will not hurt ) . Once you have the 6 glowstone blocks , return to the world you were previously in by using the /w ( nameofworld ) command . You should be returned to where you left the world . Now , you will need 15 diamond , which may take a little bit of mining to get . Try to take a water bucket with you so you can make obsidian when you find lava . Remember to stay below layer 15 when looking for diamonds . While looking for diamonds keep in mind you need obsidian and redstone . Once you have 15 diamonds , some redstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; CondenserThe first thing you will need is a Energy Collector . This costs 6 glowstone , 1 diamond block , 1 furnace , and 1 glass . The recipe is as follows : Energy Collector : GS GL GS GS DB GS GS FU GS GS=Glowstone GL=Glass FU=Furnace DB=Diamond Block Place the collector down , and directly above it place the Glowstone ( if you are having trouble placing it without opening the UI of the collector , hold shift while placing ) . You can now make glowstone out of coal , although it takes a long time . The next thing you will build is a alchemical chest , and use it to make a energy condenser . The condenser allows you to use neighboring power collectors to generate items . First , make low covalence dust , medium covalence dust , and high covalence dust . Each recipe makes 40 dust , so you will have plenty leftover . Put the extra in storage for later.Low covalence:CO CO CO CO CO CO CO CO CL CO= Cobble CL=Charcoal Medium Covalence : IR RD EM EM EM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covalence : DI CL EM EM EM EM EM EM EM DI=Diamond CL=Coal EM=Empty Now , you will need to make an alchemical chest . The alchemical chest is just a larger version of the normal chest , and is used in several recipes.Alchemical Chest:LC MC HC ST DI ST IR CH IR LC=Low Covalence Dust MC= Medium Covalence Dust HC=High Covalence Dust ST=Stone DI=Diamond IR=Iron CH=Chest And now you have the items needed to make a Energy Condenser . Energy Condenser : OB DI OB DI AC DI OB DI OB OB=Obsidian DI=Diamond AC=Alchemical Chest Place the condenser directly next the Energy Collector . Now you can dupe items , but at a slow pace . As you progress , you can upgrade your duping setup . In order to dupe you must have the item you want to dupe , and proceed to place it in the slot at the top left corner of the UI of the Energy Condenser . When you have enough , you can manufacture more energy collectors .

@@21399179 @1399179/ <p> One of the great things about Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition is how easily mod-able it is . Capcom seemed to take great care in how the game 's files are layed out . As a side effect of this , it 's also very very easy to switch between costumes for each charter . All that requires is some simple renaming and moving a few files . Capcom also included every single alternative costume with the initial install of Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition making it simple to enable all content that usually costs about $15 <p> This guide will assume you understand how to rename and move files using explorer . Make sure to back up every file you change . Also , this has not been tested online . It should work , but it may also count as a hack and ban you from using the game online on windows live games or steam . So be warned it 's possible and use at your own risk <p> Step 1 - Gathering information ? <p> The very first thing you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need the folder you originally installed Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition into . It 's usually " c : program filesSuper Street Fighter IV " . Make a note of where that base folder is . For the rest of this guide it will be refereed to as *base* . We will be using various sub folders of that base folder . Now the actual files are divided up by what character they are . Each character has it 's own sub folder . <p> Before we proceed with locations , you 'll need to understand the PC game is based on the xbox version of super street fighter IV . On the xbox the arcade edition was DLC content . This DLC added 4 new characters : Oni , Evil Ryu , Yun , Yang . These 4 characters are in a different place an have a slightly different layout then the other characters <p> Now for the list Super Street Fighter IV skins 1&amp;2 are in the folder : **25;2172;TOOLONG skins 3&amp;4 are in the folder : **29;2199;TOOLONG <p> Now for the super street fighter IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder - **31;2230;TOOLONG <p> GKX - Oni RYX - Evil Ryu YAN - Yan YUN - Yun <p> Step 2 - What to move ? <p> For the purposes of this guide I 'll use Adon as an example . Going into the ADN folder ( **28;2263;TOOLONG ) you 'll see a number of files . Each skin has two files . One is the color , the other one is the object that 's being colored ( aka costume ) . These files are numbered according to what skin slot they are . The very first skin slot ( the default color and object ) for Adon is named ADN0101.col.emb and ADN0101.obj.emm . " ADN " refers to the model , in this case Adon . The file with " col " in it is the color , the " obj " is the object . All alternative costumes are labeled the same way , only the first number is changed . For adon the first alternative color and object are named ADN0201.col.emb and ADN0201.obj.emm <p> To enable the alternative costumes , you can simply rename the alternatve constume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ADN0101.col.emb and ADN0101.obj.emm . Note that you ca n't have two files of the same name , so just rename the original costumes to something else <p> Now start up super street fighter IV arcade edition and go into the training room . Select adon and make sure he is suing color 1 . If all works correctly Adon should know be wearing the 2nd alternative costume <p> To get costumes 3 and 4 simply copy the correct files to where skins 1 and 2 are located . now rename them to match the original costume like you did before . <p> For Oni , Evil Ryu , Yun , and yang it 's slightly different . they only have 3 costumes in total and all are in the same folder . Follow the same instructions for naming as before <p> Note : Included as an attachment is the list of what folders belong to what characters . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

I wonder what Microsoft has done to stop this from happen . I 'm putting on my thinking cap . *- ) <p> The disc are signed by Microsoft , even if you do n't have the key it would be possible to run unsigned code via an exploit which is what happened with the Xbox 1 . However on the 360 there has only really been one major exploit which was patched by Microsoft before the majority of people even knew about it . <p> Your best reading the Xbox-Scene forums to learn about the technical side of the 360 . <p> Man you must be thinking like me , lol ! I just posted basically the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I am not modding or flashing my Xbox lest I void the warranty . Where there is a will there is a way . Keep thinking as I will be as well . Lemme know if you come up with anything . Peace . <p> I got to thinking about this too . Maybe it would be possible with the NXE update . Seeing how most game are over 4.7Gigs ( Standard Blank DVD ) . Maybe if you borrowed a game and Downloaded it to the 360 's HDD then possibly made a disc to specifically boot up the game ? I might be getting somewhere ... *- ) <p> You modify the DNS settings in the games network options to the IP address if your pc , then launch a program on your pc that acts as a fake server , when you click online play on the game it connect to your pc which sends a GameCube program across and Pahntasy Star launches it . <p> This GameCube program can be software to stream GameCube ISO from your pc to the Cube , a memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All that 's in the past now as in the end someone managed to create a modchip , but before that it was quite a break through . You can probably still find some information about this if you Google . <p> i 've been thinking if microsoft can make the discs why ca n't we . if someone could get their hands on the hardware and software microsoft uses to make 360 games they could distribute the software . maybe microsoft just uses a normal disc drive or maybe they just mess with the laser or something . maybe microsoft just uses normal drive and everything but just have certain discs with the unreadable part already on there and the hologram already on there an d they just send the disc out to the companies and they burn it and add the label . there 's a world of possibilities and remember if they can be made they can always be remade .

@@21399191 @1399191/ <p> The One Plus One is a phone which has the highest specification of any phone currently on sale , at a mid range price point . However the catch is you need an invite to purchase one . Its been two months since invites started to be handed out , and so far only a few 1000 have been . Chances are you already know this if you happen to be reading this post and know that you can walk in to shops in China and purchase a One Plus One . <p> So what if you were to skip this ridiculous invite system and just purchase the phone from China ? will it work in your home country ? The short answer is unless you live in North / South America or Canada most likely , however I will explain how you can work it out for yourself . The main difference between the international One Plus One and the Chinese one are the LTE / WDCMA band 's the phones support . <p> Comparison of the One Plus One GSM frequencies and WCDMA / LTE bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see above the Chinese One Plus One does not support LTE bands 4 and 17 , along with WCDMA band 4 . So basically you want to know what bands your mobile network operates on before importing a One Plus One . <p> Above we can see that the mobile operators EE and 3 use LTE bands 3 and 7 which are supported by the One Plus One , however o2 and Vodafone use band 20 which neither version of the One Plus One supports . <p> So if you are from the UK you could purchase either the international of Chinese One Plus One and get 4G here in the UK on the 3 or EE . Of course the One Plus One will work on any other network here as it supports all the GSM bands used here in the UK , so you can use 2g /3g fine . Given that 4g is only really in major citys here at the moment that 's not a total deal breaker . <p> Show me some 4G proof : <p> Here are some 4G speedtests taken here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Three network . <p> This test was taken on a moving bus : <p> This test was taken stood outside my workplace : <p> So as you can see if your network supports the LTE bands you have nothing to loose by importing a Chineese One Plus One . <p> You have convinced me , where can I import a One Plus One from ? <p> Aliexpress is the place i imported my One Plus One from , think of it as the Amazon / Ebay of China , except with sellers that are focused on selling outside China . You are probably a bit concerned about purchasing from a seller on Aliexpress , however if you read up on the website you will find out like with Ebay the site really does favour the seller . When you purchase something the money is held in escrow by Aliexpress . The seller then has x amount of days to ship your item with a tracking number , otherwise you are automatically refunded . Once you receive the item you have to mark it as received on Aliexpress to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can open a dispute , just like on Ebay . Like Ebay / Amazon market sellers have feedback scores and reviews , so i would say in general buying from Aliexpress is as safe as buying from Amazon Marketplace or Ebay , if not maybe even more so . <p> This is the seller i purchased my One Plus One from , i was very happy with the communication and service offered . This seller / company shipped the item to Europe somewhere , then on to the UK so i did not have an import duty to pay . I was provided with a FedEx tracking number to track the progress of my shipment . Once my order was despatched it arrived exactly a week later , which I thought was very fast considering the distance it had to come . <p> English Software : <p> The Chinese One Plus One ships with " Colour OS " , basically a Chinese version of Android , however you can flash Cyanogenmod 11s , which is the English version of Android the international version of the One Plus One ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find a lot of the Chinese sellers will have done this anyway for you , the seller i purchased form had . I will have a guide up soon shwoing you how to flash Cyanogenmod 11s anyway . <p> Final words : <p> If your mobile network uses LTE bands which the Chinese One Plus One supports i see no reason not to import one . The total cost for myself was actually cheaper than what i would have been if i had an invite to purchase the international version . In total i paid -268 for the 64gb version , this was the cost delivered to my door . To purchase one directly would cost you -269 which does not include shipping , and possible customs charges from what various people have said . <p> Personally I am very happy with my decision to import a One Plus One , the phone is the best you can basically get at present , sold at mid range prices . <p> The 64gb iPhone 5s is -709 , for that price you could purchase 2x One Plus One 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device the Nexus 5 is -339 for the 32gb version making it -71 more expensive than the One Plus One . Neither the iPhone 5s or Nexus 5 are in the same league as the One Plus One either . I really am very impressed with the quality of the device . <p> If you have any question 's i will do my best to answer them , stay tuned as i plan to have a guide on how to flash Cyanogenmod 11s on a Chinese One Plus One and a review of the device too . <p> I 'm planning to get one , only problem is I may have to wait a while to get an invite ! However , have you received the phone yet ? If so I might buy it from the website mentioned . Finally I 've heard that there is a Chinese regional version of the phone and an international version , if I were to buy it from Aliexpress which one would it be ? <p> Yes i 've had my One Plus One since Monday , after it was despatched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via Fedex . <p> If you order from Aliexpress it will be the Chinese version of the phone you get , you might have to flash Cyanogenmod 11s ( the English version of Android for the phone ) yourself , however a lot of of the sellers are doing this before shipping the phone out . The seller i linked to above will pre flash it for you . <p> A photo comparing my old HTC Desire ( 2010 ) and Galaxy Nexus ( 2011 ) to the One Plus One : <p> My One Plus One compared to a mates Galaxy Note 3 : <p> I 'm currently working on a review of the phone which i expect to get up within the next week or so , however if you have any questions i 'll do my best to answer them . <p> In my opinion it really is the best phone out at the moment , both in terms of hardware , software and value for money . <p> I 've also noticed on the website you linked , that you can buy the pre-order or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? Also what would the warranty be if it was bought from Aliexpress because if you bought it through the official website , you would get a 1 year warranty . If you bought it through Aliexpress and it broke about 3 months after you received it , what would happen ? Would the person you bought it from give you a new one or would you be completely stuffed . ( Only asking this because my dad is paranoid ) <p> The pre-order option is basically a special offer , you get the phone a bit cheaper , however it will take them 2-3 weeks to dispatch it . That 's what I did as I thought if I get an invite in that time I will cancel my Aliexpress order . <p> As for the warranty I do n't believe you would have one . In general phones are pretty reliable , if the phone breaks its most likely going to be an accident e.g your dog ate it , which no warranty covers anyway . <p> I 'm finding the phone very good all round its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big brand but one I got phone my issues were laid to rest if I had to choose between a Samsung galaxy s5 or nexus 5 and one plus one I 'd choose one plus every time the 4G for me is n't an issue as I find 3G sufficient as I 'm on giffgaff which piggybacks on 02 as mentioned on various sites the phones raw specs beat even the top price phones for price it is you ca n't go wrong <p> Just ordered my OPO on their website on the 27th " 1 " hour pre-order ( turned out to be 3 due to the website crashing ) . I was lucky and should get it this week . I hope its as good as everyone says . I found this thread today on the oneplus website . It shows how not to handle a situation when something goes wrong .

@@21399192 @1399192/ <p> Tomato is a great after market firmware compatible with many Broadcom based routers , however in the default configuration WAN to LAN throughput ( the speed you can download ) will be limited to around 100mbps as the router just does n't have the processing power to process packets at such high speeds . <p> Here is a speedtest on my 150mbps connection : <p> As you can see my router simply ca n't cope with a connection speed of much more than 100mbps , however we can do something about this , we can enable Fast-Nat <p> What is Fast-Nat ? <p> Fast-NAT does n't keep track of connections , where as NAT does . Connection tracking takes a lot of processor power and there for requires a lot more resources , this ends up becoming too much of a strain on your router which has limited processing power .

Follow this guide and you will succeed . <p> This requires a CDMA iPhone not GSM . Should work just fine on a iPhone 4 or 4S . However a 5 has n't been tested . <p> Why should you do this ? The plans are significantly cheaper than going directly through Verzion . Not to mention you are not binded to a contract . I switched from AT&amp;T ( purchased a verzion iphone first ) paying 60-80$ a month that I did n't even use that much due to my inactivity . Even then AT&amp;T would n't allow me to use tethering . Had to jailbreak and use My-Wi to accomplish this . Even then AT&amp;T detected it and threw a larger data plan on my account . Which I had to call and have removed . I am now paying 12$ a month and it suites me just fine , no contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . OH ! ! Let 's not forget about the spotty AT&amp;T coverage and the LACK of 3G in my area . PagePlus gives me better service 3 bars vs my 1 bar before AND 3G ! <p> The savings a year is quite significant for just my line alone doing this for your family and ! It had to be done . <p> The first step is rather easy . You need to check the ESN of your iPhone . This is best done using this link . After a short while or a few hours depending on there server they will send you a email . Please be sure to read it completely so that you make sense of what its saying . Now here is an example of what my email said . " The Device State is : AVAILABLEFORUSE ( this field should NOT be blank , if it is , read below . ) " Now this is the most important line in the email and it can say many different things which have been explained in the email sent to you . The device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it means your device will work on the PagePlus just fine . However you may at times receive nothing on this line . If so this generally just means to re-submit the ESN check request . If your getting something else then please read your email and make sense of it . If you need help just ask . <p> Next step , you need to go here to get a FREE PagePlus phone number . Now before contining understand this is a quick and free method that will generate you a PagePlus phone number based on the zip code you provide . If you 'd perfer to keep a old phone number I 'd suggest using this . This is also free , however it does take time . It took me a day or so to fully port my brothers iPhone . There are other methods of doing this but free is clearly the best ! <p> Activing your iPhone is next ! You need to get in service range and dail *228 then press 1 when prompted . You 'll recevie a " Service Update Complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts ( while in the phone app ) it should show your new phone number at the very top . If not , restart your iphone . <p> Now place your first phone call . It will complete the activation . When prompted just press 1 and your done . Now after this is done your phone is good to go . However you need to register an account and tie your phone to the account to purchase minutes or go on a monthly plan . This needs to be done here . PagePlus . Creating an account should be rather easy . AFTER you have created an account and are signed in go to this Add a Phone . From here just register your iPhone . It will send you a text message code that you will need to provide it . <p> All done . You may now purchase a monthly plan or do a Pay as you go deal type thing from here . Plans . If you went with a Port-In above then you should of recevied a email with a discount code . However it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take more time . <p> Note : If your using a jailbroken phone here you can download a PagePlus Carrier Bundle and apply it your iPhone using Cydia . This will make it show PagePlus as your carrier in settings and at the top . It will also remove visual voicemail . As this wo n't work . It may also also change apn settings and such . Everything will work just fine without it so this step is not required but will make everything more proper . <p> Note : It will add a silly looking logo at the top left , if you wish to remove this and use the normal PagePlus text just install " iFile " from Cydia . Then browse to " /var/mobile/Carrier Bundle.bundle " . Delete or rename all the . png files . Optionally if you have OpenSSH install on your device just login and type cd " /var/mobile/Carrier Bundle.bundle " &amp;&amp; rm *. png <p> That 's all there is . Your 100% done ! Enjoy your new FEATURE packed iPhone . Should you need any help just ask below . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , if your trying to do this using a non-verzion iPhone , then it wo n't work .

For this guide I am using Ubuntu however it should be really simple to change these commands based on the linux distro you are using . <p> Please note at the time of writing this the latest version is 5.1.1b1 . My system is also 64bit . Therefore you should adjust the ' wget ' &amp; ' tar ' lines below to match your setup . You can find the files here . <p> Also if you already have an older unrar installed you can leave it this way or simply remove it by running ' sudo apt-get remove --purge unrar ' <p> First you need to resolve a few dependencies .

The codec you want to be using is Xvid . <p> Once you have done the settings here click ok , then add job . If this is the only file you want to convert click start . <p> Various different programs will appear in the taskbar such as VirtualDub and Lame , that 's noting to worry about ... both VirtualDub and Lame are encoding programs for audio/video that Auto GK uses to encode Xvid Files <p> AutoGK will do a 2pass encode , once both encodes have finished you will be notified in the AutoGK log window <p> It 's hard to say howlong the encoding will take , it all depends on the speed of your processor . As you can see from the above image it took 17 minutes to do the first encode on my Core2Duo which is overclocked to 2.93ghz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encode . <p> I have included a DVR-MS and Xvid sample of the encoding I did to create this guide . The DVR-MS file is 29.8MB where as the Xvid file is only 10.8MB big , if you watch both samples you will see that there is little difference in quality . I think its defiantly worth encoding your Recorded TV to Xvid , for very little quality loss you saving you 're self a lot of disc space . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Cheers M <p> Party Buffalo Drive Explorer should open FATX formatted drives pretty well . The hard drive on the Xbox Classic can be locked though , so you might actually need the borken console to power on and unlocked the drive , then keeping it powered you can unplug the IDE cable and hook it up to your PC , and in theory access the contents of the hard drive . <p> I believe the Xbox 360 tools should be able to read he FATX partitions on the Xbox Classic hard drive , however its not something i have ever tried . <p> You can damage your Xbox hard drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC / Xbox are powered on however . It might be an idea to try fix the console if possible and just FTP the contents off the hard drive . <p> Nice one Nutter .... Thanks for taking the time out for that explanation , much appreciated .... All straightforward enough but unfortunately the console is long gone ... by a few years . Where I was based overseas it just was n't viable storing a dead weight lol <p> So regarding weather my hard drive is locked ... Is that an operating state or just pre-hacked setting ? <p> I ask because way back when I had already replaced the original harddrive with a Seagate 200Gb ( lol seemed big at the time ) and being a modded box the Hd had evox , xbmc etc installed ( Which is what am actually trying to access on it ... My sons photos when new born ) ? : lol <p> It 's an operating state , when locked a PC cant access the drive . The Xbox powers , unlocks it and boots up , meaning aslong as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe its sort of like encryption , the drive is essentially decrypted when the console powers on , however do n't quote me on that its been a long time since i did anything with the Xbox . <p> As you have upgraded the drive yourself chances are it might not be locked and you can connect it to a PC then read the contents with one of the 360 tools that can read FATX formatted drives . <p> P.

@@21399200 @1399200/ <p> Note : This map pack includes the Blastacular map pack and the Halo 2 1.5 update released on April 17th 2007 . These are not included on the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack disc you could used to purchase in shops . This is a user modified disc created by feudalnate with the additional map pack and 1.5 update included . This is the only way to install the Blastacular Map Pack and 1.5 update on a flashed Xbox 360 , as it is no longer possible to download them off Xbox Live , since Xbox Live for the classic Xbox has closed down . <p> Q : What is this ? A : This is an edited version of the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack game <p> Q : Why call it homebrew ? A : I called it homebrew because calling it Custom , Modded , or Edited may give the indication that it does n't offer the retail data - which it does . <p> Q : Wait , homebrew ? For a retail Xbox 360 ? A : Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited the main executable ( default.xbe ) has not been tampered with and Microsofts ' digital signature is still valid , thus allowing the executable to be launched on retail consoles . <p> Q : How is this possible ? A : By dumping the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack image , I found that the default.xbe ( original Xbox executable ) was really the CDX menu system by Microsoft . The CDX menu was designed for kiosk style discs ( ie : demos , videos , content , etc. all-in-one disc ) and is totally configurable from external files and the executable never needs to be touched to offer something completely different . <p> This meant by editing certain files and adding the necessary content , I was able to edit the game to offer whatever I pleased . All this is possible because the executable file is cryptographically valid and external files are n't checked for validity . A mistake on Microsofts ' part but a benefit for those that understand how CDX works . <p> On another note , although it would say Halo 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executable and its files could be used to install ANY original Xbox content on retail Xbox 360s as long as all the required files for the particular DLC are present . <p> Q : Does this really install all 4 of the map packs ! ? A : Yes , it really does . <p> Q : What title update does this install ? A : The latest update , which is version 1.5 ( aka Auto-Update 5 ) <p> Q : Does this contain all the content from the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack game as well ? A : No . The exclusive videos , E3 videos , and sound test have all been removed . Only the 4 map packs , title update , and Bungies ' game type variants are included . <p> Q : So what are the requirements for using this ? A : A few things are required : <p> 1 ) The original Xbox emulator for Xbox 360 ( most consoles have this pre-installed or have installed it via a system update ) 2 ) iXtreme 1.6 firmware ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support playback of burnt original Xbox games , sorry you 're out of luck ) 3 ) Have ran Halo 2 atleast one time ( needed to create the content folders to store the maps and update ) <p> Q : Will I get banned booting this on my console ! ? ! A : You run the same risk as you do booting any other burnt game . <p> Q : Is this stealth patched ? A : Yes ! Because I ripped the original game with my 0800 drive , the image is patched with the proper SS(v2) and DMI sectors and because the default.xbe has not been touched , the sectors are valid for the executable <p> Q : I ca n't run this through ABGX360 arrrrrrggggggggg ! ! ! A : Nope . <p> Q : Why do this ? A : Because I can . Halo 2 has always been my favorite game and has been the most enjoyable multiplayer experience on a console for me and I 'm sure many people share the same feelings towards it . <p> So why do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mainly , for personal use , and for those that still enjoy Halo 2 over system link emulators to this date . Also , at the time of this post , this image ( ISO ) is the ONLY way to get ALL the map packs and latest update on a retail Xbox 360 . <p> Thank you for your post and the time you took to make this package . I just recently dusted off my Xbox ( original ) and brought it into work for some fun when we have downtime--and this looks like the perfect thing to have ! <p> Unfortunately I can not get the disc to work , and it may be due to a bad DVD-ROM drive . IMGBurn completes and verifies successfully ( with layer break 1913776 ) , but when I insert the disc into my Xbox it comes up as empty . My DVD-ROM can still read retail games , but no other media seems to work . I have tried with Memorex and Verbatim DVD+R DL ( again with layer break 1913776 ) to no avail . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and mount the image and transfer it to my Xbox via ethernet . I 've tried Qwix , UltraISO , Xiso , C-Xbox Tool , and a few others with no luck . Some say the image is empty , others just say there only exists a VIDEOTS folder . <p> Is there any course of action I can take to get this release onto my Xbox ? If it makes any difference , I was looking to get this package for the additional game version update , the Blastacular Pack , and the additional game modes . <p> Sorry if this is a stupid question but I 've never really been knowledgeable about these kinds of things . A short time back I stumbled across the Portal 2 DLC page but that said you had to have a JTagged console so I ca n't download that DLC to either of mine . How do you flash a 360 though ? <p> Halo 2 is one of my favorite games of all time and I desperately want all of the maps to play on . <p> The Jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Xbox 360 console . That would be a good starting point , you probably would need to buy some hardware to enable to flash a console today however . <p> So i downloaded the file and burn with imgburn with the layerbreak 1913766 and all is OK , the console play the disc and i proceeded to install first the update and them the map packs , when i put my copy of halo 2 is not updated and the new maps aren-t . So wich was the mistake ? Can you help me ? <p> I have a Xbox 360 slim with LT 3.0 . I burn this image with imgburn at 8X in a verbatim disc with layerbreak 1913766 and I play in my console and run , so first install the update , choose english and finish with actualization suceeded or something like that , then install the map packs in order and when I put my copy of halo 2 to play the number 1.5 is n't and the maps less . Thanks for answer me . <p> I think that the problem is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder Halo 2 sized 555MB ( only the maps ) but when i select the folder found in to a game data with 561MB are 6MB between them , the 6MB are the update . I have a question , i need to have installed the update 1.1 before to install the 1.5 because i do n't have this update . I tried to find the original disc converted with the update 1.1 but nothing . It 's frustating . Do you have it ? <p> Yes i played halo2 before in Xlink kai and when downloaded this image and burned was recognized that i had a copy of halo 2 and i could install the update and the maps , Otherwise it went wrong when updating and could not get the maps either because he told me that in this console you had not I pull halo 2 before , I know because I took out my profile up and I am here to load it again with the hope that she recognized me the update . I do n't know what else to do . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i did n't create the disc ) do you have a Jtagged or RGH hacked Xbox 360 ? We have installers created by a member here which work perfectly for modified consoles . <p> I 'm not really sure what else to suggest unfortunately ( i did n't create the disc ) do you have a Jtagged or RGH hacked Xbox 360 ?

But is this possible on an un-flashed 360 ? When I was re-reading it , I kept reading " retail " . Or if I had a modded 360 , would I be able to copy the data to my 360 memory card/flash drive and then move it over to my regular 360 ? I want all these maps and I want them all on one console . <p> It 's not sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> Xbox Classic content ca n't be moved to a memory card , its tied to the console it 's installed on . Even putting your hard drive in another 360 then back in the 360 it was installed on corrupts the content , so you have to re install it . <p> If you have a flashed DVD drive capable of playing burned games then you can use this , this is easier than doing a full hardware hack such as the Jtag or RGH hack . If you do have a Jtag / RGH 360 then you can also use this , however using the installers by Harcroft would be the easier option as you do n't have to burn any discs . <p> Softmod an Xbox Classic ? it 's still well worth having a Classic Xbox in your collection if you ask me . They can be modded with an exploitable game and memory card , so you do n't even need to open them up . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399209 @1399209/ <h> Amazon Prime Now : Can it replace Supermarkets for Food ? <p> So browsing Amazon a few weeks ago I noticed the big banner ' Amazon Prime Now ' available in the South East of England . It looks like it 's finally available to those of us outside London , including large parts of the South and North of England . <p> Amazon Prime Now is Amazon 's flagship service for ordering items for people who subscribed to Amazon Prime ( currently standing at -79 a year ; which includes Amazon Prime Shipping , Amazon Video , Amazon Music and a Kindle Book Library ) . Amazon have been trying to drive growth in the Prime Service ; and it looks like finally they may have hit the big one . Providing the item or items are available in your local depo ; Amazon can deliver it within 1 hour from order ( at a cost , currently -6 ! ) ; but more importantly , within a 2 hour window for free . <p> The 2 hour window process works like such , the whole day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set up as 8-10 , 10-12 and so forth . You can make an order up to 30 minutes before the slot is due to send , and your items will be included in it . So if you play it cleverly and order at say just before 5:30pm , you order will be on its way to you at 6pm . I 've made a few orders and got them in less than 45 minutes at no charge . <p> There is one rather weird downside to Amazon Prime Now though ; you ca n't order it on the traditional website . You have to download the iOS or Android application and log into it with your Amazon account . Honestly this makes no sense to me , say I 'm purchasing a copy of Doom from Amazon.co.uk ; by default as a Prime Member I will get the usual options of Evening Delivery ( if ordered before 1pm ) , or next day . It makes no mention of Amazon Prime Now . I would have to separately open up the App ; and see if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon Prime Now . So right now Amazon has a conflicting service ; where everytime I order from Amazon I have to check both there website and the Amazon Prime Now app before I make an order . I hope in time Amazon realises how silly this is , and supports ordering from Amazon Prime Now from the website ( or at least ; a nice notification when ordered that the item is in your local Depo and can be ordered from the App ) . <p> But moving on from that ; the biggest part of Amazon Prime Now though which I think very few people know about is its Grocery shopping . You heard me , the items you pick up at your local supermarkets like Tesco are available on Amazon Prime . I 'm not even joking ; Fresh Fruit and Veg , Chilled , Frozen , Toiletries . The Lot . <p> The idea of going to the supermarket ; doing a weekly shop and dragged it home just seems so old fashioned . I 'm a young professional ; I 'll be honest that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it off as much as possible ; and I rush around when I do because I find nothing more hateful than going round a supermarket packed full of people . To resolve this , the big supermarkets did online shopping which while being great ; seemed really backwards . Take Tesco 's for example ; you have to order one day at a minimum before your shopping delivery day ; that 's assume they have any slots left . If not , you could be ordering days in advanced . To top it off ; you pay for delivery ( some slots cost up to -4 ! ) ; and you ca n't guarantee you get the items you want . On the site they offer every item your local store sells ; but do n't take into account stock availability . So you could order Banana 's , and find Apples instead . It 's a joke . One of the nice points of Amazon is the stock is real time ; if Crumpets are for sale ; it means they have stock . They also wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's talk about Prices . This one I think is key for the service . So it does n't have your traditional BOGOF , or multibuy discounts or buy this and get that free like your traditional supermarket . But instead it has ( which I prefer ) ; damn good prices . I mean ; one example . A giant box of Cornflakes , Tesco 's and Morrisons sell it for something like -3.79 . Amazon had it for -2.50 . Crumpets ; 50p for a pack , vs -1.20 in supermarkets . Toilet Roll , half the price . The prices are good . Now a lot of this comes down to Amazon 's ' Tax Status ' I 'm sure ; but ultimately in difficult times like we are now in ; it 's hard to say no to Amazon 's lower prices . <p> On terms of Availability ; Amazon has a big range ( well ; maybe it depends on area as I can only speak for the South East of the UK ) . But I had no problem finding my favourite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiletries the lot . The one downside I guess in this ; is Amazon does n't realty do its ' own brand ' food ; however that 's likely to change down the road due to recent news that Morrisons is about to sell its own label goods wholesale into Amazon Prime Now . One funny thing I did notice is the fruit and veg goes under the brand ' Independent ' and when you read the packaging it says ' Thanks for supporting local businesses ' which is ironic considering Amazon is anything but local . <p> There are however a few downsides to Amazon Prime Now ; Fresh Meat is almost non-existent which I can understand so it still makes the need to visit your local express store needed . However being able to do all your weekly shopping on demand , and getting it 2 hours later means you do n't have to visit the big stores again . Another weird downside to Amazon Prime Now is by default ; you tip the drivers -2 per order ; added at the end . This makes no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However over here ; the idea of tipping a delivery driver who 's just doing their job is a rather strange concept . I do n't tip the postman , I do n't tip Parcelforce . Heck ; I rarely tip a takeaway ( unless they literally were epic ) . It 's an issue I 'm hoping goes away ; and not Amazon 's attempt to make us pay their drivers a living wage ( they should be paying them a good fair price for it ) . The good news is the tip can be removed at checkout which I do every time . The app warns you that you can not tip the drivers cash or anything but I 've ignored that . One of the guys that delivered not only brought all the shopping up the stairs ( I live in a block of Flats ) ; but actually went ahead put them in the kitchen ; and was REALLY friendly . I gave him a few pounds cash tip and said keep it and tell no one <p> Personally though , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand why Amazon Prime Now expects it ; and also does it before it got delivered . Surely it should be a pop up once you have ordered Would you like to tip the driver ? ' after delivery . Some of the drivers have n't been as friendly , one even dropped it at the bottom of the stairs ( and thankfully got no tip ! ) <p> In terms of delivery ; you get a nice notification when your order is out for delivery ; you can even track the driver in real time which is brilliant ! If you ever got a delivery from DPD ; it 's a bit like that . You also get another notification when the driver is 10 minutes away so you can get ready . The shopping itself arrives in nice big brown paper bags ( very American ) ; which is great . It 's split into three ; Ambient , Chilled and Frozen ; and the trade hands you the bags and gets a signature ( if there 's Alcohol or other age restricted products ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who lives in an area serviced by Amazon Prime Now , I can honestly say it 's worth a try . I now use it extensively ; I do n't go to the big stores anymore . I combine Amazon Prime Now with my local Express store ( for things like Fresh Meats ) and I 've got everything I need . My food shopping bill is down a third ; I 'm getting much better service and I can order my shopping around my life ; instead of like with the traditional supermarkets where you do it around their old ' slot ' system . Right now Amazon are running a promotion for -10 off your first order over -30 ; so why not give it a go and let us know your thoughts below ? <p> Amazon normally has great prices for everything except food , well , there are exceptions but not that often . I personally would rather visit LIDL and Aldi due to the food and prices , plus , would rather just get it myself in this case . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Filter should be " Bilinear " unless you have issues with blurring in your downscaling . Bicubic and Lanczos are both supported , but will take additional processing.5 . FPS is recommended to be 30 . Note that 720p at 60 frames per second for some games will look better than low bitrate 1080p at 30 FPS.6 . Aero is recommended to be disabled only if you are using monitor or screen capture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layered windows , window capture , or game capture .

I do n't know if this is due to a system update or yet another sign that I 've done something wrong . <p> This may seem like a repeat of previous threads ( and I have read those threads ) but , since none of those threads have resulted in any progress of any kind for my situation , I have started this one because I clearly need help and my mounting frustration is becoming more than I can handle . <p> I think you can extract your profile / individual saves from the backup you currently have on your computer , then re inject them in to the USB drive once you have configured it for use on the Xbox 360 again . <p> Thank you for the prompt reply . I anticipate that these steps may lead to success , however , since nothing can be painless , this is what I 've come up with : <p> Step 2 goes down like this . I click Custom Backup Directory , I select the folder " Xbox360 " , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe this was supposed to be the desired effect as I 'm not seeing individual game data and can do absolutely nothing with this window or the files it 's displaying . <p> On the other hand if I do Custom Backup Directory and instead select the 360 formatted USB drive , I can navigate that successfully and I can even find a stand in save file I made . <p> Step 6 goes like this : I click Device Selector , the dialog box appears and says there are no devices to detect ( I did plug in the USB ) . Clicking refresh produces no results . <p> Interestingly enough , it 's not the drive I have trouble reading . It 's the " Xbox360 " folder containing the DataXXXX files that Party Buffalo does n't seem to be able to do anything with . I can see those files anywhere . Party Buffalo is not succeeding in reading those files as a collection of folders and game/system data . <p> Try USB Xtaf and go to File &gt; Open USB Manually and select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resides in on your computer and see if you have any luck with that . <p> If not you can upload the " Xbox360 " folder you have backed up to the Digiex FTP if you like and ill see if I have any luck extracting your save games from the files you have backed up . ( Do n't worry only Digiex staff members can download from the FTP , not the public ) . <p> Looks like I 'm going to try uploading the folder because I 've tried Xtaf and Party Buffalo , Horizon and Modio , and they 've all just thrown error after baffling error about not getting part of the path to the E drive and indexes out of range . It 's to the point where I 've spent so much time on this my eyes hurt , my head hurts , and I am starting to forget what the actual problem was in the first place . Maybe someone with a clear head would have better luck . <p> I would have uploaded them by now but I 'm having trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . It 's around 16 gb so the connection has been timing out before it can all be uploaded . Also I was getting a 550 Error from about 8 of the individual DataXXXX files due , apparently , to lack of permissions which I ca n't explain . Might you have some idea how to deal with this as well ? <p> After much delay I was finally able to try the above suggestion and had no success . There is a chance I misunderstood however . If I was supposed to delete the xbox360 folder and copy the folder to the drive root with a drive explorer like partybuffalo , then that 's not what I did . <p> I managed to use USB Xtaf to open up the drive and the backup folder , I found a Dragon 's Dogma save file at : Data LONG ... <p> ( For the sake of simplicity I 'll refer to the old save I 'm trying to restore as " A " , and the new save created as a point of reference as " B " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backup folder at that location and used it to replace file B which I created for a point of reference . I plugged the USB into the 360 , loaded the game and found myself in save file B. <p> After that I assumed it must have been the wrong file so I looked further through the drive and found another save file at : Data LONG ... <p> I replaced it with its equivalent from the backup folder and again the game loaded up save B despite the fact that I had just replaced both save files on the drive with their backup version equivalent which were last modified months before the B versions were created . <p> There is another Dragon 's Dogma file at : Data LONG ... but I 'm fairly certain that is the DLC downloaded from the disk as it is 1.41GB and this game 's save files are all 568KB . <p> It seems like nothing I changed had any effect and the xbox keeps managing to load a save that I was fairly certain I had deleted and replaced with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399236 @1399236/ <p> Having trouble working with DOSBox ? Not sure how to get your DVD drive to work ? Maybe this guide can help you to get it all to work . <p> First thing you do , obviously , is download DOSBox . You can get the latest version here : DOSBox , a x86 emulator with DOS You probably want to go for the first option , the Win32 installer . After installing you can run the program but you wo n't be able to run anything yet . First thing you do is mount some drives . <p> Mounting drives If you go to the DOSBox folder in the start menu you will see a couple of options , click the DOSBox.conf option . <p> ? <p> Notepad will open the file now . In this file you can configure all your DOSBox settings . If you scroll all the way to the bottom of the file you will see this : autoexec # Lines in this section will be run at startup . <p> ? <p> People familiar with MS DOS will know that the autoexec.bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on startup . Here we will enter some commands to mount the drives needed to run your DOS games . <p> The command to mount a drive is simply mount c c : . The first c is the drive letter you will be using for the drive in DOSBox , the c : part is where the drive is located in Windows . So for example if in Windows your hard drive is located at D : and you want to have it as let 's say H : in DOSBox , you enter mount h d : . Most people have their hard drive as C : in windows though and want it the same for DOSBox so you 'd be using mount c c : . <p> You can add as many hard drives as you want like this . Adding a CD-Rom or DVD-Rom drive works a little differently though . The first part works the same , if your DVD drive in windows is E : and you want it as D : in DOSBox you enter mount d e : . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add -t cdrom to the end of that line , so to finish it off it will look like this : mount d e : -t cdrom.Having added both a hard drive and a CD/DVD drive your DOSBox.conf file should look something like this : <p> This is all you need really to make your games work . If you have some MS DOS knowledge you will know the commands to run a random game . If not , keep reading . <p> DOS CommandsFor those of you who have not worked with MS DOS , I will explain some of the basic commands . When starting DOSBox you will notice it says Z : &gt; . The Z : is the drive you are in at the moment . Z : is a drive DOSBox uses so you wo n't get very far with that . To change drive , let 's say you want to go to the C drive , which is your hard drive if you have it set up like I did in the last step , simply type C : &lt;enter&gt; . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Z : has changed into C : . You can do the same to go to your DVD drive , just type D : &lt;enter&gt; . <p> Alright , now let 's say you want to play Commander Keen 5 . You have unpacked the game to a folder called Keen5 on your hard drive ( C : keen5 ) . First you go to your C : drive . Then you go into the keen5 folder . To do this you type cd keen5 &lt;enter&gt;. the cd command is used to enter a folder . If you want to get back out of the folder and back to just C : , you simply enter cd .. &lt;enter&gt; . <p> Now you should see C : KEEN5&gt; , which means you 're in the folder in which you unpacked Commander Keen 5 . Now to run the game . To run a game or program under DOS , you need to know the name of the file . If you do n't know there 's an easy way to check . To see the contents of the folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show all the files inside you folder you are in at that moment . <p> Sometimes , the number of files inside a folder is too large to fit on the screen though and you will only see the bottom part of the list . If this is the case , you type dir/p &lt;enter&gt; . This will pause the list every time the screen is full . If you want to see the next part of the list you simply press a key and you will see the next part . <p> Now to run a game you will have to run an executable file for the game . Usually , it 's an EXE , BAT or COM file . If you look at the picture of the file list , you can see at the left of the screen the names of the files . Next to that are the file extensions . This is what you need to be looking at . You will notice KEEN5E EXE , which is the executable file for this game . So to run the game you type keen5e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics to make any game run . Just change the folder and file names to those needed for the game you want to play and everything should work . <p> Extra stuffThere are some small things you might want to know when playing a game under DOSBox . When starting , DOSBox will start in a window , you can simply change to fullscreen by pressing ALT+ENTER . You can also make it launch in fullscreen mode by making a small change to the DOSBox.conf file . When opening DOSBox.conf , in the middle of the screen you will see a line which says fullscreen=false . To make DOSBox launch in fullscreen you change this to fullscreen=true . <p> Another thing you might want to know is the CPU cycles DOSBox uses . If you are playing a game and it 's running slower or faster than it should , it might help to play with the CPU cycles a bit . Pressing CTRL+F12 increases the cycles and CTRL+F11 decreases them . By playing with this a bit you might get a game to work more smoothly . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might notice it does n't work and it tells you it ca n't find the CD . There 's something you can do that might help , it does n't always work though . When mounting the CD/DVD drive , you can add something that will tell DOSBox what the CD is called . If you go to My Computer in windows , the CD will have a name . Let 's say our CD is called Keen5 . In DOSBox.conf you will see mount d e : -t cdrom . To this you add -label KEEN5 -ioctl . This will tell DOSBox the CD that is in the drive is in fact that CD . So now the line should look like this:mount d e : -t cdrom -label KEEN5 -ioctl , KEEN5 being the label of the CD , change this to the label or name of the CD you have in your drive . Do n't forget to remove this part again after playing the game , because when running other games from a CD Rom , they might not work if DOSBox thinks the Keens 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the basics to get a random DOS game to run . Hopefully you can get all your old games to work now . If your having any problems , just post a reply and I will try to help . ? <p> Did you know : You can easely load games without any commands if you have a shortcut to DOSBox on your desktop . Simply open an explorer window and drag an EXE file into the shortcut and DOSBox will open directly with that EXE ! <p> thank you for that . now i can confiqure the dosbox. but i tryed it slaz 's way because it was n't let me play the game but it said this program can not be run in dosbox mode . the game ive downloaded is alien trilogy ( love that game back in the day ) and it wont play on my laptop cause its a old game so tyred it in dosbox but that did n't  work . is there another way to play the game ? 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399240 @1399240/ <p> Recently when my PC performs LARGE file transfers between drives or during decompression , the PC will reboot . This has been really frustrating . At first I thought it was the RAM , but Memtest shows no errors , rearranging did n't make a difference either . <p> Then I remembered , a month or so back I had an incident where the CPU fan got blocked from turning , and it took me several reboots due to overheating to realise it . <p> Now I 'm thinking that this overheating issue caused problems with the in built memory controller in the CPU , and I do n't think that there is any damage to the motherboard or the RAM . What do you think ? I 'll be purchasing a replacement CPU in the next couple of weeks to confirm this issue , but right now I just want anothers opinion . <p> I had this problem before , and it was with a VIA network adaptor , is the large files going across the network to and from another pc ? 64320 @qwx264320 <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it set up where torrents/downloads download to one specific directory , then once that 's complete I move/copy the files to their corresponding folders , mainly on different drives .

I rebuilt Windows about 3 weeks ago from scratch and set up all the drivers , but you never know there may be something that Windows 7 does n't like . <p> I really hope that it 's not the CPU , as I 'd rather get a new video card for my PC and a motherboard for the kids PC , then I can upgrade their video card with my old one , but if it turns out to be a CPU issue , well there goes some of my plans . <p> OK , bit of an update . I ran Ubuntu 9.10 32 bit Live CD last night , it found a stack of bad sectors on one of my hard drives , which I am currently in the process of fixing . From within Ubuntu I moved the files on that drive across to one that had plenty of free space , and NO CRASHES ! Weird . <p> Well thinking that it may be this that 's causing my issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into Windows and ran a test . Prior to testing I also disabled reboot after System Failure , but it still reboot . <p> Here 's some of my current thinking : 1 . Issue is caused by a damaged core in the CPU 2 . Windows 7 default drivers ca n't handle what I do with my PC - However Gigabyte and ATI do n't put out drivers for the chipset , they suggest running the default ones from MS 3 . Something weird with Crossfire ? ? ? - I 'm going to test this tonight . 4 . Bad SATA ports ? - Thanks , Nutter , I 'll be testing this as well fortunately I have 2 free plus the eSATA ports I can use to test . 5 . Bad motherboard , possibly damaged by the overheating issue that I think is the root cause of this whole annoying nightmare . <p> i still would n't rule out overheating , especially if you have 5 hard drives in your PC. if you have a regular house fan ( a large fan that you can plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there while transferring the files . <p> also , do n't  use the fact that the files transferred using ubuntu to rule out a hardware problem . windows vista and windows 7 have some sort of ass-backwards file transferring systems . large files that take 5-6 minutes on XP take me 15-20 min to transfer on vista/7. your power supply can also overheat ( by itself , with nothing wrong with your other hardware ) , which would be a possible cause , if in fact you 're machine is overheating . i 've had it happen several times . <p> i still would n't rule out overheating , especially if you have 5 hard drives in your PC. if you have a regular house fan ( a large fan that you can plug in ) , open your case and have it blow in there while transferring the files . <p> also , do n't  use the fact that the files transferred using ubuntu to rule out a hardware problem . windows vista and windows 7 have some sort of ass-backwards file transferring systems . large files that take 5-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vista/7. 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Overheating now is n't the issue I do n't think , I run SpeedFan on the system to keep an eye on the temps , nothing ever gets above 45c . <p> Now I can use a free " file copy " application to move data around the PC as needed , which works , the real issue comes when I need to decompress large files . <p> Actually come to think about it , this morning I was trying to " reformat " the bad drive when Windows crashed . Rebooted the system , logged back in , went and had a smoke , came back and the system had crashed again . Not sure what happened there , and checking now remotely , it looks like it 's been on since . <p> I 'm also going to run a anti-malware scan tonight and see if maybe I missed something somewhere as well . <p> Not to rule out hardware entirely . But if things worked correctly in ubuntu , it very well could be a software issue . Windows falls over itself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get random freezes and stutters , over 16k of bad sectors . I would n't be surprised if Vista/7 had nasty behavior on corruption . So I reckon running chkdsk on a few of your volumes might help , it 's surprisingly fast if you do n't run thorough checking , chkdsk /F /X should be good enough . Plus , it never hurts . <p> Also , the chipset being damaged sounds feasible , these normally have poor cooling anyway , and I ca n't imagine they handle well in a system that 's overheating , so it may have sustained damage . If a CPU was at all damaged you 'd get some more hardcore problems . <p> I 've still not fully ruled out hardware , but the things look to be pointed more and more at a software issue . <p> Number 1 - running Windows XP under a VM and performing file transfers and decompressing files works fine . The only thing up in the air here is the fact that data is being manipulated over a virtual network and not physically on the PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only this time the VM is Ubuntu 9.10 . Both VM 's are 32 bit , which may be question number 3 .... <p> Number 3 - ran hardware diagnostics within Windows 7 , physical box/non-VM , using SiSoft Sandra and all hardware reported back as no errors . Though the app recommended turning off Acoustic Management on the drives . <p> Next steps : <p> 1 . Disconnect OS drive and install Vista on either a portable drive or on one of the physical drives in the box to see if it suffers the same issues . <p> 2 . If the above shows issues , will try XP , might as well ... <p> 3 . If 1 and 2 have the same problem , I found an older CPU ( AM2 Sempron 3400+ single core ) to test with . <p> Also , the chipset being damaged sounds feasible , these normally have poor cooling anyway , and I ca n't imagine they handle well in a system that 's overheating , so it may have sustained damage . If a CPU was at all damaged you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , you 're probably right about the CPU , but as for cooling for the chipset , have a look at the cooling on the motherboard : <p> Plus my HSF has a duct that directs air over the top most section of the chipset heat sink . <p> Your chipset should definitely be fine . And those testing methods sound perfect , you 're well on your way to a fixed issue by the looks of things . As you 're busy testing software issues and fixes , try updating the chipset drivers , if it 's nForce , which it might be because of the two PCI-E16x , get them from the nvidia website instead .

@@21399258 @1399258/ <h> Convert DVR-MS to Xvid and remove commercials using freeware tools . <p> Background If you record TV on your pc using Windows Media Centre the recorded TV will be saved as a DVR-MS file . DVR-MS files are big , depending on the quality of the TV broadcasted in your area an hour of digital tv will take up 1.5gb to 2gb+ of hard drive room . Converting DVR-MS to Xvix files massively reduces the file size , many standalone DVD players can also play Xvid back . <p> Let 's begin First we will use a program called DVR Edit to cut the commercials out of your recorded tv . <p> Load DVR Edit and open the file you wish to convert <p> Looking at the screenshot below use the slider to find the start of the program <p> At the start of the program click the button to mark the start , now browse through the program until the first set of commercials come on then mark the end , you have now created a segment . Now scroll through the commercials , when they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the program . You should now have segments for all the parts of the program as can be seen below . <p> Now go file save as and save the segments of the program somewhere . <p> Click ok to the attributes window that opens , the cut segments will then save . <p> You now have a DVR-MS file containing just your program , all the commercials have been removed . <p> Now load up DVR-MS To MPEG converter , this can be downloaded here Browse for the DVR-Ms file you saved in the previous step and click convert <p> When you click convert a command prompt window will popup , let this run , it will close when the DVR-MS file has been converted to an mpg file . <p> Now load up Auto GK , this is the program we will use to convert the mpg file we obtained from the previous step to an Xvid encoded avi file . Select the mpg file as the input , auto GK should automatically show an AVI file as the output . <p> The file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , these are the sizes i would recommend depending on the length of the program . <p> Now click advanced settings in step 4 , for widescreen programs I 've found fixed width of 640 works best with 128KB VBR MP3 audio . The codec you want to be using is Xvid . <p> Once you have done the settings here click ok , then add job . If this is the only file you want to convert click start . <p> Various different programs will appear in the taskbar such as VirtualDub and Lame , that 's noting to worry about ... both VirtualDub and Lame are encoding programs for audio/video that Auto GK uses to encode Xvid Files <p> AutoGK will do a 2pass encode , once both encodes have finished you will be notified in the AutoGK log window <p> It 's hard to say howlong the encoding will take , it all depends on the speed of your processor . As you can see from the above image it took 17 minutes to do the first encode on my Core2Duo which is overclocked to 2.93ghz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encode . <p> I have included a DVR-MS and Xvid sample of the encoding I did to create this guide . The DVR-MS file is 29.8MB where as the Xvid file is only 10.8MB big , if you watch both samples you will see that there is little difference in quality . I think its defiantly worth encoding your Recorded TV to Xvid , for very little quality loss you saving you 're self a lot of disc space . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399261 @1399261/ <p> Note : This map pack includes the Blastacular map pack and the Halo 2 1.5 update released on April 17th 2007 . These are not included on the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack disc you could used to purchase in shops . This is a user modified disc created by feudalnate with the additional map pack and 1.5 update included . This is the only way to install the Blastacular Map Pack and 1.5 update on a flashed Xbox 360 , as it is no longer possible to download them off Xbox Live , since Xbox Live for the classic Xbox has closed down . <p> Q : What is this ? A : This is an edited version of the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack game <p> Q : Why call it homebrew ? A : I called it homebrew because calling it Custom , Modded , or Edited may give the indication that it does n't offer the retail data - which it does . <p> Q : Wait , homebrew ? For a retail Xbox 360 ? A : Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited the main executable ( default.xbe ) has not been tampered with and Microsofts ' digital signature is still valid , thus allowing the executable to be launched on retail consoles . <p> Q : How is this possible ? A : By dumping the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack image , I found that the default.xbe ( original Xbox executable ) was really the CDX menu system by Microsoft . The CDX menu was designed for kiosk style discs ( ie : demos , videos , content , etc. all-in-one disc ) and is totally configurable from external files and the executable never needs to be touched to offer something completely different . <p> This meant by editing certain files and adding the necessary content , I was able to edit the game to offer whatever I pleased . All this is possible because the executable file is cryptographically valid and external files are n't checked for validity . A mistake on Microsofts ' part but a benefit for those that understand how CDX works . <p> On another note , although it would say Halo 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executable and its files could be used to install ANY original Xbox content on retail Xbox 360s as long as all the required files for the particular DLC are present . <p> Q : Does this really install all 4 of the map packs ! ? A : Yes , it really does . <p> Q : What title update does this install ? A : The latest update , which is version 1.5 ( aka Auto-Update 5 ) <p> Q : Does this contain all the content from the original Halo 2 : Multiplayer Map Pack game as well ? A : No . The exclusive videos , E3 videos , and sound test have all been removed . Only the 4 map packs , title update , and Bungies ' game type variants are included . <p> Q : So what are the requirements for using this ? A : A few things are required : <p> 1 ) The original Xbox emulator for Xbox 360 ( most consoles have this pre-installed or have installed it via a system update ) 2 ) iXtreme 1.6 firmware ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support playback of burnt original Xbox games , sorry you 're out of luck ) 3 ) Have ran Halo 2 atleast one time ( needed to create the content folders to store the maps and update ) <p> Q : Will I get banned booting this on my console ! ? ! A : You run the same risk as you do booting any other burnt game . <p> Q : Is this stealth patched ? A : Yes ! Because I ripped the original game with my 0800 drive , the image is patched with the proper SS(v2) and DMI sectors and because the default.xbe has not been touched , the sectors are valid for the executable <p> Q : I ca n't run this through ABGX360 arrrrrrggggggggg ! ! ! A : Nope . <p> Q : Why do this ? A : Because I can . Halo 2 has always been my favorite game and has been the most enjoyable multiplayer experience on a console for me and I 'm sure many people share the same feelings towards it . <p> So why do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mainly , for personal use , and for those that still enjoy Halo 2 over system link emulators to this date . Also , at the time of this post , this image ( ISO ) is the ONLY way to get ALL the map packs and latest update on a retail Xbox 360 . <p> Thank you for your post and the time you took to make this package . I just recently dusted off my Xbox ( original ) and brought it into work for some fun when we have downtime--and this looks like the perfect thing to have ! <p> Unfortunately I can not get the disc to work , and it may be due to a bad DVD-ROM drive . IMGBurn completes and verifies successfully ( with layer break 1913776 ) , but when I insert the disc into my Xbox it comes up as empty . My DVD-ROM can still read retail games , but no other media seems to work . I have tried with Memorex and Verbatim DVD+R DL ( again with layer break 1913776 ) to no avail . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and mount the image and transfer it to my Xbox via ethernet . I 've tried Qwix , UltraISO , Xiso , C-Xbox Tool , and a few others with no luck . Some say the image is empty , others just say there only exists a VIDEOTS folder . <p> Is there any course of action I can take to get this release onto my Xbox ? If it makes any difference , I was looking to get this package for the additional game version update , the Blastacular Pack , and the additional game modes . <p> Sorry if this is a stupid question but I 've never really been knowledgeable about these kinds of things . A short time back I stumbled across the Portal 2 DLC page but that said you had to have a JTagged console so I ca n't download that DLC to either of mine . How do you flash a 360 though ? <p> Halo 2 is one of my favorite games of all time and I desperately want all of the maps to play on . <p> The Jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Xbox 360 console . That would be a good starting point , you probably would need to buy some hardware to enable to flash a console today however . <p> So i downloaded the file and burn with imgburn with the layerbreak 1913766 and all is OK , the console play the disc and i proceeded to install first the update and them the map packs , when i put my copy of halo 2 is not updated and the new maps aren-t . So wich was the mistake ? Can you help me ? <p> I have a Xbox 360 slim with LT 3.0 . I burn this image with imgburn at 8X in a verbatim disc with layerbreak 1913766 and I play in my console and run , so first install the update , choose english and finish with actualization suceeded or something like that , then install the map packs in order and when I put my copy of halo 2 to play the number 1.5 is n't and the maps less . Thanks for answer me . <p> I think that the problem is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folder Halo 2 sized 555MB ( only the maps ) but when i select the folder found in to a game data with 561MB are 6MB between them , the 6MB are the update . I have a question , i need to have installed the update 1.1 before to install the 1.5 because i do n't have this update . I tried to find the original disc converted with the update 1.1 but nothing . It 's frustating . Do you have it ? <p> Yes i played halo2 before in Xlink kai and when downloaded this image and burned was recognized that i had a copy of halo 2 and i could install the update and the maps , Otherwise it went wrong when updating and could not get the maps either because he told me that in this console you had not I pull halo 2 before , I know because I took out my profile up and I am here to load it again with the hope that she recognized me the update . I do n't know what else to do . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i did n't create the disc ) do you have a Jtagged or RGH hacked Xbox 360 ? We have installers created by a member here which work perfectly for modified consoles . <p> I 'm not really sure what else to suggest unfortunately ( i did n't create the disc ) do you have a Jtagged or RGH hacked Xbox 360 ? We have installers created by a member here which work perfectly for modified consoles. 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Hey if I hotswap the normal map pack with the mod on a unflashed 360 would that work ? ? ? ? <p> I 'm little tired and maybe I 'll get an email replay later . But is this possible on an un-flashed 360 ? When I was re-reading it , I kept reading " retail " . Or if I had a modded 360 , would I be able to copy the data to my 360 memory card/flash drive and then move it over to my regular 360 ? I want all these maps and I want them all on one console . <p> It 's not sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> Xbox Classic content ca n't be moved to a memory card , its tied to the console it 's installed on . Even putting your hard drive in another 360 then back in the 360 it was installed on corrupts the content , so you have to re install it . <p> If you have a flashed DVD drive capable of playing burned games then you can use this , this is easier than doing a full hardware hack such as the Jtag or RGH hack . If you do have a Jtag / RGH 360 then you can also use this , however using the installers by Harcroft would be the easier option as you do n't have to burn any discs . <p> Softmod an Xbox Classic ? it 's still well worth having a Classic Xbox in your collection if you ask me . They can be modded with an exploitable game and memory card , so you do n't even need to open them up . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Rename it to " XBSlink " &amp; put the folder on your desktop . <p> Once all that is done open up terminal . Now enter : " cd **35;2439;TOOLONG " Press enter . Now your in the directory of XBSlink . Now enter this : " sudo mono XBSlink.exe " It will now ask you for your password . That is the same password you use to authenticate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This worked without issue for me a week ago , both on my MBP and Mac Mini . Tried to fire it up this week and XBS keeps crashing and giving error messages in both Terminal and XBS . Have deleted and reinstalled numerous time without any luck . Any idea of why it worked last week and not now ? Will include ss 's of error messages if needed . <p> Got it up and running finally ( error on my end ) , but here 's the issue I now have . <p> I get extreme lag when joining other servers , and others get that lag when joining my created match ( though I have none in this case ) . Noticed these error messages in Terminal when running XBS today . <p> *for some reason the forum wo n't let me post these error messages from Terminal . Will PM them to you* <p> I 'm using a Time Capsule as my router , with the Mac Mini hardwired to it . Good connection speeds from my ISP , 20 down and 6 up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ISP , does n't have the lag issues . But he 's using a different router , which would make you think the issue is with my Time Capsule . But I 'm not sure and am hoping for some ideas . <p> From what i can see in the error message is that there is something wrong with your connection to your internet ( network settings ) . Did you change anything or did you update to the new version of XBSlink ? Anyway , you could also try to use XLink Kai , they have a mac client . <p> I just played on XBSLink a few minutes ago . Everything is working on my part . Dit you install the latest Mono Runtime &amp; Mono app ? You can also install the Mac version of Xlink Kai to get the libcap library . <p> BTW , ignore everything that Terminal is saying once XBSLink has started running . It should be running perfectly . And just one more thing , hosting a game on Mac is a no go ( it will lag pretty bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a better way to run XBSLink on Mac , then please let me know in this topic . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

For many countries , the catalog in Xbox Music is double the size of Spotify , as well as being cheaper than an Spotify Premium account ( with the option of further discounts if you pay a year upfront " in the United Kingdom for example its -89 for an Xbox Music Pass for a year , vs -120 for Spotify ! ) . <p> Sadly however , while there is native Applications for Windows , iPhone/iPad , Android , Windows Phone and Xbox , Microsoft as of yet have n't yet made a version for Mac OSX .

I got the " CX " due to the larger cache &amp; to try since no one anywhere seems to mention the CX drive also being hackable . <p> I 've doubled checked ive done everything correctly , but what you have on one of your screen grabs differs from what I see . Where you say " You will then be asked if you also want to create partition 0/2/3 ( HddHackrv1.30 will not display any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i do n't  get this at all .. it just skips it and goes to " you drive should now be hacked , congratulations ! " But the drive does n't  show up on the xbox . <p> ive tried doing the partition before the flash , after the flash , nor doing it at all .. using Data Lifeguard ( no issues , its a brand new drive from your list ) to test and wipe the drive and start again . <p> The only thing that i can see that differs , is i do n't  have the options you mention for my BIOS " ensure the SATA operation mode is set to ATA or disable AHCIdepending on the options you have .

I have already made a HQ profile for movies and DVD 's I have on my HDD based on the settings contained in a previous thread here but my problem is that I have still some older TV stuff on that I want to convert for storage and viewing on my TV from a HDD through my Blu-ray player . The normal setting does n't really do it very well " it is blocky where a similar colour or shade covers a large area and also a little fizzy , as most of my stuff fis sci-fi there is a mlot of this . <p> What I really need is a profile that is better than the normal ( maybe on par with MeGUI Spline setting or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I want to make them as MVK with AC3 Passthru and chapter markers , constant bitrate and 400MB is size but they are all the parameters I know about . I would obviously not mind waiting longer for the conversions than the really quick time taken on Normal ' . I could do them in the HQ profile but they take ages for little gain considering the source . Can anyone please advise settings for a medium or medium-high ' profile for this sort of content ? <p> I could post them up for when i 'm home if you like , both profiles do take ages to encode stuff . However the 480p one has worked fine for some TV shows i 've encoded. 64320 @qwx264320 <p> That 480p one you made for DVD 's would be great if it 's not too much trouble , What I really need is a better quality than ' normal ' would give be as it leaves blocking on the particular famous sci-fi series I need to do ( 4:3 aspect ratio 720 x 550 encoded size ) . But also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal ' preset would take bun nowhere as long as it would take to do an HQ one ( for DVD movies and Blu-ray rips ) , which I got from this site . They also need de-interlacing but as I understand it the Decomb function will do this selectively although I can find no explanations for the setting choices ' Fast ' and ' Bob ' . I am currently doing a test episode to see if de-interlacing using Decomb actually works <p> Any advice you can give would be great . <p> My media is all converted from my own DVD 's , I need to get shelf-space desperately . I do n't bother with my movie collections but the series take up an awful lot of space . I also do it because I am disabled and find it difficult sometimes to keep getting up and down to change disks . I playback from an external HDD connected to my Sony Blu-ray Player . <p> Ive been encoding TV series to set file sizes , 550MB for a 45min ish 480p TV episode has produced great results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff looks great , i probably could get away with doing them smaller however the quality / bitrate is great and seems to be better than encodes you see uploaded on the net , with very similar file sizes . <p> Have a play about , i have mainly used the 720p settings . Only encoded one or two random episodes with the 480p settings , however i was happy with the results . 64318 @qwx264318 <p> Thyankks InsaneNutter . I 'll give tthe 480p one a go straight away and will let you know the results I get . I was expecting it to take a long time , but at the moment it says a total of half an hour for a 45 minute episode of TNG ... that is great ! I tried with some settings yesterday and the resulting MVK was very jittery , even when someone was walking diagonally across the screen , I am really hoping your profile will sort this out . <p> In the end it actually took just 32 minutes . It was a superb picture but still jittered . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlacing because if I make the same episode with MeGUI it is perfect as there is a de-interlacing analyses on there , in the case of TNG it is Partially Interlaced , Varying Field Order and Yadif used to correct ... but , and it is a very big but ... for some reason , despite successfully doing Enterprise , TOS , DS9 and Voyager and a myriad of other series with MeGUI , all U 'S series from R2 DVD 's , TNG has decided to lock up my BD player when I skip forward or back to a chapter , or even FF or REW . It makes no sense . I know how to do these given the amount of conversions I 've done but for some reason the chapters and skips will not work on this particular series . I never checked if they worked with Vidcoder because of the jittering problem . As a test I made a conversion of episode 1 of ' Space Above and Beyond ' with the 420p settings , this did not require de interlacing and was superb so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have yet to do . But if de interlacing is needed it seems that I will have to use MeGUI . <p> In the meantime - and as I am the kind of person with little patience for technology as a whole , and also as a result of now not having a full converted set of the Star Trek franchise because of the indexing problems with TNG I have now , regretfully , deleted all the other seasons and will keep my DVD 's on shelf . I do not like missing series from an otherwise full set . <p> As for my system and processor , My processor is older than is yours , I suspect you have the i5 with the graphics capability , the new type .

I have halo 4 original game disc and i want to rip that and turn it into an . ISO file . I use GOD2ISO program which converts all " Game on demand " files into ISO files and then i can put the iso files onto my hard drive and insert it into my XKEY which is a virtual drive loader or ODDE loader made for the xbox 360 . <p> Can someone please help me to do that ? Basically what i have done is , 1 . Insert the original game disc into my xbox 360. 2 . Press the " X " button on my controller then click on " install game button " . I choose to install on my 32gb usb stick . 3 . Afterwards , i use USB xTAF on my windows 7 laptop to extract all those . DAT files that i have on usb drive and put them on my desktop in a folder named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the " data folder " not the cache . I choose to extract the " title file " which is a few kilobytes . Once i choose that file it automatically extracts the rest . dat files for me. 4 . After extracting the files off my usb onto the folder on my desktop i click on " GOD2ISO " . It launches and opens up . 5 . I select my GAME ON DEMAND title file which is a few kilobytes and again it finds all . DAT files for me. 6 . I i click on start process and afterwards i have a ISO disc image with a long name . If i load up xkey dvd menu , it will fail and ill see errors . I am unable to rip this game using this method described above . So please can you ansswere this question : <p> - Will installing game from original disc from my xbox 360 dvd drive onto a usb drive make an exact full copy of the disc or will it only install limited files ? If it is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JTAG OR MODCHIP HACK , then would i need the disc in the xbox 360 dvd drive to execute the game using the xkey anyways or not ? If the iso file can not be read by the xkey then how to launch it using the method above ? I will post pictures if people ask . Just tell me . I 'm not sure if this is correct way of ripping games . I think that my games can be riped via the dvd drive attatched to my desktop but the tools needed for the CK3 probe lite and pro versions are too expensive and i think getting a desktop pc is too much work . I own a laptop and i need a method of ripping games without attatching a dvd drive taken from a xbox console into my pc . Actually i can boot win 7 via usb stick and attatch the xbox dvd drive via sata cable to my internat laptop hard drive bay and try that .

You will need a DS flashcard for this , however flashcards are around $10 these days . ( You do n't need to mod your DS in any way , put the flashcard in the DS and power it on ) <p> You would simply put GBA Backup Tool on the flash card , the then power on the DS , loading GBA Backup Tool from the flashcards menu . <p> After place the GBA game in the DS and you can backup the save from the GBA game to the Micro SD card you have in your DS flashcard . You can also restore a GBA save you have copied to your DS flashcard too . <p> When you log in tick remember me , otherwise if you do n't  load a page on the forum for a while you will be logged out . <p> I 've never actually seen an E-Reader in person for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . If you can explain sometime that would be great ! You must have obviously had a lot of Pokemon events in your area over the years then ? We 've never had any around here , although do get some WiFi ones in games shops now which is something ! <p> I only used an E-reader once before I bought mine . A friend of mine from middle school , an older guy I knew had one and lent it to me . I scanned in some Pokemon cards and returned it . I did n't have much use for it . Think of it like a credit card swiper at a store . You can scan in Pokemon cards with barcodes , E-Reader cards an that 's it I think . I have the rare Eon Ticket E-Reader card . You need 2 GBA 's , a Link Cable , an E-Reader , the Card and a game to even use the thing . I do n't think a whole lot of people bought the E-Reader because the whole idea was poorly thought up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Eon Ticket basically scans an Eon Ticket into your Ruby or Sapphire cart , allowing you to take a boat from Lilycove City to Southern Island . If you 're on Ruby or Sapphire , it allows you to catch the opposite Pokemon of the roaming legendary . ( Latios/Latias ) at LV.50 , holding Soul Dew . The roaming legendaries in gen 3 are all messed up and have terrible IV 's . They 're all 0-3 I think . In Emerald version , they ask you to pick Red/Blue to be the roaming legendary and the opposite will go to Southern Island . If you mix records with a Ruby/Sapphire that has the ticket , it will send one to your Emerald . I think you can send 3 of them per save file . I 'm not sure if you can send them to other Ruby/Sapphire carts . Emerald Can not pass them on . <p> It 's a damn shame really . English and Japanese Ruby/Sapphire can not mix records and they ca n't mix records with Emerald . But the English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an Action replay code to get Southern Island on the Japanese Emerald but it would be nice to do it on Ruby/Sapphire as well . <p> There 's a Japanese E-reader card for secret base dolls of all 3 of the Regis . If you could somehow print it off and get it to work , you could scan them into an English game by mixing records . There 's a man who is generated in Mauville city 's Pokemon Center based on your I 'd number . It has to end in a certain number . If he 's there , you can trade secret base decorations with him , mix records and he is sent to the other game with the items you gave him . You could use that to get the regi dolls in your English games using legit means but that card is damn near impossible to find . Ther <p> In Japan there were E-Reader cards for Fire Red and Leaf Green as well as Colosseum . I do n't know much about them . I have a Japanese friend and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sometime . I have some of the Japanese Ruby and Sapphire E-reader cards already but not an E-Reader Plus from Japan to use them . <p> I have all of the English cards and even a couple sealed packs . There were 3 different English packs . I have 2 sealed copies of " Freezing Ray " . They 're not exactly common so I snagged them while I could . They scan an Enigma Berry into your save game if you use certain cards . You can then grow the Enigma berry or scan in other berries and grow them and they take the place of the Enigmas Berry . Most of the E-Reader cards take days . I know of an exploit though . One of them only takes 4 hours . Just scan it in , grow a bunch and then just scan in one of the other berries to replace it . There 's also a house in Mossdeep city with a man standing in front of a door in the back of it . If you scan in trainer cards , you can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or money is rewarded . <p> Just last night I purchased a 3DS flashcard so hopefully when that arrives , I 'll be able to backup my save and add events to the save easier . I 'll also be able to do several more things . I can teleport anybody to Navel Rock or Birth Island in Fire Red/Leaf Green , scan in an Enigma Berry or the other berries* or an Eon Ticket into Ruby or Sapphire and activate every single event ticket in the English and Japanese Emerald Versions . Really , the only one I ca n't get the actual tickets in , is Fire Red/.Leaf Green . I tried a teleporting code on those games and it worked . Everything else I 've tried over the years has failed and I 've put dozens of hours of work into it . <p> I can make videos of most of this stuff if you need me to show you a demonstration . I have a decent amount of hardware and resources . <p> I 'm pleased to announce we have a nice update to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HaxAras was kind enough to send me his Pokemon Box save game , however due to his copy of the game been NTSC and mine been PAL I had a lot of trouble using his save game with a PAL copy of the game , even after changing the region of the save to PAL . My PAL Pokemon Box would read the save game , however when saving would corrupt both the Pokemon Box and GBA save of the connected game . <p> After many hours of messing about the only way I could over come this was to boot a NTSC copy of Pokemon Box an anonymous person hooked me up with . I was able to boot this on a PAL Wii using the homebrew app Nintendont . Nintendont ignores region restrictions on GameCube games and will happily load them regardless . <p> For game settings on Nintendont " Native Control " should be on , this allows the GBA to GameCube link cable to be recognised , memory card emulation can be on or off , however if off you can use a real GameCube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done this I had no trouble linking my UK ( Euro ) Pokemon Fire Red to an NTSC version of Pokemon Box . <p> Something else to keep in mind : When linking a GameCube game loaded with Nintendont to the GBA only the official GBA to GameCube link cable will work , 3rd party ones do not work with Nintendont , so I ended up having to purchase an official one from Ebay . <p> The following Pokemon have been added since the previous version of this save : Box 11 - Japanese Event Pokemon : <p> Ageto Celebi <p> HO-OH ( JPN Mattle ) <p> Berry Glitch Fix Zigzagoon Ruby ( 1x ) and Sapphire ( 2x ) <p> Box 12 - American Event Pokemon : <p> Wishmaker Jirachi ( 2x Normal and 1x Shiny ) <p> HO-OH ( Mattle ) <p> Berry Glitch Fix Zigzagoon ( Sapphire 1x ) <p> Box 10 ( HaxAras ) : <p> The two Jirachi 's have been leveled up so I have left them in this box as we have many untouched ones . <p> Chikorita , Cyndaquil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm what these are from with him . <p> Various legendry birds are also in this box , i need to confirm where these are from . <p> The eggs in box 9 are 2x Skitty - When hatched , you will be the OT and it will have Payday. 2x Zigzagoon - When hatched , you will be the OT and it will have Extremespeed 2x Swablu - When hatched , you will be the OT and it will have False Swipe 1x Pichu - When hatched , you will be the OT and it will have Surf . <p> The two Jirachi 's have been leveled up so I have left them in this box as we have many untouched ones . <p> Chikorita , Cyndaquil and Totodile have HaxAras as the OT , I need to confirm what these are from with him . <p> Various legendry birds are also in this box , i need to confirm where these are from . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> One of the leveled up Jirachi is Wishmaker . The other is Japanese and I was n't sure if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't very common , I threw it in . <p> The 3 Latias and the Latios are all from the Southern Island event . They should be Untouched , LV 50 and be holding Soul Dew . One of them is Japanese . <p> The Japanese Ho-oh and Lugia are from the Navel Rock event . <p> Chikorita , Cyndaquil and Totodile are from Pokemon XD : Gale of Darkness . It was incredibly tedious to obtain them . You have to clear 100 floors of Mt.Battle just like I did in the English and Japanese versions of Colosseum . When you get to the top , you get your choice of a starter with Frenzy Plant , Blast Burn and Hydro Cannon respectively . I 'm not sure if you can breed them on like egg moves but if you want them and do n't want to clear 300 floors of Mt.Battle , they 're there for you . <p> I retrieved a very outdated copy of my Pokemon Box save to get these events for the thread . Later I will be sending Insane Nutter another save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the Berry Fix Zigzagoon . Because , why not ? <p> I 'll be throwing in my Master Rank contest team and 100 win Battle Tower team . I 'll leave it up to Insane Nutter on whether or not to include them . While not events , some people might have a use for them and he could toss them in the box named after me , if he feels like doing so . <p> Thanks for the info HaxAras , with all that in mind I have updated the save again , this time better organising the Boxs . I have also added more info to the original post based on what you have provided . <p> The master rank contest team and battle tower team could be interesting additions , it gives people some good Pokemon to use if they wish to attempt it themselves . <p> Thanks again for your contributions , I do feel we have advanced the save a lot and preserved a lot of GEN3 event Pokemon . <p> During my search for more GEN3 event Pokemon I came across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archived the majority of the GEN3 event Pokemon , you can view the now offline site on web archive : LONG ... as the files are so small you can even download the Pokemon . The problem is their useless for GEN3 as have been imported in to GEN4 then extracted from a save and shared online after that . <p> It does however show their potentially a lot more GEN3 event Pokemon we can obtain , presuming People actually have them on GEN3 save files . <p> Excuse me . I just really wan na ask if this save files are legit/legal ? I was reading your post the day after you posted this , because I really wanted to have a legit/legal legendary pokemons in my Emerald I will be visiting this site day after day just to know your answers if this are legits . Because I just read their is an Egg contains pichu that has surf move ? Does pichu can really learn surf ? That 's why I just wan na ask I 'll be waiting for your replies sir thankyou <p> Pokemon Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves when you deposit certain amounts of Pokemon. 0 , 100 , 500 , and 1,499 I think it is for all of them . Pichu is 1,499 and by far , the hardest to get . To answer the question , yes . It 's entirely legit . I 've actually sent Insane Nutter another update to my save with even more Pokemon so you might want to hold off on downloading it until he has time to update it again . <p> All the Pokemon in this save are legit to the best of my knowledge , i 've even gone to the effort of providing extensive information in the first post about where each event Pokemon came from . You can confirm their all legit yourself by looking on the Bulbapedia event pages I have posted links to . <p> Just a quick update : <p> I have been working on getting a Jirachi we do n't  currently have yet in the save. , It 's the " CHANNEL " Jirachi from the PAL version of Pokemon Channel . I finally managed to get it after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to mess about some more and use an earlier version of my own Ruby save . As I had got the Jirachi from the US bonus disc it would n't let me obtain the channel one . <p> The end result is here which i just got a few minutes ago and dumped my save game , I now need to trade it to the current version of the save here and add the Pokemon HaxAras has sent me in his Pokemon Box save via PM <p> Great news on my end ! While I do n't have much more to offer at the moment , I got a new SD card ans my 3DS R4 cars is working perfectly . I 'm playing a Pokemon Black Rom and I 'll be downloading the GBA backup tool later . No more pestering Insane Nutter or having him go through extra work for me . Seriously though , it 's been very appreciated ! Once I get the backup took working , I 'll also be able to add working tickets to peoples ( English ) Ruby , Sapphire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves . <p> I currently have a save somewhere that has a Deoxys , Berry Fix Lonoone and Zigzagoon . I need to find it though . I have a LOT of backed up GameCube saves and no form of organization for them at all . I 'll try to get on it soon . <p> Note : HaxArs has contributed a box full of these , however due to the Fire Red save game we have been using been quite full I have only added a male and female of them with the Ruby and Sapphire as the OT . I might put them all in a separate save game if their is demand for it . That way we can keep the majority of the Pokemon in other box 's in this save , although there not event it 's clear a significant amount of time has gone in to obtaining , evolving and training them . I also think they will be useful for people playing GEN 3 games today and have no friends playing anymore to trade with / complete the Pokedex . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's my update to the save . So I gained access to a save editor and I 'm edited the Fire Red save contents a little . I only edited my own Pokemon . I 'm changed the I 'd of my contest Pokemon and Battle Frontier Pokemon to my current Emerald save and fixing the EV 's of my Battle Frontier team . That was more of a personal thing . My old Emerald save was a female trainer with the name " May " and I have no idea why . I hated that my Pokemon did n't have me as the OT . I 'm remaking my gen 3 and 6 living Pokedexes just so all my Pokemon will have me as the OT . <p> I changed the Milotic in the Party 's OT from Bulldog to HaxAras since it was originally my Milotic . It came from a really old Ruby save of mine . I sent Insane Nutter my Pokemon Box save in 2014 or 2015 and the updated version recently so that explains how Milotic found it 's way to the save . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm asking the people involved here for their opinions . Later on I could re-edit the save to set the Venusaur to LV.70 and the 2 Jirachi in the HaxAras box to LV.5 . Just before I typed that , I realized I could clone them . For anybody who thinks setting their levels to their default levels makes them fake , then you can download the leveled up ones . For those , like me who prefer UT Pokemon and still see them as legit , I 'll put UT clones of the 3 in the HaxAras box . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

@@21399317 @1399317/ <h> How to Backup the Tomato Firmware 's Bandwidth Logs ( Rstats ) to a FTP Server <p> If your router is running the Tomato firmware you will probably be aware the router can log your bandwidth usage , the bandwidth log could be useful if you have a limit each month or just want to keep track of your internet usage . <p> In its default configuration the router will lose the logs when its powered down or re started , this guide will show you how to automatically backup the logs to a remote ftp server every 12 hours . <p> Before you begin you will need some ftp space on a remote server , if you have some free webspace on your isp 's server this will be perfect . <p> You can test this works by surfing the net for a bit or downloading something , then use the shutdown button on the routers web interface . It should upload the bandwidth logs then download them again when the router re starts . ( it can take a minute or two after the router loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take no credit for creating the script used in this guide , I found it on a random website after spending a long while looking for a solution to backup the logs to a remote server . <p> I was just working on doing this the other day . Nimrod was asking why was I even bothering and to just use some program . I could n't find anything useful on the net . Though tonight I was searching on Google very hard for a good script and I was amazed at what site I finally was returned to ... DIGIEX ! ! ! I 'm glad you already have a guide for this . <p> Quick qustion though , is there anyway to change it to back up sooner then every 12 hours ? What if your router dies , electric dies , a tornado come through and you want that data to be preserved . <p> I have a ftp server running on my PC at the moment InsaneNutter but do you think it would be better to back this data up to my webspace here ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote server such as your Digiex webspace . A dedicated server should be online 24/7 , at some point your pc is not going to be on when your router wants to backup the bandwidth logs . ( especially as you like installing new Windows 7 builds ) <p> The advantage of doing the bandwidth monitoring with your router is that it will log the bandwidth used by every device on your network and not just a pc running an application to do so , this means the bandwidth used by the 360 and other games consoles will also be logged . <p> To change when the logs are backed up I think you would find " 1 */12 * * * /tmp/backup-rstats " and modify the 12 to 1 for example if you want the backup to run every hour . <p> The script has been working perfectly for the last 1 and a half years now . 64318 @qwx264318 <p> Finally got it working fully today . Of course this picture is mostly showing all your rstats since you sent me yours . Though its backing up once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a webpage so no one should be able to see it inless they access it via a ftp client which to my knowledge does n't work without a user and pass . <p> Thanks for helping me today on MSN . I turned out leaving the shutdown code as it was and changing the wan up script a little to this . so it replaces the old file on the server instead on creating a new one each time . <p> I think the idea of having it creating a separate file is so if an upload was to fail or the file got corrupted you could just restore another backup and not lose everything . As the files are only a few kb i left it be . <p> I found this thread when Googling to find a way to backup my bandwidth stats on my Tomato ( v1.25 running on WRT54GL v1.1 ) .

Just think about it ... we are just formatting a 250gb hard drive for use with the 360 because you ca n't even buy them without plumping for a console as well ( ie the MW2 special edition box ) . <p> The price that Microsoft charges for their official drives should be an Anti-Trust case all on its own ... sheer daylight robbery . If I was to take a DVD player and put it in a fancy box and call it a SuperDuper DVD player and then charge 4 times the cost of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called a pirate ... this is exactly what Microsoft is doing with the 360 hard drives . They take ordinary hard drives , add a little bit of software formatting to the drive and then put it in a special box and selling it for 4 times the cost . <p> It 's ironic when Microsoft are death on pirates when they are doing piracy themselves . Considering they want us to buy DLC that is taking up more and more space these days and then wondering why we go out and mod our own OEM drives that are IDENTICAL to what they use . Installing games to the hard drive reduces wear on the DVD drive and stops the hairdryer noise in the bargain ... If you do n't want to keep having to uninstall games every time you get a new one you need AT LEAST a 250gb drive ... <p> If they deactivate these drives I will be one amongt many who will egg on the brave souls who will be suing Microsoft . I wo n't be among them due to the fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford the stupid price of the Microsoft Official Hard Drives ... that is if they bloody well sold them in the first place . Ironic eh ? <p> Great tutorial ! ! ! I have a question though can i only use up to 250 gb hd or can i go higher ? Say for instance a 320gb ? Thanks 64320 @qwx264320 <p> This has been answered several times , the answer is no . In order for there to be a bigger hard drive to be for 360 Microsoft would have to officially release one , which they have n't . You can only mod a 20GB , 60GB , 120GB , and 250GB . <p> Ok , since I 'm the paranoid type , I 'm going to throw this question out one last time before I proceed with this excellent HDD hack : <p> Is anyone aware of anyone having their XBL account banned for using a non-MS hard drive ? <p> Everything I can find online only mentions the DVD-ROM firmware hack being targetted . A few newspaper articles mention things off-hand like " apparently even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the authors are techie-types or have first-hand knowledge ( so I 'm thinking MS scare tactic just to sell a few more HDDs at 300% markup ) . I 'm all set to do this because I 'm buying all kinds of DLC and even the full-game digital downloads and need the additional space , so it would seem pretty dumb for MS to buy me for wanting to buy MORE content from them , even if I 'm not using their stupid HDD . <p> I was having that same problem because I forgot to right click on Xplorer360 and select " Run as Administrator " . Once I did that it detected the FATX drive no problem . The other hiccup I had was trying to drag-and-drop my content folder onto the 250gig drive ( would n't let me ) using Xplorer360 250 gig version . I just had to turn off the UAC in Windows 7 and now it 's copying over no problems . <p> Already tried the drive in the 360 though and it works like a charm . This tutorial is awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why in xplorer 360 ? I was talking about the flashing process in DOS , where it is n't recognized by hddhackr . <p> Do I have to format the drive before flashing it or something else I forgot ? Never read anything about xplorer 360 related to the flash before . I thought you just need that to back up your data from old drives or something . <p> People are asking the same 5 questions to the same 5 problems ... just a suggestion , you should begin the tutorial with a FAQ section in the very beginning written in big red capital letters or something . This post is getting to big , and people get too lazy . <p> When googling around to figure out how to do this upgrade I found a poorly written post on another forum ( ca n't remember where sorry ) which claimed that formatting their new 250gb drive ( presumably via system settings on the xbox 360 ) had caused them to be banned . This seems utterly stupid but I just wanted to check : has anyone tried this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250gb drive now and , of course , I did n't get banned . <p> When googling around to figure out how to do this upgrade I found a poorly written post on another forum ( ca n't remember where sorry ) which claimed that formatting their new 250gb drive ( presumably via system settings on the xbox 360 ) had caused them to be banned . This seems utterly stupid but I just wanted to check : has anyone tried this ? 64320 @qwx264320 <p> I did the upgrade using these instructions and it works perfectly . I did not find any confirmed banning of the DIY hard drive upgrade via Google . The only instances I did find is when the XBox itself is modded and becomes banned . You can still use the hard drive off the banned XBox and use it in a new XBox just fine . <p> Common sense would lead us to believe that if they are n't even banning the actual hard drives off of banned modded XBoxes , then a DIY hard drive upgrade is safe to do without any consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard drives , then there would be plenty of warnings that you would find online from the thousands of people that have performed this upgrade themselves . <p> So I just did the hard drive upgrade . Xbox recognises it with no issues , but none of the content from partition 3 that i transferred is there . Any ideas ? The tutorial is not particularly clear on the specifics of this ( no offense to the author ) . I used the ' extract ' command in xplorer to copy the content folder onto my pc 's hard drive . I then used the inject folder command to put that same folder back into partition3 on the new drive . <p> edit : works now , turns out xplorer was n't putting the files where I thought it was . It seems to insert a folder always in the root of the current partition and not the current folder , no matter where you right click to start the process ( drag and drop does n't work ) . As an aside , has anyone come up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps similar to the forza 3 method ) ? <p> I havnt tried mass effect 2 but i have read elsewhere that the forza 3 method works for it too . <p> I just did this process starting feb 3rd 2010 so this process works as of that date . This is the best guide that I found but I ran into a few snags so I am posting the solutions to help others have a smoother experience . <p> Delete as much unneeded stuff off your hard drive , free DLC , installed games , things that you can redownload later , the process is n't that fast and only having to copy a couple gigs of data from my 20GB was a lot easier then the first time i tried an had 11GB . Though this will create empty folders that will show up during the transfer process but they do n't  need to be transferred . <p> When you take the old hard drive out of the case there is a spring that holds the latch , mine shot across the room and i almost lost it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer it would only recognize the new drive when connected to sata port 0 , all other ports it would n't see it . Also my computers printer has an SD card slot that it was trying to boot to and wouldnt boot to my usb stick until i disconnected my printer , so if you have issues disconnect everything else while on the hddhackr part . <p> You need to restore the partition 2 in order for it to work , I thought i do n't  play xbox1 games i wont do it , but it wo n't recognize any files unless partition 2 is restored , you can use xport 360 from datel to do these folder manually if the image restore is n't working . <p> The system content folder ( the one with all 0s ) is very touchy and i had to do folders one at a time for it to not crash and wipe out whatever progress i had made . <p> I 've got it .. When I flash my hdd the hddhackr ask for " Making partition 0,2,3 " when i press yes its make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't see Hdd , when i press No everything is ok my xbox see 228GB of space 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

( I used these when I was a promotional " Pokemon Gym Leader " for KB ToyWorks to share cloned Pokemon with my customers . ) <p> The Gen1 carts were used to restore saves , and to move Mew data between Gameboy Games/Stadium Carts <p> Finally , the Retron 5 was utilized to back up the final combined Mew save to a SD card for distribution to the net and backup purposes . <p> Gen1 Event Mews " Certificate of Authenticity " : <p> These print outs were handed out by Nintendo promotion staff during the Mall Tours . The Mew upload machine would stamp your Mew with a unique Trainer I 'd number , which was then copied to a " Certificate of Authenticity " for the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution machine . The first Mew from a machine is 00001 , the second 00002 , 00003 , so on . <p> Mewdude Save on Pokemon Stadium 2 : Stats Page 1 ( Nickname ) : <p> I have found 12 of my 14 , two of them are MIA . <p> These are all legitimate Mews from Pokemon Mall events that happened in 99 for launch of the TCG , and 2000 for the Movie and Pokemon Stadium launch . You would insert your Gen1 cartridge into a machine , while a promo employee would fill out a paper " Certificate of Authenticity " for your personal Mew . <p> Mewdude Save on Pokemon Stadium 2 : Stats Page 2 ( Stats ) : <p> Soluko : About the Mews in the save : - Every single one of them has the same DVs ( 5 ) /10/1/5/12 - The first 6 Mews have been trained to level 15 ( one to level 16 ) - The next 6 Mews are untouched . - The last 2 Mews are at level 100 , max stat experience and custom moveset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Pokemon Stadium 2 : Stats Page 3 ( Moves ) : <p> Not much to say here - moveset on the bottom was my go to for Gen1 Mew .

The Trainer I 'd is generated sequentially from the Mew distribution machine . The first Mew from a machine is 00001 , the second 00002 , 00003 , so on . <p> The LUIGE Mews came from a TCG event in 99 , where I made friends with a Nintendo rep named Jeremy . He traded these two , numbers 00012 and 00014 to me and my girlfriend . The story as I remember it was that the machines were scheduled to go on tour but had technical difficulties . He had snagged these two ( and the certificates of authenticity ) during some testing runs . <p> The LINKW Mews came from a Mall Event in Arlington , TX promoting Pokemon Stadium and the 2000 movie .

I 'm not posting the horrible picture of me and Jeremy from NOA , sorry ! <p> 1999 Mall Tour - Pikachu Car Back : <p> Rocking the CRT in the trunk . Pokemon Snap was the bomb ! <p> In 1999 and 2000 , I was able to obtain 14 Official Event Mews from the US Mall Tours for Pokemon Trading Card Game ( 1999 ) and Pokemon Stadium / Pokemon Movie ( 2000 ) . I was contacted about helping to preserve information on these Event Mews - here are the results of my completed restoration project . <p> A few weeks ago , a person named Suloku Mago emailed me out of the blue asking for information about my old website from 1999 . I was horrified to hear that the site was still up and running . Written in Notepad , pokeball animated gifs , proudly designed for 800x600 .. oh dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pictures of a mall event I attended in 1999 , and the event Mews I had collected . These are all legitimate Mews from Pokemon Mall events that happened in 1999 for the launch of the Pokemon TCG , and then in 2000 for the Pokemon First Movie and Pokemon Stadium launch . You would insert your Gen1 cartridge into a machine , while promo staff would fill out a paper " Certificate of Authenticity " for your personal Mew . <p> The Trainer names are LUIGE or LINKW . The Trainer I 'd is generated sequentially from the Mew distribution machine . The first Mew from a machine is 00001 , the second 00002 , 00003 , so on . The LUIGE Mews came from a Pokemon TCG event in 1999 , where I made friends with a Nintendo rep named Jeremy Hepworth . He traded these two , numbers 00012 and 00014 to us . The story as I remember it was that the machines were scheduled to go on tour but had technical difficulties . He had snagged these two ( and the certificates of authenticity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Summer 2000 Mall Event in Arlington , TX promoting Pokemon Stadium and the 2000 movie . They had four of the machines running simultanously for a huge line of people . Once the lines died off I went through the machines and got 12 of them . <p> Suloku wanted to know if I remembered anything about the Mews , like trainer I 'd or stats . He is documenting as much as he can about all of the different events and their Pokemon . Luckily , what I had for him is much , much better . <p> Back in the late 90 's I worked for a KB ToyWorks store . My weekend duties included playing Pokemon TCG with kids , and promoting Pokemon in all ways . Supported by Wizards of the Coast with tons of materials , it was a blast . During that gig , I ended up buying a save backup cart for my Game Boy , and started cloning these event Mews for the kids . <p> So when Suloko asked , I dug up all my Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow carts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found six of them on a Blue save . I found another six sitting in Pokemon Stadium 1 . And the last two were in a box on Stadium 2 . <p> I was able to shuffle all of the Mews to one Stadium Cart , and through much trickery , get them onto a fresh Pokemon Yellow save . <p> Using a Retron 5 , I copied the save from the Pokemon Yellow cart onto my SD card . ( I will post a youtube video with instructions on backing up cart saves using Retron 5 as a follow up , really neat way to preserve your retro saves ) <p> Now I gift these Mews to Suloku , and to all of you . I hope these Mews provide useful information , thank you for reading , and please let me know what kind of information or data you pull from the save ! <p> EDIT1 : The save file link has been taken down due to concerns about legality/piracy . Please send me a PM and I will send the file via Dropbox link . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Suloku Mago : <p> I 'm glad to inform you that you did not change your original Mew 's ( #12 and #14 ) DVs , you only changed stat experience . Also , they are tenchnically not hacked , as they just have the stat experience maxed and level 100 , which is something you can achieve in-game . These " test " mews have the very same DVs as all ( or most ) other mews , which makes sense taking into account they come from the distro machines for the tour . Most valuable information is that they were actually named LUIGE and not LUIGIE , because now I have proof about LUIGE and LUIGIE Mews , both with certificate , which is an interesting fact . <p> The first 6 mews have been trained to level 15 ( and one to level 16 ) . <p> As I already stated , what makes a Mew an official mew are OT , I 'd and DVs . They were all distributed at level 5 with pound as the only move . All these Mews can be reverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion , will still be legit . Some people wo n't accept this , but since your save has your original Mews , it 's ok for everybody . <p> The other 6 LINKW Mews are untouched as you received them back in the day ( I bet these were the ones stored in stadium 1 ? ) <p> ps : I do n't know if you know this , but I used this program to convert to a " standard " save file ( 32 kb ) as I noticed it used some kind of compression format ( it was n't 32 kb , then I opened the file with an hex editor and found a " RTN5 " header , so searched a tool to re-convert ) : Retro5.net View topic - Retron 5 File Converter You 'll need the standard 32kb file for any emulator or other tools usage . <p> Thanks for mirroring this ! I came across this thread but did n't found time to read through it yet until now . It 's good to learn how Mew was distributed back then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have NOE tour these machines at some point , and instead of a certificate you 'd get a sticker on your Gen1 cart stating " Mew Inside ! " . I never took one , but at least I got a Mew on my 3DS Blue VC savefile through the glitch and a " GameStop Mew " through the 3DS event last January . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Follow prompts when done i believe it 's back back to shutdown . Power cycle ( unplug power 2 minutes ) and turn on if it boot 12611 ( easy to tell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alt dash like freestyle or xexmenu for file explorer . If it has 2 red lights on top then bottom and rotate ( christmas lights ) then you put the nand dump on a flash drive and name it updflash.bin and hit the dvd eject button with the standard a/v cable plugged in no HDMI and it should say it 's updating in 15 seconds and count down . After that it will be back to the dash you have now . after 12611 in on it put dash launch 2.07 on flash drive and use file explorer from dash you installed to run default.xex in **32;2626;TOOLONG folder and follow install . If you want to boot that dash all the now just edit the ini file and put on root to always boot to it first .

No video , no green ring , no error indicators what-so-ever , and Xell/Xellous was gone . FIX : I had to re-solder my LPT cable , reflashed xellous ( I had to go figure out how to build xellous ... I started with JTAG back with Xell ) , and I put my updflash.bin ( the 9199freeboot.bin image ) onto a CD as a file , and re-flashed with xellous off CD ...

I play Minecraft occasionally , usually on temporary local servers with friends , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back into multiplayer Minecraft . During the early summer , I spent a lot of time on this one server , but it literally died out of nowhere ( too bad , WildStyle had built a fantastic Gothic cathedral not too long before , and the server was still quite active and popular ) . I 'm playing on a relatively new vanilla server on-and-off , but I 'm not entirely happy with it , and if I find a better one I 'll likely stop going there . <p> Also , I would totally go on a nostalgia event on Digiex . And I would come back in a heartbeat , if it went public again ( though I know chances of that are very slim ) . The reason I stopped playing is why everyone else stopped playing too , no-one was online anymore towards the end , and singleplayer is boring . However , I still love Digiex above all other servers I 've been on . <p> Planetside 2 , BF3 , HoN , playing some Soft airgun , being social etc etc <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recreate that feeling we all had ; ( Sure minecraft is fun for 1-2 weeks maybe nowadays but then it gets boring Tried to play some minecraft on Buxville , was fun for 2days then it got boring : / <p> But hey if anyone plays Planetside 2 or want a betakey just ask me ! It goes live 20th november anyhow so join me then ! Could make a Digiex outfit perhaps ? And it is Free 2 play , and it 's a massive MMOFPS ( kinda like Halo ) and no its not lame graphic or anything it 's actually a really good game ! <p> Wow , nostalgia so much at the moment . I miss digiex soooooo much ; ( If planetside becomes free to play , it 'll be the first game i get on my new computer i 'm saving up for . I would love it if the even was help for about a week , plus the tekkit server has n't  done too well . At the moment i 'm playing minecraft on a server called Outlaw . Its the first server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play dungeon defenders on steam quite a bit , towns came out on steam i play that some , tf2 , garrysmod , halflife 2 and 2 or 3 more games . <p> I miss digiex . If i had a time machine i would go back to the old days ; ( <p> I have been going to school , played a bit of ArmA 2 DayZ mod but that 's about it . I have also played PlanetSide 2 ( i got in the closed beta early ) but i havent had the time to get back to it yet . And i probably wo n't have much time in the near future anyway since i keep getting more projects to run at school and not to forget the homework . <p> Ill try to work some gaming time into my schedule so if anyone is up for a game let me know on steam . <p> i have not moved on , i have been playing hard core pvp raiding servers alot , but my friend told me about a nice smp towny server so i started playing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play it feel free to ask for the ip. plus you guys are missing out on all the new stuff !

I would vote 100% towards a small temporary server which we can have a little meet-up ; Like I said , great to hear from Digiex again and seeing what you 're all up to . <p> I 've been mostly working and trying to get into college since I want to pursue business as a career .

There is also the JTAG Tool program , is it better than NANDPro ?

I think you meant to say set it to false , then update and then turn it back . That is what I did and now I am good to go . Updating to the new kernel went very smooth for me . It was not knowing I needed the XEXMenu disc to be able to get to the dashlaunch file I needed to install . Then installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and turning the noupdater to false so it would accept an update . <p> InsaneNutter , Thanks for your help . I made the process using my original nand dump ( the one I have downloaded through xell and webbrowser , before xbr was installed ) . Now I ended up with a completely different resulting updflash.bin file ( I have compared this to the other one I made with the nand dump aquired by NANDFLASHER 360 , using nandpro feature ) . Also looking to the log files fbBuild created , I have some remmaping warnings for the supposed erroneous one , which not occured to de modified nand using the original nand dump ) . Should this be the problem ? There is some way of detecting this newer modiffied NAND is correct before flashing it to xbox ?

I will try to reestablish the backup I made with NANDFlasher 360 and see if I can go back to xbr ... if I do n't  , I think I will need a usb hardware to flash the original image , flashing 256mb with lpt cable will take soo long to finish I think ... Any Ideas ? <p> I have been looking in to this for you , I think the problem could be freeBOOT has a different layout compared to XBR , so XeLL is in a different place on the nand .

I ran Gears of War 3 and that update ( 13406 - I believe ) went fine , but when I try Dark Souls or RAGE ( both 13599 ) I get E81 error while it extracts/unpack the update . I then tried both the 13599 and the 13604 updates from this site , using a usb stick . I get the same results . <p> I tried booting the console while holding the sync button - thus clearing the update - but it still wo n't update , giving E81 error every time . <p> What is this E81 error ? I know it 's an update error , something to do with failed update or something like that . Can it be fixed , either by a future update or something else or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been banned for 2 years , maybe you should read ? If you 're updating the Xbox I believe that you would have to put the OFW back onto the disc drive before you can update . Also a quick question . Is you drive spoofed to think it 's a different model ? <p> Try flashing the dvd drive to stock , then booting normally , it may be able to install the update then . If it still fails to boot , remove the hdd and try booting normally , or holding the sync button to clear updates again with the hdd removed . <p> The newest few system updates flash the dvd drive with a new firmware and often fail to do so when the drive is running a custom firmware . <p> If one of that works , try flashing to stock then doing the update while booting with a usb flash drive . <p> The drive is the stock one , has n't been spoofed . I do n't think the stock method works , as other people have problem with this and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't have the means to do it now though , but if nothing else works I 'll eventually give it a shot . Afaik , the 13599 and 13604 should not flash the drive . Most people are updating to newest dash - 13604 - with custom fw . Many people have updated to 13599 the same way . <p> Going from 13146 to a higher firmware reflashes the drive . If you 're already on 13599 and up to 13604 then you have no flashing as it 's just a maintenance update , therefore no reflashing but going from 13146 to 13604 will still flash the disc drive . Most people do n't have this problem and that is because not everyone has the same disc drive . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Or is this supposed to work with a xbox regardless if it is glitched or not ? I tried to flash the undo.bin through Hex Workshop , my drive is no longer a visable drive in windows . I can see it in Device Managaer under hard drives as USB only it no longer shows it being a 250 gig drive . I can not flash the undo.bin back to it to fix it either . Any idea 's . I also tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undo.bin is the wrong size . Am I bricked ? <p> I tried to open the Hex Workshop and Went Disk , Open Drive , and it shows the Seagate drive as Physical Disk 6 ( 0 bytes ) now ? So I choose it , then click ok . I get Read failure : Unable to read sector 0 . The drive may not be ready , contain bad sectors , or require read permissions . Then my option are Abort , Retry , Ignore .

Or is there a undo.bin for seagate drives . Like there is for western digital drives ? <p> I do n't  know if people are still using this forum or what not , but I have a question . I have went through all the steps you described in the tutorial above , and even went through most of the steps in InsaneNutters tutorial . My only problem is when I go to run HDDHACKR in MS-DOS , my computer just sits there and idles with the hddhackr command still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what I might be doing wrong . I have a Seagate 320 GB SATA drive that I want to flash to use with my 4GB 360 Slim . Can anybody please help ? ? ? Thanks in advance ! ! ! <p> Also if you are still on msn messenger , can I possibly have you screen name so we can chat more directly ? Would love to get advice from the person that made this awesome tutorial . Thanks ! <p> Correct ... For instance the drive i 'm currently doing ( got kicked off pc after flashing and copying my undo.bin ) still has windows installed on it ... When you use the Partitions command on hddhackr it will repartion the drive into 3 partitions ( a partition is like a seperate draw on a file cabinet ) then format them all so yeah ... <p> Edit : Been doing a full hex edit method ( manually created the partitions using hxd and used the above method to flash ... i did this as i had pulled apart my 250g portable hdd in the effectively giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i couldnt be bothered opening up my pc ) managed to reach the point where my hacked explorer beta 6 detected both partition 1 and 2 ... of course the xbox did n't  find it ( it may have been because i timed out while filling hex blocks 120EB1000 through 130EAFFFF with 00 and thus did n't  get up to fixing the cluster map ... ive done that now tho and ill get back to you if it works ) also if it still does n't  work considering ive done everything right then either i need some data for partition 1 or the seagate hm121hi is incompatible <p> Edit2 : Okay either ive done something wrong or i had to do something before the hex ... I only get partition 0 and 2 no 3 ... When apparently i 'm meant to already have 3 ... It would n't have anything to do with the fact i cleared the partitions off the drive before starting the partition hex edits ( its all unallocated space right now ) would it <p> So I have a working WD3200BPVT 00JJ5TO in one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made using HDDHACKR with no issues .

I just bought the same WD3200BPVT 80JJ5T and unfortunatelly made a brick using undo.bin from other revision of WD3200BPVT . Did you solve the problem ? They say , that is could be solved with the hex editor <p> I recently got a new Slim . Before , I had a Elite with a 120GB hard drive . When that one broke about a year ago , thinking I would n't need the HDD anymore for an Xbox , I formatted it and used it as an external drive for Windows . <p> Now I decided to use it again in my Slim . So I followed your tutorial and did the following : - Download the HDDSS.BIN for 120GB Hitachi ( exactly the right one for my HDD ) - Used HexWorkshop to replace the Sectors 16-22 with this HDDSS.BIN - Then formatted the HDD/created the partitions ( first using HDDHackr , and when that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , valid Security Sector and all , but my Xbox does not recognize the HDD at all . <p> Is there anything left I could try ? Or does anyone know what I 'm doing wrong ? Help is greatly appreciated . Thanks a lot in advance ! <p> P.S. : With " when that did n't work " , I meant the xbox did n't recognize the drive . HDDHackr itself was succesful in creating the partitions . The drive was still visible in Windows though ... After using FatXPlorer , it did n't show up in Windows anymore , but in Xplorer , XPort etc. as a valid Xbox drive . <p> EDIT : I 'm aware this is n't supposed to work with every drive . I just figured , if it worked with a Seagate model , why should n't it work with a drive that belonged to a Xbox360 before , and now with the right SS should be exactly the way it was when I bought it ... 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

It seems unlikely , but I 'll find out if I ever do because of it . <p> Anyway , here is an updated method on how to get Sgt Johnson with the same file in the OP . This method requires a configured flash drive . I recommend using Horizon for this but Modio should work too : <p> 1 . Open up either an updated version Horizon or Modio . <p> 2 . Plug in your flash drive . 3 . Make sure you have an ODST save on your flash drive as this makes it easier . I know the download comes with one , but I got an ODST file just to make the job a bit easier . You can skip this step though if you feel confident . <p> 4 . Right click , inject file . 5 . On your computer , go to wherever you saved Sgt Johnson , he should be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click on that , click on the 0002 folder . 7. click on the file inside the 0002 folder . The program should say that you have Drop Sgt Johnson into firefight successfully . Eject the flash drive , insert it into your console , either move or copy the file to your HDD , launch ODST , choose Sgt Johnson as your firefight character and you 're all set ! <p> Basically now days you can just use horizon and inject it to the usb and the files are already made for you . This post was made before horizon . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> I know . I just wan na make sure I 'm clear from the banhammer 's radius though since the file is legitimate but it 's not something from my download history .

Also now days you just use horizon and the files get made for you . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Alright . Good . Yeah it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things like this , not to mention it was the HDD in the PC instead of a flash drive . I do n't think MS really cares anymore since they moved on to the Xbox One . <p> Though I 'm sure if I were to color mod my avatar , that would lead me to a profile ban for good . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

Thanks in advance for some help . <p> If you go in to memory on the Xbox 360 can you format the drive ? not configure it to be used in the Xbox 360 but actually format ? it should ask you to enter your Xbox 360 's serial number when doing so . <p> The drive is no longer recognised as an xbox drive , it 's formatted to fat32 . I have an identical extra one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract the HDD.bin from the good one and flash it to the fat32 one will it work . And can I format it in the xbox or do I need the HDDHacker tool ? <p> Hey thanks for the tip , I already removed the microsoft sticker and used hddhackr to just reformat . But I wonder if what you said would work , it was mistakenly formatted to fat32 . The hddss.bin remained untouched so it just needed reformatting . The Xbox360 did n't see the fat32 . Would it see the NTSC as unformatted ? Do n't  know . Thanks again . <p> Everytime i 've ever formatted a hard drive that was messed up , I always formatted it to NTFS and then the 360 would see it as unformatted . Please check back if it works or not , it would be appreciated .

@@21399384 @1399384/ <h> Are Temps Supossed To Be This High ? <p> Have noticed that FSD was reporting that my CPU temp was 70c and GPU 68c when i quit out of playing a game for about an hour ! . Obviously before i had my RGH console i had no idea what the temps where for the 360 , do these seem high ? i have the fan setting left on Auto , but have n't heard it speed up at all ? ? ? <p> Thanks for the info , having the fan set at 65% is quiet audible though is n't it ? I 'm running FSD currently , and change the Fan settings through that , is it actually FSD that controls the speed of the fan ? as I 'm thinking of just using the normal MS dash instead , if I was to do that how would I have control over the fan ? <p> Any ideas what the ambient temp of the room where your 360 is in is ? Are there more advance temp controls that can be used , for instance having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say 60c ? ? . I wonder if RGH causes the system to run hotter when playing a game ? , I should see how it would ! <p> if the fan is set at 65% , it is a bit audible . I think there 's a setting in dash launch ( the xex file ) that can control when the fan switches on . ( I stand to be corrected on that ) Not sure what my room temp is . <p> I 'm sure some of the more experienced forum members will be able to help though . ( Sorry I ca n't be of any more help ) <p> Yeah ive just downloaded the latest release of Dash Launch , and it does indeed have a temp target option so that helps a little . <p> I 'm not sure why the temps would be high when playing a game whin in RGH mode than if playing the same xbox in normal retail mode , unless it runs more processes when the game is being played like if FSD is still running etc ? That said i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for a bog standard 360 ! ? <p> Going back to the fan settings and system temps for retail nand mode ( no control over fan speed ) i thought of a way to find out what temp the system got upto in this mode . Basically in retail nand mode play a game for a while then turn the system off , switch to RGH nand and power on the console again as soon as the system boots hold down the Home Button and see what the system temps are ( must have the ' Shut down temp ' option enabled in dashlaunch ) . From turning my system off and then waiting for it to boot into RGH mode ( roughtly 15 seconds ) my system temps were as follows : <p> CPU 66c GPU 62c Mem 59c <p> obviously these had probably cool down slightly whilst the system was glitching into RGH mode and the fan was going crazy so can probably add a few more c to these figures . <p> I cant even hear my fan at all when in retail nand mode even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40% speed ) so Microsoft CPU , GPU and MEM heat tolerance threshold must be very high so one would think these temps must be in MS safety parameters ! ? . Begs the question why do so users have their fans set to 60%+ this must be overkill surely not to mention how loud it would be ? ? ? , i think setting the fan speed to 45% is more than enough as this would be faster than what MS officially set the fan speed at <p> A lot of people have old Xenon Jtags , which are like ticking time bombs . To try and keep the consoles a bit cooler they crank the fan speeds right up to 100% <p> Personally on my Jasper Jtag i leave them as default and the console has been fine for years now and is pretty quiet ( could n't tell you the temps off the top of my head ) . <p> As you have a Slim you should n't need to worry about them at all , Slims are so reliable compared to the older Xenon 360 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found your console is fine when in retail mode , so i see no need to make it sound like a jumbo jet when been used as an RGH console , its not any more demanding than when the console plays a game in its retail state . <p> A lot of people have old Xenon Jtags , which are like ticking time bombs .

First time for me but its wrking ok now My Falcon JTAG runs no hotter than 63c on both GPU and CPU with fans set to auto <p> Hi not trying to hijack the thread , but I had a similar question . I have a jtag console ( all the " hard " work was done by someone I was friendly with online and who used to do this stuff for a living but has now retired and vanished off the net ) that has a couple of quarky issues , but I will stay focused on the fan one here . Since the day it arrived it has always blown out at 100% and while this normally is n't an issue for me as I normally use headphones , it 's starting to become a problem with my new setup . I 've flashed the NAND a few times ( I just followed InsaneNutter 's guild and upgraded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there =p ) and was wondering if anyone knew of a way to get it to act like a stock Xbox 360 ( aka increase and decrease in speed as needed ) ? I noticed the comments above about dashlaunch ( I 'm using an outdated version and should upgrade anyway ) but is this the only solution we have for now ? <p> Edit : Okay this makes no sense to me ... I just finished flashing and now the fan works perfectly with auto ( I can heard it rev up a bit at times but the rain outside my window is way louder than the fan ) . I have not yet fixed the dashboard by installing the official update yet or update dashlaunch so that FSD 3 is the first thing to launch , but maybe the problem just fixed itself ? Or is dashlaunch to blame ? Personally I do n't mind going into " My Games " , launching Viper360 and then loading FSD 3 if I get a working fan system . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321

It was initially designed to function as a droplet : G just drop an . iso file on the app and it will ask you for a folder to extract to . If no file is dropped on the app , it will ask you for an . iso file . <p> Why for god 's sake ? I wanted to get xiso extraction done on my mac with as few clicks as possible . I wrote this because i thought it might come in handy . If you do n't  like it - do n't  use it . 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321 
@@21399395 @1399395/ <h> Guide to Jailbreak the PS3 with a iPhone 3G/2G running PSFreedom <p> This jail-break is simple once you 've done it . I spent well over 12 hour 's trying to do it . Now to help everyone , here 's you a guide . It 's pretty simple , just follow it exactly , read the notes and pay attention to anything in bold . Doing so and in a matter of 30-60 minute 's you 'll have a jail-broken PS3 ! <p> Recent Change 's in the Guide : <p> Hidden all steps on the guide that 's are n't needed when using a pre-patched method . You may skip them if using a pre-patched method . If not , then show the spoiler and do as it ask 's . <p> If you 've not got the correct firmware , use this time to downgrade you 're firmware version now . You can learn how to do that at this link . ( Same step 's no matter the firmware version listed in the guide . ) <p> Connect the iPhone to PC , close iTunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click on iPhoDroid.exe located in the folder you extracted to you 're Desktop . A window should open , click " Shoot " this will then install Android ( PSFreedom ) to your iPhone 3G/2G . <p> ? <p> Once this has done your phone will boot to a menu , push the power botton on the top right of the phone , this will scroll through the boot options , push the power botton untill you get to the bottom left hand corner where you will see " Install " now push the home button and it should install fully to your phone . Once installed you 're phone should boot into Android ( PSFreedom ) , now you need to exit Android ( PSFreedom ) by holding the power and home button 's in until the phone kicks off . <p> ? <p> When you power the phone on you will be greeted with the boot menu , choose the apple logo which will put you back to normal iOS , you will find you 're now stuck in recovery so go back to iPhoDroid and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exit out of Recovery " . You 're iPhone OS will now boot as normal from now on . <p> Note : If you receive a error after hitting " Exit out of Recovery " Then download TinyUmbrella above and use it to kick you 're device out of Recovery mode . <p> ? <p> For those who has chosen to manually SSH the file 's you 're self , you will now need to copy the file 's to you 're iPhone <p> Unzip the PSFreedom for iPhone 3G/2G onto your Desktop . ( Note : Do not extract " Android.img.gz " It is suppose to stay that way . ) <p> Make sure your iPhone is booted into it 's normal Apple iOS . <p> Launch Filezilla and connect to iPhone . Navigate to private/var <p> Copy the 2 files from within you 're PSFreedom extracted folder on you 're desktop to private/var , it should then ask you if you want to overwrite , hit yes . <p> Then right click on the file 's and change the file permission 's on them both to 777 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone and ready to be loaded up via you 're PS3 . <p> Step Two Using The PSFreedom Jail-break <p> Power off iPhone and launch the Android icon from the new boot menu , your iPhone will have load 's of text line 's appearing , wait for the " INIT " text to appear ( the phone is now ready ) <p> Connect the iPhone to you 're PS3 <p> Flick to power switch ( on the back ) of the PS3 to off then on . ( FAT ) If slim then plug the the power cable to the back of you 're PS3 . ( Slim ) <p> Push the power button ( on front of console ) and straight after push the eject button . <p> You will notice the text on the iPhone start 's scrolling again . <p> Your PS3 should now be booted jailbroken ( you should now have 2 folder 's within the game selection screen ) <p> ? <p> Troubleshooting : <p> Q : I am trying to boot PSFreedom / iDroid but at the very first screen it get 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done " line ; why ? <p> A : You may have uploaded the PSFreedom / Android images onto your iPhone with WinSCP which does not alway 's work . We suggest that you instead use an ftp client ( such as FileZilla ) . Once you have uploaded the images into the folder /private/var you must also set the image permission 's to 777 . If everything fails then maybe you need to redownload the PSFreedom image files and try again . If still nothing , uninstall Openiboot and boot into iOS , then redo Step Two above . <p> Q : I am trying to boot iDroid and after some loading it gets stuck at the " kernel panic - not syncing : VFS : unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(1,0) " line ; why ? <p> A : The files you have uploaded are corrupted , just reupload them as described above . <p> Hi everything went smooth , i installed the ps freedom already patched file , clicked install on the iboot window , all goes fine , install gets to the IMIT and stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , get to the ps3 part ( slim ) all seems to go well , ps freedom script stops @ unregistered gadget ps freedom ?

You may notice from the video above . I think that 's normal . Are you certain you 're running 3.41 on you 're PS3 ? <p> The fact that you 've managed to even see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I can think of is the PS3 firmware or perhaps you 're trying from a iPod ? <p> here 's some helpful information : <p> Once you 're ready , turn the switch off in the back of your Playstation 3 or unplug the power cord . <p> Make sure there are no other USB devices plugged into the PS3 ( USB Stick , Sixaxis Controller , etc . ) . <p> Then plug in your device and plug in the power cord of the PS3 or flip the switch back on . <p> Once you have that done , quickly press the power then immediately after press the eject button ( as fast as you can ) . <p> You will know it work when it takes a slightly longer time ( about 5 seconds more ) to turn on . <p> The PS3 should boot up and you will see two new options in the games portion of the XMB ( cross media bar ) . <p> I 'm not sure that it will work on 3.40 . The jailbreak does for sure work with 3.41 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do that . 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Hi There ! <p> Man I have a issue , I downloaded the patched version , I open it and hit shoot , everything goes well but when the iphone reboot 's in the screen shows " loading quadra " ( PC ) , and in the iPhone shows " recovery mode " and iPhodroid closes , and then i have to use TinyUmbrella to close the recovery mode , and when it does there is no boot menu , I rebooted a lots of time the same no iphodroid menu , what I am doing wrong ? <p> Man I have a issue , I downloaded the patched version , I open it and hit shoot , everything goes well but when the iphone reboot 's in the screen shows " loading quadra " ( PC ) , and in the iPhone shows " recovery mode " and iPhodroid closes , and then i have to use TinyUmbrella to close the recovery mode , and when it does there is no boot menu , I rebooted a lots of time the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64320 @qwx264320 <p> Finally psfreedom is working , but not thanks to iphodroid , instead I used openiboot , but another issue comes out , I am using a iPhone 3G and a ps3 slim , was not working , it took me hours but I find a solution , when in the terminal says " Psfreedom ...

@@21399398 @1399398/ <p> The Server is founded on the principle of fairness . We 're a group of friends that have played Ark across many private servers . Sadly we kept struggling with other private servers as Admin abuse is rampant across them all . We 'd join one , and spend weeks farming and building only to have an admin tribe with item spawning attack and wipe , or go against bases with clear item spawning or admins force taking over our tribe when we got too big ' etc . After leaving our fifth server in six months we decided there has to be a better way , and as such we got an Xbox and setup our own private server with the one key promise - no cheating ever . Ultimately , why would anyone bother playing on a server which has admin tribes or admin logging turned off ? <p> Note : While this server is approved by Digiex ; it is run separately to the main site/team . <p> Our Server setup is PvP ; and while we want to be as simple and friendly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base rules just to make the game fair and give everyone a chance : <p> We are a PvP Server , therefore attacking each other is allowed at any time . However we do ask you to do it with decency ; if your raiding for materials you do n't need to floor everything they have . Likewise , if a Dino is on passive and not in the way ; try to avoid it if possible . <p> Do n't pollute the map with junk . if your not using an old base please take it down as it just wastes space others can use . <p> Respect new tribes - Give them time to build up . For the first 48 hours any new tribe is protected by the NEG Tribe . We ask that you put a white flag up ASAP as this is the ingame notifier to everyone to give you space ( but if you keep it up way beyond 2 days , we may take it down by force ) . <p> Tribe battles and disagreements are to be resolved between Tribes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If after two weeks your tribe has n't been on nor made contact ; we reserve the right to respectfully dismantle your tribe and bases to free up space for others . If you intend to be inactive for a period over two weeks please post in this group so the Admins and other Players know and leave you alone during the period . <p> The Server Settings are close to Vanilla as possible with a few exceptions ; <p> 2.0x XP 5.5x Taming 2.5x Harvest 5.5x Egg Hatch 3.1x Mature Speed <p> These settings can of course be changed ; we tend to do it based on Community feedback on the Group and go with what our dedicated player base wish for ( within reason ) . One thing we will make clear though is item spawning or dino spawning is never on the table . If you want a boring server with spawning like that ; we are not the one for you ( After all ; its more fun when you play properly ) <p> Joining is easy , first step is add the Server Gamertag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64319 @qwx264319 <h> Home <h> Forums <h> About us 64321 @qwx264321
