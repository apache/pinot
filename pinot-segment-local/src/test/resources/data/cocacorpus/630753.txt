@@82539418 @4039418/ <h> Testimonials <p> Our safes were the best value for money products we 've bought this year . We bought the sky blue one for my nephews birthday and then my niece wanted one straight away . We bought the bubblegum pink one for her and they had happy birthdays . Delivery was great too , we knew when the packages were coming through real communication . I also liked how the products came with all the fixings and a very clear instruction leaflet . The idea of supplying 2 keys was also really welcome . I think the size is ideal too , everyone should buy one for those things theyd like to keep safe . I 'm very happy with all the services from beginning to end . I think you 've captured customer communication to a very high level . <p> Purchased this item to compliment larger safe kept upstairs . These days my wife has difficulty climbing the stairs , so this one is kept downstairs for such items as regularly used , such as credit cards and loose cash papers . It supplies us with not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document down in a safe place , only to realise that the place is so safe you can not find it again . With this safe you come back from shopping and just pop your credit cards , spare cash , receipts etc into the safe via the slot . You do n't  even have to open it . Somewhere safe , convenient , easily accessible . Peace of mind at a very moderate price . Just remember not to keep the spare keys in the safe . <p> I was very impressed with the high quality of this safe and it is definitely value for the price I paid . Also , the slot at the top is very useful for putting in cash quickly without having to open it . This is a brilliant function for quick deposits . <p> This safe is ideal for the purpose for which I bought it . Its a good size yet still compact enough to be installed in a small cupboard out of sight of a casual glance which in turn greatly increases the security aspect . The construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolts which actually secure the door are substantial . The interior is fitted with a system of adjustable shelf supports and a shelf , the position of which can be varied to suit the different articles which are stored in it . The key lock is positive and operates smoothly . All in all , a very good product and very good value for money . <p> The reason I decided to buy this product was that I needed to store a large amount of valuable material the usual items of money , foreign currency , passports and jewellery , but also house policy etc . The safe , which has very easy access , is very large and I have been able to easily fit everything into it including a large camera and spare lenses . What I particularly like about this safe is that its able to fit very neatly under a work top and is also hidden from view but it is also very accessible . <p> Well packed and fast delivery . Better quality than expected for good price . First time buyer of a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buying and sent with the safe on how to fix it to the floor with supplied special screws . Quite heavy but did feel best to fasten to floor . Inner shelf adjustable so easily holds A4 ring binders vertically with plenty of space still on top shelf for other items . The safe is locked with a key . Two keys supplied at time of purchase . Happy with my purchase for safe size and quality . <p> This is an excellent product and is very well built and perfect for the job in hand . It was very easy to install and also very easy to use . It is very secure . This is a three gun cabinet and there is plenty of room for three gins . The delivery was quick and the cabinet was securely packaged and arrived on time . The overall process of purchasing and receiving the product was simple and hassle free . Having received the cabinet it was well worth the money . I would have no issues recommending anybody to buy this product .
