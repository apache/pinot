Family and consumer sciences education applies academic learning to hands-on application and is part of an integral part of each student 's development . <p> Finding balance in one 's physical , mental , and social wellness is the fundamental foundation for a healthy life . Health education , in addition to teaching key concepts or knowledge , also teaches a variety of skills that promotes lifelong wellness .

A Connecticut state mandate requires substance abuse education each year and HIV/AIDS education on a consistent and on-going basis . Students learn through an interactive program that allows them to personalize the knowledge , believe it , understand its importance and personal relevance , believe in their own ability to act upon it , and then actually act upon that knowledge when necessary . <p> The principle reason for studying mathematics is to learn how to apply mathematical thought to problem solving . Students must be able to perform the fundamental operations associated with each course and acquire a set of meaningful concepts they can use effectively to solve problems .

Students have the opportunity to analyze the value of certain activities and how each activity enhances total fitness .

Students experience a wide range of high-interest and accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By guiding students through the reading process and gradually increasing text complexity , students become more reflective and proficient readers . During this process , students predict and interpret text , draw conclusions , make inferences , recognize an author 's purpose , find organizational patterns , and improve general comprehension and vocabulary skills . Students leave class with improved confidence in their skills and a working repertoire of strategies to employ when confronted with challenging texts across the content areas . <p> Our science department strives to stimulate each student 's creativity and innovation through the use of an appropriately rigorous curriculum centered on problem solving and critical thinking .
