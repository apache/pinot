To cover the Ka frequencies used here in the US you really only need to set up sweeps 1-3 and 4-6 can be disabled , or you can use them all if you like doubling up sweeps on a particular frequency if you want overkill on that band . <p> There are really only 3 Ka frequency ranges commonly used here in North America <p> There are also some rare old Stalker ATR handhelds that operated between 34.2 - 35.2 but these are out of circulation for the most part . <p> I 'm just going to deal with setting up sweeps for the current production radars listed above , but you can use sweeps 4-6 to cover anything you want or leave them unselected ...... your choice . <p> Good news ..... for 33.8 Ka you do not need to set up a sweep ! This band is covered automatically in Euro mode via the Euro POP mode that is always active . The 33.8 Ka POP sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cover the complete bandwidth of 34.7 you need to use custom sweep 1 &amp; 2 . This is due internal calibration points inside the V1 that do not permit a single sweep to bridge a 4 MHZ boundary between 34.770 - 34.774 . No sweep can start or stop within that range either , so you have to sweep around it . <p> So let 's get started . In order to adjust a sweep you have to put your finger on the button and drag it left or right to adjust the sweeps start and stop points . This can be a little frustrating with the small buttons and fat fingers but stick with it and eventually you 'll get it right . Do n't be surprised that when you save the sweeps that the V1 makes some minor adjustments to your selections ..... this again because of internal calibration points . <p> Sweep #1 - Start point at or just below 34.600 / Stop point at or just below 34.770 ( V1 should adjust to 34.770 so long as you are within a few MHZ under ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or just above 34.774 / Stop point at or just above 34.800 ( again the V1 should adjust the start point to 34.774 if you can only get it within a few MHZ above that number . <p> Sweep #3 - Start point at or just below 35.400 / Stop point at or just above 35.600 . <p> That 's it ! Now you can click on the file button in the top right corner and save this as a new profile and choose what to call it ....... I called mine Custom Sweeps . <p> Before saving the profile you can also go back and change other settings such as enabling K-Band muting according to your preferences . <p> With Euro Mode / Custom sweeps enabled you will get a big C in the display . By clicking on the mode button at the top of the V1Connection display , you can switch to Ka Custom Sweeps which will turn off K-Band reception entirely and switch the display to little c .

All my comparisons are made to the escort X50 which I consider a pretty good radar detector ! The bike it 's for is a Honda CBR ' 05 F4i <p> Out of the box , the Cruisader looks like a nice piece of kit . The antennae looks quite durable had should easily mount inside the front fairing or just underneath it . I intend to mount the LED somewhere where it shines right in my eyes , but I doubt that it would be noticable in bright daylight ! The main display unit will be a much more difficult installation . None of the hardware supplied will work for the F4i . It seems to be more designed for " cruiser " handlebars than for sport bike " clip ons " . I 'm sure I 'll figure something out , but it wo n't be easy ! The display is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in daylight . The " in-helmet " display works remarkably well , although I have n't installed it yet so I do n't know how I will like it actually riding . <p> I 've been driving around with the unit set up on the dash of my car for a couple of weeks now , so I have a little insight on it 's operation . I 've also been running it alongside my escort ( I know , a radar testers taboo ! ) Here 's what I 've found after a recent road trip from Vancouver B.C. to Seattle : <p> Generally speaking , The Cruisader seems to be a bit less sensitive than the Escort . It reacted to false alarms on X and K bands later and stopped earlier than the Escort . All settings were on Highway . When the Whistler is put on City 1 it is quite a bit quieter in the city that the Escort on City . On the trip to Seattle , they each had 16 X falses . The Escort had 8 K falses while the Cruisader had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered as K on the Escort were reported as X on the Cruisader ! I do n't know what the impact would be if the x band were defeated on the Cruisader . The Cruisader had 2 Ka falses , while the Escort had none . There were no Laser falses . <p> Unfortunatly , I did n't come across any radar traps or those speed warning signs . The only thing I found was a possible interstate trap while I was off the highway at a cloverleaf " on ramp " ( off axis ) . The Escort went crazy on the K band ( 24.150 ) the whole time while the Cruisader just had a few blips . The Cruisader reacts appropriately to my " Highway Zapper " which triggers radar detectors on X band . <p> On the whole , I do n't think the Cruisader is as good a detector as the Escort , But there 's no way I 'm gon na have a portable on my bike . The detector must be permanently installed , weatherproof , concealed ( to police and thiefs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these attributes except the last one . In general , I do n't think that visual alerts work as well as audible ones ! The dash LED wo n't be that usefull . I 'll have to wait until I install the helmet display , but I think that it will work better ( but I 'm not sure about sunglasses ) . I 'm going to contact the radar screamer people and see if it will work with the cruisader. as I think that this might be the best warning . I 'm not sure if the Cruisader uses proprietary circuitry for it 's " add on voice module " or if it 's just a speaker . <p> Unfortunately , I still have n't accomplished the " acid test " - ie real radar , or at least a speed warning sign . After all , that 's what it 's really all about ! I will keep you posted when I have done the complete install and have some real radar results to post . <p> I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone knows if you can just attach an earpiece or speaker to the output jack please let me know . <p> 2 Secondly , I ca n't stand having wires hanging all over ( especially to my helmet ) <p> 3 I want something built in that 's always on . I do n't want to have to remove it everytime I get off the bike for a cup of coffee <p> I 'm not really worried about laser protection , cause it 's a waste of time anyways . I mulled over your option , and I might end up doing it if the Cruisader does n't work out . but I really want a nice buit in one . Thanks for the advice though . It 's way better than having one sticking out on a stem mount begging for a ticket or to be stolen . <p> I never liked tank bags either , but I finally had to cave . I have an autocom on my bike so I can have comm with a passenger . I also have bike2bike comm with a Kenwood radiol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May as well add the radar detector . Sooooooooooo , the good thing is I have the audio alert running through the autocom into my earphones . I also mounted the remote alert between wind dash and the dark windscreen . There are some very small tankbags out there ( triangular shaped ) that mount to special bolts on a gas LONG ... <p> The Crusader is a total piece of crap . I 've been through two of them and killed my 9 month old battery because it turns on by itself . I 'm in the process of taking the system off my bike and putting my Valentine 1 in a tank bag and using helmet speakers . <p> I had a Whistler car remote with similar experience which eventually got tossed . Like you I wanted a remote for my sport bike , and Whistler is the only game in town , so I broke down and tried it . So far I 've yet to find a trap , but I 've gone by a few cruiser 's parked on the side of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even go off . I 'm gon na install it anyway , and see if it 's any use at all ( but I doubt it is ! ! ! ) . Then I guess I 'll just put my escort in a tank bag . I still think remote is the way to go , now if someone would just make one ! ! ! !

It 's pretty old , maybe nearly 20 years old ... maybe older , not sure . <p> The one I have is pretty much useless though . It falses a lot , wo n't pick up multinova , ( Obviously wo n't pick up laser ) and it does n't really give me any protection at all .

These false radar signals are not just located in cities anymore . More &amp; more rural and highway travels are plagued by them . Constantly having to put up with these false alarms may cause you to gain distrust or in my case , have your wife demand the RD be turned off . BEL and Escort seam to have the solution with their GPS , red &amp; speed camera radar detectors . <p> In radar-detection performance the BEL PRO 500 ( GX65 replacement ) is a mirror image of the improved Escort Passport 9500ix . If auto scan is enabled by a push of a button , sensitivity is controlled automatically on X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speedzones new 2012 test showed the Pro 500 to have good sensitivity on 9 mile distance on all radar bands . <p> The Pro 500 has an automatic audio mute . All alarms bellow 20 MPH are a double tone and then the signal strength is displayed . It also has an auto mute setting that can be enabled or disabled . After the initial alert ( above 20 MPH ) it will sound to the volume set and then drop down after a few seconds . The V1 does have an available one speed mute setting add-on which I do not have , but its all integrated in this unit . <p> I wont go into the GPS lock out features or marked location . You can read about that in depth by reading the online manual available at Beltronics website . The software to download all the red-light &amp; speed cameras as well as firmware upgrades is pretty straight forward . You do need to power the unit with a 12 volt DC supply or 12 volt DC battery while hooking up the USB cable to your PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your car . It is Escort live capable also . <p> So how did it compare to my V1 in radar encounters ( highway mode ) ? I ran them separately &amp; together and low on the windshield . As far as raw sensitivity , V1 alerts first always on X band which is no surprise and a small margin on most of my K band encounters . Some encounters on K were equal . This I believe is part due to the Pro 500s DSP filtering of low X &amp; K band thresholds . As far as KA is concerned , they were pretty darn close . The V1 seems to be more sensitive from the extreme sides , which makes it very vulnerable to false alarms but gives it an edge in picking up corner traps sooner . <p> Going down to Cape Cod on the NYS thruway I encountered 3 laser ambushes from NYS troopers with the new Bel unit . One I definitely picked up scatter at a distance of over 700 ft. with cars directly in front of me . The other two encounters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit alerted accordingly , but I had visual I 'd on the officer for quite some time before he pulled the trigger . I had lots of sunlight but did not encounter any laser falses that some seam to have complained about from the GX65 . <p> As far as filtering out false alarms , the Pro 500 wins this category hands down over my V1 . There simply is no comparison . Manually being able to lock out false alarms with the GPS filter is a God send &amp; wifey likes it . <p> Now for the uglywith the Pro500 mounted low on the windshield , the suction cups work well but the unit does shake over bumpy roads . I guess all Escort and Bel units do this more or less . However , more than the V1 . The larger suction cup mount they sell may help stability . This shaking was a big turn off for me so I made a bracket for the dash . I call it the wedge . Angled to be horizontal yet boosts it above the wiper blade &amp; secured by Velcro.1002679.jpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard wire version has two LEDS &amp; a mute switch . Basic but does the job . There is no self or auto dimming of the remote LEDs . I find this to be an issue for night time driving as they are pretty darn bright . I might have to install a switch with a dropping resistor for the LEDs . It would be nice if they could address this with a firmware upgrade as the main display has different brightness settings a well as auto dim . The firmware updates are a nice access feature when available to download with the software . <p> Did I miss the V1 arrows when I was solo with the Pro 500 ? Well , not as much as I thought I would . Most of the encounters I could figure out were in front with a continuous increase in signal . The few I did encounter from the rear I figured out pretty quickly that they were from behind . There was one encounter where I could not figure out where the officer was or went to before the alert fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as with momentary radar transmissions . But the priority is to check your speed and adjust accordingly , then figure out where the cop is . <p> Over all I like the plethora of extra features &amp; capabilities you get with the Pro500 . It gets a big thumbs up from me . Radar Roy rates it #2 over its twin sister , the 9500ix . I believe it to be the #1 GPS detector for the money with the same performance as the 9500ix less a couple of features . <h> Re : My Review of the Beltronics PRO 500 &amp; comparing it to my V1 <p> Nice review Techhead . It 's great to hear that you , and your wife , are pleased with your Pro500 . <p> Please note that you do not need to supply the Pro500 ( or many GX65s ) with 12VDC when updating the detector 's camera database or firmware .

I also found in the owners manual that the TSR function under bands in the " quick reference " on page 3 , but on page 15 " overview of Programming " , it does n't mention TSR under bands nor does it explain it 's function . <p> Also , this unit does not have KU but it 's mentioned on the first page intro and pages 11,12,17,18 &amp;19 . <h> Re : My Review of the Beltronics PRO 500 &amp; comparing it to my V1 <p> UPDATE : So I have been driving with the PRO 500 for about a month now . Keeping my V1 off the dash while getting comfortable with the PRO 500 . <p> I must say I do miss the added side and rear sensitivity that the V1 has but not the false alarms that go along with it . The Pro 500 has good sensitivity upfront but its like a horse with blinders from the sides and of course not having a rear antenna make it less sensitive from rear faint signals . So its a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " detector . <p> I also encountered a few more threats where I did in deed miss those V1 arrows . <p> So I may go with my other setup which is the V1 with my GPS for the speed &amp; red light cameras as well as known speed traps and purchase the SAVVY to quiet the V1 . With that said I do still like the Pro 500 but its not a V1.

So being able to quickly disable and enable the filter would be great instead of relying to go into programming modes to do it . <p> With respect to their update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse 's mouth . <p> The " new " Junk-K fighter is just an update to the marketing terms to help people understand that TMF and TMF2 also reduce alerts from these nanny systems . No new features or version numbers at this time . v3.894 is the latest and TMF2 remains the only filter option for this currently . <p> One thing to consider . TMF2 was really designed for those that drive vehicle that have the rear K-band system always on . If another K-band signal is detected that is very close in freq to your rear transponder it is possible that the detector will then continually alert to the rear emissions continually requiring a power off to eliminate it . <p> If you do n't drive with such a vehicle , TMF should be sufficient and I believe TMF does n't quite give you the hit in delay as TMF2 does . So , I believe there is a case to be made to keep the version where only TMF is incorporated . Too bad that they do n't give you the ability to toggle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be a nice feature . Whistler gives you the ability to tweak the " delays " in their models .

To call it a " TMF and junk K fighter " , ok for the future ........ Another thing , MV is ( was ) getting away from the V1 's motto , but maybe he got tired of the false alarms like we have ?

This is a huge concern especially considering many states/common wealths are currently developing legislation to ban the use of lidar/laser jamming devices . This all combined with the fact that even top of the line modern detectors are lucky today even to detect potential lidar/laser scatter is moot . This is even so for high end units such as max 2 or 360 redline v1 or Radenso pro se , or even the new uniden lines . Thus , the information I 'm about to share is very intense .

This Notice explains the scope of FCC regulation over these devices . It updates and supersedes the Public Notice on the same subject dated August 1 , 1985 . <p> Radar units are transceivers , i.e. they both transmit and receive a signal , and operate under rules for the Radiolocation Service contained in Part 90 of the FCC 's Rules . As such , they are certified and authorized by the FCC under Parts 2 and 90 of the FCC 's Rules . Part 90 specifies the frequencies and technical standards for radar units , but does not address how radar units are to be operated as devices to measure an object 's speed . Also , the FCC Rules do not contain provisions concerning the calibration of radar units , the reliability of the readings , or operator capability requirements . <p> Radar units are used by police and other public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rules , licensees in the Public Safety Radio Pool ( such as state or local government entities ) , that already have a FCC license for a radio communications system , may operate radar units without obtaining a separate license for them . Radar units may also be used under Part 90 by non-public safety entities such as professional baseball teams , tennis clubs , automobile and boat racing organizations , private transportation firms , railroads , etc. , to measure the speed of objects or vehicles . Non-public safety users , however , are required to obtain a Part 90 license from the Commission for use of radar units . Additionally , many public safety agencies also operate unattended , low-power , transmit-only radar units under Part 15 of the FCC 's Rules . <p> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) is the federal agency concerned with the enforcement of highway speed limits and with the operation of radar as enforcement tools . Information on NHTSA regulations concerning radar use can be obtained from the Department of Transportation , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20590 . <p> Radar jammers are transmitters tuned to interfere with ( " jam " ) a radar signal . The intentional use of jammers is considered " malicious interference " and is strictly prohibited by the Communications Act of 1934 , as amended , as well as by FCC Rules . Anyone using a jammer risks such penalties as losing an FCC licenses , paying a fine , or facing criminal prosecution . <p> Radar detectors are radio receivers tuned to receive radar signals and are used by motorists to provide a warning of any radar activity in the vicinity . In this regard , the FCC regulations pertaining to receivers do not address the subject of radar detectors . The use of radar detectors by members of the public , therefore , does not constitute in itself a violation of FCC Rules . Some jurisdictions , however , have local regulations or statutes concerning the use of radar detectors . Inquiries about such statutes should be directed to local law enforcement authorities . <p> In summary , the FCC Rules regulate radar transmitting units but provide limited regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being specifically addressed in the FCC Rules . For more information about the subject of this notice , contact the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau , Public Safety and Private Wireless Division , at ( 202 ) 418-0680 . <p> " A licensee of a radio station in this service may operate radio units for the purpose of determining distance , direction , speed , or position by means of a radiolocation device on any frequency available for radiolocation purposes without additional authorization from the Commission , provided type accepted equipment or equipment authorized pursuant to 90.203(b) ( 4 ) and ( b ) ( 5 ) of this part is used , and all other rule provisions are satisfied .

The performance of the V1 has stayed fairly consistant over the last few years with mostly only slightly programming software changes , again to fix any issues that may have showed up or to add new features . Example , ghosting ( when the V1 shows 2 radars instead of one radar ) or directional issues are mostly fixed with software changes . Most gimmic users grip about the V1 staying the same over the years , but the advantage of this is to work out the bugs which makes the Valentine 's performance and design top dog in my experiences ....

Have you done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off ? <p> More or less every simple radar detector should detect the Poliscan , since the RD " sees " the laser fan as a single laser beam with 100 Hz . Detection varies greatly due to the chosen position of the lidar device and the working principle itself . As I mentioned in some of my previous posts , the rotating mirror which is spreading the laser beams works very unsteady . Another reason could be that the RD filters out the laser beams up to a specific distance to the laser device , because of the overlapping laser beams . <p> I hope i can do some measurements in the near future ( when spare time is available ) and take a closer look at the pulsrate characteristics . <p> Ghost9 <p> 02-09-2011 , 05:21 PM <p> It would help if i told you in some point i just stopped my car in front of saher 's car . i was just looking for a signal ! but nothing .. we tried to reinstall laser shifters in front of the car and we did test in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there was no signal at all . mounting the sensor was n't the problem its self . the point of this to get just signal not to be sure if shifters can jam or not .

I do not think the 9500ci is capable of shifting the Poliscan but , because Poliscan is constantly transmitting laser and a wide dispersion of it , the 9500ci should detect it very well in advance .

So the radio is 50ohms , the coax is 50ohms and if the antenna is not 50ohms it will cause some power to be reflected and is referred to as standing waves , and can be measured with an SWR meter . If you can make the antenna 50ohms you should have an SWR of 1:1 . <p> Some antennas are not 50ohm antennas and you do not trim them for the lowest SWR . An example is a full size 1/4 wave whip . Going by memory they will most likely be 35ohms , however you can get fancy and do impedance matching with the coax length so the radio sees 50ohms . <p> Note : a 1:1 SWR is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It only means that the meter is not reading any standing waves .

Anyways , I was pissed that they used my chart to milk more money from poor un-educated buyers , so I sent them a e-mail where I asked them where/how did they get that chart and if they are 100% sure that it 's the correct info.Next day I got an e-mail from them , where they claimed that all the info , including my chart , came directly from Mike V. <p> I want to thank DougiesGoinDeep for starting this thread.I appreciate your self-iniciative.I tought about doing it myself , but I chose not to , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get info that way and -if not stickied- the thread goes cold in less than a week.I also want to thank TheStanton for making it a sticky .

A radar detector will still be better than nothing . Note also that CA is pretty heavily littered by K band noise from industry and traffic sensors .

They seemed tight enough already ( enough for grounding I would think ) , but they did turn slightly . I also snugged up the horn screws from the topside . One of those screws , a flat , inset screw was loose . The topside screws only hold the horn together tight . <p> I live on a gravel road and have about 3-4 miles to go to the highway . Screws coming loose has been a problem in the past . I had an old laptop that would drop screws . The vibration in the vehicle works things loose . <p> I reset accordingly and have it in the house now and there has been no self calibration failure so far . It did not go into the self calibration mode following the reset ; however , it does not self calibrate every time , so it may or may not be fixed . I 'll see how it does . Thanks . <p> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get any self cal messages after a week or two of use , then you might want to dip the tip of each screw , each one removed one at a time , in contact cement and then reinstall each screw . This should permanently resolve the self cal problems since the screws wo n't be able to easily work loose in the future . Unfortunately contact cement dries much more quickly than ThreeBond , so you will likely have to create several puddles of contact cement while you proceed to dip each screw in the contact cement . You can use some isopropyl alcohol to slow the contact cement 's drying process though ! <p> Not one self calibration message today all of the way to work and back . Does the loose connection cause the self calibration ? I presumed the detector would automatically self calibrate following a certain number of start-ups as part of its regular processing . My thought was , if the self calibration failed , it would again try to self calibrate another 1 or 2 restarts . <p> I am curious about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the detector communicate externally ( doubtful ) ?

Thanks . <p> My theory is that the slightly loose screws cause a flaky ground connection for the horn , and that this somehow interferes with the self calibration process . <p> Belscort radar detector models self calibrate upon every power-up and then periodically thereafter while powered on in order to correct for temperature induced frequency drift . The self calibration process is an internal one which basically involves a process of precisely adjusting the voltage to the local oscillators to make the local oscillators produce the correct frequencies relative to a single on-board crystal reference frequency . The circuitry for the on-board crystal is temperature compensated . <p> Anyway , it sounds like your self calibration and service required issues are resolved . Use your RD for several days more and if all is good , then open it back up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would NOT use loc-tite on the screws ! The screws are tiny and loc-tite is extremely strong stuff ! You probably will never be able to get the screws out again without completely stripping the heads . Contact cement , once cured for a day or two , has more than enough holding power yet will allow the screws to be removed if need be for servicing in the future . Just get a small amount of contact cement on the bottom third of each screw . That will be more than enough to prevent the screws from working loose in the future . You could dab some contact cement atop each screw head and onto the surrounding circuit board to secure each screw , but that would look really tacky and could pull off the silicone overcoat on the circuit board . Again , a bit of contact cement on the bottom part of each screw would be the best method and will do the needed job of preventing these screws from working loose . <p> Maybe I should have said , " The circuitry for the on-board crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Heck , I am not really sure if Belscort is using additional circuitry in conjunction with the crystal to assure a very accurate reference frequency regardless of ambient temperature . It may be that the reference frequency from the crystal is stable enough throughout the specified operating temperature range of their radar detectors that an additional temperature compensation circuit is not needed . This really is a question for Jimbonzzz , the Professor , since he has delved into the operation of radar detectors in general considerably more deeply than I have . <p> A crystal oscillator by nature is very stable over temperature changes . In the X50 , the 1st LO is calibrated by examining mixer products which result from mixing the first LO with the 2nd LO . Since the 2nd LO is crystal referenced , the 1st LO can be accurately calibrated . <p> Michael , It 's doing great . Not one self-calibration failure since tightening the screws and resetting . It starts up normally and has been remarkably quiet all week . It only alerted a few times this week , KA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county is K. There has been a lot of rain here this past week which translates into fewer to none running radar . <p> I believe it is working fine now , similar to its behavior when new . It is in highway mode and is detecing about a mile . The county will run his K constantly , so it is easy to tell as the signal becomes stronger . Many thanks ! <p> If and when the problem occurs again , I will put some contact cement on the screws .

I 'm only stateing that so my credability is established . I am in no way a local or county or state officer but I have had the pleasure of riding as a civilian with all the mentioned officers . In Ohio , to ride with State Troopers , you have to be a reservist and it 's like " pulling hair " to get the Post Commanders to let you ride along even with those credentials ! In Ohio , your local and County officers mainly use the usual radar unites and of course Laser guns . You truely need your radar detector wide open with all bands on here because you never know what counter measure device your car or motorcycle will encounter ? All officers young and old male or female are experts in R/F Hold ( Instant On ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ka band here in Ohio because it really does n't matter if your triggering your radar unite ! One thing is for sure , there 's NO radar guns ! One of my friends from way back lost his father in law who was an Ohio State Trooper and he was a master with the Radar Gun . He died from testicular cancer in which MAY have been caused by his use of a Radar Gun ? Anyway , no more Radar Guns are being used by any law enforcement that I have noticed ? The Ohio State Patrol knows that detectors are legal in all of Ohio so they have Radar School once a year to train all rookies and even current officers on the use of R/F Hold as an art form . In other words , to have the " upper hand " in the cat and mouse game of catching you with your pants down ! It 's been very effective for sure ! The Laser gun pretty much closed the deal on counter measuring ! It 's very accurate , easy to single out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at great distances and can not be detected but only jammed with any confidence . Once they perfect it to use while moving , forget it brother but , how safe would that be . The officer would only have one hand on the wheel ! Well , they would make it hands free ? I get a kick out of these old farts that are using detectors from the 80 's and swear they are effective ? There old detectors only can detect X and K band . It 's because Ohio State Patrol still widely uses X band . We all know that 's a primative band width but as I said , in R/F Hold , it 's still effective . All the Trooper knows is that if he uses his radar unite in R/F Hold , he has a better chance at nailing you . The Trooper could n't care less which band is in use ! But , if grandpa motors into the city , he has about a 90% chance of getting zapped by Ka Super Wide and guess what , it 's citation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 years ago at this time setting " blacked out " and using his Laser gun in pitch black darkness . He was so proud of himself because he saw my Bell attached to my windshield . I , repectfully , reminded him about setting stationary with no running lights on ? He then handed me my license back and said , " Have a nice day ! " Sometimes you may have to question authority but do it tactfully . The officer has a choice , a verbal warning or written citation . One of the two will save you a lot of money ! <h> Building on what radar wizard says : <p> Any continuous wave ( CW ) radar transmitter held in " instant on " mode will no doubt be quite effective against the RD , if the traffic is light and the operator can lay off zapping each car as they go by . Long range detection is your friend here along with the drivers ' attentiveness . <p> BTDT with Speedguns and K-15 II . <p> Until the CW radar is replaced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be tracked and identified separately , the speed reading will always be questioned in its association with a specific vehicle as well as its accuracy . <p> Just a short browse of Ebay every few months produces the kit radar gizmo that sends back the tune " its a small world after all ......

I once beat a LIDAR ticket because the LEO said his windows were up and the Operator 's Manual ( LTI 20/20 , I believe ) said not to operate through glass . I actually thought he was covering for a different mistake . Admittedly , that was almost 10 years ago and technology may change . They may well have added processing to ignore the stronger in-car reflections and accept only the distant target reflection . On the other hand , the laws of physics tell me that shooting IR through an insulator such as glass is a sure way to significantly reduce targeting range ( think Veil for the LIDAR gun ) . I suppose the visible targeting beam *might* go through without much refraction error , but does it really work to transmit and acquire reflected IR from an external target through a closed window ? I know when I use my infrared pyrometer , it just does not work through glass -- it just reports the temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I watched a local LEO shot though the glass a while ago .

Was working a 30 mph zone near my house and was kept busy most of the shift . Best reading of the day was about 48 mph . <p> To reiterate , yes they can shoot lidar through the the glass . It does reduce the effective range , so that can help you , I believe if memory serves correct some lidar gun have an operation mode to help compensate shooting through the glass . <p> I have personally shot a Prolaser II through the front windshield glass and got lock ons but yes , the range is severely reduced .

Sounds damn dangerous I know but it works if you are shot at a longer distance , say over 500yards . <p> I have also had problems locking on cars with headlights on high beam at night , I guess it interferes a little . <p> the infiniti qx56 are the ones that false on laser all the time i passthem al l the time its the cruise control sensor that sets off my v1 and then goes laser .. and yes you can shoot laser threw glass window of a car i have a prolaser II but i get min range by doing it . at most i get 500 feet threw the car window shooting threw the window . <p> Radarrob is a approved radar detector and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radar and Lidar Guns to test systems.Need Help Choosing a Radar Detector or parking sensor for your needs ?

The oblique angles of most windshields will often reduce the effective range of the system , and in addition , some windshields are treated with a coating that blocks the infrared emissions , making operation impossible .

I see Troop T ( Troopers that patrol the Thruway ) is using Troop G 's ( Albany area ) tactics too now , aka , hiding on the right side of the road . <p> Yesterday , went from Albany to Rochester . No rain . From Albany to Utica , I saw two cars pulled over on the side . Other than that , no cops in the middle . After Syracuse , I saw two cops , driver 's door to driver 's door , on the right side of the road . No alert . I was doing 85 . They must have been talking because I did n't get pulled over . <p> I had to stop at exit 43 and get gas . I was in some hillbilly town and I picked up a Ka . Speed limit was 30 , so I figured since I did n't know the area , to slow down . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ka alert and it 'd go away . Then the alert stayed on . There was a lady trooper , ( young and blonde ; - ) ) , who was going the opposite way as me and had her constant on radar on . I was picking that up for about a mile . If only she knew the wonders of instant on . <p> K band drones on the middle and side of the road near Rochester . They 're usually on the signs . <p> Today , it was raining off and on . Going from Rochester to Utica , no alerts until near Utica . I get a 2/9 signal and then it stops . I 'm thinking , " oh a cop 's going the opposite way , or instant on up ahead " . I do n't see anything . A minute later , I get another 2/9 signal and it stops a second or two later . I still see nothing . Drive for another mile or so , and get another 2/9 signal and it stops . Since I 'm only using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , it 's just falsing . NOPE ! I decide to bring my speed back up to 80 something and then I see my exit and slow down ... about a tenth of a mile before my exit ... guess what ? Trooper with instant on . He did n't even shoot me since I saw my exit and was doing 70 by then . I was picking him up shooting people with instant on from about THREE miles away . <p> For my trip back to Albany tonight , hopefully it 's raining just enough that they do n't use laser . <p> well just did my trip and i have no idea how you picked up instant on from 3 miles away with a whistler , i had about 3 ka enconters with the x-50 , and it was basicly about a second or two before i saw the cop , and this was constant on . i 'm thinking this maybe was because of the hills further east on the thruway and my car sits pretty low so maybe it cant see alot of the radar signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direction so i guess the distance closes pretty fast , but i was not to impressed <p> Here are my experiences on the Thruway - New Jersey to Albany and the Northway Albany to VT/Lake George . <p> With my X50 I can pick up a Ka alert very easily , usually with atlest 1 mile to slow down , sometimes more depending on the partol cars location and the terrain . <p> The State Troopers love to speed trap from the medians where you see the U-Turn signs , especially in the wooded spots where its harder to see their dark blue cruisers . <p> Personally I am not sure if they use instant on , because everytime I see one drive past me on the other side of the highway , in 90% of all instances and I have driven Northway/Thruway countless times , Ka lights up on the X50 just before the cop passes and stays on , not a lot of warning but I assume they have their radar always on . <p> On the Thruway south of Albany I recieved a laser warning by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill , luckly for me there where about five other cars in the fast lane , no ticket . <p> On the Northway I believe instant on or Laser may be in use , as I have passed police in the median speed trapping to the other side of the highway and I received no radar alerts in limited cases , usually I would with received a Ka warning with the X50 as their radars are always on . <p> Bottom line - Ka is being used and the cops are not exactly being sneaking about it , but that does n't mean they wo n't pull you over , as in about 70% of all instances with cops on the thruway and Northways when I receive and alert they have someone pulled over already . <p> I-81 Binghamton to Syracuse there are a limited number of patrollers but airplanes are used in addiction to Ka band cruisers . <p> If you like to speed and you have a V1 , X50 , or the good Bel Rd new york does n't really have anything that can stop you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the Northway is laser galore . You have to be VERY careful . They *are* sneaky with laser and I 've seen them be very sneaky and selective with instant on radar , too . I 've seen laser on the median and right side of the road speed traps more than the radar . This summer , because of work , I 've done probably 1000 miles of driving on the Thruway and Northway . Just today saw someone pulled over around exit 5 on the Northway . When I 'm going back to Albany about 20 mins later , I remembered that , and sure enough , same cop in the middle shooting my direction now . <p> Definately watch out for their Joey Chitwood u-turns and gravel spitting in your windshield as they cut you off so they can get in hot pursuit of their next donut fix . Seen that more than once ! ! I travel to upstate NY quite a lot as we have a vacation home in Middleburgh . Last time up I was talking with a state trooper at a wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have thruway and northway duty are ones who have been written up for various reasons . Either from having bad attitudes ( general a-holes ) or too many civilian complaints . Also the troopers running I-87 and I-90 are the only ones who have a quota for tickets per day , they have to write 2 a day before they get off shift . Apparently thruway duty is boring and noone wants to pull it , hence it is left to the problem children . <p> Not True . Troop G covers the Northway around Albany up past Saratoga . They randomly assign officers to it . Troop T an officer can transfer to after a few years . I know a lot who were on Troop whatever , went to Troop T and then went to a different Troop .

Can everyone post any schematics of laser jammers they use or have made before please ? Right from detection of the laser through-out to transmitting a nice confusing laser back : wink : Thanks if anyone can help me . If possible as well try to avoid ones with PIC 's in cause I ca n't program them to save my life . <p> No one know any schematics then i 'm guessing : P OK is there anyone here who knows exactly the specifcations of the pulses these laser guns give off then and i 'll device a circuit for myself . I 've done a bit more reading and these Lidar mark 3 or whatever seem to be the tricky ones to jam and something about them being impossible when used in stealth mode . What does this do to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message , thanks . <p> Jamming a laser gun is not a trivial undertaking , the guns today are very sophisticated . Evan many of the commercially available jammers havs some trouble with certain laser guns . If you expect to be able to go down to your local RadioShack to buy parts and then take them home and solder them together to make a working jammer , it is n't going to happen . So , basically that 's why there are n't really any schematics around ! And any that are around , probably are n't effective at all . <p> The trick to jamming , is to make the laser gun interpret a jamming pulse as it 's own reflected pulse . The first pulse received by the gun after sending a pulse is the one the gun accepts . Anything received outside of that window is simply ignored . So to jam the laser gun , one must ensure that a jamming pulse is received by the gun after sending out it 's own pulse , but before that reflected pulse is received back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pps sends out a pulse every 5 milliseconds , or .005 seconds . <p> At 1000 feet , the pulse has a time of flight of about 2.32 microseconds , or .00000232 seconds . <p> So at 1000 feet , you would have to ensure that a jamming pulse reached the gun in that 2.32 microsecond window in order to have any kind of jamming effect . If one were to simply pulse laser diodes or an LED at the same rate as the gun , without being closely timed to the incoming pulses from the laser gun they would have to fall into the window at random . Using this technique , at 1000 feet you would have about a 1 in 2155 chance of having any kind of a jamming effect : .005 / .00000232 = 2155 . At 500 feet , you would have a 1 in 4310 chance . At 250 , you would have a 1 in 8620 chance . And even if you were to get lucky and the pulses fell into the window at those distances , as you approach the gun there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window as time of flight decreases . <p> Historically , there have been two methods in use to jam effectively : <p> 1 ) Constant-pulse jamming . This method was used by the Lidatek LE10 and Target LE850 . First detect the laser , and then send back constant pulses at a very high frequency so that no matter what , at least one jamming pulse is received in this " window " . If the pulse frequency is 2 MHz , this ensures that there will always be at least one pulse within the " time of flight " window , down to around 250 feet from the vehicle : <p> 1 second / 2000000 = .0000005 seconds , or .5 microseconds . Time of flight for the pulse @ 250 feet is .00000058 seconds , or .58 microseconds . Therefore , at least one pulse always falls into the " window " <p> So to consistently jam at closer distances , an even higher frequency is necessary . This method requires overdriving the laser diode beyone it 's rated specs , most are rated in the KHz range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MHz frequencies for a very short time period without overheating and burning up , such as 5 seconds which is probably enough to adjust your speed . Unfortunately , jamming time is limited because of the need to overdrive the laser diode . Also , utilizing this method is not very eye-safe . This method also prevents the use of LEDs for jamming : LED 's have much slower rise/fall times than laser diodes , so they can not be operated at the high frequencies necessary and still produce pulses . <p> But the good thing about this constant-pulse method , is that it would probably be the easiest and most effective method that is most accessible to " hobbyists " , as very little processing and timing is necessary , and it should be effective against all laser guns . <p> 2 ) Time the pulses based on the pulses received from the laser gun : the " smarter " method . This method is used by most if not all of the current major production jammers . In this method , pulses from the gun are received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulses will be received based on the previous pulses . The jammer then sends a jamming pulse slightly before the next pulse is received form the laser gun , but slightly varies the timing of the jamming pulses so that the distance calculation will vary wildly . This way , the gun always sees a jamming pulse before it 's own reflected pulse and interprets the jamming pulse as it 's own reflected pulse , but the corresponding distance measurements are too inconsistent to calculate a speed . The pulses can be more precisely controlled using this method , in order to jam more effectively against different guns , prevent tripping " jamming codes " on the gun etc . <p> As far as methods like " flooding the gun with light " so that it is unable to pick out it 's own pulse from the " noise floor " , these methods are not practial . Technically this could be done , but the amount of light necessary to do this effectively would probably be quite expensive to produce ( a LOT of CW laser diodes used together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lower-powered continuous light sources are n't likely to do much at all , especially using low-powered LEDs . The guns use techniques such as averaging out the noise and adjusting thresholds to prevent such methods . At best , you might be able to cut the range down very slightly , if at all . <p> As for simply pulsing some LEDs , you might be able to get very lucky and jam one or two of the guns ( Jenoptik Laserpatrol ) once in a while at farther distances ( if some of the pulses happen to fall into the " time of flight " window ? ) . But this would certainly not be consistent , and as the time of flight decreases as you approach the gun making any jamming less likely . Also , there would n't be any good way to improve this further , without using one of the methods outlined above . <p> I wonder if it would be possible to use multiple pulsed diodes , kind of like a " gattling gun " . It looks like you would need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at reduced output , but faster pulse rate - has anyone tried this ? <p> Also , is the pulse rate consistent from the guns ? i.e. for the LTI , do the pulses come at regular 10 ms intervals , or do they mix it up ? If it 's regular , it should be fairly easy to predict when the next pulse would be sent . <p> I wonder if it would be possible to use multiple pulsed diodes , kind of like a " gattling gun " . It looks like you would need a lot of diodes . I suppose you could run them at reduced output , but faster pulse rate - has anyone tried this ? <p> In my opinion that would be a VERY good method to mitigate the heat etc when using a constant-pulse technique : have multiple laser diodes that " share the load " . <p> Originally Posted by ptpark <p> Also , is the pulse rate consistent from the guns ? i.e. for the LTI , do the pulses come at regular 10 ms intervals , or do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be fairly easy to predict when the next pulse would be sent . <p> Yes the pulse rate of the guns is fixed , and if the vehicle was stopped , each pulse would be received at a fixed interval . However , there 's also the time of flight of the pulse to take into account as well : when the vehicle is moving , time of flight decreases as the vehicle approaches the gun . For example , at 1000 feet the laser gun 's pulse would take 1.16 microseconds to travel from the gun to the vehicle , and at 500 feet the pulse would take .58 microseconds to travel from the gun to the vehicle . So after the cop pulls the trigger on the laser gun , as the vehicle approaches the gun it sees each pulse at a slightly " sooner " interval than the previous pulse . <p> If the jammer knew the distance to the laser gun ( which I do n't think it does ) it could simply fire a jamming pulse so that it is received at the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-30 ns or something ) . But , since the jammer does not know how far it is to the gun ( that I know of ) , it must continue to compare pulses received from the gun in order to be able to predict the next pulse and send a jamming pulse slightly before the next one is received . <p> Hmmm upon yet further reading and research these jammers are n't the easiest thing to make ' at home ' but my next question .... has n't anyone taken one of these popular jammers like the Blinder or anti-laser and devised the circuit layout upon inspection for themselves . They ca n't be as bad as a computer motherboard or anything : ? i think . I 'm not pretending I know more about electronics than the people who professionally make these jammers but if I was given a schematic I 'd gladly try reproduce and improve them . Also by looking at the results from the " guys of lidar " tests , is there not one jammer that all the time jams every gun lol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be nice and what i 'd expect if investing $300-$500 you know . <p> I 'll be posting the schematics for a " primitive " jammer soon . Just testing a few receiver circuits . It will be a constant pulse jamming type with a few twists to it . It will be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of LED 's or laser diodes , depending on how much you want to spend . 8 ) <p> In principle it will detect a Lidar pulse , send the jamming pulses for a period of time , check for pulse , jam again , etc . <p> The intention is to pulse at 2MHz but with very little mods it can pulse at 4MHz in sequential mode ( or even at 8MHz - depends how far you want to go ) . <p> I have looked at an intelligent jammer , but with stealth modes and variable pulse rates on the guns , I consider it a bit advanced at this stage due to lack of info on the guns . <p> Testing these receivers just take so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuits will surprise a lot of people . : wink : <p> I suppose for regular rate lidar , you could measure the time between the first two pulses you saw , and then use that to anticipate when to send the jamming pulse , hopefully just before the next one is received from the lidar system . Since you would still be getting the pulses from the lidar system , you could judge how successful the jamming may be . I wonder if lidar systems have a mechanism for rejecting speeds when it appears as though multiple reflections are being received . I guess you could factor in the speed of your own vehicle as well , although I do n't think that would help much . <p> I 'm trying to make the design so that a microprocesser can be easily added at a later stage . <p> I think the next move for the Lidar guns will be to transmit at random pulse rates , hence I prefer to kick of with a constant pulse jammer . It has its own possibilities ie you could also change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 6 MHz ) . : wink :

I do them all out of pocket and on my personal time . <p> I maintain that the top model Whistlers have for some time offered great value for the buck . Ka and Laser is very good . K-band lane assist filtering ( by time delays only , not sensitivity reductions ) are unmatched by any other detector regardless of price point . Whistlers have always been extremely fast at response too . Whistlers also offer programming capability that is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ) . For example , they are the only ones that allow a user to fine-tune reactivity to X and K and then Ka and can filter out specific laser pulse rates . They also can detect hard to detect lasers ( probably only second to the V1 ) . These things are n't a matter of opinion , they 're reproducible facts . They give you a lot of detector for $150-$170 street price . Mike B is a great guy and humble guy . A straight shooter that has no equal that I know of in this industry . Whistlers are n't marketed with over the top claims . These subtle capabilities are just there for savvy owners to discover--which reminds me of VR to a large degree . <p> I fell in love with Whistler the day I witnessed a $100 detector of theirs absolutely smoke a $2000 Kforzero remote . <p> I once drove across the state of Wyoming for extended periods of time in excess of 100mph and I did it with a Whistler .

Some drivers believe Route 17 is the newest addition to the NASCAR circuit . <p> And state police are there to remind them to the contrary . <p> Nearly half of 553 tickets issued from 2006 to 2008 for speeds of 100 mph or greater in Orange , Sullivan and Ulster counties went to motorists lead-footing it on Route 17 , state figures reveal . <p> " People get a false sense of their driving skills because the road is smooth and open , " said Sgt. Scott Mohl , traffic supervisor for state police Troop F. " They think they can exceed the speed limit in those areas . I guess they do n't think they are going to get caught . " <p> While Route 17 is most attractive to extreme speeders , expressways such as the Thruway and I-84 are not immune . In 2006-08 , police issued 160 tickets to drivers of 100 mph or more on the Thruway , and 82 such tickets on I-84 . <p> Just last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thruway . After fleeing police , he was eventually nabbed when his motorcycle ran out of gas . <p> To reach such speeds does not necessarily require a motorcycle , however . Conventional cars have always been able to hit 100 mph or more , Mohl said , but modern technology , from suspension to tires , makes it much easier . <p> " They seem to handle a little smoother and perform with a little less effort , " he said . " It makes it easier for people to feel comfortable behind the wheel . " <p> A 71-year-old man was clocked doing 100 mph on Route 17 in the Town of Liberty in 2008 . <p> Of all the tickets where data was available , motorists were going an average of 19 mph above the posted speed limit . <p> The lowest speeding ticket went to a driver doing 22 mph in a 5 mph-posted parking lot in Ulster County . <p> Source : New York state Department of Motor Vehicles ' Traffic Safety Law Enforcement and Disposition system <p> Extreme hazard on the road <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle such speeds . <p> There are formulas involved when designing expressways , said state Department of Transportation regional traffic engineer Michael Cotton . Engineers make sure there is enough time and space between exit signs and ramps for drivers to react safely . Curves are designed to be handled at specific speeds . <p> These are all things that motorists driving at high speeds may be unable to handle . <p> " We , as drivers , all know intuitively the faster you drive , the less control you have , " Cotton said . <p> Extreme speeding dramatically impacts a motorist 's field of vision and peripheral vision and reduces the time to process information and react to it . That , in turn , can increase the probability of a crash . <p> In his capacity as a volunteer emergency medical technician , Cotton sees a correlation between the severity of an accident and the speed at which the motorist was traveling . <p> Nearly 200 of 733 car crashes between July 1 , 2006 , and June 30 , 2008 , on Route 17 between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaza , were attributed to unsafe speeds , according to the state Department of Transportation . That was the second-highest contributing factor after tailgating . <p> Why the need for speed ? <p> One local psychology professor cites the need for conformity and the rush of adrenaline . <p> " I think cognitively , they think of it as doing what they need to do , or doing what everyone else does , " she said . <p> If everyone does it and it 's not really breaking the law , it cognitively gives people permission to do it , she said . Some of it may be that people want instant gratification and drive faster to get to their destination more quickly . <p> " I think people are very impatient , " she said . " For some , the time spent in the car is not seen as relaxing . It 's seen as something you need to do so you can get to the place you need to go . " <p> " It 's a big adrenaline rush , " she said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true danger in it . " <p> Excuses abound <p> Mohl has heard all kinds of other explanations for speeding : " I have to go to the bathroom real bad , " " I 'm late for school or work " or " I left something on my stove , " and even " I 'm on my way to court . " <p> Using accident information and complaints , Mohl sets up speed and aggressive driving details on the roads . The details generally last six hours , with troopers saturating an area with the goal of issuing tickets for speeding and any other moving violations they spot . <p> Drivers can give any excuse they want , but in the end , it does n't matter . <p> " We do n't care why they are doing it , " he said . " We just care that they are , and we 're trying to send a message that they should n't be . "

Like a proper way to set it up or something ? Thanks in advance <p> Did he have a radar gun pointed at you ? It is a radar detector but if the leo doesn t have his radar on you will not be alerted . Read through the forum there is a lot of very knowledgeable people here and they are very helpful <h> Re : Bought XTR-558 <p> If you need to mount it low , dead center and at least 3-4 inches above dashboard . If you have it mounted too low the antiglare on the edges of the windshield may reduce its performance . Same rule if you elect to put it in the dash itself - use a dash mount so it is elevated enough to see down the road clearly .

" I recently reviewed the Beltronics GT-7 Radar Detector , which is basically identical to this device . Here are the differences : 1 . Directional arrows on the right side that show where the radar is originating in relation to your car . I actually found this feature to be quite useful while driving and making braking/acceleration decisions . 2 . You can turn off the " over speed " alarm and can now set it all the up to 160 ( limit of 99 on the Beltronics and you could not turn it off ) . 3 . The enclosure is aesthetically different , it 's darker and more pleasing to the eye . <p> Ok , here 's the kick in the pants that brought my Beltronics review to 3 stars ... Escort is taking a value-subtraction business model by removing core functionality of the device . This is an attempt to get you to subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also collect a database on you that can be sold to third . This includes your name , you email address , your driving record , the physical locations , and how much you like to speed . Hmmm , what third parties would be interested in such information ? <p> Ok , so I 'll be the guinea pig this time around and sign up for the service . I drive a 2009 Corvette and have an Escort Redline ( 5 stars , by the way ) installed . Now I have the Max 360 beside it and I 'm ready to attach this thing to my smart phone .

Alpharetta and Sandy Springs police departments have a new gizmo that mounts on patrol cars and is capable of reading up to 18 to 20 license plates a second , and detecting which ones the police need to stop . The license plate reader can scan license plates in the hurly-burly of Ga . 400 going in both directions . It can accurately read license plates of cars going 120 mph in rain , dark , or sunshine . " Its a great thing , " said Alpharetta Public Safety Director Gary George . " Think of Amber Alerts , stolen cars , outstanding warrants . " Alpharetta and Sandy Springs each have one license-plate reader , which costs $22,000 to $35,000 , but several cars are wired for it . " We keep it on the road constantly , " said spokesman George Gordon . " You can unplug it and transfer to another car in two minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the system became went online last August , he was driving home after a shift when the system alerted him that he had passed a stolen car .

" Its helped find a dead body in a stolen car in New York . In New Haven , Conn. , police used them to catch tax delinquents . In a four-month trial in Ohio , the highway patrol captured 23 suspects , and recovered 24 stolen cars . Sandy Springs Officer Scott Ellis said that in the past month , he s recovered three stolen cars that might otherwise not have been recovered .

License-readers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gwinnett and DeKalb counties have them as well . The license-plate reader is not a Big Brother-type surveillance device , George said . It scans and discards the license tags on cars that have no warrants on them , hanging only on to wanted plates in the police database . Even if it did store all the license plates it encountered , the license-plate reader still would not be an invasion of privacy , he said . " You have no expectation of privacy on a public road , " George said . " I do n't  want us to be Big Brother . " Whether its a proper tool for law enforcement depends on how its used , said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington D.C. " The same technology that can be used to identify unregistered vehicles can also identify cars of participants in a political rally , or who go to an abortion clinic or a church or a mosque , " Rotenberg said . " There needs to be some oversight . " The license-plate reader works using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two on each side . A camera snaps a picture and the computer converts it into digital characters and compares them with an FBI list of wanted or missing license plates . An updated list is downloaded daily into the officers car computer . When the computer gets a hit , an alarm sounds and a picture of the suspect car pops up on a screen , and the crime it is suspected of being involved in . The system photographs the suspect car , records the police cars GPS coordinates , and the time and date . Police must verify the car is wanted because the computer ca n't distinguish between a Texas license plate from a Georgia plate . The system can help put a suspect at a crime scene , spotting and identifying witnesses , according to the Web site of Remington ELSAG , a manufacturer . Allen predicts more and more departments will start acquiring license plate readers in Georgia . " Absolutely , theyll become more common , " he said . " Its very helpful in catching these vehicles and perpetrators . It makes it much easier to find them . "

I was out driving yesterday , and tried to clock the car ahead of me with an Ultralyte . When we both were travelling at the same speed , it shows 0 mph . When I go faster , his speed becomes +3mph , and when I go slower than that car , his speed goes negative . I checked the distance reading and it seems accurate . <p> From the info you provided Mouse , it seems to be pretty accurate . It also appears to be designed for shooting oncoming vehicles from a stationary position , but can easily be used for shooting vehicles moving away . <p> It 's just that the units have n't been designed to take input from a moving vehicle . I do n't think it 's very difficult to add the speed input and to add the logic to factor in the speed input to determine target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges of vibration/impacts ( vehicle going over rough terrain , bumping fleeing vehicle in a chase , etc ) and still maintain it 's accuracy . These lidar guns will have more of a usability issue - how to make the lidar unit easily usable in a moving vehicle in a safe manner ( for LEO and others ) . <p> Lidar as presently implemented is intended for shooting from a stationary position , as LittleOverPSL indicated ( though it can shoot vehicles approaching or departing ) . <p> In order for a speed measurement device to work while moving , several things need to happen : <p> The device has to know the speed of the cruiser , so it can calculate the target speed by taking the difference <p> It ca n't be affected by vibration , bumps , etc . <p> It has to be able to be operated in a " hands-off " manner , so the LEO can concentrate on driving . <p> Moving radar meets these qualifications . It is able to measure the cruiser 's speed by reading reflections off of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the performance of radar , since the beam is wide . It can be turned on and operated hands-off by the LEO ( or in instant-on mode , the LEO only needs to press a button ) . <p> Laser does n't meet these qualifications . The narrow beam ca n't measure the patrol speed like radar can ( though it could be retrofitted to the cruiser 's speedometer , but this complicates installation ) . The narrow beam means accurate aiming and a steady hand is needed to get accurate speed measurements . Hit a bump , and the beam will scatter all over the place , causing faults or incorrect readings . This also makes it impossible for a LEO driving alone to operate the unit , though someone in the passenger seat could . <p> There 's probably some researchers out there working on mobile lidar systems , but I doubt they 'll become as practical or usable as mobile radar . <p> An LEO riding in a cruiser could clock vehicles with a laser , and then calculate the actual speed based on the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what gomouse did ) . But if anyone tried to issue a ticket that way , it would never hold up in court . <p> That plus a moving lidar would probably have to use a wider beam in order to more easily get readings from a moving car , and/or allow for a dashmount configuration with no aiming required . This would make detection ( and jamming ) easier . <p> And if the lidar uses two beams , or a split or wider beam , to measure the patrol speed , that 's even better for us detector users . <p> In any case , the main purpose of lidar is to allow individual cars to be clocked in traffic , and to make it harder to detect than radar . A moving lidar system would n't have these benefits , at least as much . And it 'll cost a lot more than a moving radar that will do the same thing , only better . <p> In any case , the main purpose of lidar is to allow individual cars to be clocked in traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moving lidar system would n't have these benefits , at least as much .

This is as good as it gets for a handheld/mobile scanner Unless you use a base station antenna in which case then your scanner now becomes part of your home .

Being a recent transplant to the Northern Virginia area and a life long radar enthusiast , I have never been a fan of the detector ban here , even before I moved to the area . <p> Politics aside , I have a V1 stealth mounted above my visor ( 100% hidden ) in my Escalade with the remote display mounted on my windshield in the upper left hand corner behind the tint strip . ( No I do n't speed at all like I used to before I owned a larger truck but I still like using the device ) So anyway , point being , my setup can not be seen from the outside of the truck . <p> Driving on Route 28 to work the other day , I passed a multi-car accident which had traffic all messed up . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the accident area and start creeping up the left shoulder . I was in the left lane . I had honestly totally forgotten my V1 was even on , as I have it tied into a main switch for my Sirius radio and other devices . <p> As the trooper rolled up next to my truck he stopped , waited for me to roll by ( stop and go traffic ) and then pulled me over . Like always , I immediately rolled down both my front windows , turned on my dome light and placed my hands on the wheel . As the officer approached , I heard a loud beeping noise coming from his person . He stopped at my window and said " License , Registration , and your Valentine One please . " I was floored , I could n't believe he knew what device I had . " I picked you up on my Spectre Elite , it will get you every time . I 'll bring back your device . " <p> So off he goes to his cruiser , writes the ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me all the paperwork and my V1 . He was very professional and contrary to other posts I 've read , there was never any threat of confiscation or otherwise destroying my detector . <p> So I 've done the best I can do , I 've written my local representatives in hopes that they might begin to repeal the law . I 've investigated the STi Driver and the Redline , but I can not get confirmation from anyone that those are 100% undetectable to the Spectre Elite either . <h> Re : V1 + Virginia + Spectre Elite <p> His spectre ca n't tell what you have . He saw it before or it was a lucky guess . Either way it shows how retarded VA is when they have nothing better to do than bang people for radar detectors . <p> I agree , it 's clearly a money making tactic for the state . ( Think of the sales tax that could be made from the sale of the devices , if they were n't banned ... ) When 49 other states do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this state would wonder why . Not to mention the fact that the officer had to cut across 5 lanes of bumper to bumper traffic just to pull me over . <h> Re : V1 + Virginia + Spectre Elite <p> A lot of members use detectable RDs in VA . I would not , go with the Redline . The Leo could have seen the flashing lights from the V1 and also know the weak strength level unlike a Cobra ...... ( Keep it hid plus the dark mode ) <h> Re : V1 + Virginia + Spectre Elite <p> Was the trooper in one of those unmarked impalas ? Or was he in the marked cruiser ? I 've seen many of them using Spectre in the unmarked vehicles . <p> Just curious ! <p> In this instance , it was a marked Crown Vic . Would n't surprise me if they are running them in unmarked cars as well . <p> Originally Posted by North Alabama <p> A lot of members use detectable RDs in VA . I would not , go with the Redline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V1 and also know the weak strength level unlike a Cobra ...... ( Keep it hid plus the dark mode ) <p> So a quick question to the other members in VA who run detectable units .... Any advice on how to handle the ticket ? I do n't just want to pay it , since equipment violations show up on your driving record . ( Which is totally bogus . I did n't know until I ran my report online ) I read some posts about the HAM radio guy who won his case based upon the radio receiver/FCC part 15 rules . Part of me just wants to show up to court with that case number and ask for a dismissal . <p> And for you V1 fans out there , some inside info . In conjunction with my research , I went ahead and wrote Valentine Research an email basically explaining my " run-in " with the VA trooper and asked if they had any solution which would help me in the future . The reply I got said that " ... While the V1 has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spectre line . We are currently working on a solution to combat the Spectre devices . " So I 'm due for an upgrade , but I may wait and see .

What about any info/data points on proportion of RADAR/LIDAR used by area/state and whether cops prefer one over the other in each state/area ? FWIW , I have heard that generally speaking , city/local cops use LIDAR , whereas Highway Patrol use RADAR .

I suspect Steve would disagree with the above assertions as blanket statements . <p> Is Veil absolutely 100&amp;#37 ; effective at defeating laser ? Hardly .

History has shown this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually used the product in the real-world , against real speed traps . <p> Can Veil give you a false sense of security ? I do n't know . Does driving with a radar detector give one a false sense of security versus IO police radar ? Does driving with a laser jammer that does n't provide JTG/JFG protection in every instance provide a false sense of security ? <p> I guess it is ultimately up to the driver to understand the strengths and limitations of any countermeasure solution and then drive within those constraints . And , not everyone can afford a $500-$2500 piece of electronics + cost of installation .

( state - PA ) <p> Hello , <p> Today i went to trial for a speeding ticket in Pennsylvania ( 53 mph in a 25 mph zone ) . I lost . However , i found that the judge made some mistakes when accepting the cop 's prove of certificate of the device used ( a tracker ) . These are the mistakes i think were done : <p> 1- The calibration certificate was a copy . When i said that an original should be presented , the judge asked the cop if it was an original copy , he said yes , and the judge said it was OK for him ... <p> 2- The cop did n't  bring any certificate that indicates that the speed timing device is approve by the bureau . When i asked for it as indicated in 41 Pa B. 7042 , the judge argued that is not required by law and that HE certifies that the device is approved ... <p> In PA this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if i should appeal in superior court or leave as is . Also , if i appeal , would i have to hire an attorney ? <h> Re : Appeal speeding ticket decision . is it worth it ? ( state - PA ) <p> The calibration certificate should mention the make and model of the speed timing device , which would verify whether or not it is permissible for use in Pennsylvania . While I guess it is possible that the officer could be using a device that is not approved for use in Pennsylvania , it 's unlikely . Unlike radar and LIDAR guns in other states that might cost thousands of dollars , an officer in Pennsylvania only needs a $40 stopwatch in order to determine the speed of vehicles . Because the devices are so inexpensive , police departments usually do buy the correct devices and have them calibrated appropriately . Of course this can change on a case-by-case basis , but I guess I 'm just saying that there 's a very high chance that the device is approved for use in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 3111A , 5 over , 10 over , total dismissal ... ? Because the speed was so large ( 28 over - note that 30 over in Pennsylvania requires additional court intervention and could be deemed careless driving ) it is quite unlikely that you would win if you went to court asking for total dismissal . <p> Most judges are willing to drop the citation down , however ... in a case like this , I usually see judges drop the penalty down to 10 over , which is around $131.00 and 2 points assigned to your license . Granted , any point value assigned is bad ... but there 's a big difference between 2 points and 5 points , both for your insurance and for your drivers license . The difference between 2 points and 5 points for your insurance would probably be in the high hundreds per year . The difference between these point values on your license depends on your license status right now - if you have other points on it right now , 5 points added could result in a license suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a lot more room for error . <p> In my very unofficial opinion , I would say that if you decide to appeal , you should hire an attorney . 28 over is a big offense and hiring an attorney for a few hundred bucks could end up saving you money in the end if you get some of the points appealed . However , if the points are not removed , I guess that is additional money that you will be out . It 's a gamble , but it 's really up to you to decide which you think is best . <p> Every MDJ is different and each one runs their court in a different way , so long as they follow the court rules . Some judges are harsher when it comes to certain cases , and some are more lenient . When it comes to the county court system , things may be a little bit more formal and you may be able to prove your case better . However , you will want to make sure you have a really good case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the appeal level , they will be expecting that you have all of your evidence and proof in place . <h> Re : Appeal speeding ticket decision . is it worth it ? ( state - PA ) <p> Thanks for your reply . <p> I have no doubt that the device is an authorized device . However , is it not required that they prove by the appropriate documentation that that 's the case ? <p> So , if i appeal , will there be a completely new trial ? i read that you appeal if you think that the laws were n't followed correctly in the first trial regardless of if you are guilty or not . Is that correct ? <p> Before we talked to the judge , the cop told me that he could reduce the point but that do n't  expect that he would reduce it too much because it was more than double over the limit . When i tried to tell him that i was n't going as fast , he said to talk to the judge right away . <h> Re : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( state - PA ) <p> I assumed you pleaded not guilty with your case .

Creating a 33.8 custom sweep makes that six times . I doubt the difference could be measurable in actual performance , however , the custom sweep ( depending on how you set it ) may go lower in frequency than the POP sweeps and induce more falsing to other detectors spewing emissions in the 33.6xx range . <p> The 34.2-35.2 ATRs were rare to begin with and likely near to extinction in the field .... but I ca n't say there is n't the possibility of a couple still in service .

Then customize your sweeps accordingly . 135530 @qwx755530 <p> I have also inquired about custom sweeps and never got a definitive answer regarding performance .

DickinsonAn appellate court on Monday ruled that key evidence used in Ohio speed traps was not admissible . With millions in local government revenue at stake , the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Ninth District found the accuracy of laser-based speed guns ( lidar ) to be unproven . The decision could inspire challenges to laser tickets throughout the state . <p> The present case began when Ohio State Trooper Dennis Matulin hid along the median of Interstate 71 with an LTI 20-20 laser speed gun waiting for the device to indicate that someone had exceeded the speed limit . Matulin charged that when Donald Miko 's semi truck passed his location , the lidar gun displayed a reading of 67 MPH . The limit for trucks on the road is 55 and for cars 65 . <p> At trial in the Medina County Municipal Court , Miko objected that the trooper 's LTI 20-20 had never been proved reliable in an Ohio court of law . The prosecutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Yes , the court had done so by prior judgment entry . " The court imposed a $100 fine and two points against Miko 's commercial driving license . Appellate Judge Clair E. Dickinson scolded the lower court for violating the rule that a county court must publish , or report , a " judgment entry " used for the purpose of taking judicial notice . <p> " Nobody has brought a reported decision of the Medina Municipal Court considering the accuracy of the LTI 20-20 device to this court 's attention , " Judge Clair E. Dickinson wrote . " The trial court , therefore , was not authorized to take judicial notice of the scientific accuracy of the LTI 20-20 laser device by Rule 201(B) ( 1 ) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence . " <p> Dickinson went on to point out that the unreported case which the Medina court cited to convict Miko did not include any required testimony from expert witnesses . As a result , the court overturned Miko 's conviction . <p> " In the absence of a reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on scientific testimony it heard in that case , that the LTI 20-20 laser device is scientifically accurate , the trial court was not authorized ... to take judicial notice of its accuracy , " the appeals court concluded . " Inasmuch as the trial court was not authorized to take judicial notice ... , it erred by doing so . " <p> The British media has been scathing in its treatment of the inaccuracy of the LTI 20-20 speed gun . The basic operation problem is that handheld laser speed guns must take two separate measurements of distance to generate a speed estimate . If , while taking a speed reading , an officer 's hand twitches slightly , the laser beam can " slip " from one portion of a vehicle to another . The extra distance measured in the second reading is then added to the calculation that determines the speed readout . For example , if the speed gun 's aim point slips from the windshield to the grill , the speed reading will read 8 MPH too high . London 's Daily Mail newspaper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing fundamental flaws in the way lidar guns estimate speed . <p> A full copy of the ruling is available in a 35k PDF file at the source link below . <p> i mean , did n't the original guns that came to this country end up being used old 20/20 guns from the UK ? and they came with cameras on them but the US removed the cameras ? <p> Not just that ; the way LIDAR guns eliminate sweep error is by a " patented statistical algorithm " -- which frankly sounds like just tossing out everything except for returns that look like a monotonic decreasing set of distance readings .... In a 4th grade science project I believe this is called fabrication of data -- if I am being convicted of a crime based on some wishy-washy statistical algorithm , at least I would like to see the source fully disclosed so we can analyze if it 's sound or not .

Your real vulnerabilities are going to be your headlights , cornering lights , and roofline . I just do n't see any point in going out of your way to negate your plate . <p> The 3M method seems to work as well as any plate cover , although the plate cover is probably less noticeable and lasts longer . But if you use a plate cover , make sure it is NOT one made for obscuring your plates for cameras . That will eventually get you stopped .

If you have traffic sensors , you can run without issue but as said the IO and burst K-band signals may be missed . Given only certain roads have these drones , you want a system in which you can turn it on and off while driving . With the V1 I accomplish this with programming , but it still means that any time I am in a ' city ' mode , I also lose burst K-band signals and so it still it a PITA .

I have never had problems with any of the mods but legally I just have to let you know this .

The only warranty I offer is that when the display/main unit leaves my hands everything is on proper working order . <h> Re : COLOR Valentine One Displays <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a unique product not offered anywhere else ... so I think this should pass , even become a sticky in this forum ... we will see what the mods/admins think ... apparently it is fine via the post below . <p> Its funny that people who buy the extra concealed display from VR have to go and buy a 40 or 60 dollar addition to their product to make it effective ... oye . <p> BTW : Beautiful pictures of your work , and a spectacular final product ! It 's not my tastes but I can appreciate the need for this upgrade to the display for many users , that 's for certain ! <h> Re : COLOR Valentine One Displays <p> I will most likely be getting one of these after the new year , excellent looking , the one with the green to yellow to red led 's on the signal strength then the blue red yellow green for bands is perfect ! Especially since it matches my old unidens colors from WAY back in the day , green was x , yellow was k , red was ka , perfect !

They will likely drag it out for a long time with continuances hoping the officer wont show up .

Unfortunately the V1 is not one that does n't leak , so even if it 's totally hidden from view they will know you 're using it . Now , most detectors will claim invisibility to the VG2 RDD , but that 's irrelevant because that 's obsolete and now they use one called the Spectre . <p> The only detectors currently available that are undetectable by the Spectre are a few models from Escort and Beltronics ( which are basically the same company ) , the STi , Redline , 9500ci , and STi-R ( discontinued in America ) . <p> Secondly , a display in the mirror is not stealth at all . The reason a mirror works is because it 's in a position where everybody to your rear can see it , including the police .

Unfortunately , only the Escort/Beltronics remote mounted units have a display you can play with for positioning . The windshield units do n't have a display you can remote mount like the V1 has . If you 're handy with a soldering iron , perhaps you could disassemble a windshield unit and remote mount the display to where you think it 's stealth , but then your warranty is NFG . Too bad Belscort does n't come up with a remote display for their windshield detectors .

Thanks for the replys ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> All other things being equal , a " through the glass " desgin will not perform as well as one that has a direct connection to the radio and antenna feedline . <p> If there 's metallic tint on or in your glass , it may not work at all . <p> I once had a mag mount scanner antanna that had difficulty staying on the car at freeway speeds if I was in gusty conditions , like passing trucks , when it was used on a vinyl roof .

Even so , I bet most of the frequencies that are programmed into it have changed . <p> If you want an updated system with a beartracker , the BCT-15 is the most recent model with updated freqs . <p> The BCT-15 works once in a while but it 's definitely not worth the money for the amount that it has saved me . It has a 3-mile radius which is a bit far . It will go off a lot and you will never see the trooper . Many other times , you will see a trooper and it will never go off . <p> Take this good advice : If you 're looking for more countermeasures ( especially for a highway ) GET A CB . <p> Thanks to the proliferation of 800 MHz trunked radio systems , those older scanners that detect MRE ( mobile radio extenders ) are obsolete . MREs are not used with 800 MHz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prefer a scanner . You can find out about all kinds of traffic hazards , not just laser and air enforcement traps . A scanner is indespensable in the winter ! Once you get off the interstate , a CB is not so helpful . <p> IMHO the Pro-96 is the best all around scanner , and is capable of following digital systems . <p> I 've had a Bct -7 and a BCT-15 , and the highway patrol alert " bear tracker " almost never went off in all my rides to and from Nashville everyday maybe a couple of times . Once I got the bct-15 and then the 996T I was able to hear the wireless mics they wear as I pass them if they are out on a stop .. I heard this more often than the bear tracker going off and I 'm pretty sure it was false or something ... I could hear the post loud and clear but not the troopers unless I was in close proximity . <p> The BCT-15 is a fine choice for a mobile or base if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Yes , Those ' scanners ' where a good idea years ago before they started to move from Low band and VHF systems to 700 &amp; 800 Mhz Digital Trucking systems . ILL SP used 42 and 44 mhz low band radios . When away from the car , they used a 155. xxx vhf portable ' link ' to their mobile low band radio to their base . <p> The entire ISP is moving to a statewide 700/800 digital system this year or next . Nice that they can talk from one end of the state to the other . But coverage going to be a bit spotty at times . Portable coverage will be even worst . Then they 'll not own it , ' leased ' from Motorola they have to pay a yearly sum per every portable/base/portable in their system . <p> So here is what I would do : <p> Get a good high end system , a good radar detector Sti , 8500 X50 or V1 . Which one depends on your driving area : <p> STi for anti-detector states X50 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small cities/boonies and mainly interstate . *1 <p> Laser protection if your state allows it . As there is really no protection from Lidar by any detector . 90+% of the time , when it goes off , it really is just telling it 's time to pull over and smile at the officer . <p> CB is a help at times if you do n't mind all the ' stuff ' on there at times . <p> Just my 2 cents worth . <p> Take care , <p> Spin <p> *1 Some people complain about how ' chatty ' the V1 is , really a nice detector and works well . I sure like mine and would n't be without it . Been known to turn around after leaving for a trip ( a few miles ) and go home and get it . I use mine in larger cities but use the Big L mode . A bit chatty with all those dumb auto door openers . But then I do n't drive fast in areas like that .

No contest , the Redline impressively beat the 9500ix in all k and ka scenarios I came across . I definitely felt safer from LEO and considered cancelling the 360 , but decided to give it a fair chance and wait for its arrival . I have had my 360 for a couple days now and have been comparing it to the new redline . Be advised I am driving with both detectors operating at the same time ( just as I did with the 9500ix/redline ) , and there seems to be no conflict with operation . Impressions so far : The Max 360 has equaled the redline in K band encounters thus far ( with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ) . On the 2 Ka band encounters I have had , the Max360 handily beat the Redline by 2 and 5 seconds in detection time .

I will report back with further testing . 9500ix settings : Hwy , Gps off// Redline settings : Hwy , no x band , TSR off , RDR off , BSM off // Max 360 settings : Hwy , no X band , TSR off , SWS on , Gps off <h> Re : Driving with max360 Redline 9500ix <p> Today k and Ka band performance has been near equivalent with both detectors on speed signs . I had one LEO Ka encounter today , and the 360 narrowly beat the Redline but both gave very ample distance and warning time . As far as size goes , most detectors I 've seen are comparable in size to the 9500ix/redline . This 360 is a little wider but not excessive , which you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll upload soon . <h> Re : Driving with max360 Redline 9500ix <p> The problem is see with these " tests " is that the units are ONLY 6-8 inches apart and the Max 360 and its dual antenna will definitely interfere with the Redline , as it would with a V1 or an Stir-O . Testing always requires ONLY one unit ON at a time .

Its wide band Ka performance is , well , very lacking and more likely is dismal . However , if you live in a small town with a police force which entirely uses older K band radar guns , then it will do a fair job of detecting those . On the other hand you are likely to experience tons of falses from modern radar detectors and microwave sources such as cell phones and digital microwave communication towers .

Volume wheel is on the left and has city/hwy click slider thing on top right and mute on top left . I 'll take pics later tonight if you want . It only gives one alarm tone , which is a beep , so i ; m sure it 's not the same one as yours . Maybe it 's an earlier model . <p> I really do n't know what bands it detects or anything like that , as I said it only does one tone , so maybe it only does X band . It 's pretty old , maybe nearly 20 years old ... maybe older , not sure . <p> The one I have is pretty much useless though . It falses a lot , wo n't pick up multinova , ( Obviously wo n't pick up laser ) and it does n't really give me any protection at all .

That 's why I 'm ditching it for my RX65 that should be here this week or next . <p> Mine is pretty much just like yours but the power is on the right hand side in green and the alarm on the left in amber . It has a city switch on the top right hand side and the mute button on the left . The tone is is well just a tone it beeps faster when you get closer to the source , other than that I get some false signals alot . But it will have to do for now .

The horns in our RDs are quite a bit more complex in design with the Ridge(s) and multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Just an idea ... <p> If the RD is mounted where what it " sees " reflected from the hood is down the road , and instead of a complete external horn you have only the top panel of the four , that might help capture more of the signal from down the road without affecting off-axis . In other words , the hood and panel would be acting as a large " collector . " <h> Re : Antenna Horn <p> Hello people ! I 'm renewing the topic . <p> Here is a good comparison of Standard Unit / Horn Extension Unit performance on a very hard to detect photoradar Ramet AD9 ( low powered Ka 34.00 GHz , radar antenna extremely low by the ground ) . Since radar beam is 22 degrees to the road , detector needs to have good off-axis sensitivity to catch it , because signal does n't hit antenna directly but rebounded from the sides of the road ( buildings , poles , etc . ) . <h> Re : Antenna Horn <p> I guess I made it a little big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mine 's big enough to where you can fit the 8500S7 just inside the horn extension . I guess it will still work ? <p> I ca n't promise but of course you should try . People learn from mistakes <p> The best way to make really working H/E is to measure size of the original horn aperture ( for S7 it is 2.9cm x 1.25cm , if I remember well ) , design that end of a H/E with the same dimmensions , and match it exactly to original antenna . <p> If you do n't want to demolish unit 's housing , make those dimensions little bigger ( for instance 3.1cm x 1,4cm ) and stick H/E to the detector 's front shield 1,4cm from left side of RD 's front and 0,6cm from the bottom . <p> Please do n't let me do all the work for you , because you loose such a fun

" We 're hoping that it 's a little closer when we finalize the numbers .

However , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $288,720 for operating costs during that time . <p> Nevertheless , Ryan said the camera system still has n't cost taxpayers anything . <p> In the city 's contract with the camera company , Redflex agrees to pay all installation and equipment costs . The company is contracted to pay the city back if operating expenses exceed traffic fine revenue . <p> " We do n't look to measure success in the amount of revenue gained , " Ryan said . " If we break even and make the roads safer , then that 's a success . " <p> The intersections of McHenry and Standiford-Sylvan avenues and McHenry and Briggsmore avenues each will get two cameras . Coffee Road at Sylvan and Coffee at Briggsmore each will get one camera . <p> All the cameras are scheduled to be in place by the end of this year .

" The volume of vehicles coming into the city from Oakdale and Riverbank has increased . " <p> Recent criticism of the red-light camera system used in Sacramento has Modesto police on the defensive about its system .

Dierker contends that the red-light camera system violates due process of the law by presuming guilt . The judge says that he ca n't say for sure whether he was the person driving his car when it was ticketed on Kingshighway last December for running a red light . <p> Instead of simply paying the $100 fine for the ticket or trying to argue it in traffic court , Dierker demanded a jury trial in circuit court . It 's believed that his case would be the first to reach a jury in St. Louis . ( A pre-trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dierker says he may represent himself at trial , where he 'll argue three key points : <p> The system 's presumption of guilt is invalid <p> The citation he received contained deficiencies , such as no signature from the prosecutor <p> No ordinance -- that he 's found -- supports the $100 fine for the tickets . <p> In July a federal judge dismissed a similar challenge to red-light cameras in Arnold , Missouri . Dierker tells Daily RFT that he 's not concerned with that ruling . <p> " The Arnold ordinance is worded differently , " says Dierker . <p> Still , the judge realizes that many courts have ruled in favor of red-light cameras . <p> " The big issue has been the presumption argument , " says Dierker . " It 's been litigated across the country , and most rulings have upheld the presumption . " <p> Despite being labeled as a " crusader " , Dierker says his sole intent is to receive an acquittal -- and not to overturn the city 's use of red-light cameras .

I had a noise in my radio in my Semi one time and it turned out to be from the 12v cooler I had . that shows it could be picking up the noise thru the air , simular to when you would turn on a hairdrier and the television would go nuts , before we had cable and relied on those rabbit ears . The electricical noise can be coming from alot of sources today , fuelpumps are electric in alot of cars and can be another source too . <h> Re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got it fixed .

This is what the clipper looks like : <h> Re : CB noise is driving me insane <h> Re : CB noise is driving me insane <p> The only problem now is no one wants to give me a radio check . What is up with people ? Good god , if i hear someone on the line asking for a check I give it to them , not a big deal .

Also the air waves are very quiet around here . Is it like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving me insane <p> It varies . It will be quieter at early morning , and after dusk . Noisiest when the sun is highest 1100-1500hrs . Have you had you CB tuned up for peak output ? I would suggest it , typically 25 bucks from a CB shop , but makes your CB 3 to 4 times more powerful .

The problem is identifying it as a real threat or not . You will have falsing on all 3 bands with less falsing on Ka band .

So you have to watch your strength meter and audio alerts . Also know your local LEO frequency . A lot of auto door operns operate in K band and have to know where these locations are .

You have to be alert mentally , visually and drive defensively . <p> Quote : <p> I understand that different bands work on different frequencies but what I want to know if what effect that has on how a band picks up your speed <p> No difference .

The most common falses for Ka band is from nearby radar detectors , so keep your distance from anyone you suspect to be running a radar detector . <p> K-band is still a live and kicking band with modern guns still manufacturered using K-band .

I 've been using it for about two weeks now , and thought i 'd post my results for anyone that 's interested . <p> The 1730 is a small unit , it 's got a black casing with grey buttons , so windshield glare is minimal . It no longer ships with the silver windshield mount , it 's now painted flat black . This makes it much less noticable from outside the car . <p> The detector comes with a 5ft straight cord , windshield mount ( only one set of suction cups ) and a very brief manual . <p> The detector uses LED lights across the front for the indications . They are FAR too dim to see in sunlight . The only way I could see them during bright sun was to mount the detector behind the tint strip and right above my head . The sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were easily overpowered by 65 mph with the windows down . The tones are distinct for each band except for Ka and X. If they were different , it was close enough that I could n't tell . If you 've got anything but an extremely quiet vehicle , you need ot look elsewhere . I 've had the same problem with tones being WAY too quiet on another non-voice whistler that I used . The voice models are a lot louder , but still not close to the Bel 's tones . <p> The 1730 has only three buttons plus the power/volume wheel . It has a City mode , Quiet button , and a VG2 cloak button . The city mode is a half-hearted attempt - it beeps twice when a signal is first detected , then goes silent until the signal reaches full strength ( line-of-sight with the radar source ) . It does this for ALL THREE bands as well . If you miss the initial alert , you 're screwed with city mode on . The quiet mode works like it did on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at normal volume , then switches to a clicking sound for the duration of the alert . It is a neat feature , but not really nescessary due to the low alert volume of the unit . I did n't use the VG2 cloaking mode since I have no need for it in Illlinois . These features all re-set every time you turn the detector off , but I found that the default settings ( highway mode , quiet mode off , VG2 cloak off ) were the best for me anyway . <p> Detection was surprising for such a cheap ( $40 ) detector . It certainly was n't even in the same league as some more expensive detectors , but it seemed to be about the same as a $100 Cobra ESD9210 that i 'd owned previously . Normally about 5 seconds pre-warning to K and Ka , sometimes a little more . No more than 10 seconds . In comparison to the Cobra , it seemed like I got a little better warning to K with the Whistler , and a little better to Ka with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So , to wrap it all up- <p> Pros - Detection for the money Ease of use Build quality <p> Cons- Audio Volume LED brightness <p> Who it 's good for- Someone that occasionally drifts a little ( 5-10 ) over the speed limit and has a quiet vehicle . <p> If any of you guys and gals have any specific questions , i 'll answer them as best I can . <h> Been Lasered yet ? <p> I 'm new here and just purchased a 1730 about 4 days ago after reiceiving a ticket : x Saw a few reviews and 80%-%90 were positive . One said it was better than any Cobra he 's tried . I saw the date and was wondering if you have had any enconters with laser in that amout of time . Also do you know of any other reviews or tests on the 1730 ? Thanx , great forum ! ( Before anyone says anything I know its CHEAP and I 'll upgrade later ) <p> Unfortunately I 've never had a real laser encounter , but from what i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it should fare much better than my RX65 in that regard . It seems extremely good at picking up off-axis laser from the tester . The 1730 is just a backup , so it 's not something i 've spent a whole lot of time with . <p> I would suggest a mount high on the windshield with this unit to maximize line-of-sight . <p> I heard you should mount as low as possible without being obstructed by wipers . That way it will be closer in line with the liscense plate . Maybe I 'm wrong , I 've only had 2 detectors before and they were given to me.

First off , almost everything affects swr . The shielding braid of the coax cable is ground . You do n't need a ground but rather a ground plane for a mobile install to work . The flat sheet metal of the truck works as the ground plane providing the mirror image to make it work . A 3 foot antenna is very small and greatly compromised for CB . Nonetheless you should still receive a high noise level on CH19 . There is more likely a break in the coax . If you have a factory pressed on PL259 , cut it off and toss it in the trash . Buy a real one with an adapter and solder it on . If you want full on performance and your willing to drill ..... get a heavy duty ball mount with a 96 inch fiberglass whip . Mount it at the rear d/s at least 1 ft higher than the bumper . You want little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna is both electrically and physically correct . <h> Re : Magnetic base antenna with no ground <p> You can get two main variations of the PL259 coax plug . see link below which explains the adaptor queryPL259 <p> Also , you can get ground independant antennas , and these are generally noticeable as they have an integrated coil at the base of the antenna which creates a " magnetic " ( for the want of a better word ) ground plane . These antennas can be used where you may not be able to get a good flat surface on your vehicle to provide the " ground " for the antenna as drKing explained . The " ground " for your radio is the negative of your power supply . also the body of the car ( generally ) . The " ground " for your antenna is n't necessarily the metal of the vehicle ( but can be ) hence the insulation on your magnetic base . But that 's only there to protect your paintwork

You may be able to talk a few car lengths at best and the CB will be useless as a countermeasure . The handhelds still require an external antenna if you want to be able to use it for more than a few hundred feet . <p> CB uses coax but the connectors are different and will not connect to your current antenna . You will need a true CB antenna , using the proper cabling , there is no way around this due to the 11 meter wavelength . The best you can do is a stealth type of antenna that looks closer to an FM antenna ( its still going to have a coil on the bottom but will be thin everywhere else and about the same length as an FM antenna ) . Read the CB faq ... pretty much covered in there <p> I agree with The Chariot , I have tried using a handheld CB Radio and actually got a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a a Lil Will antenna and the Uniden 520XL , I did n't like the antenna at first either . But since it 's a magnet mount you can just throw it in the trunk if you want to so it 's really not that big a deal . But a Lil Will is about the smallest antenna you can use and get decent results . <p> The car antenna is a receive only antenna . The CB antenna , since it transmits , has to be installed , and then " tuned " to get the SWR right ( its a ratio of how much of the power is going out the antenna verses coming back into the transmitter ) . Length of the antenna comes into play for this . Additionally , its a very long wavelength radio wave and therefore requires a long antenna for any type of performance . The shorter antennas on the hand helds are good for walkie-talkie distances only . <p> What you can do is mount a Firestick Venice CB antenna where your stock FM antenna is . It looks darn close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those internal FM antenna kits for your AM/FM radio . It 'll cut down a little on FM reception , but not much . <p> I understand your dilemma . I have a show vehicle and do n't want a redneck looking CB antenna on it . There are ways to make it blend in and minimize the look , but one way or another you have to have a real antenna on it . <p> For a mag mount X2 about the Little Wil . It has some damn good reach both transmitting and receiving considering its size . Plenty of distance for countermeasures ( saved my bacon more than once so far ) . I used it on my show vehicle and a Firestick on the F250 . I 'm in the process of installing a Firestick Venice on the show vehicle for a permanent stealth antenna . <p> Yea , like the other guys said , you need a goofy looking antenna to get any real use out of one . <p> A Maxrad ( Laird , Antennex , etc . ) Would be pretty stealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to look at trunk lip mounts . <p> A few years ago you could buy a duplexer that would divide the CB from the AM/FM while using the existing AM/FM antenna . In the 80s Caddy even used this technology as stock factory option in the vehicle . <p> Check around they may still be out there ( duplexers ) <p> Of the 100&amp;#37 ; it takes to make a radio work good 90% of it is antenna .

Considering that the V1 is still by far my favorite detector , and that I 'm contemplating getting a STI-R Plus setup in the near future , I figured this would be a good way of testing a similar antenna . My prior experience with Belscort units have been purely M4 based products ( 9500ix , 8500 x50 , and Passport iQ ) . <p> I 'm not gon na attempt to do a thorough review -- I just wanted to share my thoughts/observations on the product . <p> Note that for parts of my trip , I did run my V1 and Redline together in order to compare their reactions to various encounters . As a result , my comparative performance observations should not be taken as a scientific test . <p> - X band was not ( consciously ) tested ... I turned it off in settings almost immediately . - K band sensitivity was ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V1 in alerting to K band sources . - Most of my Ka band encounters were 34.7 ( this is CHP after all ) , and this is by far the closest I 've seen an Escort detector compete with the V1 on 34.7 sensitivity . The V1 still beat the Redline by a few hundred feet for most encounters , the Redline is undeniably superior in sensitivity to the M4 platform detectors . While with M4 detectors , sensitivity was a big factor in my aversion to using them as my primary detector , this would not be a concern for me with the RedLine . I 'm expecting , based on the various tests floating around , that the RedLine would beat the V1 on 35.5 , but I had no personal experience to draw on . - No laser encounters . The V1 did false on laser on several occasions , but the RedLine does not seem to react to Infiniti cruise control from oncoming cars . - The V1 had a noticeable and appreciable performance advantage for forward-facing Ka band encounters . The RedLine sometimes did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cop ( while the V1 alerted intermittently 500ft before ) . Not a threatening issue , but it does add a sense of security to have the V1 see such encounters . - REAR DETECTION . Ugh . This is the biggest area in which I found the RedLine lacking , and my only real criticism of the product . I had one encounter with CHP creeping up behind me with radar running , and this encounter was picked up 5+ minutes before visual contact with the V1 , but less than 30 seconds before the contact with the RedLine . Also , the V1 clearly read the encounter as an arrow from behind , and a slow and steady ramp-up . The RedLine instead presented the encounter as IO blasts , presumably as it caught reflections of the beam from cars ahead . Yes , it alerted before the kill zone , but the way it alerted would not have suggested to me that a cop was approaching from the rear . Without the V1 around , I would 've been expecting an IO encounter . - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . The V1 has always had a fairly linear ramp-up that lends to confidence in estimating the threat level . The RedLine seems to always bring in Ka band threats at 2/3 strength ( when the V1 would initially give a 1 dot alert ) , and then oscillate between stronger and weaker indications before pegging at full strength . The V1 for the same encounters would provide a linear ramp-up . In the end , it meant with the RedLine , whenever it went off I had to assume I was close to the kill-zone and set my cruise-control. - ARROWS . The arrows definitely help in spotting a cop , or knowing when you 've passed them and can let your guard down again . With the RedLine , whenever it 's going off , I have to be on high alert . The biggest problem is when the signal inexplicably goes away without seeing the cop , you have to wonder whether this is an IO encounter , or the cop was a part of oncoming traffic . The V1 never casts any doubt in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more " pleasant " alert tones than the V1 . The alert lamp is a nice touch too , but it only is truly effective at night . During the day , it 's not as easy to see . - The buttons on the front of the RedLine are somewhat flimsy . On my unit , volume up / down were hard to press . It 'd tend to like to increase the volume even though I 'm pressing the left side of that button . <p> Overall , I feel like the RedLine is a solid platform , and by far my favorite Belscort detector in terms of its overall performance . At the end of the day , I still prefer my V1 , primarily due to rear detection , arrows , and linear ramp-up , but I do see a lot of merits in this platform . Honestly , if Escort would release a RedLine that did GPS filtering / camera detection , even if it costs $100-200 more than the 9500ix I would be willing to buy it . <h> Re : Quick Escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pretty good luck as far driving thru CA. in rear detection . I went about 1500 miles with my redline from Seattle , WA. to Las Vegas NV . and it was great . I agree with you about the ramp-up with the redline but it 's something that I have gotten use to now . <p> On the rear detection you ca n't beat the V1 , my redline have alerted me at places like the road speed sign way before the V1 but I still like the V1 . I travel with my redline when I take those trip because in the dessert I can get some awesome ranges . Sometime you can travel and get Ka . band for miles and you are wondering where is Leo sitting and when you do n't see nothing for miles it 's almost annoying . <p> I like both for what they do , they have been talking about the redline will get the BS and RDR seg but it have n't happen yet . <h> Re : Quick Escort RedLine Review <p> How far apart did you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time ?

Weak off-axis false alerts went un-detected . At the time , there were something like 12 different K and X falses on my 12 mile commute .

As he noted to me , leading the sheep to slaughter , remember I/O and QT radar are instant speed readouts for the LEO . <p> As a cautionary note , most radars have both " Fastest " and " Target " vehicle displays for the LEO . So the ricer may win the Fastest target , you may win the Target speed unless you 're far enough behind the rabbit . Go to the Stalker Radar dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the display the LEO sees . " Target " and " Fast " displays plus the " Patrol " car speed , three displays . <p> As far as " if " you show up in the LEOs display , it depends on how the LEO has his radar gun oriented to the flow of traffic NOT his vehicle , and how far behind the rabbit(s) you are . That is why it is important to have a top end RD to trail the rabbit(s) far enough back and still pick up that faint I/O or QT alert as the rabbit is impaled.

I mean of course you 'd like to have the most power you could have . However , your 29 is already peaked and tuned , which means that it 's definitely deadkeying more than what you want to drive that amplifier with . I am assuming this is a low drive amplifier . Yes , normally you will drive a low drive amp with 2-2.5 watts . A radio shop will normally set them somewhere in that range for use with a low drive amp . That being said , it is always best to bring the radio AND amp to a radio shop and have the radio set to whatever wattage works best with the amp . All amps are different , and sometimes you can drive it with a little more and get just that much more out of it , but you NEVER put more than 4 watts deadkey into a low drive amp . All of this aside though , your 29 has what is called a " swing kit " in it , and is likely swinging 30-35 watts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive an amplifier with . Two of the locals here have burned out their amplifiers driving them with 29 's and the very same swing kit you are likely using . <p> My 2 cents : Do n't bother using an amp with the 29 unless it 's at least a 200 watter , and if you do , take them to a radio shop and have your output toned down so as not to burn out the amp . <p> Also , if in the future you do want to use the 29 with an amp , I 'd recommend having a radio shop install what is called " variable power " in your radio . This way you could turn the wattage down for use with an amp if you 'd like , and then turn it up when you 're not using the amp . <p> i take it that i shouldnt bother with the 75 watt amp . maybe i should wait and get a hold of something in the 200-300 watt area before making any changes . what do you think ?

However , I 'm sure when the speaker is going off during an alert situation , the current is much higher , probably upwards of 600-700mA ? So with this in mind , is the wiring in a regular 24/26 awg telephone cord sufficient ? <p> On a different site , i found the schematic for the smart cord . My intention is mount a remote bright alert LED that is more inline with my field of vision than where the RD will be mounted . <p> If i 'm reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sink ) for the power led under no alert conditions . When an alert occurs , either this ground is electronically disconnected or supply voltage is present - in either case , current flows to the alert led , while at the same time , a voltage is present on the yellow wire . Using the voltage divider circuit ( 10K &amp; 680K resistors ) , the transistor is driven into saturation ( turned on ) , permitting the alert led to ground . <p> To make this function more so for alert purposes , the power led can be omitted as well . The 470O should not be omitted , but may need to be replaced with one of proper value based on current requirements of the alert led(s) . The transistor used is a general purpose 2n3904 NPN type , with a recommended maximum current capacity of 100mA . Should be plenty to drive several 20-30 mA LED 's , or one higher power led . Since it 's used strictly as a switch , other transistors with higher current handling capacity are available . <p> Edit2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any one have any idea of on what the ear phone jack is capable of sourcing , specifically in terms of voltage and current ? It would be much easier to just hook up an led or several led 's via a 1/8 " mono plug and call it a day . I need to use very bright LED 's however that are visible in the day time . <h> Re : Home made smart cord <p> Bel/Escort does n't provide any specs for the ear phone jack . I know that it ca n't source much current . The internal speakers on Bel/Escort models have an impedance of 38 Ohms . I do know that the maximum voltage at max volume at the earphone jack varies depending on the radar detector model , and of course the earphone jack is AC , not DC . Any DC current flow or ground loops for any accessory attached to the earphone jack must be blocked using a cap . Yet there is no reason I can think of why the earphone jack ca n't be used to properly drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As a final note before I begin detailing the install , feel free to request additional pics of anything related to the install . I know I did a lot of reading other threads before I tried to take off certain trim panels , so I 'd be glad to help make the process easier for others . Now on to the good part : <p> Hardwire details : I tapped into the positive lead wire for the 12v accessory plug ( constant power ) to power the V1 using the included hardwire adapter . I added a relay between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via an accessory power source that 's on when the key is in " accessory " or " on " and turns off when you open the door .

One other idea I had to fully conceal the display was to make an upholstered or painted faceplate with tinted plexiglass that fits the whole opening where the display currently is , then mount the display a little further back behind the plexi . My only concern is that the concealed display 's sensor for its auto-dimmer feature may think its always dark out ( and therefore keep the display at minimum brightness ) if its hidden behind tinted plexi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Display - 09 Ford Fusion <p> To wrap up this post , I 'd like to invite any and all comments , questions , criticism . Also , please reply with suggestions on how to fill in the gaps around the remote display for a more finished look . <p> That 's some truly fine work ! My suggestion would be to use the original " FUSION " plastic piece as part of a hinged cover which flips open and reveals the CD behind it ; when the cover was flipped up and closed , your dash would look 100% stock . This would improve your stealth , making it tougher for thieves ( and any cop who stops you ) to see the CD.

If you can not do something with your plate like with a laser shield plate cover and/or Veil and laser shield together , I would recommend ( if legal , of course ) to enhance your arsenal with an active jammer . But be careful there as well , as more and more states are outlawing them and they are very easily detectable by simple visual inspection . <p> I know of a gentleman who had his new Mazda 6 permanently confiscated ( by the authorities ) for having been caught using a laser jammer .

I never had a Ka band detection with it . I gave it to a friend , it had many radar saves with . Only thing is is not equipped to detect pop . <p> I tested it alongside my STi , and I can honestly say , Im impressed . I drove by 2 k band speed signs , and 2 ka band speed signs . On the K band signs , it had a little more than half the range of the STi , which really not bad at all . On one of the Ka signs , it picked up at .7 miles while the STi picked up at .9 . Thing is , there was a curve at .7 so the STi picked up around the curve whereas the whistler only detected once it had a straight shot , hard to judge that . On the second sign , something strange happened . the STi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than half ( also on a curve ) , however as soon as the whistler started going off , the STi went silent . Interference maybe ? <p> I paid $20 for my Whistler 1730 at Best Buy a few years back , and used it as a backup to my X50 . It saved me a couple of times before I gave it to my sister for use as her primary--and even though it 's a budget detector , she 's had quite a few saves on it . It uses a very similar platform to the 1734 , with the main differences ( as I recall ) being in the 1734 's much more advanced display . <p> Yeah , Whistler makes some pretty nice budget detectors . Though most of the enthusiasts on this board would n't be happy with the range of these things , for $25 it can still save you from all constant-on and some IO speed traps . <p> Guys I hate to bring back this post , but IMHO any $40 detector is a ticket waiting to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about $40 detectors . I had a Whistler 1783 DE ( I think it was about $160 new in 04 ) and it did good , but lagged a little on Ka ... So any $40 detector probably would not even come close to that . Again I 'm not bashing Whistler at all - good detectors . But ANY $40 detector just wo n't cut it on Ka , I/O . It only creates a false sense of security . I should know - in my not so smart days years ago I had $60 Cobra - Ka ticket ... got rid of it the next day . <p> Do n't want to start a war , just be reeeeaaalll careful with ANY $40 detector ... <p> Ca n't go wrong on a Whistler for $25 .

No sweep can start or stop within that range either , so you have to sweep around it ( before and after ) . <p> You can duplicate/repeat the below sweeps so the V1 will over scan that frequency ( remember 34.7 must have 2 sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Custom Sweep #1 ( 34.7 ) - Start point at or just below 34.600 / Stop point at or just below 34.770 ( V1 should adjust to 34.770 if you are within a few MHZ under . ) <p> Custom Sweep #2 ( 34.7 ) - Start point at or just above 34.774 / Stop point at or just above 34.820 ( V1 should adjust to 34.774 if you are within a few MHZ above . <p> Custom Sweep #3 - Start point at or just below 35.400 / Stop point at or just above 35.600 . <p> Custom Sweeps #4,5,6 - Can be duplications of the above ( like I did ) for even better range/response , or if you see 33.8 in your area you can add 33.8 ( 33.7 - 33.9 ) . <p> Now click on the file button in the top right corner and save this as a new profile and name it . Your V1 will display a " C " when its in Euro mode with Custom settings you just programed . You can hold down the mute button to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can also change other settings like K-Band muting according to your preference ( time strength to mute ect ) . The K band muting can be a fantastic tool to reduce falsing dramatically and should be used according to your risk scnareo . <p> So if you decide to use the V1 with max time and signal strength muting in " l " mode here is the ( Risk Scenarios ) you should use ( l/L mode wont show when V1C is programed ) : <p> Note : " l " mode shows all K band alerts on the display but mutes sound for a specific time/strength . " L " mode does not show or provide audio for any K band alerts for a specific time/strength . <p> Basically i toggle between " A " mode when in " High Risk " areas and " l " mode when in " Low Risk " areas where there are a lot of falses , or where i would n't speed anyway . Just do n't forget to turn it back to " A " mode when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) In areas where police X and/or K band is n't used , use " l " mode . ( No Risk &amp; best area for " l " or " L " mode ) <p> 2 ) In areas where police do use K/X band but never sit in that area it would be a Low Risk area . You will most likely use " l " mode . But watch you display and listen for the bogey tones . Note : double tapping the mute button during an encounter temporarily kills the bogey lock tone . <p> 3 ) In areas where police K/X band is used and they do sit in that area it would be considered a ( High Risk ) area and " A " mode should be used . " A " mode should also be used on the highway . <p> The V1 provides a lot of information , and if used actively and with knowledge of your area and what the local LEOs use it can be programmed and adjusted to be pretty quiet . <p> If you decide use " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alert automatically for the time and strength you chose you should still drive through the area with caution if you suspect any chance it could be muting police radar . Simply use " l " mode when you want quiet and proceed with your own discretion and best judgment . ( There is all ways the option of switching to " A " mode when speeding in a " High Risk " area ) <p> V1 filtering mode Risk scenarios : Use the above threat risk scenarios to determine the usage of " l " mode . I suggest using " A " mode in " High Risk " areas and manually muting if you feel its safe . " L " " l " mode should be used sparingly and according to your Risk area . <p> Just so i do n't  loose my V1C fob and to make it more of an all in one cord i did this : <h> Re : V1 w/V1C Custom sweep programming ( Android ) . <h> Re : V1 w/V1C Custom sweep programming ( Android ) . <p> My V1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed photo cameras in my country ( ASIA ) .

Yes it can happen , likelihood of it happening over a 3 ft distance is low . To give you a sense of how low , if you are traveling 35MPH this is 51 Ft/sec to cover 3 ft it will take 0.0588 seconds .

This method obviously creates an error . LEO wo n't stop you if he 's not sure about which vehicle was the violator .

Just a guess . <p> The four wireless displays is so 4 patrol cars can all get the signal , I would bet you can have more then 4 if you like . It really depends on how the circuit is set up . It may require beam 1 to be broken first before the timer starts , if that is the case then it can only measure in one direction , if it does not care which is broken first then it would work in both directions . <p> Your correct if the officer is paying attention he may choose not to pursue if he has doubt , but our police are not the brightest light in the strain and are sometime motivated by other factors so they grab the next car that comes by that their displays says they were speeding . <h> Re : What is the ENRADD and how to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , they redesigned the unit , it is completely different , the transmitting unit is smaller .

If you pulled over right about there and hit it what could they say ? They left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ENRADD and how to beat it . <p> Hi everyone- <p> Thanks to Maestro for the information . I sucessfully negotiated down a 16+ ticket ( 4 points ) obtained via ENRADD to &lt;5 over ( 0 points ) with the officer before the hearing , based partially on the information and diagram you provided . <p> My argument(s) I prepared were as follows : - Officer did not have a direct view of the ENRADD device ( it was set up in a large dip in the road , actually losing sight of the cars ) . - Used the diagram Maestro provided incidicating a vehicle traveling the opposite direction could trip the second beam , after I tripped the first . <p> The officer originally offered 15 minutes before the hearing to cut the speed in half ( 8 over , 2 points ) . I pushed hard on the 5 over , and he said he would only do that if I had a compelling argument . So I used the above points , including photos I had taken of the vicinity from the Officer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over cars up the road ) . <p> He agreed he could not see the ENRADD device , but claimed there was a sign on the side of the road , adjacent to the ENRADD device , that he could see , which was his reference . And he claimed that he could see the car pass that sign . ( I challenged that ... I am pretty sure the officers were waiting around and only looked up when the wireless display indicated a speeder , then flagged the next car that came into sight ) . <p> My two pictures showed traffic on the road , and showed where they " disappeared " from view down the dip . He said " well in your photos the cars on the road are hiding the reference sign " . Of course , I suggested it was his burden to prove there was a reference sign there . He did n't have pictures to show that . <p> We actually continued to have a nice chat , he was a nice officer , but he would n't move from the 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . As I sat down and laid out my papers , he asked the judge for a minute ..... then told me he would agree to 5 over ( 0 points ) . He agreed I had a decent case , and was feeling in the holiday mood ... plus I was courteous throughout our discussions . <p> At that point , I figured why keep gambling . I was happy to get a partial refund and 0 points . Though I think I possibly could have won , I did n't want to get the 4 points ... so I accepted and did n't risk it . <p> One note . He indicated that if the second ENRADD beam is tripped first , that the display will show an error code . So therefore ENRADD ca n't be solely measuing a car traveling in the opposite direction . However , a car traveling opposite could trip the second beam after you trip the first ( as noted above , and as drawn by Maestro ) .

Seriously it would take a THOROUGH search of the car , in high light conditions , for someone to even have a clue there might be something there . Anyways , I live in VA where I 'm sure you all know , RD 's are illegal . So I have a few questions : <p> 1 . Are laser jammers illegal ? What is the fine ? 2 . Do LEO 's here generally use radar detector detectors ? If I have a very well concealed detector and just leave it on , what are the chances I 'll get pulled over for the detector ? 3 . If I do get " caught " with the RD , is the ticket the worst thing that can happen to me ? My biggest fear is that since the RD is integrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial or something . Would they have the right to do that , or try to make me get it uninstalled ? 4 . If I get a RD ticket , is there any way my insurance will go up because of that ? <p> 3 . You 'll get a ticket , and the LEO will copy the serial # of the RD . They do n't generally confiscate or impound in VA . You just get a no-points ticket . <p> 4 . RD tickets in VA are no-points , so your insurance should n't be aware of them . <p> Note that this info is dredged up from me reading other posts on here , I do n't live or drive in VA so take my answers with a small grain of salt ... <p> Also , most RD tickets in VA are issued not due to RDD usage but due to driver behavior , or the LEO seeing the RD on the windshield .

Everything is illegal in VA , if you are worried about breaking the law , do n't speed . 2 . VG-2 is the only RDD used in VA ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most new RDs are VG-2 immune . Whistlers try to hide from it , but not very well . There is no Sprectre here , at least that is what is posted here in the forum , I also asked several state police , and I never had encountered any by locals . 3 . They take down the serial num , return the rd and the ticket , like previously said , is a no point ticket , therefore wo n't affect your insurance <p> I run my RD all the time , and it is NOT intergrated . Just be smart and you do n't have anything to worry about . <p> Well the way I see it your only concern is if the cop knows and is persistant that you have an RD . At that point it is going to be tricky to feel out the situation how far the cop will go . You can be upfront and honest ... that will make for a hell of a uninstall on the spot , or run the risk of your car getting impounded . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god sakes if you see a cop , turn the RD off . <p> You may seriously want to concider haveing a cheap throw away detector just in case ! Inorder to get the monkey off your back . The RD fine is minimal , hell you even get to keep the junk detector . Just easier . Again you have to feel out th esituation if you ever get into a situation . <p> My take on this is sell your remote detector and get one you can mount pretty much out of sight inside the car . <p> There are two reasons . <p> 1 . You will have better protection . <p> 2 . If you get caught with the remote it is a PITA to remove at the side of the road . The cops are n't stupid . I 've had remote detectors and Steve Wonder could easily spot them when standing in front of the car . If you mount them in a non visible place you get even worse detection capability . <p> Now with a laser jammer you are kind of screwed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is currently little chance of being detected on the fly . <p> Personally I hope they never change the VA . RD and Jammer laws . Because so few people have these devices it is n't worth it for the police to invest in much detection equipment . BTW according to Roy the Va . state police have one Spectre RDD per barracks if I remember correctly . <p> VA from inside info is phasing out ( already phased out in some areas ) VG2 's and currently have no plans for Spectre 's ( in mass ) . Instead there are ' setups ' where one fires a radar pulse and another looks for braking . Sometimes this is a team game , sometimes it 's solo . <p> VA from inside info is phasing out ( already phased out in some areas ) VG2 's and currently have no plans for Spectre 's ( in mass ) .

I can not find a good location near rear view mirror to locate , and some dimmimg feature on the RVM makes it impossable to use the clamp trick I have seen here .

Would I be loosing the effectivness of the front unit trying to shoot between the front seats ? Or am I missing anything else ?

Instant-On prevents you from knowing he 's there ... unless he instant-on 's someone in front of you ( down the road ) and your RD picks up the signal thereby alerting you that a threat may be coming up . <p> POP is a special ultra-fast version of Instant-On ( implemented by the MPH company ) where the radar gun only comes out of " standby " for 67ms ( or 0.067 secs ) in order to obtain your speed very quickly w/o notifying RD 's of the LEO 's presence ( you wo n't have a chance to pick up his signal shot at a car ahead and therefore know a threat lies ahead like w/instant-on ) unless your RD has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal way of obtaining someone 's speed w/which to write a ticket .

So legally , POP radar , although a threat , is not really a threat itself since it is not to be used as grounds for writing a speeding ticket .

Your RD is working fine . Give it a few weeks .

The enforcement is heavier here than where I 'm from originally which is Mich ..... Mich has some of the most lax enforcement than anywhere I 've been , and I 've traveled all throughout the US . <p> I can say that most radar encounters I 've had in the Carolinas have been Ka 35.5 . Rarely do I get a K band detection , but it is used . If you were to get an RD , I would suggest getting one that is the best at sniffing out Ka 35.5 . Some of the people on this forum will know which ones they are . <p> I have a Whistler pro 78 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not a speed demon ... rarely will I ever be 10 mph over the PSL . They are sometimes weak against off axis 35.5 encounters , but from what I 've learned , the 35.5 is the hardest band to detect with all radar detectors . <p> I do know the state troopers will use instant on radar .... in fact , I ca n't remember when the last time I have passed a constant on radar trap . There is n't a RD made which will keep you from getting clocked during an IO encounter . <h> Re : Hello from north Carolina <p> thanks everyone ! <p> but i 'm still wondering if i should keep my bell v995 or go with the escort 8500x50 ? for ka band detection distance , what one performs better ? the 8500x50 is 20 bucks more but i do n't  mind spending that if its better . i drive over 100 miles a day so i wan na make sure im able to pick them up at a distance . <h> Re : Hello from north Carolina <p> Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws are tough here and the enforcement is definetly working hard to get your money . Your 995 is adequate . I had a V940 that worked for me for many years . I also used an X-50 in another car . They are about the same in performance , the x-50 just has better user options . I alway have mine on Highway mode . If you are traveling mostly highway you should not be bothered by falses too much other than the radar drones placed on overpasses . Do n't  turn off x band as they still use it occasionally here . In my area they use K band alot too so you have it all . My immediate area does not use LIDAR yet but other parts of the state use it alot . State troopers use it all over . They have alot of different unmarked vehicles and they use cover and terrain very well .

Yep down in NC the laws are stern on speeding and the fines are serious , 15 over is reckless driving and a mandatory 30 day license suspension or anything over 80 . NC sucks . The troopers in NC do use X , K , Ka , Instant On , Vascar , and Lidar . If they are using lidar you are toast with a radar detector . Check out the jammer section because NC State Highway Patrol loves using Lidar . They have a lot of unmarked vehicles as well .

Theyll fart around zapping a few drivers till the plane arrives . They usually cut off their radar after that so there is no warning . <p> A good example is where I-75 and I-4 intersect . Just a few miles south of there on I-75 past Hwy 60 ( Bradenton exit ) you 'll be tooling along northbound , the plane is rolling back southbound after a runhe is timing you going northbound while he is headed southbound , blanks , follows you and the crowd your in , and the overpass just north of Hwy 60 , I have seen , will have four to twelve LEOs waiting , massacre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're in FL get a scanner you 'll need it . <p> And yeah theyll use a laser setup from a bridge that way too , just watch out for " dem planes " !

Or maybe it 's a " stealth " version of the Speedlaser because they put it in an Advantage case ? <p> When you pull the trigger of the Laser Atlanta after putting it in stealth mode you will hear the audio tone is different than normal mode . To put it back in normal mode , repeat the process to turn stealth mode off . <p> Laser Atlanta guns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if it is not an option on the gun you obtained then it is pretty old . Hope this helps . <p> The lidar menu that you posted is similar ( and helpful ) but not exacly the same as on the unit . Some of the options are on different screens and other options , such as changing the crosshairs to a dot I can not seem to locate . I can find the test modes for range , volume controls , etc . <p> Kapatz , I am not sure but I think you may be correct about the unit being reflashed at one point . It is also possible that the case was replaced for whatever reason . <p> As jimbonzzz noted in his post when the unit starts is shows P/N XXXXXXXX for part number , and then VX.XX for firmware . Then it just shows STEALTH SPEEDLASER . It also shows this info when you enter the test mode . When I get home I will post the firmware version . I think it may be Ver 2.63 or 2.93 if I remember correctly .

I have an RX65 that has NEVER alerted for any safety area ( yes , SWS is activated ) , yet my Father-in-law 's Cobra picks them up in my area all the time . And no , they are n't falsies . <p> SWS use can be anywhere or nowhere . For example , SWS is not widely used in Indiana . But there are some Wishard Ambulances ( Indy 's main Ambulance Service ) do have SWS transmitters . I 've seen Hoosier Helper ( CVS ) vans that help stranded motorists with SWS transmitters . I picked them up with my BEL 985 and it actually displayed a message . Krogers with multiple K band door sensors have caused some false SWS alerts . <p> SWS is a hit or miss type of thing . You wo n't see a lot of them around anywere as far as I know . <p> Okay ... another related question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as what Bel uses ? Meaning if a Cobra picks up an alert , should my RX65 ALSO pick up that same alert ? I swear my Father-in-law gets warnings for approaching trains and road construction and even some kid picking his nose on the side of the road . Yet all I get is silence from the RX65 : ? <p> Okay ... another related question ... is the warning system that Cobra uses the same thing as what Bel uses ? Meaning if a Cobra picks up an alert , should my RX65 ALSO pick up that same alert ? I swear my Father-in-law gets warnings for approaching trains and road construction and even some kid picking his nose on the side of the road . Yet all I get is silence from the RX65 : ? <p> Dep <p> The big question is does your in-laws Cobra actually display an SWS message , such as , " Work Zone " or " Train Approaching " , or is it just alerting SWS ? The Bel RX65 actually decodes valid SWS messages . <p> I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traffic Warning System . " <p> Then I went to the Beltronics site and they call it " Safety Warning System radar capability . " <p> Are these the same company or something different ? Maybe that is why the Cobra alerts to different things than the RX65 alerts to . It could also be that the Cobra is POS that alerts to everything and alerts everybody else with a quality radar detector that they are in the area . <p> While SWS messages are encoded , Cobra 's " SAS " system works by regular CW K-band signals being present at certain specific frequencies . However , these frequencies are in the valid bandpass for police radar and motion sensors . So , the SAS system is likely much more prone to false alerts than SWS.

If you have two reference points and you know the distance between them ( for the sake of argument , let 's say your objects are 300 feet apart ) , you 'd do the following : <p> 1 . Start the stopwatch when the front of the car reaches the first object . Stop the watch when the front of the car reaches the second object . Always start and stop when the same part of the car reaches the object ( e.g. front of car ) . You could use the back of the car , antenna , or whatever , as long as you use the same reference point on the car for both starting and stopping the watch . <p> 2 . The elapsed time is how many seconds it took to cross the indicated distance ( 300 feet in my example ) . If the car took 5 seconds , he went 300/5 = 60 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows . 5280 feet in a mile , 3600 seconds in an hour , so divide 5280/3600 = 1.47 . Divide feet/second by this number to get mph. 60 / 1.47 = 40.9 mph . <p> 4 . To convert directly from time in seconds to mph , given the distance in feet is known , divide the distance by the 1.47 we came up with above . 300 / 1.47 = 204 ( approx ) . Divide this number ( 204 ) by the number of seconds to get speed in mph ( 204 / 5 = 40.8 mph ) . <p> It may seem a bit convoluted , but I 'm a bit rusty in algebra ( graduated HS 20 years ago , I do n't do it very often ) <p> As stated just use two objects as a car passes by them .... Make sure you start/stop it with the same part of the car ... does n't  matter where as long as it is the same referance point on the car otherwise your time will be off . I found the best thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pole that have a digital readout by the handle , and every 1/4 , 1/2 , or full revolution ( depeding on how good it is ) it equates to a certain distance . Think of it as : 1 revolution of the wheel it covers ' X ' distance and the little device automatically calclates distance by : ' X ' times Revoltions to give you your foot/yard etc etc etc readout ( they have all different sized ones ) . A lot of bio teachers have this for marking the distance between two species , or contruction/engineering courses will have this for obvious purposes . <p> 2 Problems : 1 ) If the objects are at ( different ) angles compared to your POV your time will be off . So you cant have that . 2 ) Using a small distance is a very bad thing to do ... make it as long as you can . ( because if you get trigger happy with the stopwatch and stop it 1/2 second sooner it will have a huge impact on your final numbers ) . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markers , because most of the time pending extremely high speeds .25 or .50 seconds would not have a MAJOR impact on the readout . ) <p> Think about it if you are off by .5seconds in a 1/4 mile ( 1320ft ) that 's not huge . Now take that same .50 seconds and plug it into 1/18th of a mile ( Approx 295ft ) . OR LESS and you have a some pretty big problems coming from .50seconds . <p> ( Because .50seconds will be a very small fraction of the total time in seconds it took a person to go a 1/4mile ..... however it will be a much larger fraction of the time it took them to go 1/18th of a mile so it will skew the MPH calculation by much more . ) <p> Easy post to anwser . First pick a place you want to start to measure as your start . Grab a stopwatch and drive the speedlimit constantly for .25 miles . see how long it takes on your stopwatch . Write down that time . Then at the .25 mile mark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ( at the begining ) . <p> You wo n't really know the exact speed of the vehicles going too slow or too fast but you will have an idea if they are going over or under the limit .

Ordinarily , it is up to those who dislike photo enforcement to make their way to an automated ticketing location so that they can express their political opinion . This time , however , the city paid a visit to the protesters and used the opportunity to conduct a surveillance operation . The newly formed group CameraFraud.com openly used its website to encourage local residents to attend a Friday evening meeting to discuss strategies to encourage the city to drop photo ticketing . Soon after learning of the event , Scottsdale updated its photo enforcement schedule for Friday to include a new location . It ordered a van to the 7600 block of East MacDowell Road , the location of Peter Piper Pizza where the activist meeting was held . A photograph taken by an attendee shows that the camera van was perfectly positioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway ( view full-size image ) . It was also parked illegally . " With hundreds of places where the vans could be located , multiplied by the various times of operation , the chances of such placement being an ' honest mistake ' seems highly unlikely -- but not impossible , " CameraFraud founder D.T. Arneson wrote . " Now , one is led to wonder if the city is actively attempting to intimidate businesses and perhaps provoke peaceful citizens who are guilty of no crime other than lawful assembly over a pizza pie . " This is not the first time that a city has used photo enforcement equipment to intimidate political enemies . Washington , DC officials ordered a mobile speed camera positioned outside the offices of the Washington Times on New York Avenue . The paper broke several news stories embarrassing to the program , including the admission of the then-mayor that photo radar 's main purpose was to generate revenue . " It was literally right before the entrance to our building , " said Brett M. Decker , a former editorial writer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It might , it might not . Depends as much on who you are listening to as it does on your antenna . A trunking repeater , you will hear five to ten miles away . A patrol car not going through a repeater , probably not . Bottom line is , without some kind of external antenna , outside the metal cage of the car , your performance is seriously limited . Very little performance improvement can be achieved by simply buying a more expensive rubber duck .

Thanks - Russ . <p> I have a rd9xl. one in great shape , w/visor clip . but Like you I keep it around for nostalgia reasons . also have a whistler spectrum 3se. a maxon rd1/and a rd30. and the original escort . just for old time sakes ...

Sounds like it 's not firmware dependent . Thanks for clarifying . <p> Given that you were running two detectors side by side , we ca n't rule out interference either . I know it was a Redline you tested with , but even the Redline will alert to the Spectre if you put it close enough .

I was n't there and I only saw the little clip you posted on youtube , but how can we be sure that some detectors were n't pointed off in different directions , incorrectly skewing the results ? Is it possible that one detector was being tested on axis while another was being tested off axis , for example ? Radar detector sensitivity can vary significantly based on the angle the horn is receiving the signal so you looked to be introducing a bunch of variables that could easily be invalidating your results . <p> It 's certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things happen . At the same time , we have to make sure the testing itself is conducted properly for obvious reasons .

For example , yesterday it was 19 degrees outside , I start the car and sure enough I keep getting POP alerts and I have to just unplug the detector until the radar detector warms up then it is fine . <p> I also have always received laser alerts constantly when the sun shines towards the lens and sometimes for no reason at all , it occurs so much that i turned it off . For example , I brought the rx65 in the house a few minutes ago and plugged it into a 12v adapter and turned on the laser mode and it suddenly went off for no reason 2 times . I know the police are not running laser in my house lol so of course it is a false alert . <p> I called beltronics today , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted my credit card # so I told them I would call back because I did not have it with me .

I have 3 older bel detectors and i have no issues with false laser alerts EVER . <p> Should I just turn off POP and laser and live with it or send it in for service ? <h> Re : Beltronics RX65 issues , need help <p> My RX65 will false laser when bright sun hits it ( say early in the morning when there 's solar glare ) . Many detectors do this .

Those are so sensitive they false laser when you look at them the wrong way . <p> As for POP , I 've never used it on my RX , but it can false from other detectors ( esp . Cobras ) . I 'd just leave that off . If the unit works well for picking up real radar , hang on to it . Otherwise , send it in for service . <p> What other Bels do you have ? I do know the M4-platform RX65 is one of the more sensitive units to laser .

Recovery of plates and vehicles as well as removing drivers with suspended or revoked licenses from the streets not only have a tremendous impact on safety , but on the insurance industry as well , because fewer claims are being paid out.This unit can check for expired insurence , Registration , warrents out for arrest ...

This being a toll road they could " register " each vehicle at this point and then " register " again at the toll collection point to determine if the vehicle 's average speed exceeded the limit . I believe this is done in other countries and I think it has been tested in the US but I never knew exactly where .

About six weeks ago I began using WAZE and said I would report back with my experience using the app . In urban settings ( in Alabama ) I found it useful in keeping me up to date on traffic conditions ( heavy traffic , stoppages , etc ) . To a lesser degree police reports . Just this past week I drove from Birmingham to Gulf Shores , AL . A trip of about 260 - 270 miles each way . 70%of the trip was interstates and 30% four lane state routes . I found myself announcing disable cars on the side of the road , debris in the road , and the occasional radar trap on the interstate and on the state roads . I was disappointed that apparently I was pretty much alone out there , with few WAZE participants adding traffic information . This was mainly due to few WAZE members transiting on the roads I was using . <p> WAZE has the potential to be a great app and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the problem ( at least in Alabama is there are not that many members of WAZE on the road ) . Hopefully as more people sign up for the app and interact with the app , the value will grow . <h> Re : WAZE Review <p> The wind down of the vacation travelers has left my almost midnight ride home has seen a drop off in users . This summer it was busy with many Waze users both day and night . But weekends are still busy here in Ohio . The demographic with a smart phone plays a big role too in how many other users there are at any one time . Ohio 's texting law banning texting , what ever that definition is , has put a dampener on users reporting information . Even though the new law has a six month , non-primary offense . <h> Re : WAZE Review <p> The latest version has added touch-free voice activation . Basically wave your hand in front of the gps and tell it--through a few menus--what you are reporting . Eyes on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , but I was just discussing with someone the other day how much better this type of app would be if the user-input of waze could be combined with the functionality of google maps--there are tons of users . So as not to disenfranchise iphone users , I would think an app could be written for the iphone as well that taps into google mapping . <p> Waze functions coupled with the user base and maps of android/google . That would be powerful . <h> Re : WAZE Review <p> The concept of Waze is awesome but unfortunately you got some people who reporting pointless things just to build points . I did however see something funny a couple of times . A user reported a bunch a prostitutes on a sidewalk as a hazard and another user reported cheerleader car wash fundraiser as an accident site . <h> Re : WAZE Review <p> I myself am getting rather tired of the down vehicle reports .

This Waze non sense is not for me .

I only see 3 or 4 per morning on my 20 mile drive to work . Maybe there are less people in the Atlanta area ? <h> Re : WAZE Review <p> I been using Waze for a while now and from what I see on the road Cobb County , GA they are plenty of folks who are using Waze on the road . The emount of information is fairly good , they are reports of accident , road hazards , traffic conditions and occasional revenue party . I did not have the opportunity to really tested the maps for accuracy though so I can not speak for that .

Short story long ... about 3 weeks ago I was omw to work on the NJPW and was doing my usual 80mph ... I moved from the left lane to the right lane ( 3 lane change but not at one time ) a little faster than I should have . As I am about to take the exit off the PW ...

He said " well today just cost you close to $1,000 and you have n't even made it to work yet " ( he added the cost of my radar into the equation lol ) . <p> As soon as he said that ... he gave me back my papers and simply told me to " slow down " ... and it was over just like that ! He did n't even go back to his truck and run me . I graciously thanked him and went on my way . <h> Re : Do FOP stickers help ? <p> I used to live in Northern NJ and I used my PBA cards a couple of times over the years .

He wrote his name on the back of the card with the notation 35/25 then gives it back to me . He advises me to slow down and says I 'm free to go . I heard some LEO 's confiscate the card and mail it back to the officers name on the back to let them know that the cardholder was stopped for a traffic offense . I hardly ever used the card in fear of losing it and not getting a new card next year . They do come in handy at times .

The detector actually detects the VG-2 , provides an alert and then hides the local oscillator ( LO ) by shutting down for a short time . With this , the detector is unable to detect police radar but laser can still be received . When the unit reactivates and VG-2 is out of range , the detector will detect radar once again . One problem , if the VG-2 units are modified in some way these detectors are unable to shut down and will be detected without warning .

I 'm so happy with it I 've just ordered in another similar , updated version of the same detector for only $30 as a Amazon Warehouse " Used-Like New " deal , , , the CR70 , , , which has traffic flow signal rejection and may be slightly updated in other respects . <p> I 've never experienced a laser alert in rural Missouri . The threat outside of the Kansas City and St. Louis metro areas is primarily radar , either Ka or K band . Even the lower end Whistler units do a fine job of detecting radar and the higher end " Rev C " units should do even better .

You get one button for power , one button that does both filtering and volume , and a display consisting of a single red 7-segment character that does n't seem to dim at all . That displays H for highway , F for filter , 1-9 for signal strength , and P for pulse ( yup , that 's a Whistler ) . As far as I can tell it is only capable of detecting X and K bands . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's nearly 20 years old ? In reality it is n't terribly useful since it wo n't detect Ka band , which is the bulk of law enforcement around here . And they had n't even thought of LIDAR when this thing was built . But let me just say that on X and K band this thing is insane ! I drove around my test-loop ( roughly 15 miles ) and learned that it picks up X and K band JUST AS WELL AS MY V1 ! . There are door openers on that route that I did n't even know existed . It alerted on time or early to those that I already knew about . So is it increased range or decreased filtering ? Beats me , as I have n't tried it in " F " mode yet . Maybe tomorrow . <p> I was fortunate enough to have one real LEO encounter that drove it positively insane on K-band ( I assume ... I had n't gotten used to the video-game tones ) and produced a " P " alert at first . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other from odd angles and I really was n't expecting it . <p> Considering its age this is a truly phenomenal device . It just goes to show you that back in the day Whistler did know what they were doing . Now I have half a mind to pick up a Pro 58 to play with for comparison ! <p> So there you have it , a review of something that is n't the " top 3 . " And here 's a terrible pic to go along with it : <p> I 'm curious , does anybody know what kind of receiver the Spectrum 1 uses ? I 've searched all over the net for more information and actually did find a reference to it on the Whistler website , but the owners manual is n't there . <p> I 'm still playing with it since the V1 is n't back yet . I 'm still getting the falses where I should be and lots of range , to boot . However I think that some of the other falses are coming from other sources . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go nuts on a small news van that was driving around . Later on I plugged it in to a transformer and watched it go nuts , pulling up X and K hits at 1/3 strength every few minutes .

Which is least likely to get caught ? Is it worth it to combine them or is just 1 enough to do the job ? Anything else effective , such as 3m duct tape worth adding to the list ? Any difference between front and rear plate , is 1 technique better in front/back compared to another ? <p> Also , would your suggestion change at all depending on what type of jammer is being used , LED or diode ( say a zr4 vs Cheetah PASS , waiting on some test results before making that decision ) ? <p> The typical metal state-issued front plate is highly LIDAR reflective . The fact that it is flat , and totally perpendicular to the roadway , certainly does n't help . These reasons , combined together , makes it the preferred targeting point of enforcers in front-plate-mandatory states/areas . Enforcers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before anything else . <p> As such , one would expect that by addressing this " point weakness , " LIDAR effectiveness can be decreased - and similarly , by playing the game the right way , you could also " bait " enforcement , too , by offering up a valid " front plate " for targeting . <p> In terms of addressing laser reflectivity , it 's much the same as the concerns presented by the vehicle 's light-assemblies . Here , instead of reflectors either beyond an overlying lens or laying beyond a projector lens , you 've got directly-exposed reflective elements - much the same as on the tail-light or rear of many vehicles ( or even those reflectors on your kids ' bikes ) . What we are looking to do , as countermeasures hobbyists , is to cut reflectivity as much as possible ( visible-light reflectivity , although a far-from-perfect measure of laser reflectivity , is nonetheless a predictative factor ) . <p> You can cut reflectivity by " roughing up " the surface of the plate in a number of ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with road-grime to try to scruff them up a bit using steel-wool or fine-grade Emory paper - or you could try to " matte " its surface with , say , a spray-coating of matte-finish clearcoat , covering it with a single layer of carefully laid 3M Clear Duct Tape ( yes , this actually works ) , or using a commercial cover , such as the LaserShield ( which is a matte/dimpled plastic cover ) . You could even use VEIL ( either on the plate , directly , or on the exterior and/or interior of an overlying cover ) . The idea here is to simply break-up the LIDAR return by substituting a non-smooth surface for where , before , only a smooth surface existed and thus facilitated the return of the laser beam . <p> The trick to the stuff above , though , is how much compromise you 're willing to make , in terms of the aesthetics of the situation ( i.e. " scruffing up " the plate - which , here in the snow belt , can lead to rusting ) , and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area ( the LaserShield , for example , is readily " visible " when about 30 ft. away from the vehicle , particularly if you know what you 're looking for ) . <p> Another way to address this concern is to physically think about the plate itself ..... that is , to say , substitute the reflective-material embedded state-issue metallic plate for a less-reflective one . This can be achieved by using anything from a high-quality color photocopy of the state plate to purchasing fiberglass/plastic replicas of the plate ( from , for example , CR8APL8 ) . Again , here , the question will be how far you 're willing to go in terms of aesthetic compromises - and also , with the replica plates , the spectre of it potentially being " illegal " becomes more of a concern , too . <p> ---- <p> The above was a copy-past that was a part of my e-mail to a friend of mine . <p> The following is a very recent thread , which further illustrates the specific points covered above of : <p> Now , the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not if one 's jammer setup/choice affects passive countermeasures concerns . <p> Without a doubt , yes , this is definitely a consideration - for those with " weaker " jammers , the more passive protection layered-on , the better . <p> However , even for those with an overwhelming array of top-flight active jammers capable of " screwing the gun " , it is my personal belief that passive countermeasures should not be overlooked , particularly in terms of such vulnerable " hardpoints . " <p> To me , it 's about achieving a full circle of defense , where each layer of active and passive protection combines , in-synergy , to render a result that 's greater than the sum of its parts . <h> 3m Lidar Reflectivity Of License Plates <p> There are a couple of other things you can do to reduce the amount of IR bounced back to the LEO LIDAR 's detector . Along the same line as the stealth fighter technology you can change the angle of the front plane of the license plate downward ( towards the road surface ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser bean downward into the road . This is technique is used in the stealth fighter geometry in that the angles are such that what radar is n't absorbed is deflected away from the point of origin . <p> Another technique would be to creat a subtle convex bend in the license plate so that when looking from above it is bowed out towards the LOE LIDAR . This keeps the entire plate from reflecting back ... a single vertical line will be reflected back and the sharper the bow the thinner this vertical line . <p> You could actually combine both of these methods to reduce your LIDAR IR Cross Section ... wo n't make you undectable of course . It will just make your detectable range a little less as you will have to be closer to the LOE before LOE gets a reading . <p> This license plate issue is pretty gnarly . Way too much reflectivity from that thing to even try and take a chance with it on the front end . The rear plate you generally have to use because of the opportunities law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excepted because he 's a stealth freak of nature ) . Case in Point : When we tested our jammers last Spring SpeedDemon was very stealthy but still caught a PunchThru on his single head LPP because the operator probably caught a piece of his " state issue " plate he keeps on his dashboard . So in my opinion if your serious about reducing forward reflectivity the state issue plate has got to go . <p> The CR8APL8 looks fake up close but with a plate cover it will easily pass casual inspection . I think in the final analysis all illusions are a form of diversion . The front plate is like the magicians fake thumb . It only looks fake when you know what it is and when to look for it . <p> I got crap for my plates while using lasersheild covers from a late night leo . He claimed he could n't see them when his lights were turned off ? ! ? ! Besides that I found if you put some adhesive in the middle of the shield and the plate , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates more clearly . <p> You will notice that the letters/numbers are not reflective . Only the background contains those very tiny pigment called ' ' cataphore ' ' , which reflects the incidental light to any angle , not depending the angle of arrival . <p> So you apply a flat paint , latex outdoor house paint , of the right color on every reflective surface . Apply meticulously so to render as good as the ' ' original ' ' . <p> You could also color photocopy your plate , apply/replace the real plate , with some kind of weather protection of your own recipe . <p> You will notice that the letters/numbers are not reflective .

A contract between a regional joint committee and The Guard and Warden Service House Ltd seen by The Sunday Times states that if local councils reduce the weekly hours of service , the fees increase to ensure a satisfactory return for the company . On the other hand , the rates are lowered if the councils request more hours than those listed in the agreement . On Sundays and public holidays , the charges increase . The services , managed by the various local councils ' joint committees , also include the provision and installation of speed cameras . Under the agreement , the contractor receives the majority of the revenue from speeding fines though it has to foot the bill for installation and maintenance . The Guard and Warden Service House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nine joint committees . When contacted , Kenneth De Martino , chief executive of KDM Group , of which The Guard and Warden Service House Ltd is a subsidiary , said : " We were successful because we believed in the system and we invested in equipment , vehicles , computers , software and people , " he said . The company is also responsible for the installation , operation and maintenance of speed cameras . While motorists have accused the Malta Transport Authority ( ADT ) of using cameras to solve cash flow problems , it transpires that the ADT actually gets a minimal portion of the revenue . For the duration of the five-year contract , speeding fines are established at 69.90 per ticket . In the first year , the income is shared as follows : 66.6 per cent to the company and 33.3 per cent to the local council . From its share , the local council has to pay 11.65 per ticket to the ADT . It also has to reimburse the contractor the cost of postage at the rate of 15c for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next year , the share of revenue for local councils increases to 40 per cent , and then to 46.6 per cent in the following six months .

However , the large majority of speeding fines are issued in the first three to four months of a camera 's operation , making the company the main beneficiary . Mr De Martino confirmed that his company generated good revenue in the initial months that speed cameras are installed and their percentage of revenue decreased as income fell . But , he said , this was fair due to the investment made by the company : " The first three to four months are healthy from a commercial point of view but after that the revenue from speed cameras dies ; yet the level of service remains , " Mr De Martino said . " The cost base is phenomenal . We made a great investment in equipment , support services and licensing fees . " Cameras also need to be calibrated every 12 months , which means I have to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by the Malta Standards Authority for inspection and calibration . " Mr De Martino insisted that his company provided a service and had no control over the number of speed cameras installed or their location and speed limit . Before the privatisation of traffic management , enforcement fell exclusively within the competence of the police . Now , as well as The Guard and Warden Service House Ltd , another company - Sterling Security - provides local enforcement services to the two joint committees grouping 14 local councils in the south of Malta .

" The " biggest thing I noticed right off the bat was how much the " K " band sensitivity went through the roof . There is a K band speed sign I tested it on . It is a fairly flat road straight into the k band speed sign . It was a cool night and it gave me an almost 2 mile warning on and still does to this day . 1.8 to be precise . Before the update , maybe 1 mile .9 miles . Sold me on the upgrade . I will be honest though , I did not see much ( feel ) of a Ka band or X band increase at all . Minimal at best .

Hope this helps you out . <p> Thank you very much for the prompt reply . <p> So what I understand from your real life experience using now the very same STI Driver unit but with a STI Magnum software/firmware : better detection range on K-band ONLY but pretty much insignificant improvement on Ka-band , the only two radar bands ( k and ka ) I 'm interested in ( x-band always off on my STI , no x-band anywhere in Ontario and none from Buffalo , NY all the way to Key West , FL , major interstates and hwys of course ) . <p> Our OPP uses K-band anywhere in Ontario , you see their radar unit in this video : <p> Probably next spring I 'll go for the upgrade , but I have one more question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the upgrade , I mean who was responsible for the shipping and how much , I know the upgrade itself is $100 but what about shipping ( to/from Escort ) , included in the $100 upgrade or not ? And how long it took to get it back from Escort , 1 , 2 , 3 weeks maybe ? <p> Toronto PD , the ones I have to deal with on a daily basis , uses Ka 33.8 , ALL Municipal Police Forces in SW and SE Ontario all using Ka-band radar , OPP is the only one on K-band but they patrol only major hwys plus regions in Northern Ontario where I do not live in . So if you ever cross the border into Canada/Ontario and drive Hwy 401 or QEW , your ONLY concern should be the K-band alert . <p> From Bufallo , NY all the way to Florida , either on I-95 corridor ( Virginia included ) or I-90 to I-75 , 100% Ka-band only , mostly Ka 34.7 plus some sporadic Ka 35.5 , from all my road trips to the States only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NC State Troopers use Ka 34.7 radar . <p> With the X-band police radar issue , IMO it 's 99% obsolete nowadays , only some very poor ( police budget of course ) jurisdictions , mostly country side , still use some very old and antique radar units running on X-band , obviously excellent to pinpoint exactly where X-band police radar is still in use , but other than that , my advice is to simply disable the X-band on your STI Driver/Magnum . <p> But just curious ( mostly to see how small or large that jurisdiction really is ) , what police force in NJ still uses X-band radar ? <p> And about I-95 VA , have done that road tons of times , also from Richmond to Virginia Beach and then south to the one and only NC 's OBX , I never bothered taking down my ( hardwired up by the sun visor ) STI Driver and TONS of VA State Troopers all running Ka 34.7 around . <p> I even used it in Washington DC but the K-band falses were extremely annoying so decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ( always ) very crowded streets , right ? <p> Love my current STI Driver ( built 50/08 ) , it runs flawlessly , as soon as I 'll get the Magnum upgrade installed ( maybe next spring ) I 'll come back and post my first impression on the upgrade . <h> Re : Sti driver upgrade to magnum ? <p> after giving the new magnum sti a test run on the track I find that the k band has no improvement . ka 35.5 and ka 34.7 still the same .

I understood that the Velocity ( according to Bushnell ) was the newest one .. <p> A tuning fork wo n't tell you if it is off frequency . But if it is spec 'd at K-Band , still clocks the speed of objects OK , and does n't set off your detectors that work for other K-Band sources , then it most likely drifted . <p> To really tell , you would need to measure it with a " frequency counter " that goes into the K-Band range . <p> Something else you could try ( at your own risk of course ) is put it into the refrigerator or freezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if it alerts your detectors when cold . A big change in temperature will also change the frequency , and might pull it back into the proper range but only as long as it is cold , this would tell you for sure that is the problem . If that does n't work , then maybe try to heat it up somehow ... <p> The bushnell Velocity is supposed to be K-Band , so it should trigger your detectors . But the guns are cheap . So it is possible that your unit might have drifted outside of the police K-Band . <p> Jim <p> I do n't appreciate your unkind words about the bushnell velocity ..... even though you may be smart when it comes to some radar stuff that does n't mean you know that much about the bushnell velocity . It is not as cheap as you think it is . It is built very nicely if I say so myself . And for the money you ca n't beat it .

I just recently had to send my X50 in for repair because it would so call " " hibernate " " it would be on but not pick up anything after a certain amount of time . ops : But I just wanted to point out that I have tested mine out on my detector and it picks up the radar gun fine . It does n't drift of frequency like you think it may . It is not a piece of crap . I am not going to spend $1000 on a falcon K band radar gun when I can buy one that is just as good and is JUST as accurate for $80 . I am not an idiot . : x Sorry to be harsh , it 's just I wanted to defend that the bushnell velocity is a good K band radar gun .

Then , later down the road there he is . I was amazing . But at other times i can pull right up next to one and its silent . Is it always that inconsistent ? <h> Re : Whistler XTR-330 Review ? <p> it could mean that he is not using radar . Radar detector does not mean it 's a cop detector . It just goes off if the cops are actively using radar or laser to acquire speed . Therefore if the cop is pulled over on the side of the road watching a movie or reading a magazine or eating a cheeseburger your RD will not go off . <h> Re : Whistler XTR-330 Review ? <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? Maybe i 'm wrong here . I know how it works . I know its a " radar detector " not just a cop detector . Yellowtibby if you own one , do you know an estimate of its range ? <h> Re : Whistler XTR-330 Review ? <p> it 's hard to give exact numbers since there are so many variables that come into play with range . e.g. geography ( curves hills ) , weather , traffic , etc . I would say on a flat straight road the 1 mile for Ka band 1+ mile for K band . On hilly terrain probably around .4 miles for both K and KA . but like I said there really is no accruate number . Also this is assuming they are using constant on radar , not instant on . Most cops I see around here in CT do n't even use radar , and the ones that do never leave it on unless they are actively trying to do speed enforcement ( most are n't ) around here . Most of the cops here use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notify you of a impending ticket . There are rare occasions where people recieve laser alerts for the laser scatter bouncing off of cars in front of them but these are exceedingly rare . So to answer your question , no most cops around me do not have their radar guns running when driving around . <h> Re : Whistler XTR-330 Review ? <p> Dude , thank you . That 's exactly what i was looking for . Yeah i 'm in MI and most of them ... so far . Have been using the ka band while driving around but one cop was just pulled over on the side of the road and nothing went off so i was assuming he was using laser and just did n't  pull the trigger on me when i went by .

I live in West Virginia but drive through Virginia to work each day . I purchased this radar detector because of it 's total shield technology , it 's supposed to be undetectable . The other day when I crossed the state line into Virginia , I got off the highway and was driving through a small country town at 35mph which was the speed limit . I drove past a cop sitting at a gas station , he came out with force . His lights came on and I stopped . He asked if I had a radar detector ? I said yes , I live in WV and forgot to turn it off when I crossed the state line . He was very nice since I was honest and asked to see it . He said this is a good one , then he handed it back to me and said try to remember to turn it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscate it . I said you were able to detect my radar detector ? He said yes they just installed Spectre Elite which detects all radar detectors so I suggest you stop using that thing . I quickly said thank you and was on my way . That was a waste of money , now I have a Magnesium paper weight unless I 'm driving through states other than Virginia or D.C. Of course not all squad cars have this equipment but who wants to risk losing such an expensive radar detector . In the last two weeks 3 other squad cars came after me but I was able to turn it off before they got close to me , I was n't speeding any of those times . I looked up the Spectre Elite and sure enough it detects all radar detectors . I thought is was a coincidence that I was being stalked by Virginia cops more now after purchasing and using my STi Driver ( and was n't speeding in any of these situations ) but it 's Spectre Elite . The STi Drivers owners manual says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Radar Detector Detectors .

I do n't think this is possible but if it is , I am thinking about replacing the hood on my Impala with a fiberglass one ... <p> Yes his signature will be less with a non-metalic , then the next question would be what is his cross section . Since radar does depend on the doppler shifting , how much return will he still produce ? He next problem will reside with his radiator , roof , etc etc ..... <p> carbon may help but only nominally , a radar gun can clock a baseball ... good luck getting your signature that low with just a hood . fiberglass does not absorb radar , so it would not help like graphite , though it really does n't  help anyway . <p> Yes , it does have a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood may have something to do with it also . I had a ' 98 TA with the standard aluminum hood , and a Stalker Dual Ka could clock it at 1500 ft. , similar to the range you would get on a Buick Regal . I traded the ' 98 on an ' 01 WS6 , with the fiberglass Ram Air hood , and the Stalker Dual Ka could only clock it at 520 ft ! I was stunned , as was my LEO friend ! He hit me with instant on at 1500 ft. and ................ nothing ! He thought I had beaten the instant-on LOL ! So we redid the test the next day with a different patrol car and a different radar unit , but still a Stalker Dual . Again , the range was only about 520 ft . There was nothing wrong with either of the radars as they could easily clock Suburbans and Jeeps over a mile away . <p> I did a similar test this year with my ' 06 GTO . The clocking range with Stalker Dual was again about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . As an added bonus , I was able to test with a Decatur Genesis Handheld Directional radar that operates on K band . The clocking range with it was 740 ft . Quite a bit longer than with Ka band , but still not too bad ! So yes , there is a significant difference . <p> Also recall the tests that Car and Driver did on radar range and a ' Vette could only be clocked at about 550 ft. with a KR-11 K band radar . It would be interesting to see range tests on other vehicles with fiberglass hoods . <p> When I had my WS6 TA , I was hit with instant on Ka ( Python II at 33.8 GHz ) at about 1500 ft . I was driving about 15 over and got on the brakes immediately , but not real hard . By the time I was within range my speed was close enough to the speed limit ( within 1-2 MPH ) I did n't get pulled over . If he had a successful clock on me at 1500 ft. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ticketed people for 5 over ! <p> Yeah , a radar can clock a baseball , but they are normally using K band , and they are clocked at much closer range , less than 90 feet . <p> Do they make fiberglass hoods for Impalas ? If there is much metal on the front of the Impala , it may negate any advantage a fiberglass hood may provide . There may also be other factors , like how the engine is mounted , assuming some of the radar signal gets through the fiberglass . In Vettes , TAs and GTOs , the engine is mounted front to back , not transversely like in fwd cars .

How much are you willing to spend ? <h> Re : Old Guard Radar Detector Uniden ' Talker ' <p> $100 wont get you much , look into a refurb 'd Escort 8500 for $150 on fleabay . Send a PM to GreenRadar and see if he can get you a discount from RadarBusters ( this forums sponsor ) on a reputable midlevel detector . They are also planning a black Friday sale so be on the lookout for deals in a week .

Many computer and peripheral manufacturers have put in bids to the FCC to get portions of the 700 MHz spectrum . I believe there are already some trunking licenses granted for the band . <p> Just a minor correction . Just because TV is going to be digital does not mean it is going to be HD . DirecTV and Dish Network , for example , are both 100% digital , whether you 're talking HD channels or not . Analog vs. digital in regards to this " digital switchover " have nothing to do with SD vs . HD.

Get another 995 if you are not wanting to spend the money on a V1 . I mention V1 because it has a Euro mode that is tailored for detection of photo radar in the 34.3 GHz range . Some BEL International models are likely to be tuned for the 34.3 GHz range , as opposed to superwide Ka . <p> Almost any superwideband Ka detector will suck on multanovas .

Have you ever scrolled across the bands on an AM radio and heard all the noise between stations , whereas while doing the same on FM its a whole lot quieter ? CB is the same way . <p> The noise on a CB varies over the course of a day and night and even over summer and winter , and the sunspot cycle has a tremendous influence , too . You 'll also notice huge amounts of noise around high-voltage power transmission lines and substations . <p> If you 're having to adjust the squelch every 30 seconds , you are probably just trying to run it too close to the " edge " , that is , trying to filter out the noise but still be able to pick up the faintest actual transmission .

And one of the areas I have problems with is lined with high-voltage lines , so maybe the noise there is just unavoidable . <p> That being said , I know the squelch control is just raising the " floor " of the noise level , so what exactly does a noise " clipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noise Chopper Filter ) do ? I figure it must operate differently than the squelch , otherwise there would be no point in making them ... <h> Re : Antenna noise / " clipper " useful ? <p> From what I have read of it is like a Dynamic Squelch Control on the higher end radios . If I am wrong I am sure I will be corrected . As you try to filter noise you also filter out weak transmissions . So it will get rid of the noise . Your ANL is basically to block out Engine Noise and other feed back generated from your car . <h> Re : CB Noise <p> The AM used by CB will pick up a lot of noise that FM wo n't , which is why FM is used by hams , cops , and any/everyone else . <p> Major sources of CB noise are power lines , which sometimes are not as well set up as they should be . Another racket can be found on channel 23 and bleed over , where diathermy machines are licensed . Go past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 60 over S9 hash that repeats . <p> Keep moving and live with it . Even the state of the art noise limiter and noise blanker in my Icom 7000 ham radio can only do so much with it . The only good thing is that areas with a lot of noise ( cities ) do n't have very useful CB , and areas that are useful ( country , highway ) do n't have lots of noise .

I bought it new in April 2005 and got the Escort ESP plan which added an additional 2 years of warranty to it . <p> I 'm using wife 's 8500 nonX50 which I bought new in Sept 2001 . It was sent in once for repairs in 2006 due to constant alarming after being turned on . <p> Was wondering , other than POP in the X50 , how much difference in performance between the two ? Any test reports you can provide a link to where they compared both ? <p> I understand that the original non-x50 8500s were essentially the x50s , . of the S7 platform , without POP feature , and that the x50 was simply an evolutionary product based , at first , on that very platform . <p> However , I was also under the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help cut-down on falses , as well as have ( debatable ) increases in sensitivity ? <p> I advised a friend that the non-x50 8500 and the x50 , while they should see similar overall performance in terms of detection capability ( per the GOL 2006 data ; both sets ) , that the latter should be less prone to falsing . Similarly , I advised this friend that an asking price of $150 for the non-x50 8500 was too high , and he should not pay that much for one on the secondary market . <p> The x50 did undergo a platform change , which was , of course , not available to the then-defunct 8500 . I believe that this is what Escort 's statement addressed , however , I am not certain that this is complete accurate , as the x50 did start-out on the same S7 platform as the 8500 . <p> I am also uncertain , though , whether the data provided either by testing or by end-user experiences ever proved conclusive in this respect - that the x50 was definitively " better " than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as well as in the threads cited ) that they were pretty much neck-and-neck , and it was always a give-and-take between being better in one and trading-off for another . <p> Similarlyh , for as many threads that say positive , there are also others like this : <p> Although true for that test , look at the January ' 06 test , where again , your own detectors were used . <p> While what you cited regarding K-band holds , it seems that in this test , your x50 also surpasses your non-x50 in terms of overall Ka band performance ( and specifically in terms of 35.5 ) by a not-insignificant margin . <p> But yet , in the August ' 06 test , the results flip-flopped in the manner represented by the test your cited above , and is even more drastic of a difference when it came specifically to 33.5 . <p> This is why I thought that in terms of sensitivity , the two are very , very similar , and that the results are so close , regardless , that it becomes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus SWS ( actual text warning ) availability was a difference between the two , as well as the fact that the latter x50s are on the modern M4 platform , but I also remember reading that the x50 had better filtering .... it is this last issue that I 'd like to confirm . <p> Overall , I do n't think that sensitivity was a clear-cut " win " or " lose " for either model , and that for an average user , through the average course of use , the differences in terms of sensitivity may not be all that important . <p> I understand that the original non-x50 8500s were essentially the x50s , . of the S7 platform , without POP feature , and that the x50 was simply an evolutionary product based , at first , on that very platform . <p> However , I was also under the impression that the x50s also incorporated a bit more filtering to help cut-down on falses , as well as have ( debatable ) increases in sensitivity ? <p> I advised a friend that the non-x50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall performance in terms of detection capability ( per the GOL 2006 data ; both sets ) , that the latter should be less prone to falsing .

But any conclusions regarding additional filtering over the non-X50 's would be subjective at best , unless tested in a lab .

We have prepared this FAQ to help quickly orient you to the basics of evaluating , choosing , installing , and using a laser jammer . This is not an exhaustive encyclopaedia of laser jammer information , and is not intended to be . There is much more for the advanced enthusiast to know about laser jamming , and still much more that we have yet to learn . But for you to get started intelligently choosing , installing , and using the jammer that is right for you and your vehicle , these basics are all you need to know . <p> Special thanks to the following people for their contributions to this FAQ : Guys Of Lidar , jimbonzzz , kpatz , Laser-InterceptorUSA , PMoth , snoopyc4 , speed-dreams , TSi-WRX <p> Yes . A laser detector by itself is useless . Period . Laser works at the speed of light . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , the officer already has your speed . It literally takes less than a second . A laser warning from a radar detector is about as useful as a buzzer that warns you that your airbags are about to deploy . It is no warning at all . Think of it as hearing the gunshot that was just fired at you . By the time you hear it , you 're already dying . <p> There is no passive way to beat laser . You must have a jammer to defeat it . And although some people will claim they were able to out-brake laser , they did n't . They only think they did because they do n't understand how it works . <p> 2 . How does a laser jammer work ? <p> It is a more complicated process than one would imagine . An excellent introduction can be found here . Generally speaking , the jammer must first recognise that it is being shot at . Then it must determine what kind of gun is shooting at it . Then it must fire back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two laser gun models are the same . And all of this must happen at the speed of light . As you can see , it is not simply a matter of shining light back at the laser gun . However , in the past there was one jammer -- The Lidatek LE10 -- that employed " brute force " of high intensity laser optics as part of the equation , which allowed it better success at blinding a laser gun . Guns are more sophisticated these days though , so the " brute force " concept remains a valid adjunct factor , but can not be reasonably relied upon as a sole manner of jamming laser . Consequently , do n't fool yourself thinking that just adding a bunch of lights of any kind to your car is going to protect you . <p> One common misconception is that the laser beam from a police LIDAR gun is a very small , pinpoint beam , as common lasers are . It is not . The beam from police LIDAR , even at a very short distance , is several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ) , the beam width is likely to cover the entire front end of your car . Consequently , simply protecting your licence plates and/or headlights with passive measures alone will not help you . The entire front end must be protected by a competent jammer . <p> 3 . What is the best laser jammer ? <p> Currently , the Laser Interceptor is the undisputed king . If you must have absolute confidence , that 's what you need . No other jammer outperforms it . And many vehicles can not be protected with anything less . <p> There only other quality option in North America is the Blinder X-Treme , which provides excellent protection for most vehicles at a reasonable price . The Escort ZR-4 Shifter may sometimes be adequate for some very small , dark cars , but it is a serious gamble and not recommended . In Europe , the Anti-Laser G9 ( Google it ) is a jammer that performs near the level of the Laser Interceptor . Be very wary of any other jammer on the market , as there are a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for complete , honest , side-by-side comparisons of the laser jammers is the http : //www.guysoflidar.com/ . There , you can see how all the current jammers stack up against each other in formal , controlled testing . While the last test results are now outdated by product improvements , Guys Of Lidar will be updating their tests in the coming months . They are the gold standard for independent laser jammer and radar detector testing . <p> To properly determine your needs , you first have to assess your risk . This is entirely dependent upon the car you drive . The factors that affect your risk include : <p> Size of vehicle bigger target is easier to hit Colour of vehicle lighter colours reflect laser better Shape of vehicle streamlined and wedge shaped cars like Corvettes have less reflective surfaces than others Amount of chrome chrome bumpers , grilles , badges , and trim reflect laser more than paint Front licence plate the most reflective item on the front of a car . Lights Headlights are extremely reflective of laser . The bigger they are , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and driving lights add to that risk . * Mounting Options - Even a small , dark , wedged shape car is difficult to protect if the design of the front end does not allow the jammer heads to be placed optimally . Consequently , you may still need the best jammer possible to get the job done . This includes most BMWs . <p> The more of those factors you have working against you , the more protection you need . But also be aware that , even if you negate each and every one of those factors , you are still vulnerable to laser . We can easily get a speed reading off the back of a jogger wearing a black sweatsuit at half a mile or more , so do n't fool yourself into believing that simply blacking out and Veiling your car will protect you . It will not . There is no passive way to defeat laser . None . Not Veil . Not a Laser Shield . Not a black paint job . They will not " buy you a couple of seconds " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you will post a question to this forum , answering all of the above questions , along with make and model , and posting a full-frontal photo of your car ( not a similar car off of Google , or one parked at an angle ) if possible , the experienced forum members will gladly help you determine what jammers would adequately protect your vehicle . Just be aware that you will spend somewhere between $400 to $700 dollars to protect just the front end of most vehicles . If you have a lot of the above risk factors , that cost could go up to $1200 dollars . Protecting your rear end will double that cost . And looking for the cheapest solution is likely to end up buying you only a false sense of security . Speeding is a pay-to-play game . If you ca n't afford to play for real , then save your money and slow down . <p> 5 . Where should I mount my laser jammer ? <p> This is going to be highly variable , from car to car . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a completely clear and unobstructed view . That means they can not be behind the grille or any other obstructions . Not even a partial obstruction , like a honeycomb grille . NO obstructions . They also should not be so deeply recessed as to be obstructed from the sides or above , because police may target you from overpasses and 45 degree angles . They generally should be as widely spaced as practical so that they are no more than 18 inches from the center of your headlights . If you run a front plate , they should be equidistant between the headlights and the licence plate . <p> On motorcycles , it has been consistently noted that jammer heads provide better coverage when mounted vertically , instead of horizontally . Remember that , on a motorcycle , you have to cover both the bike and the rider , because the helmet is the most vulnerable part of the equation . <p> The most important rule of thumb is this : Stealth the ride , not the install ! That means , concentrate on installing your jammer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are only increasing your chances of failure and getting discovered when they pull you over . You are not the first person from California to buy a jammer and think that he MUST hide the heads behind something to avoid a ticket for having a jammer . We know this . But there is no way around it . If we tell you that you have to put it somewhere , then that is the bottom line . Again , NO ! You can NOT put it behind ANYTHING ! And YES , you may have to cut your grille to mount it . You do not own the one car on Earth that will defy the laws of physics . If you argue with us about it , you will be banned . <p> If you will post a photo of the front end of your car , or a photo of an identical car , in the Advice On Placement forum , we will be happy to point out the ideal mounting location for your vehicle . In that same forum , you can also easily browse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your car . <p> 6 . I do n't need JTG performance , just enough time to slow down , right ? <p> First , it is important to understand that a jammer does not buy you time . It buys you distance . It 's about feet , not seconds . Some feel that any jammer that protects you down to around 500 feet is " good enough " to save you from a ticket because many cops do not engage you below 500 feet , so you have a few seconds to react . But others maintain that nothing but JTG is good enough to be sure of not receiving a ticket with laser . The rationale being that , in reality , most laser encounters take place right around 500 feet to begin with . And it is not the distance at which you are shot that you have to jam to . It is the distance at which you finally get slowed down that you have to jam to ! If you are targeted at 500 feet while travelling at highway speed , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means your jammer better still be protecting you the whole time , or you 're toast . <p> If you 're comfortable with gambling your $400 to $1200 dollar jammer investment by trying to get by with " good enough " , then by all means feel free to do so . But before you try to get by on the cheap with a " good enough " jammer , you should calculate how much the tickets , attorney fees , and insurance rate hikes are going to cost you and decide if you are really saving any money or not . <p> 7 . Do I need to worry about rear laser shots ? <p> Although rear laser shots have not yet become prevalent in many areas of the U.S. , this is an enforcement technique that is quickly catching on , and it is eventually going to be common anyplace that laser is used . California seems to have pioneered the technique , and it has been commonly sighted across the South . In California , Texas , and Florida , it is very definitely a concern . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . But you wo n't know until its too late . And it has been noted that having a jammer greatly increases your chances of being shot from the rear , because the officer had trouble getting you from the front . If you can afford it , it is highly recommended that you get jammer heads for your tail end too . It should be noted that the rear end of most cars is harder to protect than the front end , so again , you will probably not be able to get out on the cheap . That means NO , you ca n't just put one head on the rear . I 've seen that work on a grand total of ONE car , and I doubt that it 's the car you drive . <p> 8 . Do I need to worry about laser at night ? <p> Yes . It is generally less common at night simply because there are generally fewer cops out at night . However , there is no technical reason why LIDAR can not be used at night , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do I need to worry about laser in the rain ? <p> Yes . Although it is not terribly common for police officers to do laser or radar speed enforcement in the rain , simply because they do n't  want to stand in it to write tickets , the newer generation laser guns compensate for rain interference and work just fine in the rain . <p> 10 . Can police shoot laser through their car windows ? <p> Yes . It minimally decreases the maximum range of the laser gun , but not enough to affect it at normal enforcement distances . <p> 11 . Can police shoot laser in their side view mirror ? <p> Yes . Like the glass , it minimally decreases range . And aiming is a little more difficult . With some guns , you ca n't make it work . However , police can accurately get your speed by shooting behind them using a mirror . <p> 12 . Do headlights have any effect on laser guns ? <p> Some people have noticed that their HID headlights actually make it more difficult for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has been tested a few times and shown to sometimes make a difference of up to hundreds of feet . However , others have found no difference whatsoever with their HID lights . The results are not consistent and should not be counted upon when assessing your risk . Without a jammer , no amount of HID headlights , on even the stealthiest car , will help you . <p> Bottom line is , do not expect your HID headlights to make a significant difference in your laser vulnerability just because it did on someone elses car . Every car is different , every set of HIDs is different , and every laser gun is different . Unless you have formally tested your car against real laser guns and determined that your HIDs absolutely , positively , beyond any doubt whatsoever , have a consistently measurable jamming effect on laser , then do not count on it . And even if they do help , they will only help you if you also have a jammer . Alone , they will do nothing for you . <p> Non-HID headlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shown to have any pretictable effect whatsoever on laser speed measurement . However , remember , laser is merely light , so any kind of light can occasionally cause an error message on the officer 's laser gun . But again , do not expect that to make any difference in your getting a ticket . <p> 13 . Can I mount my jammer behind the windshield or window ? <p> Nobody who has attempted to do this has ever made it work . Not behind glass . Not behind plexiglass . Not behind Lexan . Many have tried . All have failed . Glass reduces performance of a head by about 80 percent . A system behind glass simply will not work . The very best that anyone can claim so far is that an extra jammer head -- in addition to your externally mounted system -- behind glass/plastic near a potential weak spot , such as your roofline , might possibly help reinforce that weak spot to some unpredictable degree . But no , you can not place your entire system itself behind any kind of obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam police laser at all . <p> 14 . Can I use two separate jammers on one vehicle ? <p> It is very rare that this is done successfully , and not recommended . What happens is that two separate jammers on the same vehicle , operating simultaneously , will receive signals from each other , causing them to mis-analyse the LIDAR signal , resulting in a jamming sequence that is incorrect for the threat . In other words , the jammers will try to jam each other instead of the LIDAR signal . What we usually see is that two separate jammers operating simultaneously results in absolutely no jamming at all . More is not always better ! <p> There have been some rare cases of installations , where meticulous technical care was taken to assure that the jammer heads were separated well enough that two systems can peacefully co-exist . However , most vehicles do n't have the mounting options to do so . And , of course , there is no real benefit to using two separate systems on one vehicle where it would be advisable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jammers on the same end of the vehicle . Separate systems on the front and back of the vehicle would not result in crosstalk issues . <p> 15 . Can a police officer tell if I am using a laser jammer ? <p> It depends upon the experience of the officer , but yes , it is possible . Some laser guns have circuits which attempt to identify jamming signals , and will display an " error " or " jam " code on the display for the operator when jamming is identified . This works with varying degrees of success , and there are often false alerts to jamming , so officers may or may not even pay attention to them . The Laser Atlanta brand guns are the only ones to consistently and accurately alert to jamming . Also , all laser guns emit an audible tone while firing . That tone varies with the rate at which the light is being reflected , and an officer can tell when it is on target and when it is not by the sound . If he sees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not on target , a technically savvy officer may well understand that means he is being jammed . And , of course , it usually takes less than a second for a laser gun to get speed lock on a car . It can take up to three or four seconds if there is no front licence plate and the car is particularly low profile . But after about three seconds , the officer becomes suspicious of why his gun has not locked , especially if the audible tone does not sound right . Of course , not all officers are that experienced or technically savvy , but many are . Stories abound of officers pulling people over and inspecting their car looking for jammers because of those telltale signs . Beware of that risk . <p> 16 . Are laser jammers legal ? <p> Unlike radar jammers , which are illegal under federal law , and laws in many states , laser jammers are not regulated by federal law , and are specifically outlawed by only the following states and provinces : <p> You should not get too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . First , a lot of cops simply are ignorant of the law . They know that radar jammers are illegal , and will ignorantly attempt to apply that law to laser jammers . Second , other officers may attempt to charge you with " Interfering With A Police Officer " or " Hindering An Investigation " or some other such nonsense criminal charge . Neither one are likely to hold up in court , because the judge knows better . But youve still wasted a lot of time and money fighting it , and possibly even spent a night in jail . So yes , there is a risk to be considered , even in states where they are legal . <p> If jammers are illegal in your state just remember this : So is speeding . Does that stop you from speeding ? <p> 17 . What about the " parking sensor " defence ? <p> Claiming that your laser jammer is only a " parking sensor " can help you to avoid the wrath of the police , should they discover your jammer . The top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where you can actually have your jammer alert to nearby objects , like when pulling into your garage . If you get an officer who does not know better ( most do n't  ) , and you can demonstrate that for him , it may well get you off . Its a big gamble though . He probably pulled you over for jamming him in the first place , so really , the cats already out of the bag . <p> Its worth a shot . But if it does n't  work on the officer , you probably wo n't want to try it in court . They 're going to know better , and if you can not produce documentation proving that it is a parking sensor , and a parking sensor ONLY , then you 're guilty . In states where jamming laser is illegal , doing it with a parking sensor is just as illegal as doing it with a jammer , just like robbing a bank with a fake gun is just as illegal as robbing a bank with a real gun . <p> 18 . What causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Although you will rarely get a false alert on most laser jammers , there are several known sources of those false alerts : <p> Neon and LED lights - including those on autos , like third brake lights on the Chevy Envoy , Avalanche , and Trailblazer HID headlights , usually only off-colour aftermarket HIDs Adaptive cruise control - particularly that on Infinity cars Toll plazas - usually as you are leaving the booth Airports collision avoidance system Sunlight sometimes when driving directly into the sunrise or sunset <p> Sometimes there simply is no apparent reason for a false alert on your laser jammer . The Escort/Cincinnati Microwave ZR3 and ZR4 are the most prone to false alerts , with the Blinder and Laser Interceptors falsing much less frequently . <p> 19 . How do I install my laser jammer ? <p> A laser jammer can be properly installed by anyone with moderate wiring skills . If you can install a car stereo , you can install a jammer . Radar Roy has an instructional video of the process at LONG ... . The difficulty will vary greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mounting the heads where they are perfectly aligned and levelled , and that can be very tricky on some cars , depending upon the configuration of your grille . <p> Other than installing it yourself , you have two options .

Or you can get a professional installation done on your car . To find a professional installer in your area who can be trusted to do a good job , first contact the manufacturers rep for your jammer . If they can not recommend an installer in your area , ask the forum if they know of any . If all else fails , simply locate an auto accessories shop in your area , such as Car Toyz or Circuit City . They can help . <p> Regardless of who you have install your jammer , it is very important that you do not assume they know exactly how to do it . Unfortunately , many install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform a beautiful installation , that looks excellent , but does not work . The most important part of a jammer installation is the positioning of the heads . Custom shops have a tendency to try and make the heads invisible , which hurts their performance . So be very clear with your chosen installer that the heads must be : <p> * perfectly levelled with the road * perfectly aligned forward with no degree of angle or cant * widely spaced , as close to the headlights as practical * not behind the grille or any other obstruction * not recessed into the grille or body * not be obstructed in any way , at any angle , including on the top , bottom , or sides * DO NOT attempt to shorten or lengthen any of the wires or cables <p> To accomplish a proper installation , it will often require that portions of your grille be cut out to accommodate the heads . It 's pretty easy to screw that up . So if you are not comfortable with that kind of detailed work , then by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run in the range of $250 to $500 dollars . Often , forum members get lucky and find a " part time " installer who does very professional installations on the side for a hundred dollars or less . <p> 20 . How do I know if my jammer is working properly ? <p> The only way you will know if it is working properly is to test it against real police laser guns . That means either finding another laser enthusiast who has guns who will test you , or buying one yourself . That 's it . That is the only way . Many forum members own police laser guns , so feel free to ask if anyone in your area can help you out . If you want to buy a laser gun , they are often found on eBay for anywhere from $700 to $2000 dollars . They are available from the manufacturers for anywhere from $2000 to $4000 dollars . <p> Unfortunately , even if you obtain a LIDAR gun for your own testing , it 's not quite that simple . The technique of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently , if you do not know the various methods of shooting used by police officers , as well as the methods used by hobbyists , you can not get a true reading of your jammer 's ability . It is highly recommended that you find a committed hobbyist , who owns his own laser guns and does a lot of testing , to do this testing for you . If you count on the results of just any old guy with a LIDAR gun , you may be setting yourself up for false confidence . <p> You can test your jammer to see if it is firing by purchasing a LONG ... - handheld laser jammer tester . They are sold for $49.99 at RadarBusters.com . Using this device will tell you if your jammer is receiving , alerting , and firing . That is useful for routine maintenance of the system , to make sure nothing has burned out . But it will NOT tell you if it is jamming correctly . Again , the only way to know that is to have an actual police laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control can be used as a " ghetto laser tester " , similar to the device sold by RadarBusters.com . Every remote is different , but by simply aiming the remote control at your jammer heads and pushing buttons , you may eventually find a button that triggers your jammer . Sometimes it works . Sometimes it does not . But again , it does not give you any information except that your jammer is not burned out , and can be triggered . <p> And no , laser pointers or laser aiming devices for guns are not useful for testing your laser jammer . Some of them will rarely set the jammer off , but usually not . And even if it does , again , it tells you nothing about whether it is working properly or not , so that 's not really a useful test . However , for the technically inclined do it yourselfer , there is a tutorial for building your own laser simulator can be found here , LONG ... . Although , I must say that I have never heard from anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method of triggering your jammer , whether it be with a tester , a remote , or with an actual laser gun , you can see if the LEDs or laser diodes in your jammer heads are firing properly by viewing them through an ifrared ( IR ) sensitive camera . Sony video cameras with " NightShot " will view IR light . So will many cellphone cameras . By viewing the heads with such a camera while they are firing , you can actually see the IR light being emitted by the jammer . But again , it can not be overemphasised that even viewing the heads firing does not mean that they are actually capable of jamming police laser . To do that , you MUST be actually shot by a police laser gun while moving . <p> Many people mistakenly believe that running past officers who are shooting laser will let them know if their jammer is working or not . The truth is that this is very rarely the case . You never know for sure what tolerance an officer has . That means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed limit and did n't  get stopped does n't  mean you jammed him . It may mean he was n't stopping people for less than twenty miles over the limit . There are multiple reasons why an officer might not pull you over other than you successfully jamming him . DO NOT DO THIS . It gives you no useful information about your system . It gives the officer reason to stop you , whether he gets your speed or not . And it gets officers thinking about jammers , which we do not want ! It 's a tool , not a toy . Do n't play around with it . <p> For the very same reason , do not ask a police officer to shoot you to check your jammer out . This is dangerous for you and for all jammer users . The more they know about jammers , the easier it becomes for them to defeat us , and the more likely they are to start pushing for laws against jammers .

Also used as the light source in high-end jammers including the Laser Interceptor . See Diode below . <p> CM - Center Mass . The central point of your car , at which most laser shots are taken . When shown in a laser test results page , it indicates the distance at which your jammer protected you to while the gun was shot at the center of your front end . <p> CR8APL8 - ( also Crap Plate ) The Blinder family of laser jammers brand of plastic , replica licence plates . In laser countermeasures , it is used as a replacement for the state issued licence plate on the front of your car , because it is not retroreflective , and therefore presents a much lower laser reflection profile . <p> Crosstalk - The term describing the process that results in failure to jam when two separate laser jammers are used simultaneously on one vehicle . So named because it appears to be the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mistaking them for the LIDAR gun signal , and consequently sending the wrong jamming signal . A prime example of why more is not always better in laser countermeasures . <p> Diode - A Laser Diode ( LD ) , also called a Coherent Laser Emitting Diode ( CLED ) . It is the light source in a LIDAR gun . Also used as the light source in high-end jammers like the Laser Interceptor , although using diodes does not necessarily mean that a jammer is high-end . Note that " diode " itself is not technically the correct term , as there are many types of diodes that are not laser diodes . However , when you see the term " diode " by itself here , referring to a jammer , it is referring to a laser diode . <p> ECM - Electronic Countermeasures . A military term often used in the civilian radar/LIDAR enthusiast community . Any and all electronic devices utilised to actively counter police enforcement technology and tactics . This includes laser jammers , radar detectors , and GPS speed trap and camera locators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Plate who has perfected a shooting technique that often defeats laser jammers . His name will often be used to describe the technique . <p> False / Falses / Falsing - Alerts on your jammer or RD that are the result of anything other than an actual police LIDAR shot . See FAQ for causes . <p> Fritter - The screen name for a respected forum member and enthusiast , who is also a motorcycle police officer . He has perfected some shooting techniques that often defeat laser jammers , so his name is often used to describe such techniques . <p> GOL - respected forum member . The original , independent group of hardcore countermeasure enthusiasts who runs comparison tests on radar detectors and laser jammers blindly purchased from independent dealers . Their website is the definitive source for independent laser jammer and radar detector comparison test results . Members and supporters are identified on the forum with this logo : <p> Goon(s) - The opposite of GOL . A Guys Of Lidar who spam the Internet with fake videos , test results , and testimonials in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrediting others . Although the persons and their product have long ago disappeared , the unfortunate legacy of their disinformation campaign lives on in the anals ( sic ) of the Internet . Video example of their dishonest propaganda : <p> HL - Headlight . When shown in a laser test results page , it indicates the distance at which your jammer protected you to while the gun was shot specifically at your car 's headlight , instead of center mass . An important determiner of jammer performance , since an officer 's shot is likely to hit you anywhere . <p> HP - The High Power version of the Laser Interceptor ( LI ) , which has two laser diodes instead of one . <p> JFG - Jam From Gun . The process and ability of jamming a laser gun shot from behind , all the way from the point of engagement until you are out of range . <p> JTG - Jam To Gun . The process and ability of jamming a laser gun shot from the front , from moment of engagement all the way up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JTFG - Jam To and From Gun . The ability to jam a particular gun completetly , to and from the gun . <p> JTK - Jam To Kill . The process of quickly slowing to PSL after a laser alert , and then turning off your jammer with the kill switch to avoid police suspicion . Always recommended ! <p> Keto - The screen name for small group of guys who talked a lot of smack about how good his set-up was , then chickened out and disappeared without a trace when challenged to show up for a test . To " pull a Keto " is to not back up your claims about your countermeasures . <p> LA - a forum member brand of LIDAR gun . Three versions currently manufactured , each looking different . They 've been around since the early 2000s , but are not terribly common across the country for some reason . Feared for both their deadliness and their ability to tell an officer that he is being jammed . <p> LCC - Laser Cruise Control . An Adaptive Cruise Control system on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seen most often on Infinity cars , and frequently causes false alerts on laser detectors and jammers . <p> LD - Laser Diode , also known as a Coherent Laser Emitting Diode ( CLED ) . The laser light source that emits from LIDAR guns , and powers the high-end jammers , including the Laser Interceptor . <p> LED - Light Emitting Diode . The light source used in many jammers , including the Blinder , ZR3/ZR4 , and Laser Mask . Other jammers may use actual Laser Diodes , which although sound similar , are very different light sources . <p> LIDAR - Light Detection and Ranging . The technical term for laser speed detection . <p> LM - Laser Mask brand of laser jammer . <p> LPP - Laser Pro Park brand of laser jammer . <p> LR-B - The Laser Atlanta LR-B model of LIDAR gun , manufactured by LTI . The most common and newest version of the Ultralyte series , yet still ten years old . Still in manufacture . <p> LS - Laser Star brand of laser jammer . <p> LS - Ultralyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made specifically to reduce laser reflection . When coated with Laser Shield , it is a very effective way of helping your jammer to protect you . Not a stand-alone countermeasure . <p> LTI - Laser Technology , Inc . The manufacturer of the Marksman , Ultralyte , and TruSpeed series of LIDAR guns . <p> Marksman - Laser Veil , the second ever LIDAR gun , introduced in 1993 by LTI , and still in use in many jurisdictions . <p> MOAC - Mother Of All Courses . The winding , hilly test course used by the LTI Marksman that challenges jammer performance to the extreme limits of real world encounters . If a jammer can pass that course , it is one unbeatable set-up . Members of the Georgia Jammers are identified on the forum with this logo : <p> PLII / PL2 - The Pro Laser I LIDAR gun . Second gun sold by Kustom , but was manufactured by Laser Atlanta . Very rarely used by police anymore , but was well know as being hard to jam , so still often used in jammer testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIDAR gun . The newest full sized gun in their arsenal , but still more than a decade old . Most common gun in America , and the easiest to jam . <p> PLCM - Passive Laser Counter Measures . Steps taken to passively interfere with the ability of speed laser to get a reading on your vehicle . Examples are Pro Laser III , the Laser Veil Stealth Coating licence plate cover , car bras , and a dark painted vehicle . Alone , they will not save you from laser , but can do an excellent job of helping protect weak coverage spots for your jammer . <p> Pro-Lite - The Laser Shield and Pro-Lite+ LIDAR guns introduced in 2006 . Unique for it 's binocular styling , as opposed to the traditional handled gun design . Not very popular among police because if it 's unsteadiness and fragility , but often difficult to jam . <p> PSL - Posted Speed Limit . Where you want to be when you kill your jammer . <p> PT - Punch through . The point where LIDAR is able to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . <p> RD - Radar Detector , even though it also detects laser . <p> Riverwabbit - To " pull a Riverwabbit " is to be shot with LIDAR , and then freeze up and forget to kill your jammer once you 've slowed to PSL . It 's a bad thing , but not uncommon since you 're usually caught by surprise and at close distance . Named for the forum member who first admitted to doing it . <p> Scatter - The extremely unlikely and uncommon occurrence of laser light shot at another vehicle making it through that vehicle , or bouncing off of it , to cause your jammer or RD to alert to it , even though you are not the one being targeted . In radar detectors , the phenomenon is almost entirely exclusive to the Valentine 1 . <p> Shifter(s) - The Cincinnati Microwave / Pro-Lite . Although " Shifter " is a proprietary name to Escort jammers , the term is sometimes incorrectly used generically to describe other jammers . <p> SML - Escort ZR series of laser jammers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests of radar detectors and laser jammers for product manufacturers . Although their results are often quoted by manufacturers as a way to promote their products , their methods are suspect and often quite different from what independent testers experience . <p> Stalker - The Speed Measurement Labs brand of LIDAR gun . All versions look very similar . Not terribly common in much of America , but ubiquitous in Texas , and often difficult to jam . <p> Transponder - An alternate term for a laser jammer , preferred by some enthusiasts who want their posts to remain low key on the Internet . Not widely used , but gaining acceptance . <p> TruSpeed - The Stalker LZ-1 model of LIDAR gun , introduced in 2008 , and currently the newest gun on the market . Not particularly hard to jam , but some older model jammers are unable to do so . <p> TS - See TruSpeed . <p> Ultralyte - The LTI LTI TruSpeed series of LIDAR guns , including the Ultralyte , the Ultralyte LR , the Ultralyte LR-B , and the Ultralyte Compact . Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common gun in America , and one of the deadliest . <p> Veil - Ultralyte , the liquid " stealth coating " used to reduce laser reflectivity on your headlights , chrome , licence plate , and other vehicular weak points , giving your jammer a better chance at protecting you . Not a stand-alone protection measure , and only augments the performance of an active jammer . The current version is G4 , introduced in 2008 . <p> VPR - Variable Pulse Rate . The theoretical concept of encoding a LIDAR gun 's laser pulse at a variable rate . This would probably defeat all current manufacture laser jammers , which fire back at a fixed pulse rate to match the specific gun they are jamming . <p> ZR3 / ZR4 - The Cincinnati Microwave / Laser Veil , ZR4 being the current production . Comes standard with the 9500ci radar detector system , or as a stand-alone system . <p> 20/20 - The Escort " Shifter " series of laser jammers , first ever LIDAR gun , introduced in 1991 .

I am in a toss up between the RX 65 and the Vector 955 . I am not sure which would be better for me , other than obviously assuming that the more expensive one might be better . I ask for all the help that everyone is willing to give . Thanks . <p> I have another suggestion as a user of the Turnpike . I use the threat display on my RX 65 , and the turnpike is littered with K drones . However , since the RX 65 can only show one K alert at a time , a cop could easily hide near a drone and the RX 65 would only see one alert . After traveling the turnpike , you will get used to the locations of the drones and know when they alert , and it would be easy to just speed past an alert , as you would assume it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X50 , as it can show more than one K alert at a time and it also has the automute and mute button like the RX 65 . The ramp up on the X 50 is so much better compared to the RX 65 , and is similar in price to the Rx 65 . Be careful on the turnpike , the cops really know how to use instant on K band . Also the X 50 rates slightly better on K band detection over the RX 65 . <p> Ya know i just do n't understand why some of us do n't understand that the V1 is n't for everyone.Yes it is a great detector with great sensitivity and arrows , but not everyone wants a V1.If someone ask which is the better of the two and a V1 was n't in the question , why ca n't we just answer them back with one of their options instead of throwing another detector into the mix.Sometimes people just want a simple answer to the question they posted.If they where interested in a V1 , they would of said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure if I had asked what remote detector I should get , someone would have said , " Get a V1 " . I drive a convertible , so mounting a RD high to hide its ' presence is not possible . I just prefer that the LEO that pulls me over not see a RD on my windshield . Just a preference . I realize that RD 's are legal in Cali , but the slim chance of getting out of a ticket is reduced to none once a RD is spotted . <p> I am probably going to get a 9500i , since I travel a lot for work . The last thing I need when I travel is a RD that goes off all the time . Since I do n't travel to any one place enough to get a feel for all the falses , what I need is a RD that will tell me when I should slow down and not much else . From my research , that does not describe a V1 . From what I read , the 9500i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't even try to tell that to a V1 user .

Can you tell me a bit more about where u put it ? <p> One other thing , does anyone know anything else about the fuse used here ? I was hoping someone might have a copy of some sort of electronic schematic manual for the X50 ( if such a thing exists ? ) . Just wondering if anyone can tell me any other specs for it seeing apparently there 's a lot of other attributes a fuse has besides just the the 2amp rating . <h> PICO Fuse <p> Fuses are rated in both Voltage and Current as well as how fast the fuse will open when in an overcurrent situation . The simple answer to the Smart cord fuse is to use the fuse or a similar fuse that I posted earlier . The Smart cord fuse is almost certainly 125V , 2A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , in the case of the Littlefuse #0251 002 , the current is exceeded by 200% the fuse will open in about 1 second or less . For fix-it yourself-ers , be careful to use a FAST acting fuse and NOT a SLO-BLOW . A Slo-blow fuse can withstand an overcurrent situation for much longer , perhaps long enough to cause irreperable damage to your detector . 125V , 2A Fast acting is what you want to use . <p> Hey , wow thanks insider somehow I missd your original post with the exact info I was looking for . But just one other thing , on the littlefuse site , after finding the part number and clicking on add to cart , there 's about 30 different variations of this particular fuse . They are all referenced eg : 0251002 . MAT1L , 0251002 . MXL . You do n't happen to know the exact one we need do ya ? Thanks heaps !

The 33.8 Ka POP sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cover the complete bandwidth of 34.7 you need to use custom sweep 1 &amp; 2 .

No sweep can start or stop within that range either , so you have to sweep around it . <p> So let 's get started . In order to adjust a sweep you have to put your finger on the button and drag it left or right to adjust the sweeps start and stop points . This can be a little frustrating with the small buttons and fat fingers but stick with it and eventually you 'll get it right . Do n't be surprised that when you save the sweeps that the V1 makes some minor adjustments to your selections ..... this again because of internal calibration points . <p> Sweep #1 - Start point at or just below 34.600 / Stop point at or just below 34.770 ( V1 should adjust to 34.770 so long as you are within a few MHZ under ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or just above 34.774 / Stop point at or just above 34.800 ( again the V1 should adjust the start point to 34.774 if you can only get it within a few MHZ above that number . <p> Sweep #3 - Start point at or just below 35.400 / Stop point at or just above 35.600 . <p> That 's it !

The bottom line is that to gain " sensitivity " , an antenna must " see " a narrower area of reception ( decreasing its ability to detect signals off to sides of a high gain antenna ) . I 'm sure we would NOT want to sacrifice " side " sensitivity of any RD antenna for straight ahead distance - except for straight roadways ( long , straight highways ) .

Beltronics RX65 <p> Since my co-workers car has died I got a chance to play with a V1 over the last few days , so I thought I 'd share my observations . I 'm considering purchasing a V1 the next time I upgrade . My current every day RD is my RX65 . <p> Tested units : V1 with 1.8 firmware ( this is according to V1 's web site , so far as I can tell it 's only missing POP ) . RX65 with 6.3 firmware <p> Mounted both radar units center windshield just below the RVM one at a time . I made an attempt to put them as far apart as possible and leave them both on but , needless to say , I now know what an I/O X-band hit looks like : -D <p> The V1 was set to " A " mode , all bands on . The RX65 is in Highway mode with all bands + POP on and Ka set to USA mode . <p> I tested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this drive because I know where all the false alerts are and FHP are kind enough to have a couple of speed traps that they use on a daily basis . <p> Here 's my real world observations on performance : <p> X band : <p> *Only tested door openers , no X-band here in FL thank goodness ! * <p> V1 is the clear winner here , I never had any doubt that it would n't . It picked up some X-band sources I was previously unaware of . <p> The RX65 is an excellent performer also , on the X-band sources it alerted to it was about 1-2 seconds behind . <p> K band : It 's a draw , the V1 actually stayed silent in some places where my RX65 usually alerts on ( all door openers ) . I was lucky enough to find a local city cop running K-band and the V1 was maybe half a second ahead of the RX65 . <p> Ka band : V1 comes out on top , but only just . I found the RX65 is actually a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly ( maybe 1 second ) better on the V1 . I suspect the newer POP enabled firmware will level things out . Now , where the V1 really shines is the rear detection thank , it kept alerting for a good 3-4 seconds more in those cases . <p> Laser : Not encountered , but I would expect the V1 to win here . <p> Arrows : V1 wins ! I love those arrows , I really hope when the patent expires other RD manufacturers start using them . <p> Interface : RX65 wins , by a wide margin . I absolutely hate the V1 's interface , it 's just unnecessarily complicated . Those arrows are the only redeeming feature really . The bogey counter ? Not really useful , who cares how many cops are there - it only takes one to give me a ticket ! <p> Audio alerts : RX65 wins simply because the volume is louder , I really do n't like having to turn the V1 on full blast for it to be audible over the radio ( and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dodgy ? The alert tones we equally intuitive on both . <p> Mounts : V1 has a better mount , that V1 stayed rock solid and hardly wobbled at all even on rough terrain . It DOES look flimsy in my opinion , but maybe that 's me <p> The RX65 mounting bracket sucks , sorry Beltronics ! I like that it 's made of metal , but it 's way to small and fiddly . <p> Conclusion : I 'd really like to do this test again with a V1 that 's running the very latest firmware . I 'm impressed enough with this V1 that I 'll definitely consider buying one next time around . I 'm very pleased with my trusty RX65 , it cost me $100 less but it 's definitely not performing like it did . I would recommend both RDs to someone in the market , but the V1 edges out the competition in terms of performance ( esp . if you live in an X-band area ) . I wish I had $400 to burn on a new one ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his car as junk so I 've got it for a few more days . I 'll post more observations as I see them . <h> Re : Valentine 1 vs .

Watch my video to see why : <h> Re : Valentine 1 vs . Beltronics RX65 <p> I was taking a short 50 mile trip when I get a KA hit . I slow to the PSL and meet him moments later . He passes me and then I get a few KA from the rear . So I start to get back up to speed when I get a front K hit , so I slow back down . I meet this LEO and he goes on by . So I start back up to speed and get strong KA rear and 5 seconds later get good KA on front . 2 bogey running KA one in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one flips and gets behind me while I am still meeting the 3rd one . I love the arrows and bogey counter . The X50 was my favorite but it does n't  give me that much info . <h> Re : Valentine 1 vs . Beltronics RX65 <p> I had a similar experience with the Bogey counter in Farmers Branch last week . Working late Thursday night it was dark when I left the office . Farmers Branch Webb Chapel Road is just not a road to speed on for 2.6 miles it is known as radar/laser alley for those who travel this stretch . I was painting two KA signals up front for 3/4 of a mile going towards LBJthen the counter went to three . Sure enough one LEO hiding is his familiar spot a few more seconds the other passed me then a half mile up the other LEO passed . V1 painted 3 to the rear the counter then went to 4 in the rear with three dropping off as the distance increased . One rear signal all the way to LBJ Freeway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough the other LEO from the rear came into view as I waited for the light to change . This was the first time for me to experience such a situation , it would have been tough attemting to imagine what was going on with your regular beeping unit with no bogey counter or directional arrows . Unless you have experienced an event such as above it is difficult to convey the incredible operation of the V1 . It may have nothing to do with how many units you are painting ( which I disagree with ) but the relationship in direction with your vehicle where those multiple units exist . The bogey counter was invaluable in this situation . Really liked the video that just jogged my mind for the experience last week . <h> Re : Valentine 1 vs . Beltronics RX65 <p> If the 8500 and rx65 are the same thing . I was messing around with a friend on a very straight highway and we both were doing 30+ psl . He has 8500 and I have a v1 . I picked up 3 ka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of me and picked up the signal about 5 seconds after I did .

No noticeable difference to me . I 'm wondering if this was a Beltronics shill/employee trying to raise the sales of the pro 300 ! I think they may have bit better off axis detection because of the big bubble lens , but that 's it .

I know at high speeds and powers you can risk burning up the LED 's but I figure with a large enough bank you could alternate which LED 's are on and effectively lower their pulse rate . Another thing I am curious about is at what duty cycle is it best to pulse the LEDs . I am guessing something below 50&amp;#37 ; . But lower would improve upon the LEDs power handling . <p> Hey Charlie , <p> First of all , I wanted to say that while I 've been lurking on this board for a while , the only reason I made an account was to discuss this project . I live in Houston , where lasers are predominant and there are no laws against jammers . <p> I 'm an electrical engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and 0 's , baby ! Analog is voodoo science ! ) . <p> Here are a few comments I had : <p> - Where did you get the 4 MHz number from for jamming ? I seems to me that most guns pulse in the 100-400 pps range . I 'd guess that something in the 1000-2000 range would be enough for jamming purposes . In fact , I would guess that the reason most are called " shifters " is because they use the exact number of pulses per second as they detect , but just shift it by the wrong amount . <p> - From a digital point of view ( using an FPGA as a custom DSP ) , I think it would be fairly straightforward to detect an incomming 100-400 pps source . You could even have multiple sensors . Last I checked , a dev board for a low power fpga like this would run $50 . <p> -I havent done a lot of work w/ LEDs . Do you need dedicated driver circuity to operate them ? What amount of intensity do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIY laser jammer ? <p> For brute-force jamming , you might want to look and see how the Lidatek LE-10 works . <p> Detection should be easy enough in the digital domain . I would n't bother trying to do it in analog ; that would be a daunting task . I would use a photodiode with an IR filter in front of it , and design an amplifier circuit that uses feedback in such a way to detect sudden changes in intensity ( such as an op-amp with an inductor in the feedback loop ) . Feed the output of this amp into a comparator and your microprocessor or microcontroller and use software to detect IR pulses that repeat at a steady frequency , and when you see it , there 's your lidar and you can start the jam sequence . <p> With a brute-force jammer , you do n't really have to sweat false avoidance too much . If the sun or an Infiniti sets it off , no big deal , as long as it picks up the laser gun . <p> As for the LEDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 904 nm . It does n't have to be exact , since the lidar guns themselves use photodiodes that respond to a wider range than just 904 . You 'll also want ones with a fast enough rise/fall time to generate clean pulses , and enough power handling to be able to drive them to enough intensity . You can use a MOSFET circuit to provide the needed current to drive the LEDs . If you use a narrow duty cycle pulse , you can drive the LEDs with higher current pulses without overheating them . This will work fine since the gun itself sends very narrow pulses . You could make the LED circuits modular so they can be placed in the grill , headlights , and other places on the car to improve coverage . Maybe include multiple sensors as well for more reliable detection . <h> Re : Anyone tried DIY laser jammer ? <p> why LED 's ? im just wondering about that since laser 905nm laser diodes cost no more than $50 for a class III 5mw one , and if that is n't enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes if u look at it undiffused ) . that is a LOT of POWER , more than 10-15 leds strung together . and since laser wavelength is more close together , something like 890-910 instead of 850-950 for leds , and a lot more concentrated , i think it would benefit you to look into that . also , they have pulsed laser diode drivers for sale too , so u can get a 1khz diode driver or whatever u plan to have . <p> ull of course need some heatsinks to go along with that , some weather sealant , a diffusing lense , but that 's cheap stuff . u can basically build your own LE-10 and get as many heads as you feel is necessary . there 's a forum dedicated to lasers , and i read that someone asked about building a police laser gun jammer there a while back and asked for parts and advice . <p> as for detecting IR , a simple camera with ir filter works fine . u can strip one off the wii controller if u can find a broken one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is what is necessary to jam today 's guns undetected . this kinda setup would probably run u close to the price of a set of M27's. if successful , itll work 10x better , if not , failed experiment then . i hope u live in a state where jammers is n't outlawed yet .

However , since the car was in her name , Simmons was the one to receive the $85 ticket . <p> " There 's no human element to ticket the real violators , " she said . " Due process is not available . " <p> Simmons was among 60 to 70 people who attended Saturday 's debate on the Girard traffic cameras at Cedar 's Cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moderated by Vindicator columnist Bertram de Souza , pitted Canfield lawyer David Betras , who opposes the camera , against Youngstown resident Mike Nagel , who supports the use of the device . <p> Took the challenge <p> Nagel said he logged onto de Souza 's new blog on Vindy.com Stirfry and read some of Betras ' comments pertaining to a speeding ticket the attorney received . On the site , Betras challenged users to debate the camera issue . Nagel accepted and conducted research on the effectiveness of traffic cameras , he said . <p> Betras kicked off the 11/2-hour debate by citing several examples of what he said was Girard 's rationale for using the device and why those justifications were wrong . <p> Betras said that the city uses its home rule charter to validate exercising certain police powers and that the camera benefits the " health and safety of its citizens . " <p> Nevertheless , he pointed out , two state laws give the Ohio Supreme Court the power to create traffic rules to be followed in all jurisdictions . <p> Rules relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil matters , thus " decriminalizing " repeat violations , Betras added . As a result , chronic speeders face only flat fines and have no fear of court action , he said . <p> Ca n't contest fine <p> The setup also deprives people of the opportunity to contest the fine , he said , adding that drivers ' right to face their accuser and " cross-examine " him is stripped . <p> " It 's another way they 're eroding your rights ; they 're taking away your right to go to court , " said Betras , whose class-action lawsuit against the city is pending in the 11th District Court of Appeals . " How do you argue with a camera ? " <p> Betras contended that in addition to violating due process , the driving force behind the cameras is money . <p> " These cameras are a bad idea ... and on a bigger scale , it 's just Big Brother , " he said . <p> Not true , countered Nagel , who owns Just Sons Asphalt of New Middletown . Nagel said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about 15,000 deaths , are caused by speeding , costing the nation about $30 billion annually . <p> Nagel said he agrees that points should be added to speeders ' licenses , but added that drivers should be responsible for whom they allow to use their vehicles . <p> The number of tickets being issued in Girard since the cameras were installed in July has been decreasing , which shows the program is working , he said . <p> Nagel added that he sees nothing wrong with the devices ' generating revenue for the city . Traffic cameras have been successfully used to deter reckless driving and accidents in other U.S. cities , and lawsuits like the one Betras filed have been overturned in several states , he noted . <p> Mayor 's input <p> Girard Mayor James Melfi defended the cameras , saying that it was city council 's idea to implement the ordinance after receiving community input . The devices have made his city safer because they allow more police officers to fight crime in various neighborhoods , conduct investigations and be used in schools , Melfi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role was to set the camera . Motorists have to go at least 15 mph over the speed limit to be issued a ticket , Melfi added . <p> During a question-and-answer session , Betras said that properly adjudicating cases is the real issue . The way the cameras are set up requires drivers to prove their innocence instead of the other way around , he said . <p> Girard gets $60 for every $85 citation issued ; Traffipax , the Columbia , Md. -based company that installed and operates the devices , receives the remaining $25 . <p> However , on Friday , Judge John Stuard of Trumbull County Common Pleas Court ordered that fines collected from the date of his ruling be placed into an interest-bearing escrow account until the issues surrounding the legality of the camera have been settled . Judge Stuard made the ruling during a hearing on a lawsuit filed by Councilman Daniel Moadus to stop the camera 's use . Girard is free to do as it wishes with money generated before his order , the judge said .

Anyway , I 've come into the light , and about to make a purchase , and have pretty much decided on the RX65 . <p> I can get the Refurb Red 65 on Ebay from Escort with the S7 horn or the Blue brand new from another site ( I 'm assuming wih the M4 horn ) for the exact same price ( last day of offer I believe is today ) . <p> I 've been reading all I can find about S7 vs M4 and know there 's a lot of controversy , but there 's one thig that I 'm confused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off axis differences , which has many folks singing the S7 's praises , however given the controversy and my NOOBness with relative happiness with a Cobra , I 'm sure the M4 will suite me just fine as far as those issues go . Plus , superficially , I would prefer the blue for asthetic reasons . <p> The one thing I have n't been able to figure out is if the response time to IO/QT is different between the horns , or is it a difference between the RX65 and the X50 ? I can stomach a difference in time of notification of a second or two from range differences , but I really ca n't stomach the thought of the RD never even making a peep if the LEO is just quick enough on the trigger . If I 'm recalling correctly ( have done a lot of reading and may be misremembering due to info overload ) the testing and videos comparing the response times were between an S7 Rx65 and an M4 X50 . Not sure if the improvement in response time when enabling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn or the differece in RD 's themselves . <p> So basically what I 'm wondering is , can I buy my eye pleasing Blue RX65 and still get the response time benefit of USA mode , because if not , I 'll get the Refurb red , because at least for me , in that consideration , form definitely follows function . Thanks in advance ! <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb S7 RX65 <p> As far as I know if you have I/O in your area S7 or M4 will suit you just fine as long as its a RX65 . <p> Now with that being said ... any other belscort has a hard time picking up I/O quicker than i 'd say a second or so . As long as your using the USA mode you 'll catch I/O . I 'm not saying its fool proof , but for the most part . <p> M4 has better range and better reliability from calibration error S7 has better off axis <p> You be the judge ... I would n't go with anything other than a RX65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that blue RX-65 is being sold through a belscort authorized vendor otherwise there may be no warranty . <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb S7 RX65 <p> Thanks for the info . <p> Ca n't afford a V1 or STI , so after my reading , that 's why I settled on the RX65 . My general impression is that below 200 , go with a vector , midrange 200-250 depending on refurb/sale the x50 &amp; rx65 are the options , and then there 's a big price jump to the next level at 400+ for a V1 , STI , 9500 . Seems like the 300 level is a little ignored , but that 's a different discussion . <p> The blue rx I 'm looking at is from a seller that 's not on bels non-authorized list , so by exclusion , I 'm assuming they 're authorized . Big e-tailer , rhymes with Blue Peg . ; - ) Sorry , know there are rules I do n't want to break about discussing sellers and price . <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an M4 and it does have USA mode . There is definately a BIG difference in Ka sensitivity with USA mode on . I have gotten lots of IO saves " <p> However nineC1 ( who in another thread has a nice series of videos demonstrating the IO capabilities of an S7 RX65 ) states that " Never had an RX65(M4) on the bench and other members have indicated that their RX65 's with the M4 antenna still suck vs quick triggers . " <p> Sorry , know this subject has been debated ad naseum before , and there may not be an answer out there due to lack of dedicated head to head testing , was just hoping someone might have some good solid evidence on the IO capability of an M4RX65 in USA mode . <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb S7 RX65 <p> My friend tried to buy a cheap RX65 from Frys Electronics ( unauthorized refurb ) and hey guess what ... dead on all bands . Unit powered up and everything but since it 's unauthorized , no repairs authorized from Beltronics unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy one direct from Beltronics . <p> As for the M4 vs S7 , the M4 is still reaaaally good at picking up instant on KA compared to other M4 's . Only other thing I can think of getting the M4 over the S7 is if your area uses traffic radar monitoring , the S7 can not be upgraded with Traffic Signal Rejection ( aka TSR ) while the M4 can ( RX65 Revision 6.5 ) <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb S7 RX65 <p> You know that you will get one heck of a detector if you get the S7 RX65 . If the V 1 is out of your budget , this is the detector that I would recommend . I would not buy the M4 on the hope that it is as good as the S7 . If you need TSR in your area , you will not have a choice . If you buy the S7 , Buy a factory referb unit . Good luck . <h> Re : RX65 Blue vs Refurb S7 RX65 <p> I 'm a big fan of the S7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart is set on a Blue display then I think the RX65(M4) might delight you as well . <p> The S7 has an inherent advantage on K-Band response but appears to be no better than the M4 in stock settings against Ka .

The most convenient ( or the version I 'm on ) is patching the RD audio in with my MP3 player , the voice alert comes through quite well over the music . Also for motorcycle use , the V995 is shorter in length than the X50 ... for the way I mount the RD in a very cramped dashboard under the windscreen , that extra 5/8 " of an inch blocks part of the tach that I want to see .

I have found that most products with a ' soft power button ' will not power up when you simply apply voltage . They default to a standby state . However , with the 995 , I found that by unplugging and replugging the cigarette lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same volume . One of my cars has a constantly- powered cigarette lighter outlet , so I either have to turn off the detector or unplug it when I park ( or modify the lighter outlet to switch off when the car is not running , but I never got around to it ) . <p> I think the KA alert noise should be more aggressive . In most detectors , X is a beep , K is a bleep , and KA is a BRAAP . KA is generally the biggest threat . On the 995 , the KA is a softer , more ' pleasant ' sound . It 's a minor complaint and one could get accustomed to it quickly , but it struck me as odd . <h> Re : Is the 995 the same as an 8500 x50 ? <p> Originally Posted by niran916 <p> Well , I just picked up a V995 at " the shack " today for $79 bucks just in case anyone is looking for one . <p> Thanks so much for posting this .

Otherwise , go with what the others said and try talking with Escort . <p> Thanks for the replies ! I have literally tried every sequence I can think of to start the unit up , but no dice . I think I will contact Escort personally on Monday .

So it 's possible that FOCH somehow relates to that . The packaging does look somewhat different that what I remember . I believe our first product packaging box was a flimsy thin sheet cardboard and we did n't  have styrofoam inserts for the package . That box looks like corrugated cardboard with a proper packaging insert . <p> So If I were to hazard a guess , that LE-10 was probably manufactured at a later date . FOCH could also be a distributor for the LE-10 . If you zoom into the pic you can see the 1st red circle Quality Assurance badge says " Major FOCH advantage : ( In GaAs Diode ) iridium gallium arsenide laser diode " . It seems to be touting the special hardware used in FOCH jammers . So i 'm guessing it 's a company logo .

The TSs and many LTI guns have this as well . Hold the gun right in front of a tree and shoot and it wont disregard THAT obstruction . <p> To answer your question , it means that it 's getting more difficult on CMs each passing day . <p> Here 's the thing with shooting lasers in this way and it 's an important one to be aware of . They are going to tend to be more off-axis ( at greater angles ) than what you see in closed course testing or with shots directly from the median or shoulder--which would be more straight-on ( which makes it easier for any jammer ) . <p> With off-axis shots and possible through obstructions it 's simply going to make it ( much ) harder on jammers to either alert or effectively jam . This goes for overpass shots as well which also take place at off-axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like radar , indicated speeds will drop , but not significantly so . <p> The Stalker XLR , in particular , as well as the Dragon guns are very effective at handling difficult obstruction scenarios . <p> There are also other factors that will effect jamming effectiveness that simply have n't been tested ( or published , at least ) . Perhaps these real-world scenarios will be tested and the full results published to really give the owners of jammers a better look at how things actually perform in the real-world . <p> The interesting thing as it relates to passive CMs like Veil or Ontrack 's Lasershield , these countermeasures tend to perform better in these scenarios which is why I believe a defense-in-depth approach is the best overall approach to maximizing your odds at defeating police laser in the greatest number of varied targeting scenarios . <p> Last edited by Veil Guy ; 03-02-2016 at 03:16 PM. 135533 @qwx755533 <h> Re : Latest stalker lidar 135536 @qwx755536 <p> There are also other factors that will effect jamming effectiveness that simply have n't been tested ( or published , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested and the full results published to really give the owners of jammers a better look at how things actually perform in the real-world . <p> Thank you for being honest . <p> I have come to take all this " testing " by various groups with a grain of salt .

In fact one member , just recently , was positioning himself to become a " distributor " for one them , while I understand during that time he was sharing some privileged information from another competing jammer company to that vendor . <p> At the laser jamming portion of the Arizona test last year , certain results that were less than flattering were completely removed from publication ( as was properly stated in Roy 's article about it ) and one DragonEye gun that was tearing up the jammers was put back down on the table not to be used any longer for those " tests . " <p> When one individuals who observed this asked why , the " tester " stated " we want the jammers look good .

But the laser portion of the AZ test last year turned more into a product development and manufacturer testing event than testing for the consumer . As it turned out , one manufacturer made a surprise appearance without any advanced notice and the testing group allowed the test to essentially become co-opted by them for the purposes of product development . This was entirely inappropriate and unfair to other mfrs including Blinder and Escort . <p> They 're a lot of hidden agendas and the results do give a false sense of security to users of jammers . I have also read that recommended setups should be comprised of five head systems ! Good for the manufacturers , not so good for the consumer that has to spend multi-thousands of dollars to get them and have them professionally installed . To be clear , I am not personally against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right circumstances . I personally drive with a Blinder and an Escort shifter ( along with Veil of course ) , a great radar detector , and Waze and have yet to have that setup fail me . <p> Since I mentioned Waze , I am heavily recommending that everyone use this smartphone app in conjunction with a good radar detector . Waze is absolutely free to use and I am finding alerts to the majority of potential traffic enforcement encounters on the highway which is especially important as many of these encounters LEO 's are not actively using radar or laser at any given moment , but it 's important to still know they are ahead waiting for you . <p> Last edited by Veil Guy ; 03-12-2016 at 05:58 AM. 135533 @qwx755533

Followed the suggestions of people on here and went with the Little Wilson 36 " whip . I had no idea what to expect from this thing . The antenna was $39.99 and the radio was $32.99 . I literally threw the Wil up on the center of the PT Cruiser , shut the door on the wire , screwed thing into the front of the CB , turned it on , and tuned to channel 19 . <p> I used it probably a handful of times before I left this past Saturday , Sept. 27 . I could hear truckers talking to each other and that was cool , but nothing like AirMoore said , about bears being called out dozens of miles ahead of time . I knew I could get stuff like that , because I was getting about 5-7 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't  really seem optimal in CB worlds. ) , but they just did n't  seem to be calling them out at all . <p> ( We left from Flint , MI and traveling to English , IN on Saturday , and there was really nothing to comment on . The needle never dropped below 85 . ) <p> Then came D-day , Sunday , Sept. 28 , a day that will go down in history . <p> ( Food for thought : look at the dates , this is quota timeand I knew it ) . Left about 8am EST from English ( fun tid-bits about this at the end ) , and got into Louisville , KY probably about 9:30-10:00am . Let me tell you guys , it was a massacre . Massacre is a HUGE understatement . There is not a word in any language that I know that even remotely conveys amount of traffic enforcement that took place in the course of about 25-30 miles . The CB was like a group of 9th grade girls at a sleepover , it NEVER ONCE stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupting other truckers bear reports to report more . It was getting hard to follow . There were bears in plain white wrappers , plain brown wrappers , with customers , without customers , left shoulder , right shoulder , median , blacked out Chargers , traveling with traffic at the 160 , etc , for 25+ miles . It was ridiculous , to say the least . <p> The coolest thing I saw in a while was . <p> I was using this Metro Police car as a rabbit , clearing the way , for about 5 miles before he exited . While after following him for a few miles ( doing about 80-85 ) , he turned on this RADAR gun , Ka . Well , I let off the gas and was cruising at about 70 in the left hand lane still following him , with him pulling away . The Ka bogey is getting stronger ever so slowly . Well , he gets about 15 car lengths in front of me , and I lose him behind a curve . Doing my 70 , I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Charger sitting in the left shoulder , COMPLETELY hidden by the curve and concrete barrier , running a full blown CO rear antenna . I swear I did n't  see him until I was about 2 car lengths off his back bumper . In the end , he did n't  give me a second look as I strolled by him at 70 ( in a 60 ? ) . <p> When we finally got through the heart of it , south of the city , on the other side ( northbound travel ) , over the course of at MAX a half a mile , 4 CVs with customers , at the same time , all with the blues on , and you know whatnot a single solitary sticker , antenna , or light on the outside of any of them . ( I had already known about this bunch for a while because of the CB , but I did n't  know what direction nor MM . ) <p> After a bunch of time , and about half a dozen bears later , we make it into TN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doing my 85 , at MM 182 , I get a bear report of a pair of marked LEO SUVs sitting at the top of hit at MM 171 . I nearly peed myself with excitement . About 4-5 minutes later , I confirmed the 2 SUVs sitting at the top of the hill . Let me tell you , there is NOTHING like being at MM 172.1 , lifting your foot off of the gas , and coasting to PSL , only to pass 2 LEOs sitting at the top of the next hill . <p> That was pretty much it as there was not a single LEO in AR , and in TX we switched cars , and I had to leave the CB in the PT <p> I have become a true believer of the CB and would like to thank my master , AirMoore , and grand-master , Volvo , for all of the information on here . <p> Let me tell you that the video of Volvo ( AirMoore ? ) running into the NYSP on the Thruway ( the one with the swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning he says something like " I just got a report of a bear at MM xx , which is coming up " , well , its completely true , and it does really happen like that . <p> LONG ... Along I-64 East there is a 14 mile long single lane , construction zone where its 55mph . I was doing 55 , keeping with traffic and about half way in I get a bear report at MM xxx , facing eastbound . I did n't  know where that MM was so I just kept it in the back of my mind . This was my first authentic bear report , and I was thrilled to see what it was . Well sure enough , right at the end of the construction zone , there was a state trooper running some RADAR . The V1 started chirping about 1 minute from him , but I had already known about him for about 8 minutes , and sure enough the MM matched . <p> 2 . My first conversation with the CB took place on I-64 east . About 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucker , I get a call on the CB " PT , you got it on ? " . " PT , with Texas plates , you got it on ? " As I scramble for the mic , I thought I was going to get reamed out about this and that , and being a speeding 4-wheeler , milking the truckers , yada , yada , yada . Nope . He just wanted to know what it was like in TX after Ike . I said I did n't  know , as I was in MI for the last 3 months . His uncle said it was bad , and gas prices were high . I also thanked him and everybody else for the bear at the end of the construction zone . <p> It was a nice little conversation . My fiancT made fun of me for talking , and at the end was like " A friend made , friend lost . " , but that 's sort of the nature of CBing . Why not be friendly , you 're not going to know them for long ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was nervous because I had n't  had my CB tuned .

His radar was off , but I saw him up ahead so I slowed down to the speed limit .

He pulled me over and asked for the radar detector , saying that he 'd seen it on my windshield as I passed him at 70 mph ( not sure if he saw it or his spectre saw it or both ) I flatly denied having it and stuck to my story .

Wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing to answer , and what grounds he would have had to have searched my car without a warrant . The lawyer I met with seemed pretty interested in this as well , and did some research for me .

Also , even though possession of a radar detector is technically a traffic crime ( less than a misdemeanor ) , " for purposes of arrest , traffic infractions shall be treated as misdemeanors " and " the authority and duties of arresting officers shall be the same for traffic infractions as for misdemeanors.

If he 'd found one , I could have been charged with obstruction of justice , interfering with a police officer , etc ( not sure if those charges would stick though considering it is just a traffic offense and not deemed " criminal in nature " ) .

However , Code 46.2-937 provides that " for purposes of arrest , traffic infractions shall be treated as misdemeanors " and " the authority and duties of arresting officers shall be the same for traffic infractions as for misdemeanors .

" <h> Re : Radar Detectors in Virginia - can your vehicle be searched ? <h> Re : Radar Detectors in Virginia - can your vehicle be searched ? <p> Sad state things have evolved to . Prior to the Bush Court the rule on search and seizures for cars was defined in the Chimel case from the Berger Court . That said an officer could search within the grab area of a suspect - obviously for weapons . The Bush , as in Roberts , Scalia , Thomas and Reinquist , expanded the reach area to include any place in the car , even a locked trunk . Still , even though possession of a detector in VA is illegal it would seem to me an officer would have to actually catch you in possession of one and not be entitled to go on a searching/fishing expedition to go through your car to find one . Just because he thought he saw one ordinarily wouldn't/should n't be enough .

What I would like to ask is how the new mount from Beltronics work ? I 'm in a hurry to find a good way to install my Beltronics detector but do n't know about the mounts . I am talking about Platform Mount with Disc Pad . Beltronics ' site states that it has adhesive which holds it on the dash , and another adhesive to secure the radar detector . <p> Is it possible to remove the detector from the mount and the mount from the dash , or will I have to keep everything attached at all times ? <h> Re : Platform Mount with Disc Pad from Bel <p> Your RD will stay attached to the mount , but you can take the mount off the dash .

The cup will stick to the windshield and the two sided tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <h> Re : Platform Mount with Disc Pad from Bel <p> Velcro should work . I 'd use something to remove silicone from armarol type products like naptha ( lighter fluid ) wipe on and wipe off with a clean paper towel then attach . The sun will work on any adhesive backed product when the vehicle warms up from the sun . Using stips of velcro allow some air movement will most likely yeild better results .

I would check its performance against known false alert locations and be wary of its Ka band performance until after you have a decent Ka band encounter to assure yourself that it is detecting Ka band just fine . <p> Circuit City carries the LowePro Ridge 30 camera case which just happens to fit the Bel Vectors and the RX65 absolutely perfectly . That way the RD is protected from scratches and heat when you toss it in your glove box or put it under a car seat . I use similar cases for all of my RDs.

I personally am waiting for the Blinders as I have n't really come across the need for the ALPs . Your situation sounds different , though . Just keep in mind , as I am sure you already know , that jammers and detectors are outlawed in ON , so please be careful . I believe the fines are a least $400 for being caught with one . At least they were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response . I have the ALP 's added to my vehicle and shot them with my Kustom 2 Pro laser and my laser Atlanta ( both Stealth , and regular modes ) All three tests was jam to gun with 2 heads on a pickup . No bad at all . Love the upgrade able software that is a nice touch . <p> Not sure if you remember we met once about 5 years ago in Niagara Falls in a jammer test . And a few years later I think we met a the Sema show in Vegas . Thanks again for the feedback . <p> Dave <p> It was actually here in Buffalo where you guys met , at my first meet . <p> It 's great to see you back , dcdave . It 's been FAR too long ! The ALP will serve you well . It has been recommended by the US distributor that for complete protection against VPR guns , and ESPECIALLY the DALA/DE guns , a 3rd head should be added . If you recall , I used to own an M47 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . With the proliferation of DALA/DE in Ontario ( ask wolfpacal ) , I then upgraded to the ALP Dual in 2014 . I was pretty much JTG against all guns with my Taurus except the aforementioned . I now own a Jeep , and added a 3rd head to my ALP system for complete frontal protection . However , the only way to know is to test ! <p> I have heard the 3rd head alot more . It makes sense that the extra head can help with the VPR 's . I think that and rear protection are going to become pretty standard as more LEO 's are doing rear enforcement in North America .

Not everyone knows that back in the 70 's when Cobra made a name for themselves for their Cobra 29 Classic that UNIDEN WAS MAKING THE ELECTRONICS FOR THOSE RADIOS ! - The new Cobra 29 Classics are not the same quality inside as they were decades ago , however my CB radio guy advised me the new Uniden 78 series is as exact as any new cb radio can be to the old Cobra 29 classic . All of the mods and toy circuits work the same way . So I bought my Uniden 78ltx in 2002 , it survived a bad wreck in which I flipped my 4x4 about 6 times , yet it still kicks ass on the wattage meter . <p> In these mountains of eastern Kentucky it is very difficult to be able to talk back to most of the drivers one can hear on a " barefoot " ( stock 4 watt ) radio . Most drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc ... and the real serious ones have the big boxes , often with an output of 100 watts is common here . ( not legal ! ! ) <p> The leos here do n't even recognize a big radio that has been super-tuned , so they never say anything , but if they spot a big amp box they have been known to get on to the drivers , but I do n't  think they have the authority to act on behalf of the FCC , can they ? <p> To Da Point : After I lost my favorite pickup truck in a wreck , i used my insurance money to outright buy out a new 2009 Chevy Cobalt LS Coupe XFE- great price , great mileage at 37 highway , and real fun to drive . Little by little I got things in order . I ordered a brand new Wilson 5000 Mag Mount Antenna , which I believe is the best quality in the business , mainly due to the whip being made of copper and coated with silver- great conductors make great antennas . <p> Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to best fit my large CB into such a small sub-compact car . I figured in seeing that the faceplate was looking old and scratchy anyway , that the best and safest spot was to mount in below the dash underneath the steering wheel . I sawed off a piece of wood to reinforce the plastic and used 2 inch machine screws and washers with ridges that caught on solid . The mount worked perfectly . <p> Next I routed all wires , hid them , got them tucked out of the way . So I get my SWR under a 1.0 and figured it was close enough for a radio check . Next I plugged in my brand new $70 " Telex Turner Road King 56 Chrome Special Edition Mic " ! ! It 's supposed to be chrome , but was plastic when I received it ( a shame ) . But , I figured it had to be better than my stock Uniden mic that was getting some static . I get on the interstate and drive many miles asking for radio checks . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! My $70 mic SUCKED BAD ! ! ! Everyone could hear my dead-key , but my modulation was nowhere , even with the gain turned all the way up ! ! It was useless , this mic was very very bad when fitted to my CB . I put the stock Uniden mic back on and all radio checks were pretty good , but not perfect . Some heard some static , and others said my modulation still needed improvement . <p> So , here I am with one cb mic with a great looking case that sucks and ca n't be returned , and another old stock mic that has an ugly dirty case that works good but has static and modulation issues . <p> So I did the obvious . I got out my large toolbox of electronic tools- For circuit boards and SMT parts ) . I decided I would take the best of both mics and combine them into one good mic ! ! <p> I first dissemble both mics . To my shock neither mic had any form of shielding . No wonder my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ! I first refitting the cable end that screws to the CB radio , as this was the stress point on the wires I figured was causing my static . I unscrewed the tiny screws , tucked the wire up in the plug much tighter , then placed a few wraps of black tape around it and on up the cord a few inches . Next I tighten the screws back , but not too tight to break the tiny wires . Next I take ONLY the new " CHROME " mic case to mount all of the Uniden mic parts inside . I noticed the Uniden had some thin sponge rubber over it 's raw mic , and it 's original case had 3 or 4 thin slots cut into the case where one talks at . No wonder the modulation was poor , there was not enough surface space between the case and the mic element ! ! <p> Next I had to search very hard at Walmart for the perfect glue . I needed something stronger than crazy glue that would bond parts together like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold temps . Finally I found the perfect glue- It was made by LockTite and was for Extreme Temps ! Cost $5.00 . <p> At home I cemented the Uniden Mic element with only the thin sponge rubber piece on to the SCREEN of the chrome case- thus raising the surface area to talk at by a large margin , and should prevent any muffling as in the past as well ! <p> Now came the hard part : I had to take the mic button and cement in on to the back of the magnet of the uniden mic element I just glued to the inside of the chrome mic case . It was tricky but I found the perfect angle and used as much glue as I thought I needed . This would be a high stress location due to the fact the button would have pressure applied to it every time keyed up . I used a small C-Clamp to hold these parts together for almost 24 hours . <p> After 22 hours or so I took the C clamp off and was very happy to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid weld ! ! I next had to cut a piece of plastic to make the chrome button extend just the right distance so when pressed it would operate correctly and pop back out when not pressed . Again I had to glue it and wait . <p> Finally , I got some tin foil and cut it to fit the inside of the two parts to the chrome case . I also taped over any wires to prevent shorting to the case shield . The bare ground wire was so large that I just sealed the case up with the ground wire touching the tin foil perfectly . All screws were tighten , and the button seemed to work fine . So far so good . I plugged the mic into the cb and my meter showed it was functioning . <p> Now all I needed was some radio checks . My first radio check was from my car sitting in my driveway . First try I got back a loud signal from a driver that advised me the mic/signal sounded loud and clear with no static and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the interstate because I was located down in a deep Vally many miles away from the interstate way over top a large mountain ! <p> I tested the mic for nearly three days and every single report was more than positive . I am now getting the best radio checks that I have ever got . People tell me I 'm blowing smoke , burning them up , ten pounds , and I often can be heard further than I can hear the barefoot radios . So far I 'm sure I have talked back and forth for 15 miles through some mighty large mountains , and after dark I 'm sure it 's farther away but I need other CB users to have enough power to yell back at me , as that has now become a problem . <p> The guy that worked on my supertune told me that the stock Uniden 78 Mics were some of the best and clearest he had ever used . So when I managed to increase the surface area by allowing one to talk straight through a black screen and thin sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mic element and my face . It improved the modulation at least 100% based on radio checks , and I 'm now able to be heard many miles further than I ever have been advised before I re-made my microphone . It rules . <p> For those Uniden CB Users , Or anyone that would like to copy-cat my design : - They happen to sell what appears to be the exact same chrome-plastic cb case at popular truck stops and online . If you have a stock Uniden 78 mic it will greatly improve your modulation and clarity , not to mention you range , by doing what I did . Just buy the chrome case PARTS instead of wasting the $70 on the Turner mic like I did . All one would really need is the stock Uniden mic , the plastic chrome case sold at many truck stops , and the Extreme temperature LockTite glue/cement sold in the automotive section at Walmart , and a small C clamp , and tin foil . These mics should of been shielded all along , and I do feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps these mics sound better , stops interference with radar detectors , cell phones and more . With the increased surface area of the mic exposed to your talking through a screen and foam rubber , rather than the small slots Uniden has on their cases ( see Uniden mic pic below ) - Unidens method of small slots in their mic cases makes it more likely to muffle your voice and get poor modulation . <p> BELOW is what the STOCK Uniden 78 series mics look like . It is the best stock mic I ever used , yet is GREATLY improved when one takes the guts out and installs it into the cases above ! ( Just need the LockTite Extreme Temp Glue and C-clamp , plus tin foil to make shield ) : Sold at most truck stops , or here is one of very many places to find this mic that I used for the " guts " to stuff into the above chrome plastic case . Cost is $20.00 to $30.00 . Uniden MK516 Replacement CB mic for Uniden PC68XL and PC78XL <h> Re : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great job ! I love tinkerer stories like this . And this is exactly what I have been thinking of doing myself . The thirty year-old stock mic on my Motorola CB is wore out and lame , and I want to upgrade to a good power mic . But I do n't like the look of most CB mics , because the Motorola is such a professional looking radio . So I want to have my CB guy take a new Motorola professional mic I have , gut it , and install the guts of a nice power mic into it for me , just like you did .

The Valor is really really good in UHF . Again , depends what you are looking for . If you are interested in CB and low band , check out Wilson . You will have to get an adapter however , post back here before you purchase an antenna and I can direct you to what connectors you might also need . <p> You can " search " and find the frequencies yourself , but there are too many . It would take a long time to find , and figure out what they are . <p> It 's much better to enter a list of frequencies which you know what they belong to , then " scan " . <p> 160 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanner antenna " that starts under 100 and covers up to about 1000 . I think the Valor PMM3B in this case would n't be a very good option even though it supports as low as 100Mhz . It 's more suited for 400-800Mhz operation . <p> The lower the frequency , the taller the antenna you will need . I would expect something to be around 20 inches . You should check for something in the range of 50-1000Mhz . <p> The key is : The MAIN frequencies that you listen to should be in the MIDDLE of the antenna 's range for the best performance . <p> I used to have a pro-38. 29-512 mhz . Do a web search for your local city police frequencies . Most police dept have gone to 800mhz bands . I had it hooked up to a discone antenna on a 40ft. tower . Still have the tower but not the scanner anymore . I got good reception on it .

I 've been driving with it on just out of curiosity . <p> Friday , I was driving on my daily commute in an area where there is a KA threat . It 's a two lane road with residential houses in the area . I 've never had a POP alert before this time . <p> So , I 'm driving along in traffic below the PSL and all of a sudden the detector goes CRAZY , I thought for sure it was KA hit , but then it says POP ALERT .

There 's proof of this even locally where I live - a near-by township owns the equipment and their officers are trained for it , but , thanks to the ride-along that a fellow Forum member took , it was noted that they confessed to simply never bothering to use that function . <p> Unfortunately , the only way to really know whether the second concern is valid would be to verify , through a primary source , whether or not POP is in-use . This can understandably be difficult , so let 's go with the following example : <p> Let 's start with POP being enabled on your detector , for a first pass . <p> POP alert goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario where the officer is awarding citations ) . It could be that the officer is using POP , and is going to issue a citation and thus " went Ka " after the initial POP reading - but it could just as easily be a false from I/O Ka or a leaky Cobra , even if POP was not in-use . <p> So , we cruise back , with POP disabled on the detector . No POP warning seen , Ka alert lights up from the I/O use . But in this case , there 's no way to positively confirm that the enforcer was not using POP . The absence of the POP warning really does n't mean anything at all , as certainly , it could be that POP was not in-use , but it could also just mean that the enforcer , for whatever reason , chose not to use POP for that particular measurement . <p> I still see the only way to confirm POP use is by visual sighting of the hardware , *plus* confirmation from the LEO that POP was used . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is being used . <p> Similarly , a tandem-vehicle , dual detector scenario ( i.e. one car with POP-off , other with POP-on ) , while it would be able rule-out false positives , it can not conclusively rule-out a false negative ( i.e. neither detector reporting POP , but POP actually being used ) - the only way to truly ascertain whether POP is in use is to visually identify the equipment , then have a confession from its operator whether POP was used at the moment it was detected . <p> For what it 's worth , even " The Professor , " jimbonzzz , agreed on this analysis .

Lester Maddox 's rule book this week . <p> The District 3 commissioner erected a warning sign on private property along Ga . 17 North near Egypt that a speed trap lies just across the county line . <p> " If Lester Maddox can do it , so can I , " Utley said . <p> Maddox made the Long County town of Ludowici infamous in 1970 by erecting two large billboards warning motorists of " speed traps and clip-joints " in the small town . Troopers with the Georgia State Patrol actually guarded the sign to keep Ludowici residents from causing it damage . <p> Utley and Planning and Zoning Board member Jasper Lee claim the tiny town of Oliver - population 253 - harbors a ticket-happy police department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of the Effingham County line . <p> " I 've had a lot of people complaining to me , " Utley said . " This has been going on for a good while . " <p> Lee said he 's been ticketed unfairly - and so have a number of other people he says have called him . " I was ticketed for 56 mph in a 35 zone when I was making a 90-degree left turn , " Lee said . " How could that be ? " <p> Lee said that $375 ticket helped motivate him to raise money for two signs , which cost about $250 each . <p> Utley and Lee plan to place a second sign along Oliver-Kildare Road . <p> Oliver Police Chief Pat Kile said calling his town a speed trap sounds like sour grapes to him . <p> " I heard a commissioner put that sign up , " Kile said . " I guess he could have gotten a ticket and is mad . " <p> Utley was n't ticketed , but his son Chris was . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chris Utley said . " The officer did n't even turn on his lights until he got right behind me ( inside the Effingham County line ) . " <p> Chris Utley said the officer first ticketed him for improper lane use on a road - without painted lines . <p> Utley said he was also handcuffed , given a breath analysis test and field-sobriety tests he passed and taken to the Oliver Police Department . <p> Utley started with a $375 fine he said , that was in the end changed to a window-tinting violation that cost about $100 . <p> Kile said Oliver has ample signs to alert motorists of reduced speed limits . <p> Oliver is less than one square mile in area and signs are posted on Ga . 17 and Ga . 24 . <p> The chief said his department writes less than one ticket per day per officer and their presence on the street should n't be a surprise to an Effingham commissioner , or anyone else .

" <h> Re : Georgia : Billboard Warns Motorist Of Speed Trap <p> Yea , Ludowici is pretty legendary I used to work in Midway years ago and drove through there regularly . This was looong past the speed trap stuff though . <p> Last summer I was running through Effingham a couple of times a week on average but I never strayed from the interstate . Folks in Savannah always told me to watch it in Effingham but I never saw any heavy enforcement on I-16.

It has better off axis than X50 , has USA mode and I get less Ka falses , it does not have as many user feature options as X50 but the ones you need .

On both of my Mercedes , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain glass so an EZ Pass can be mounted and both of my V1s operate as advertised in that position as well . My old Porsches windshields were filled with interference as well . This new Range Rover has heating coils in the glass so I immediately assumed that was the issue . That 's why I tested the 9500ix in the MBs and then under a plain clear sheet of glass . For one reason or another , even garden variety glass is causing issues . The seller said he had tested it out before selling it , and I 'm sure he did , maybe the gps receiver got knocked about during shipping . <p> Either way , I 'm glad the seller was cool enough to offer the refund , even though buying it new is going to end up costing me about $150 more ( he included a 3yr sub and warranty and , of course , the lower price ) .

I had to use one of these to get a strong signal for my Garmin Nuvi because of where it is mounted in the car ( also because the nuvi 1390t does not have an antenna port ) and now I get within 10 ft. accuracy all the time . A few things to note are : <p> - the re-radiating antenna will need a 12v power source - the re-radiating antenna will have its own GPS antenna puck that should be far away from the transmitting antenna ( i.e. antenna puck on truck and transmitting antenna in cabin - antenna is about $40 on eBay or Amazon ( I bought several SBG-190 for my application )

Each instrument received a complete calibration , traceable to the standards maintained by the National Bureau of Standards . Operation of the test equipment was performed as specified in the manufacturers instruction manuals . <p> In our past CB Magazine lab test , the individual radar detectors we tested were all rated quite well . This prompted us to conduct a test of comparing a wide selection of radar detectors for a more objective review for our readers .

The longer the cable and thinner the wire , the more chance you have of dropping the voltage across the radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a major issue to consider when hardwiring as it can destroy your V1 .

As stated , the V1 is not regulated ( such as select mobile audio amplifiers ) and therefore it can be damaged by this . Valentine will tell you this point blank if you call and they will also tell you that many of the ones that come in for repair have been hooked up with longer and thinner cords and have been damaged by voltage starvation .

They are n't selling that part to make a huge profit but to reduce frustration for both them and the consumer . I would go that route . If not , stick with a short and high quality cord . Fusing the V1 individually with the 2 amp fuse is without a doubt the best way to go ... ESPECIALLY if you have an aftermarket alternator or a high output drain on your system that can cause a quick spike . <p> You can often find people who do n't need the adapter kit that their V1 comes with who would probably just give it to you if you are on a budget .

I keep my automute volume just above audible level so that only I hear it as the speaker will now point to you , the driver . The passenger ca n't hear it . This works very well .

I do n't think I 've ever seen them using laser here . <p> The worst way to find out is if it 's too late ... better look to a jammer .

The reason I 'm asking is that , if the scope dot is not zeroed in a certain distance , how will you know you are hitting the right vehicle at 1500 ft. ? Example . If the scope dot is truely parallel to the the projection of of the laser beam , when aiming vehicles at 800-1000 ft , the laser beam falls short of the target vehicle . <p> The manual has a procedure for testing the alignment of the scope . You press the test button twice and then aim at a telephone pole . You are suppose to listen to the audible pitch from the gun and make sure that it changes as you go over the edges of the pole . There should be no other objects behind that pole . The manual also has a procedure for aligning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicylce reflector at a distance of 700 ft or more . The procedure is very clear . <p> What I 'm trying to find out here is at what distance is the dot being zeroed at . 700 ft ? 800 ft ? 1000 ft ? In the world of shooting sports , we have to know the sight at which the dot was zeroed at a particular distance so we can gauge where the dot has to be . <p> Example . If the dot was zeroed in at 100 ft , dot placement of the target point has to be below the intended target at say 200 ft and up . If target is less than 100 ft. say 50 ft. , the dot has to be placed a little higher over the intended target . So at distances of 500 to 1000 ft , dot placement has to be considered here depending on where the dot is zeroed at a particular distance . <p> Common instinct here is , you place the dot and it should get the reading . In actual measurements , actual laser beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placement . <p> What I 'm trying to find out here is at what distance is the dot being zeroed at . 700 ft ? 800 ft ? 1000 ft ?

Then try to perform the same test on a highway sign at 2000 ft . Observe the pitch change of the gun . If the pitch change at the edges ( left or right , top or bottom ) of each object is the same at both distances , then you know your gun is aligned pretty well . Its obvious that we 're more focused on the change in sound at a particular distance away from the sign . If the pitch change for distance in each direction is similar , then it can be assumed the scope is aligned ok . Sweeping from left to right , If the pitch changes to the left of the sign before your dot touches the sign and returns to normal before the dot has been completely swept over the sign , we can assume the scope needs to be aligned . Same concept from top to bottom . <p> Discussing with a Leo , on a forum , he told me the alignment procedure is done @ 50 ' ... but I argued with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distance ... bahhhh he said , we give the ticket then it is up to the court if you want to discuss the ticket .... here Leos says that laser is 200% accurate .... no discussion .

Sweep only applys to Ka band which you can box for muting as well . Ok you ca n't customise k band for sweeps.With the V1 C app All you can do is narrow the box to what the cops use in your area eg 24.150 GHz so box 24.100 to 24.200 to be safe . Then un-mute in the box and mute outside the box . When in euro mode ( which Is where you want to be ) 33.8 GHz is on by default you ca n't turn it off at all . You do n't need to fill up all the sweep option . You could just sweep ( sweep 1 ) 34.600 to 34.770 GHz ( S2 ) 34.774 to 34.800GHz and ( S3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space the v1 over sweeps so it 's covered . If you have pop or 33.8 GHz in your area you are cover by default in euro mode . I know it 's hard to put your head it around to start with but it will become easy in time . Also if your not too sure about the Frequencies used in your area use the v1 in USA mode till you have some knowledge on them.now ......... Third party apps for iOS stealthAssist v1 is good it will mute out k band like savvy under whatever speed you set it to @$10 . The real kicker is the android app yav1 ( free so far ) it auto mutes like the bells and escorts but it does it better . So yeah I know a head full but in time and searching OTHER FORUMS you will find a lot of helpful information and people that really know this stuff . Remember pop is on by default in euro mode pretty sure it 's something to do with the v1 j alert yes it still " J 's " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the frequency and disregard it easily . In the box un-mute and out of the box mute is magic most of the time . Regards

Door openers drift too much but most I see are in the 24.120 to 24.180 range so for local use , do n't count on spec mode to differentiate falses from LEOs . On the highway , longer range falses from cars with radar based cruise control have shown up around 24.220 .

I Ride a Yamaha R6 sport bike and I was wondering if there was any way to mount a radar detector that had an alert system that I could integrate into an audible sound in the helmet instead of having to watch the radar detector visual alert <p> On a bike , there 's several issues . Space , using with gloves , water , etc . <p> There 's a few options : <p> Whistler Cruisader - made for bikes , though I always thought it fits a little better on the cruises than in a cramped sport bike . Whistler makes a small helmet device that flashes an LED when the detector senses radar . The helmet device is wireless , and not too expensive . From what I understand , the Cruisader does ok against radar , but nothing spectacular . <p> TPX - This one is brand new and it looks like they 've got their act together as far as making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use with gloves , small , etc . The TPX also has a wireless LED device for the helmet . The TPX is a little pricier . Those who own it say it performs well against radar , but I do n't know how it compares to top of the line radar detectors <p> Run your own radar detector and use another method of getting the alert . This way you can use the top of the line Valentine 1 , Escorts , and Beltronics detectors . <p> H.A.R.D . - This is a wireless LED device for the helmet again . Just like the others , it simply flashes off to the side of your peripheral vision and then you look down at your detector to see what 's going on . This is what I use and it works as advertised . <p> Vizalert - Another wireless LED device for the helmet . It goes a step further though . It has several LEDs of different colors . So you can tell right away without looking down whether you have a Ka radar , K-band radar , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a little alarm speaker that 's supposed to be really loud . I met a guy on a CBR1100XX that had one for his Valentine 1 , but I should have had him demo it for me . I 'm not sure how loud it is , but it 's supposed to be loud enough for the rider to hear over the wind . Being that loud , I wonder what it sounds like when you 're at a stoplight next to a cop and the radar detector goes off . But they have a thumb switch to turn it down as needed . <p> Audio-out jack of the radar detector - the high end radar detectors often have an audio out jack . You can plug in if you want . It 's not wireless . I started wearing ER6i audio ear jacks some time ago and love it listening to tunes as I ride . Several people make mixer boxes for bikes . Where you can plug in your MP3 player , your radar detector , your intercom , your GPS , etc. and then listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , the mixer automatically gives it priority . Again , it 's wired ... except for recent high-end mixer boxes that have Bluetooth capabilities . <p> I personally run a Bel Vector 955 with a H.A.R.D . system LED for the helmet . I like it a lot . The Vizalert would be more advanced , but the LED flasher does work . <p> Nice summary ! My only correction is that TPX has wireless audio in the helmet ( not l.e.d . ) . This is a big distinction ! I have the Whistler with visual , and I can tell you that audio would be much better ! <p> quote=zr1 ; 387843On a bike , there 's several issues . Space , using with gloves , water , etc . <p> Vizalert - Another wireless LED device for the helmet . It goes a step further though . It has several LEDs of different colors . So you can tell right away without looking down whether you have a Ka radar , K-band radar , or even laser . <p> Hi Guy 's Vizalert and beltronic STI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my set-up 1- the tank-bag 2 the helmet then inside of it as you could see it was reflecting a bit to much , so I put a undevelopped film thrue it to reduce the power of the led . I use a lot off imagination to make it fit well even the STI on the tank bag . I use black foam core , sut it put some velcro on to make everything fix , and easy to remove . I hope your enjoy if you have question do n't  hesitate . it 's more easy to speak english then write it <p> why in the HELL cant someone make a visual alert add-on where we DO NT have to have some GIANT wart sticking off the side our helmets ! <p> a box attached to the helmet is a dead give away to a thief and every one of these things are just velcro 'd on for easy stealing ! <p> I 'm not sure visual is the way to go ... I do n't  necessarily want my FACE LIT up like a billboard at night when i get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cops that they should pull me over instead of the other guy ! <p> I will vouch for the radar screamer . My bike has an exhaust that is moderately loud , and I can heard the screamer at road speed . In fact it was so loud when I first mounted it that I ended up moving it so it is underneath my gauge panel , so it is pointed directly at me , but is not quite as loud . It has 3 volume settings - high , low , and off . This way if you are sitting in traffic next to a cop or something , you can turn the screamer off or down . I always leave mine on low , with my radar detector volume on high , and it works great . The only problem is that it does not have very distinct beeps for K and Ka and X , because it converts all sound from the detector to a high frequency 2-pitch beep , so they all sound similar . On a motorcycle , this is no big deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sound , it it was just a pain in the butt to plug a cord into my helmet each time I geared up , and it was even worse trying to get a wireless device to go in the helmet , because you have to remove it to charge at night . <p> I had the whistler crusader for 1 days , and I hated it so much I went back to my old system . Visual alerts were invisible during the day and blindingly distracting during the night . Rang was not good compared to the high end detectors I had used , and the thing was not very user-friendly over all . I listed it on ebay the night I got it in the mail . <p> Here is my current system . I have a Bel rx65 mounted beneath the headlights/nose of my CBR600rr . I attached the metal part of the windshield clip to the plastic insert on the bike with small bots . Then I reinserted the plastic insert , and my mounting job was complete . Then I went to Walmart , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I glued the underside of the square , clear plastic underneath the radar detector so that any wind , rain , or road dust would not damage the detector . Then I hard wired the detector to my high beam headlight so that I could turn it off at my leisure from the bike . ( My high beam is not blinding at all , so I just leave it on to be more noticeable . ) Then I later installed the screamer , and I wired the screamer switch to my handlebars . It works great ! When I want to remove the detector I just reach under the front and slide it off the clip . When I get a signal , I just peer over the handlebars and read the signal ( if it concerns me ) . The best thing about this setup is that it is resistant to theft . I park it in public all the time and the detector is inconspicuous , and when I column lock the bike , the brake line comes in front of it , making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the setup . <p> Here is what I see when I get a signal , if I choose to take my eyes off the road . As you can see , I did not bother to put plastic over the top of the detector , so it will be easy to remove . The only time I had to remove it for water reasons was the last time I washed my bike . It is completely waterproof with this setup while moving forward , because it is so far under the windshield and fairings , and the plastic covering protects the front and bottom .

I rarely speed , at most over 5 mph over the PSL and people ask why I use a detector . I explain that my last speeding ticket was due to a non-calibrated gun and instead of fighting the ticket , I paid it and have been using a RD since . With ticket prices and insurance surcharges , the V1 has paid for itself many times . When it alerts , I drop to 5 mph under the PSL every time to protect from mis-calibrated guns and it has kept me ticket free for many years .

I do n't know much about car electronics so i was going to put the antenna on top of car or on the trunk top . I drive a 95 toyota corolla . I have V1 in the car . <h> Re : CB vs Police Scanners <p> 1 ) ( Without going into specifics ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its nearly exclusively used by truckers on the interstates ( for ourcountermeasure purposes ) . A Scanner simply listens in on LEO/Fire ( Emergency services ) communications . You must program it , and you can only RX ( Receive info ) ... also you must make sure your local/state agency has not gone digital and encrypted for its communications , which a scanner will not pick up . The general consensus is : A CB is more useful then a scanner for Countermeasure purposes , and far easier to ' work with ' . <p> 2 ) A Uniden 510/520 and Wilson 1000 or 5000 are great choices ... and will cost $100 ( Well under your budget : You can get better radios like a Galaxy 919 , but then you would be getting ' fancy ' , and the learning curve may be a bit steeper with regards to using the extra features . ) <p> 3 ) Not really , no ... there is a reason(s) why big radios are bigger ... and its not just for fun . Granted a good whip ( antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent ( especially on a RX end ) , it can not compete with a 510 in TX ( Transmit ) IMO ( especially for a peak/tune ) ... a peak and tune boosts your output from 3Watts to 15/18watts . <p> 4 ) 100&amp;#37 ; Centered on the roof is often the best place , with a trunk being the 2nd best . <p> You have to check your SWR 's before using the equipment though . ( Search for that topic ) <h> Re : CB vs Police Scanners <p> I have read few posts about CB radio . I have few questions and need clarification . Some might be dum questions ..... lol <p> The only dumb questions are the ones you ask without first reading the FAQ ( the thread right above yours ) . <p> 1 . What is the diff. between a police scanner and CB radio ? <p> Dumb question . It 's in the FAQ , as well as being covered exhaustively in this thread . Basically , the difference is this : A CB , you need . A scanner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good CB radio to buy if the budjet is tight . Also , thinking about a Wilson antenna but do n't know which one is best for me ? I can spend about $200 . I want something to get the job done . Do n't need anything fancy . <p> The antenna is more important than the radio . The " best " would be a Wilson 5000 mounted in a hole drilled into the centre of your roof . If you do n't want the " best " , then tell us exactly what you do want . Just let me say that there is no good reason to be reluctant to drill a hole in a fifteen year old Toyota . <p> As for the radio , just about any reputable brand radio ( Uniden , Midland , Cobra , Texas Ranger , Galaxy ) will do the job . Just decide if you want a lot of bells and whistles , or just the bare essentials . Otherwise , 4 watts is 4 watts ( which they all are ) . As Mr. Moor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a CB that is strictly for countermeasure use . <p> 3 . Can i buy a handled CB radio and get wilson antennna to get good performance ? <p> 4 . I do n't know much about car electronics so i was going to put the antenna on top of car or on the trunk top . I drive a 95 toyota corolla . I have V1 in the car . <p> Not sure what the V1 or knowing much about car electronics has to do with antenna placement , so I may not be understanding your question correctly , but yes , the roof is the best place for your antenna , with the trunk lid being second . <h> Re : CB vs Police Scanners <p> That will totally rock teh performance . If there is a true CB shop around you , I 'd buy there so you can have the antenna professionally installed ( otherwise , get ready for a leak in your roof ) and antenna/SWRs tuned and ensure you do n't burn up a nice set-up .

Most K band lane assist transmitters seem to operate at or above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police radar transmitting 24.248 GHz . So custom sweeps can not be used to filter out K band lane assist . The only thing that helps for some systems is a time based filtering scheme where shorter pulses are not reported . I have read that turning POP off will filter out the Audi K band lane assist . Does not work on M-B systems though as the ones I 've encountered are constant on .

It is my understanding that Super Snooper LR was superhetrodyne for X-Band only . <p> ( Pretty sure this is the one , but I never opened it up to find out for certain ... )

Ironically POP detection hurts performance of non-POP radar signals and you will get POP false alerts . <p> We introduced TSR anti-falsing software in our detectors a few years ago to reject alerts from K band pulsed radar traffic flow sensors . These sensors are spaced at about 1-2 mile intervals on highways and will alert like instant-on K radar . With TSR enabled the detector identifies and rejects alerts to these sensors . These sensors are small pole mounted units which are quickly spreading throughout the USA . They do not show your speed and are not used to issue citations . They only report traffic flow data . <p> If you see TSR listed under " bands " in your detector 's settings then enable it . If you do not see TSR listed then we can install this software into your detector . All of our new corded detectors have TSR anti-falsing software already installed in them ( Solos do not ) . <p> Escort Radar customer service is available from 8am-6pm Eastern Time Mon-Fri at 1-800-543-1608 <h> Re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending it in ! open it up and see if somthing is wrong first like a wire or somthing stupid im sure that 's what it i because my x50 did the same thing and i opened it up and it was 2 simple wires touching .... that 's it . worked fine . escort radar guy told me to send it in ( do n't  blame him ) but did n't  take the advice haha . <p> FYI. i upgraded from x50 to 9500i and absolutly love it deffinatly worth the money and it has better range with virtually no falses.

Within one car 's distance , if I point the front laser sensor at the ACC sensor , I can set it off once every 15s or so intermittently on laser . However , either increasing the distance or trying with the rear laser sensor results in no alert . <p> Tried also with two Whistler detectors and no alert at any distance or circumstance . <p> So it seems like the ACC probably does n't operate on 905nm but is close enough that the V1 is sensitive enough to it at close distances ... <p> And yes , the ACC is an always-on module in this car too , despite the fact that no other system in the car uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer for options on turning this feature off ... I think I already know the answer from reading around online ; the ACC replaces the regular cruise control . Unhooking the module 's power results in a SERVICE ACC error and a chime every 15 minutes ( which is undesirable ) ... The disabling of the ACC will require new components ( a standard cruise stalk ) and about an hour 's worth of diagnostic labor on the car . <p> I think I might use this as an excuse to head out to a brick-n-mortar store to " rent out " a 9500i for testing ; - ) <p> The XTR-690 and 1793SE both do not false ( only my V1 falses ) to this car 's ACC so I 'm guessing the 695 wo n't be affected to begin with , either .

ACC is becoming more and more of a feature luxury vehicle customers expect to see -- and honestly after trying it out yesterday for my first time , it IS a useful feature . <p> Filtering these out will require detector manufacturers to incorporate laser jammer style tables of valid pulse rates / patterns to further inspect a pulsing IR source to see if it 's a police laser gun . The downsides of this are ( 1 ) it wo n't work for ACC systems that pulse at same rates as police laser guns ( 2 ) Every time a new LIDAR gun comes out the detector will need a flash to recognize it . ( 3 ) This will likely be costly processing . <p> Nonetheless , V1 owners are rarely those to care about cost for performance , and increased use of LIDAR by consumer devices is becoming more widespread and can no longer be ignored .

The devices that mount inside the car that claim to jam radar and laser are 100% fraudulent . They do n't do jack .

Press the knob once to go onto the next setting which is #2 K band . Do the same for #2 . <h> Re : Programming a V1 - Ideal Settings for Ka/Laser Only <p> You have 3 other options besides X/K bands off- #1 and #2 arrows down . 1 ) #5 arrow down , more LEDs per signal maxing out the scale faster to brake sooner . The down side is that there is no increase in distance and it is difficult to judge distance/strength . It is used for photo Ka radar to get you to brake quick . 2 ) #6 arrow down , turns off Ka Guard for great off-axis , 1 LEDs alarms far off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarms mostly at everything which you have to learn this setting , not for heavy traffic with Cobras around . 3 ) #J arrow down , POP off . Turn off when no MPH guns are around ( k and 33.8 ka ) but with it on , more " Junk-out " falses but fast response on these two bands . I 'm in Central FL some and I do see K band I/O . X and POP are rare as hens teeth but have been reported in certain areas of the Sunshine State ..... To add , Vascar is in some FHP cars ... <h> Re : Programming a V1 - Ideal Settings for Ka/Laser Only <p> With VASCAR , there is very little I can do to combat that . My local area is a combination of 33.8 ( I 've seen this signal only once ) , 34.7 , and 35.5 Ka , with some spotty laser ( LTI Ultralyte , and Kustom PL III . ) FHP do occasionally cruise , but every time I 've located one of their RADARS , it 's always 34.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FHP is , or already has , obtained TruSpeed S 's as their new LIDAR gun , along with mix and match other LIDAR . <p> I 've seen K on the coast and in Orlando , I 've gotten K bands from Orlando PD . <p> According to state law , the only RADAR guns allowed for speed measure enforcement can only be on K and Ka band .

Take a look at erikonpheonix 's Starla install for some ideas too . <p> And just about anything is better than the antenna that comes attached to the scanner out of the box , those are the cheap wires that allow basic reception so that the customer that buys it can think it works . <h> Re : any better in car antenna for uniden scanner ? <p> mmm see my thoughts to this just came from me having the antenna higher up in the car then down low by the shifter area . so even thou is not vertical mounted inside the car but still higher up in general vs the old location still not worth it ? <h> Re : any better in car antenna for uniden scanner ? <p> Higher is better , but I think orientation is more paramount in most cases . You car may be different , the antenna down under the metal ( below window/beltline ) is going to suffer significantly , but without experimenting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more by turning it sideways , tucking it along the top of the B pillar might be best compromise . <h> Re : any better in car antenna for uniden scanner ? <p> Anything inside a car is not going to work that great . Way too many reflections and blocked signal . Your windows are your signal ports . " Loaded " antennas ( antennas with coils to make them shorter ) have minus-gain . That makes it worse ! I have yet to see a stock rubber duck have any gain . Some aftermarket long ducks may be a little better than the short ducks , but a straight whip will work far better , and on more frequencies than " coil " models . A matched half-wave antenna without a groundplane will have no gain ( very long antenna ) , but with a groundplane it will have 2.1 dB of true gain . But those are good only on the frequency it is tuned to , and bad on others . A simple straight whip works best ... and even better with a groundplane . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biconicals are the best all band antennas ( what the military uses ... the NilJon super-M is one that you can easily buy ) . But another basic multi-band concept is to cut a no-coil whip ( or wire ) to resonant wavelengths for the bands you want to hear , and get some groundplane under it ( very important ) . Every third harmonic becomes resonant , and bandwidth improves without coils . All that " Lil this " and " ducky that " cuts gain and range . Go for the full whip for the max signal . That is the truth about antennas ! <p> So what bands do you want to hear ? Here is an idea that works " in the car " . Tape a thin wire to a window ( clear and in the open ) . Connect it to the center conductor of the end of the coax . Put two horizontal ground wires ( connected to the end of the coax shield ) under it . Cut all wires to length by taking 2950 divided by the lowest frequency you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on multiple bands ! ( NOTE : Do n't mount it over defrost wires in a rear window or metalic window tint . ) So if you listen to 154 Mhz , and cut wires to 19 " , install it as noted , it will also work well on 462 MHz . 800 trunked systems are so strong that you do not need gain . Nextel and 800 MHz cell towers will just overload the scanner anyway , so gain on 800 can hurt . That is your best bet . <p> It is a simple project that will solve your problem . It will do well . Give it a try . Make good connections ( important ) . I have done it before . You would be surprised what I have done to get on the air in an appartment ! And it worked ! ! Where there is a will ( and a brain ) , there is a way .
