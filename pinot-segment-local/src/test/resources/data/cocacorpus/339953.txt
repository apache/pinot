Adding the business logo or advertising slogan to employee name tags works as a tiny billboard when the employee wears it to a business lunch or visits the gas station on the way home from work . The company name gets advertised to others through the people who make your business what it is . <h> Helps Employees Relate to Employees <p> It can be difficult to remember names .
