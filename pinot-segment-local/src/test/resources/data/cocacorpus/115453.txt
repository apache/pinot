( Posted on 1/28/2017 ) <p> Must have - Killer Kit Review by SHorton <p> Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was extremely impressed with the package . First , the case is packed as in the pictures , everything in it 's place . It 's a work of art ! Then , looking at what you really get . I purchased a Phantom 2+ when they came out and I spent a ton of time researching all the parts and extras that you really need ... bought things that I never used , had to get other items I did n't think about ... spent a lot of time doing this . This kit starts with everything you need and no fluff . It 's got all this packed into a top quality rolling case . The case I bought for my Phantom 2 which I thought was great , is nowhere near the quality of this case and cut outs . The Remote with the upgrades is amazing . Right when you pick it up , the solid feel and weight let 's you know it 's not a toy . As the remote comes to life when you turn it on , the hum of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The antenna mount is very well constructed and solid and it moves clear to get to your plugs easily . Nothing on this feels sub standard in any way . The charger is amazing in regards to how fast it charges all the batteries . I hear its fan running to keep it cool as it charges , then when the fan stops , I saw everything was charged and ready to go . I 'm confident that having this plugged in the car with my 110V plug , it will charge everything between flight stops since it 's so efficient . <p> Have taken her flying and she performs perfect . Crystal clear video transmission in places I had issues with my prior drones . I ca n't wait to start taking this unit on my travels as this rugged kit will easily handle life as checked luggage . The P4 handles fantastic , I use the Litchi app to do flight plans and it works perfect with the unit . <p> I ordered through Amazon , then contacted Drone World directly to ask questions and they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upgrade on that I ordered direct from them and they installed it into the kit . The documentation from Drone World that came in the kit showed and verified all the components were included and one item , the back pack , was on back order which was no big deal . Most importantly , that did n't cause me any delays in getting in the air . <p> Fit and finish from their custom upgrade work on the P4 , remote and kit are first class . The decal overlay makes this drone stand out in the crowd , that 's for sure . Great job ... and a must have ! ( Posted on 12/20/2016 ) <p> Drone World Falcon Kit - The best Kit on the market ! Review by Max Seigal <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> The Falcon Kit by Drone World is by far one of the most sophisticated and advanced aerial platforms on the market today . I have been operating drones with National Geographic Expeditions commercially for the last three years , and I can always count on Drone World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems on the market . The Falcon Kit incorporates the latest technology in a ready-to-fly package that caters to everyone from beginner pilots all the way to working professionals like myself . Drone World has incorporated Firebridge technology into the remote controller using two internalized wifi boosters and a custom cooling system , along with a new dual helicoil antenna system that is custom tuned to the craft frequency . This system delivers unparalleled connectivity even in the face of obstacles or long range flights . This is imperative for commercial operators , because losing a signal means losing the shot . The ability for Firebridge to maintain signal at up to 5 miles range provides a peace of mind and level of connectivity that is a step above anything else on the market . Best of all , everything is charged via the stock charging port and no aftermarket chargers are required which saves weight and space when travelling . The Falcon Kit comes with numerous other upgrades and customizations that make it the leading kit on the market today . The carbon fiber propellers are 50% lighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds . This is extremely handy for me because I often operate in remote conditions with high winds where I push the craft to it 's top speeds to fight the wind and get the shots I need . The new L Series ' lens filters are an incredible addition to the kit as well , especially the adjustable ND2-400 filter . I used to carry a 6 pack of filters to adjust for changing light conditions , but this takes up extra space and burns valuable time during a shoot when switching out filters . With the ND2-400 filter , I can rely on a single filter to easily match any lighting conditions , saving precious time and weight during a shoot . The Falcon Kit also includes Drone World 's Thor power charging bank which can quickly and efficiently charge three drone batteries at once , including the remote control . This is a huge advantage for someone like myself who bounces around from one hotel room to the next , because I am often limited by the number of outlets that I find in each room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one power outlet saves me time and energy , and keeps my drone in the air during times I need it most . The kit also comes with a custom Nanuk 950 black wheeled case which is imperative for any kind of travel . As someone who flies all over the world for aerial shoots , I ca n't risk arriving at a destination with damaged equipment . The custom Nanuk case provides the high quality protection and peace of mind that I demand . <p> All in all , the Drone World Falcon kit has surpassed all my expectations . Drone World continues to lead the industry in providing the highest quality drone kits , and the Falcon Kit is by far the most advanced and sophisticated solution on the market today . <p> Check out some of my work here : https : **25;42;TOOLONG -Max Seigal ( Posted on 11/11/2016 ) <p> Great kit - Everything you need right in this kit .

Fall time is very beautiful here so we got Falcon drone to enjoy bird view . Package arrived promptly in very sturdy Nanuc case , very convenient to take with us on vacation . Thor charger is awesome idea , it is working reliably and fast . 3 fully charged batteries give you more than 1 1/2 hour of flight time and you can recharge them quickly . Long range remote system is super reliable , we were chasing cows in nearby field with drone 3 miles away . Learning curve is super fast , my 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when you loose visual contact with drone because of impressive distance you can reliably navigate it back home with video feed or with small radar like app on the screen , or return home button .

In this package you 'll get everything you need for long flying , taking stunning movies and pictures from impressive distance and take it anywhere you go in sturdy case .

I have taken the drone over 5 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone longer.

I was worried the remote would not have the power to last and run low because of all the boosters and fan however it only used 1 light of power . I could have used it for hours and hours before it was low . the fact that i can charge all of the 3 batteries and remote at the same time is great . they charge from dead to full in about 20 minutes . The remote after an hour of using it in about 30 minutes . I would buy this kit again ! ! if you are looking for a great drone that you can use to fly without losing signal get this one .

@@22062403 @2062403/ <h> Phantom 4 ActiveTrack Visual Tracking Mode <p> Active Track is one of three exciting new modes for the DJI Phantom 4 . Active Track let 's pilots track a subject , still or moving , with the press of a finger . <p> Like TapFly , Active Track uses an auto obstacle-avoidance system . The Phantom 4 will dodge and maneuver around a object in its path . This let 's the pilot focus on video and photography , rather than worry about piloting his drone . <h> How it works : <p> The steps are simple : <p> Switch onto P Mode <p> Select Active Track <p> Tap the subject on screen <p> Press Go <p> Active Track works best in bright environments , regardless of GPS signal quality , and at altitudes of 30 ft. or lower . If the drone disconnects from a pilot 's remote or runs low on power , it will automatically return to its home point . <p> Even with all this automation , pilots still have control over the drone . The left stick controls altitude , while the right stick controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fool-proof . The drone can still lose subjects that fall out of view , such as when a bicyclist rides under a bridge or a person hops into a car . The drone will refocus if the subject is back in view in a short amount of time . If the drone totally loses a subject , it 'll idle till the pilot changes course or the drone loses power . <p> Active Track can also circle the drone around a still subject . Where once it took an adept pilot to do such work , now novices and casual pilots can achieve masterful all-round shots . This mode is just another way how DJI is bringing the future to the present . With this new mode , the Phantom 4 users are one step closer to enjoying full drone autonomy . The pilot gains more liberty while enjoying countless new options . Awesome tech at an awesome value .

@@22062407 @2062407/ <h> DJI Zenmuse X3 vs X5 <p> The Zenmuse X3 and Zenmuse X5 are synonymous with DJI products . Customers can find these detachable cameras on the DJI Osmo handheld stabilizer and DJI Inspire 1 commercial drone . But what 's the difference between the X3 , X5 , and X5R ? <h> Sensor <p> The Zenmuse cameras use Sony Exmor Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor ( CMOS ) sensors . Engineers widely depend on CMOS sensors for image technology . The X3 sensor is 1/2.3 " of a " full-frame " image . The X5 and X5R sensor is Micro Four-Thirds ( MFT , or 4/3 " ) of a full-frame image . <h> Gimbal <p> The Zenmuse cameras are attached to three-axis gimbals . Each axis corresponds a geometric plane , as in X , Y , and Z. A gimbal stabilizes a camera to prevent a shaky image . The more axes , the smoother the image . <h> Lens <p> The X3 has a 20mm lens , while the X5 and X5R let 's users choose the lens . The greater the lens size , the closer the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at F/2.8 ; the X5 and X5R iris is adjustable from F/1.7 to 16 . The higher the aperture , the greater the depth of field . The X3 has a 94 Field-of-View ( FoV ) , while the X5 and X5R have 72 . <p> The X5 and X5R can use a wide variety of lenses , such as those seen on the Panasonic Lumix and Olympus M.Zuiko MFT cameras . This gives a videographer more options in customizing his image . <h> Video <p> All three Zenmuse cameras can shoot 4K resolution of video . " 4K " refers to the estimated number of pixels ( shortened to " p " ) across an image . Pixels are the little squares that make up a digital image . The more pixels , the clearer the image . 4K video resolution , otherwise called Ultra High-Definition , displays up to 4,096 pixels across and 2,160 pixels from top to bottom . Thats four times richer than the 1,280 by 720 pixels ( 720p ) , otherwise called basic High-Definition. 4K video is intended for large theater screens . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The X5R gives users the option of " raw " Cinema DNG files . The X3 bitrate ranges from 15 to 60 MegaBytes-Per-Second ( MBPS ) , while the X5s ranges from 25 to 60 . The X5R ranges from 500 to 1,900 , or 0.5 to 1.9 GigaBytes-Per-Second ( GBPS ) . <h> Photo <h> Which Ones for You ? <p> The Zenmuse X-Series caters to commercial videographers . The X3 , found standard on the Osmo and Inspire 1 , is ideal for smaller-scale productions . The optional X5 , with its interchangeable lenses and larger sensor , is best-suited for large-scale productions . The X5R , which records in raw , is intended for the hardcore video editor who needs his content in no way changed or compressed . <p> Customers can find the X3 and X5 , along with great deals and bundles , on our Osmo and Inspire 1 pages . 
@@22062408 @2062408/ <p> The DJI Phantom Series is the flagship drone model , and in April 2017 their latest model hit the shelves : The Phantom 4 Advanced . This new quadcopter splits the difference between the Phantom 4 and the Phantom 4 Pro . In essence it offers all of the same features of the drone it is replacing , the Phantom 4 , and misses out on three key details of the P4Pro : it lacks rear vision sensors/infrared sensors , there is no 5.8 GHz capability in the remote , and TapFly backward function has been removed .

( Posted on 7/13/2017 ) <p> Outstanding Product as Advertised ! Review by Nick <p> Value <p> Quality <p> Price <p> When I first received my Mavic the signal was for the most part good until I started flying further and lower . Between the three antenna , I have my own preferred setup depending on the flying I want to accomplish but the " HD Signal " antenna is my favorite . With this antenna , I can fly lower than previously while maintaining a clear video feed that does not degrade to ensure I get the shots I want . The distance gained was great as well ! I was able to push my Mavic just under 5 miles out ( and may or may not have had to make an early landing as my battery got low ) . People are always in awe about this antenna system when I take the drone out ! I have yet to come across another company who installs their mods as cleanly and packages their drones so well . ( Posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucretius <p> Value <p> Quality <p> Price <p> The team at Drone World really delivered on this upgrade . You get three types of antennas that work for different applications . When I want to capture really high-res video , the Helical antenna gets the job done remarkably . When I want to fly better through more trees or fly further , the panel antenna gives me that extra power and range . When I 'm using my DJI Goggles and ca n't rotate my direction with the drone , the FPV Park antennas enable 360 degree control ! Honestly it does n't get better than this . Looking forward to what else DW comes out with in the future ! ( Posted on 7/13/2017 )

@@22062460 @2062460/ <h> Inspire 1 Pro Camera and Features <p> With the introduction of the Inspire 1 last year , DJI has done it again with the Inspire 1 Pro . A rock solid platform with minor upgrades to the aircraft itself , the Inspire 1 Pro introduced huge changes to the equipment Inspire 1 carries.While upgrades to the propeller system and landing gear might get some excited , it 's the new cameras , the Zenmuse X5 and X5R , additions you cant get anywhere else without a custom built platform , that has people clamoring . <p> The question you might be asking yourself now is why ? The original camera on the Inspire 1 is still a great camera overall , so why would someone want the new upgraded options ? <p> For the professional photographer or aspiring cinematographer , the new cameras are a long awaited upgrade allowing for more creative control . Pro-ready out of the box , they allow owners to produce even big screen quality video and photos . Below we will look at the benefits and explain the different options out there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspire 1 Pro Overview <p> For those of you that already own an Inpsire 1 , fear not ! You are able upconvert by purchasing the Inspire 1 Pro upgrade kit separately . The upgrade kit is relatively easy to install or there 's even a pre-assembled version on offer for those that would rather not fuss with their quadcopters camera and gimbal system . <p> Compared to the original Inspire 1 there has been little change to the aircraft itself ( different locking system on the propellers and slightly higher landing gear that comes stock with the Inspire 1 Pro ) . As already noted , the main difference and value is in the camera . The X5 and X5R cameras are larger ( 526+ grams ) compared to the original X3 Inspire 1 camera . The X5 camera allows for 16MP still shots , 4k video at up to 30fps and it has interchangeable lenses for better control over focus and aperture ( currently Olympus , DJI and Panasonic make interchangeable lenses to fit on the X5 and X5R ) . Lenses for the X5 range from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the new cameras is their dynamic range . Featuring 12.8 stops of dynamic range , the user has the capability for quick changes to the exposure to create great clarity in any situation . The ISO range is also exponentially better , going from 3,200 with the original X3 camera to 25,600 on the Inspire 1 Pro . This all adds up to greater control and the ability to get the cleanest shot possible in almost any environment . <h> Inspire 1 Pro Sensor <p> One of the biggest benefits to owning the X5 and X5R is the sensors that come with these cameras are huge ( literally ) compared to the X3 camera . Comparing the original X3 camera or a Go-Pro style camera , the sensors in the X5 and X5R are over 8x the size . The Inspire 1 Pro models use a powerful Micro Four Thirds sensor that creates extremely clean and crisp shots . Sensors of this caliber have only been available in pricey custom builds in the past and would run nearly $10k . <p> Inspire 1 Pro X5R . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pro versions elevate DJI 's consumer drone to epic levels . Lesser quadcopters have n't reach these heights bIf the Micro Four Thirds sensor , increased dynamic range , interchangeable lenses , remote focus and aperture control of the Inspire 1 Pro X5 just do n't do it for you , then an upgrade to the Inspire 1 Pro X5R is what you need . Moving from the X5 to the X5R , you 'll get same reliable drone and camera setup but with the added ability to shoot in lossless 4k RAW . Using a 512GB removable SSD drive to store all of that video , the Inspire 1 X5R shoots video at 2 gigabits per second making that extra storage and absolute necessity . The X5R camera gives the user the greatest creative freedom possible when shooting and editing . For the professional or the individual that demand the best in quality this is the camera and platform to use . <p> ecause of the increased weight in the cameras . If you wanted to carry a better camera in the past , you needed a much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . And moving to those customized platforms can easily set you back twice what the Inspire 1 Pro costs to get similar control over the camera and lenses . DJI has done incredible work in designing this new system and the video shot from the Inspire 1 Pro is incredible .

The Phantom 4s larger FOV makes it better suited for landscape imaging . <h> Remote Controller and Wi-Fi <p> What is the difference between using the remote controller to control the Mavic , and using your smartphone to control it via Wi-Fi ? <p> The Mavic remote controller uses DJIs OcuSync transmission technology , giving it an increased range of up to 4.3mi ( 7km ) in open areas without interference , FCC compliant . When using a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi , the controllable range is 80m , and maximum altitude is 50m , making it suitable for short-range shots like selfies and for setting up ActiveTrack . You can also download photos and videos directly from the Mavic to your mobile device via Wi-Fi .

Phones and tablets larger than this do not fit the remote controllers device holder . <p> Can I use a regular USB cable to connect my phone and remote controller ? <p> Yes , you can . However , for the best user experience , we recommend that you use a dedicated Mavic RC ( Remote Controller ) Cable to connect your phone . <p> The phone on the left has a standard Micro USB Connector ; the phone on the right has a Reverse Micro USB Connector.The Remote Controller Cable ( Standard Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : Samsung , Huawei , Motorola and more . The Remote Controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : HTC , Mi , OPPO and more . For Sony , VIVO , and other brands , phone compatibility differs by model .

For your first use , you can scan the QR code with the DJI GO app to connect to the aircraft* , or enter the password manually under your phones Wi-Fi settings .

You must use the DJI GO app to connect to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and password ? <p> Connect to your Mavic via Wi-Fi and then enter Camera View . Now enter Wi-Fi settings to manually set the SSID and password . <p> How do I reset the Wi-Fi password back to default ? <p> Turn on the Mavic in Wi-Fi mode , press the linking button and hold for 5s . <p> What is the benefit of dual-band Wi-Fi ? <p> The 2.4G Wi-Fi frequency was developed a long time ago , 5G Wi-Fi is newer . As 2.4G is older , more devices use this frequency , making it more likely to suffer from interference . 5G is less prone to interference as there are less 5G devices , but not all phones support the 5G frequency . You can switch between these two frequency bands in the Wi-Fi Settings menu in the DJI GO app . <h> Propulsion <p> Do I have to take the propellers off when in transit ? <p> No . Just fold the propellers and you are good to go . <p> What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight ? <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propellers into the correct position , so you do n't  need to worry about not having unfolded them perfectly . <p> The Mavics motors are not all on the same plane . Will this affect its flight performance ? <p> No . <p> What 's the highest level of wind the Mavic can resist ? <p> The Mavic can withstand a level 5 wind , also called a fresh breeze . This is defined as wind speeds of 1924mph ( 2938kph ) . <p> How far can the Mavic fly on a single charge ? <p> In calm weather and under ideal conditions , the Mavic can fly up to 8 miles ( 13km ) at 31 mph ( 50 kph ) . Real-world performance will vary though , so we urge you to monitor your battery level at all times . <p> Why does the Mavic have a longer flight time than hover time ? <p> Thanks to its rotor system optimized for forward flight and its aerodynamic design , when flying at the optimum speed for energy consumption , the Mavic consumes less energy then it does hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 27 minute flight time , while its hover time is 24 minutes . <h> Video Transmission <p> What is the main benefit of the OcuSync video transmission system ? <p> OcuSync has a range of up to 4.3 miles ( 7 km ) with improved resistance to interference and a higher transmission throughput . At shorter ranges it can stream footage to you at 1080p resolution and also allows photo and video downloads at 40Mb/s . <p> 160ms from the Mavics camera to your device screen under ideal conditions . <h> Vision <p> What is the difference between quick calibration and advanced calibration ? <p> When the Vision System fails to function normally , you can do a quick calibration in the DJI GO app , or connect the aircraft to a computer to perform advanced calibration for higher precision . <p> What is the difference between the Mavics Intelligent Vision Positioning System and an Optical Flow Vision Positioning System ? <p> The Mavic combines dual forward and downward vision sensors to realize precision hovering . Therefore , it requires no more than a patterned surface and enough available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the ground . Even if the Mavic is unable to identify reference points on the ground , it can still rely on its forward vision sensors to hover . In contrast , an Optical Flow system , requires information from ultrasonic sensors to supplement its view of patterned surfaces . <p> An example to show the difference between the two systems is when the aircraft is returning to you where you are standing on a balcony . When flying in over the balcony , drones using Optical Flow will receive data from two data sources that measure its height above the below surface differently one being its height above the ground , and another the height above the balcony . As the data is not compatible , an Optical Flow system may become confused . <p> Another example is when the ground below the drone is covered by vegetation . Plants and trees do not reflect sound as well as other surfaces , causing the Optical Flow systems ultrasonic sensors to be unable to gather altitude data . <p> In conclusion , the Mavic 's Intelligent Vision Positioning System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality . <p> What is the minimum distance and maximum flight speed at which the Mavic can fly while avoiding obstacles ? <p> The Mavic will automatically avoid obstacles 50ft ( 15m ) in front of it . The maximum speed at which the Mavic is able to avoid obstacles is 22mph ( 30kph ) . <p> What are the conditions required for Precision Landing ? <p> Precision Landing is an upgraded version of GPS RTH . It needs a GPS signal strong enough to initiate Precision Landing , so that the Mavic can be navigated back to the vicinity of the take-off point . Then , the aircraft needs to be able to visually recognize the pattern of the ground it took off from , for example cracks or other identifiable patterns . A uniform patch of sand , however , is not suitable for Precision Landing . Finally , the Mavic needs to capture footage of the ground during take-off to record its appearance . This means that you should give the Mavic sufficient time during its ascent , instead of flying away immediately after take-off . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flight Battery and its remote controller ? <p> Yes , it can charge a battery and two other devices simultaneously via USB . However , it will take longer to fully charge the devices . <p> Does the Mavics battery support quick charging ? <p> Yes . The Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery supports quick charging at nearly 2C , with a maximum charging power of 100W . The rated power of Mavic Battery Charger is 50W , and the rated power of the Mavic Car Charger is 78W . When using the Mavic Advanced Charging Hub with a 100W adapter , the battery can be charged at 100W . <p> What is a Battery Charging Hub ? What is the difference between the two versions of the Mavics Charging Hub ? <p> The two Charging Hubs can both charge up to 4 batteries at one time . In order to fully charge the first battery as quickly as possible , the Intelligent Flight Batteries are charged in sequence according to their power levels , from high to low .

@@22062478 @2062478/ <h> DJI OSMO Review : Osmo vs . G4 GoPro Gimbal <p> With the release of the DJI Osmo , we 've had a few videographers ask us what all the buzz was about . Most of them had heard of the OSMO and DJI but did n't know much . They thought the Osmo sounded like a mixed drink or might be a fancy selfie stick . After getting our hands on the OSMO , we can tell you it 's much more than a glorified selfie stick . <p> Watching video shot out at the beach , our videographer friends were blown away . They routinely spend thousands on a single lens for their camera . But they were impressed with the quality of video taken with the Osmo ! We figured it would be beneficial to the video community to show what the Osmo is all about . There are a few other options on the market like Osmo , like the GoPro G4 Gimbal . But all in all , the Osmo is something that makes quality , steady video possible for anyone . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osmo is capable of . <p> The Osmo is from DJI , a company better known for its Phantom 3 and Inspire 1 drones . One of the best features of these UAVs is their gimbal and camera system . With the Osmo , DJI has essentially taken the same camera ( Zenmuse X3 ) and gimbal system from the Inspire 1 and created a handheld version . Or another way to look at the Osmo is as the smaller , younger brother of the larger handheld gimbal system : the DJI Ronin - designed to carry a larger DSLR camera . The Osmo has impressive specs and shoots video in 4k . It can shoot slow motion HD video at up to 120 fps and takes 12MP photos . It even shoots in RAW . You can connect different cameras like the Zenmuse X5 or X5R to the gimbal as well . What I really like about this system is the comfortable ergonomic grip and its easy to use . DJI has done a great job creating a product that is functional and extremely useful . Everything from setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well thought out . <p> Now the question is why not just get a GoPro and cheap selfie stick ? If you saw the first few seconds of the video above that is one huge reason . Video stabilization ! It does depend on what you want to do , but in general the only thing the GoPro does better is underwater filming - with the right case of course . The current set up for the Osmo is not waterproof - yet ! The GoPros have a lot of case options that can make the camera more sturdy to falls and rough handling . But , if you are not trying to beat up your camera or go swimming with it , we recommend the Osmo . <p> There are a ton of accessories out there for the Osmo as well . To name a few you have many different tripod options , vehicle mounts , bike mounts , as well as extension handles . So you can definitely take the Osmo on all of your adventures . There are many other third party companies coming out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to it the Osmos video quality with the gimbal provides much smoother video compared to the standalone GoPro . Think of an action shot where you are running , biking or driving ( or even just moving the camera in place ) . The standard GoPro will give you breaks of clean video , but in general a lot of it is unprofessional and depending on the shot and movement will give viewers a headache with shaky bouncy shots . <p> The top of the line GoPro Hero4 has some impressive stats that are similar to the Osmo . You can compare line by line , but they will both shoot some great video . Each has its place , but the Osmo lack of non-fisheye lens is a huge plus . Everyone knows when video is shot with a GoPro because of the wide angle , fisheye lens . There is a time and a place for a fisheye lens , but in general it just looks a little strange to have a fisheye lens for every shot . The Osmo integrates with your phone and attaches onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are filming . Gone is the hard time with that tiny screen on a GoPro . Granted , GoPro can link to your phone , but now your holding your phone in one hand and camera in another . <p> Finding a full camera and gimbal setup that is as good or better and the same price or less than the Osmo is going to be a difficult task . A G4 3-axis handheld gimbal is the closest competition . <p> All of this to say the Osmo is a great piece of equipment . It is revolutionizing the way we shoot quality stabilized video . It consistently shoots amazing video and is built very user friendly . The market is headed this direction and the video quality and stabilization is something that everyone will expect when they are looking to get a new camera . GoPro Hero4 to mount on the G4 - the camera is not included like OSMO . Quality is decent on the G4 , but the G4 gimbal and GoPro Hero4 purchased together would be well over $800.

I can land this thing on top of standing seam roofs . pbr roofs and etc . I flew through one of the commercial metal buildings and hovered and did a 360 degree shot of the inside , this is KEWL . Thanks , Dan Shaw - AssurSteel Metal Buildings ( Posted on 5/5/2017 ) <h> Product <p> What 's the main difference between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The Mavic is smaller , lighter , and easier to carry with you thanks to its foldable design . Its new OcuSync transmission system has a longer transmission range and 1080p resolution . Due to its larger size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand stronger winds . <p> Does the folding mechanism wear out and will it need replacing ? <p> The folding mechanism has been tested to last at least 5000 folds . It is unlikely that it will wear out during the Mavics lifetime . <p> What 's difference of camera between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The two cameras have the same features , but the Mavics camera has a smaller FOV , is able to focus as closely as 0.5m and can be rotated 90 for portrait shots and selfies . The Phantom 4s larger FOV makes it better suited for landscape imaging . <h> Remote Controller and Wi-Fi <p> What is the difference between using the remote controller to control the Mavic , and using your smartphone to control it via Wi-Fi ? <p> The Mavic remote controller uses DJIs OcuSync transmission technology , giving it an increased range of up to 4.3mi ( 7km ) in open areas without interference , FCC compliant . When using a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi , the controllable range is 80m , and maximum altitude is 50m , making it suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also download photos and videos directly from the Mavic to your mobile device via Wi-Fi . By sliding the Control Mode switch on the right hand side of the aircraft , you can choose easily between Wi-FI and RC mode depending on which transmission type you need . <p> How do I switch between the two controller modes ? <p> First , make sure that your aircraft is powered off . Then , open the small cover on the right hand side of the aircraft body . Slide the switch to the left to enable Wi-Fi control , or to the right to use the remote controller . <p> What sizes of smartphone can fit inside the Mavic remote controller ? <p> The Mavic remote controller can fit smartphones between 6.5-8.5mm thick and up to 160mm long , without a phone case . Phones and tablets larger than this do not fit the remote controllers device holder . <p> Can I use a regular USB cable to connect my phone and remote controller ? <p> Yes , you can . However , for the best user experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Remote Controller ) Cable to connect your phone . <p> The phone on the left has a standard Micro USB Connector ; the phone on the right has a Reverse Micro USB Connector.The Remote Controller Cable ( Standard Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : Samsung , Huawei , Motorola and more . The Remote Controller Cable ( Reverse Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : HTC , Mi , OPPO and more . For Sony , VIVO , and other brands , phone compatibility differs by model . Please take care to choose the correct type for your phone . <p> What Remote Controller Cables are included with the Mavic upon purchase ? <p> Two cables are included in the box : one with Lightning connector and one with a standard Micro-USB connector . <p> What is the default Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> For security purposes , each Mavic has its own SSID and password that can be found on a sticker on one of the forearms of the aircraft and inside the battery compartment . For your first use , you can scan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aircraft* , or enter the password manually under your phones Wi-Fi settings . ( *Only available for Android devices ) . <p> Can I use other QR code apps to scan the QR code and connect to the aircraft via Wi-Fi ? <p> No . You must use the DJI GO app to connect to your aircraft . <p> How can I set the Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> Connect to your Mavic via Wi-Fi and then enter Camera View . Now enter Wi-Fi settings to manually set the SSID and password . <p> How do I reset the Wi-Fi password back to default ? <p> Turn on the Mavic in Wi-Fi mode , press the linking button and hold for 5s . <p> What is the benefit of dual-band Wi-Fi ? <p> The 2.4G Wi-Fi frequency was developed a long time ago , 5G Wi-Fi is newer . As 2.4G is older , more devices use this frequency , making it more likely to suffer from interference . 5G is less prone to interference as there are less 5G devices , but not all phones support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency bands in the Wi-Fi Settings menu in the DJI GO app . <h> Propulsion <p> Do I have to take the propellers off when in transit ? <p> No . Just fold the propellers and you are good to go . <p> What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight ? <p> Once the rotors start spinning , the centrifugal force will automatically push the propellers into the correct position , so you do n't  need to worry about not having unfolded them perfectly . <p> The Mavics motors are not all on the same plane . Will this affect its flight performance ? <p> No . <p> What 's the highest level of wind the Mavic can resist ? <p> The Mavic can withstand a level 5 wind , also called a fresh breeze . This is defined as wind speeds of 1924mph ( 2938kph ) . <p> How far can the Mavic fly on a single charge ? <p> In calm weather and under ideal conditions , the Mavic can fly up to 8 miles ( 13km ) at 31 mph ( 50 kph ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to monitor your battery level at all times . <p> Why does the Mavic have a longer flight time than hover time ? <p> Thanks to its rotor system optimized for forward flight and its aerodynamic design , when flying at the optimum speed for energy consumption , the Mavic consumes less energy then it does hovering . This is why it is able to give you a 27 minute flight time , while its hover time is 24 minutes . <h> Video Transmission <p> What is the main benefit of the OcuSync video transmission system ? <p> OcuSync has a range of up to 4.3 miles ( 7 km ) with improved resistance to interference and a higher transmission throughput . At shorter ranges it can stream footage to you at 1080p resolution and also allows photo and video downloads at 40Mb/s . <p> 160ms from the Mavics camera to your device screen under ideal conditions . <h> Vision <p> What is the difference between quick calibration and advanced calibration ? <p> When the Vision System fails to function normally , you can do a quick calibration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer to perform advanced calibration for higher precision . <p> What is the difference between the Mavics Intelligent Vision Positioning System and an Optical Flow Vision Positioning System ? <p> The Mavic combines dual forward and downward vision sensors to realize precision hovering . Therefore , it requires no more than a patterned surface and enough available light to be able to hover stably up to 13m above the ground . Even if the Mavic is unable to identify reference points on the ground , it can still rely on its forward vision sensors to hover . In contrast , an Optical Flow system , requires information from ultrasonic sensors to supplement its view of patterned surfaces . <p> An example to show the difference between the two systems is when the aircraft is returning to you where you are standing on a balcony . When flying in over the balcony , drones using Optical Flow will receive data from two data sources that measure its height above the below surface differently one being its height above the ground , and another the height above the balcony . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become confused . <p> Another example is when the ground below the drone is covered by vegetation . Plants and trees do not reflect sound as well as other surfaces , causing the Optical Flow systems ultrasonic sensors to be unable to gather altitude data . <p> In conclusion , the Mavic 's Intelligent Vision Positioning System requires fewer inputs and is therefore more robust in its functionality . <p> What is the minimum distance and maximum flight speed at which the Mavic can fly while avoiding obstacles ? <p> The Mavic will automatically avoid obstacles 50ft ( 15m ) in front of it . The maximum speed at which the Mavic is able to avoid obstacles is 22mph ( 30kph ) . <p> What are the conditions required for Precision Landing ? <p> Precision Landing is an upgraded version of GPS RTH . It needs a GPS signal strong enough to initiate Precision Landing , so that the Mavic can be navigated back to the vicinity of the take-off point . Then , the aircraft needs to be able to visually recognize the pattern of the ground it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns . A uniform patch of sand , however , is not suitable for Precision Landing . Finally , the Mavic needs to capture footage of the ground during take-off to record its appearance . This means that you should give the Mavic sufficient time during its ascent , instead of flying away immediately after take-off . <h> Charging <p> Can the Mavics charger charge both its Intelligent Flight Battery and its remote controller ? <p> Yes , it can charge a battery and two other devices simultaneously via USB . However , it will take longer to fully charge the devices . <p> Does the Mavics battery support quick charging ? <p> Yes . The Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery supports quick charging at nearly 2C , with a maximum charging power of 100W . The rated power of Mavic Battery Charger is 50W , and the rated power of the Mavic Car Charger is 78W . When using the Mavic Advanced Charging Hub with a 100W adapter , the battery can be charged at 100W . <p> What is a Battery Charging Hub ? What is the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two Charging Hubs can both charge up to 4 batteries at one time . In order to fully charge the first battery as quickly as possible , the Intelligent Flight Batteries are charged in sequence according to their power levels , from high to low . This gives you the fastest way of getting all your batteries fully charged.There are two main differences between the two Charging Hubs . First , the standard Charging Hub only supports the Mavics 50W Battery Charger and Mavic Car Charger , while the advanced version also supports the 100W Battery Charger and Car Charger from the Phantom 4 . Second , the advanced version will balance the voltage of each battery cell to improve charging efficiency . When one batterys charging enters the second-half of its charging phase , the next battery will enter the first-half of its charging phase . With 4 batteries all at 15% , the advanced charger can get 4 batteries fully charged in 140 minutes using the Phantom 4s 100W charger , while the standard version will need 270 minutes with the Mavics 50W charger . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This adapter can be connected to the Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery , turning it into a power bank . Thanks to its high capacity , an Intelligent Flight Battery at 25% charge can fully charge the Mavics controller , or an iPhone 6 . <p> What is the maximum output current for the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> The adapter has two USB ports which can be used simultaneously . The output voltage is 5V , and the max current is 2A + 2A . <h> Travel Notice <p> How many batteries can I carry in the Mavics Shoulder Bag ? <p> Four . One mounted on the Mavic , one at the bottom of the bag , and on in each of the two side pockets .

@@22062549 @2062549/ <h> Inspire 2 vs . Inspire 1 <p> For the last decade DJI has established itself as the dominating force in commercial drone technology , demonstrating tremendous success with their Inspire , Phantom , and Mavic series drones . In November 2016 they unveiled the next edition of their Inspire series , the DJI Inspire 2 , a follow-up to the DJI Inspire 2 , which first sold in November 2014 . <p> The DJI Inspire 1 was positioned by DJI to appeal to the middle ground of consumers - between the average drone fan and a Hollywood filmmaker . Between the release of the Inspire 1 and Inspire 2 , DJI has introduced numerous drones that are less expensive while offering many of the popular features of the Inspire 1 ( both Phantom and Mavic series drones ) . The DJI Inspire 2 takes drone pilots to dizzying new heights , both figuratively and literally . It is remarkably fast , responsive , and all around a major improvement over its predecessor . ( Discover all DJI Inspire 1 Accesssories ) <p> Learn more about the DJI Inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the Inspire 2 bests the Inspire 1 : <h> Price <p> Inspire 1 : $1999 <p> Inspire 2 : $2999 <p> The DJI Inspire series is marked by high quality all around , boasting industry leading materials , specs , and features . It comes as no surprise then that they are the highest priced consumer drones , with the Inspire 1 fetching a $1999 price tag , and the Inspire 2 costing a cool $2999 . <p> Included in the Inspire 1 V2.0 Everything You Need Kit is priced at $2,737 , and comes with : a second remote controller for dual operators to control flight and camera functions , a spare intelligent flight battery , a battery heater to ensure safe and reliable flights in lower temperatures , a battery charging hub for charging four batteries at once , a remote controller monitor hood to shield the tablet from direct sunlight , and two pairs of quick-releas propellers ( one pair of clockwise and one pair counter-clockwise ) . Flying with the extra controller allows for even better photography and videography , as one pilot controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera to capture the best shot . ( All DJI Inspire 2 batteries and battery chargers are available here ) <p> The Inspire 2 Premium Combo comes with its own set of valuable upgrades : the Zemuse X5S and Cinema DNG &amp; Apple ProRes Activation Key , which provide Inspire 2 owners full access to the CineCore 2.0 image processing system , making it capable of capturing 5.2K 30fps CinemaDNG and Apple ProRes video as well as 4K 60fps using H.264 and 4K 30fps using H.265 ( both at 100Mbps ) . <p> For amateur drone fans , the larger price tag may be a deterrent , but otherwise the $2,999 figure is perfectly fair given the slew of features and improvements to the new model . <h> Flight Time ( Battery Performance ) <p> Inspire 1 : 18 minutes <p> Inspire 2 : 27 minutes <p> Inspire 1 operating temperature : 14-104 Fahrenheit <p> Inspire 2 operating temperature : -4-104 Fahrenheit <p> As expected , the Inspire 2 can fly for a longer period of time , reaching 27 minutes of flight compared to 18 minutes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers two different sized batteries for the Inspire 1 : a 4500 mAh unit that provides 18 minutes of flight time , and a 5700 mAh battery that provides 22 minutes . Additionally , the Inspire 2 utilizes dual battery redundancy , a useful features that allows the drones to pull power from both batteries , but run off one in case of failure . ( If this happens , it will force the drone into landing mode , but that is 100% better than having an Inspire 2 fall helplessly from the sky ! ) <p> Another neat advantage the Inspire 2 has over the Inspire 1 is the cold weather performance . Say you 're flying early in the morning , or even on a cool evening , but your batteries are too cold to function . If you fly an Inspire 1 , you have no choice but to wait for warmer conditions , while the Inspire 2 includes a battery warming function that brings them up the required operating temperature . This difference is reflected in the operating temperature for each drone - Inspire 1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that right , that 's negative 4 ! ) <p> The Inspire 2 utilizes 2 onboard batteries that can be hot-swapped to maximize flight time . This provides it with 9 more minutes of flight time , a welcome addition for any drone pilot . <h> Size/Weight/Apperance <p> Inspire 1 : 6.27 pounds <p> Inspire 2 : 7.58 pounds <p> Looking at both drones , it 's not easy to recognize how they differ in size and weight , especially because the differences are slight . The Inspire 2 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier than its Inspire 1 counterpart , weighing in at a stout 7.58 pounds , with the Inspire 1 tipping the scale at 6.27 pounds . In terms of size , the diagonal distance of the Inspire 2 is just 1 inch more than the Inspire 1 , at 23.8 inches . Finally , perhaps the most noticeable difference in these two drones is their color . DJI has opted for a metallic finish for the Inspire 2 , which photographers and videographers will appreciate over the stark white color of the Inspire 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speed and Range <p> Inspire 1 Top Speed : 49 mph <p> Inspire 2 Top Speed : 65 mph <p> Inspire 1 Range : 3.1 miles <p> Inspire 2 Range : 4.3 miles <p> When choosing between the Inspire 2 or Inspire 1 , speed is a huge component , as the Inspire 2 really shows its muscles , vastly improving upon the 49mph top speed of the Inspire 1 with a blistering 65 mph. 65 mph is an impressive top speed , and will aford filmmakers unprecented action sequences as they zoom around their subject . DJI also improved on the range , boosting the 3.1 mile flight capability to 4.3 miles . Once again , DJI has taken their original iteration and made dramatic improvements , to the joy of all DJI fans worldwide . <h> Obstacle Avoidance <p> Inspire 1 : None <p> Inspire 2 : 360 <p> Plain and simply ( not to mention surprisingly ) , the Inspire 1 does not have any kind of obstacle avoidance . DJI stepped up its game with the Inspire 2 , offering 360 obstacle avoidance for complete protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensing objects up to 30 meters away while traveling up to 34 mph . Upward facing infrared sensors on the Inspire 2 sense obstacles within a 5 meter range . Plus , sensors on the underside of the Inspire 2 provide terrain detection . Both drones can hover in place without GPS thanks to DJI 's Vision Positioning System ( which also allows pilots to take off and land at the press of a button ) . It 's unfortunate that the Inspire 1 does n't utilize any obstacle sensing technology , the result of which is a drone that is not as safe and could be poorly suited for new drone pilots . <h> DJI Goggles <p> Inspire 1 : Not Compatible <p> Inspire 2 : Compatible <p> This category is a simple one to understand : the Inspire 2 is compatible with the transformative DJI Goggles , while the Inspire 1 is not , unfortunately . DJI Goggles give pilots a truly transformative experience , putting them inside the Inspire 2 for a flight that is absolutely breathtaking . Imbued with Head Tracking Technology , the DJI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , providing complete control over the aircraft 's movement . A USB cable connects the Inspire 2 to the DJI Goggles , which operate up to the same transmission distance of the drone . If experiencing FPV flight is important to you , this compatibility is a huge factor when picking the Inspire 2 or the Inspire 1 . <h> Camera <p> Although DJI thought ahead when designing the Inspire 1 by creating a gimbal capable of changing cameras , the Inspire 1 does not have an FPV camera like the newer model . The FPV camera allows for the pilot to see where they are flying while simultaneously relying on a camera operator to capture all the photos and videos . <h> Flight Modes <p> Follow Me - Aircraft follows you and captures your every move from a unique aerial perspective . <p> Course Lock - Controls are set relative to your aircraft 's current path . Fly in a set direction while soaring alongside moving objects or fixed objects . <p> Waypoints - Set multiple GPS points , or Waypoints , and the aircraft will automatically fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Home Lock - fix your controls to be relative to the Home Pilot . Easily pull back on the control stick to bring the aircraft back home , or push forward to fly farther away , no matter which way it is facing . <p> Point of Interest - Set a specific building , object or location as the Point of Interest and the aircraft will continuously circle around it while you record the perfect photos and video . <p> New to the Inspire 2 is Spotlight Pro , a powerful tracking mode that allows even single pilots to capture complex , dramatic imagery . Visual tracking algorithms lock onto a subject during flight , regardless of the aircraft 's direction . The result : jaw-dropping photos that would have once required a dedicated camera operator . The design is so intricate that if the gimbal nears its rotation limits , the Inspire 2 will rotate itself in the same direction without affecting flight control . Spotlight is marked by two shooting modes : a ) Quick Mode - Simple . Select an object to begin tracking , b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the subject enters the preset tracking position , press the shortcut to begin tracking . ( Spotlight Pro is available in TapFly , Waypoint , and Point of Interest ) <p> One other new feature is QuickSpin , DJI 's solution to not including continuous panning . When activated , QuickSpin rotates the aircraft 360 , working seamlessly with GPS , ATTI , Sport , and all Intelligent Flight Modes . <h> Conclusion <p> Ultimately , the DJI Inspire 2 blows all competition out the water . It really is n't a fair fight . It crushes the competition with a combination of blinding speed , an assortment of great features , and beefy battery life . Plus , compatibility with DJI Goggles and a sleek new color result in the Inspire 2 cementing its place as the ultimate commercial drone . DJI has taken all of the wonderful features of their Inspire 1 and capitalized on them , making the Inspire 2 a truly valuable upgrade , in every sense of the word .

( Posted on 3/11/2017 ) <h> Product <p> What 's the main difference between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The Mavic is smaller , lighter , and easier to carry with you thanks to its foldable design . Its new OcuSync transmission system has a longer transmission range and 1080p resolution . Due to its larger size , the Phantom 4 has a higher maximum speed and can withstand stronger winds . <p> Does the folding mechanism wear out and will it need replacing ? <p> The folding mechanism has been tested to last at least 5000 folds . It is unlikely that it will wear out during the Mavics lifetime . <p> What 's difference of camera between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The two cameras have the same features , but the Mavics camera has a smaller FOV , is able to focus as closely as 0.5m and can be rotated 90 for portrait shots and selfies . The Phantom 4s larger FOV makes it better suited for landscape imaging . <h> Remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remote controller to control the Mavic , and using your smartphone to control it via Wi-Fi ? <p> The Mavic remote controller uses DJIs OcuSync transmission technology , giving it an increased range of up to 4.3mi ( 7km ) in open areas without interference , FCC compliant . When using a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi , the controllable range is 80m , and maximum altitude is 50m , making it suitable for short-range shots like selfies and for setting up ActiveTrack . You can also download photos and videos directly from the Mavic to your mobile device via Wi-Fi . By sliding the Control Mode switch on the right hand side of the aircraft , you can choose easily between Wi-FI and RC mode depending on which transmission type you need . <p> How do I switch between the two controller modes ? <p> First , make sure that your aircraft is powered off . Then , open the small cover on the right hand side of the aircraft body . Slide the switch to the left to enable Wi-Fi control , or to the right to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit inside the Mavic remote controller ? <p> The Mavic remote controller can fit smartphones between 6.5-8.5mm thick and up to 160mm long , without a phone case . Phones and tablets larger than this do not fit the remote controllers device holder . <p> Can I use a regular USB cable to connect my phone and remote controller ? <p> Yes , you can . However , for the best user experience , we recommend that you use a dedicated Mavic RC ( Remote Controller ) Cable to connect your phone . <p> The phone on the left has a standard Micro USB Connector ; the phone on the right has a Reverse Micro USB Connector.The Remote Controller Cable ( Standard Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : Samsung , Huawei , Motorola and more . The Remote Controller Cable ( Reverse Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : HTC , Mi , OPPO and more . For Sony , VIVO , and other brands , phone compatibility differs by model . Please take care to choose the correct type for your phone . <p> What Remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two cables are included in the box : one with Lightning connector and one with a standard Micro-USB connector . <p> What is the default Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> For security purposes , each Mavic has its own SSID and password that can be found on a sticker on one of the forearms of the aircraft and inside the battery compartment . For your first use , you can scan the QR code with the DJI GO app to connect to the aircraft* , or enter the password manually under your phones Wi-Fi settings . ( *Only available for Android devices ) . <p> Can I use other QR code apps to scan the QR code and connect to the aircraft via Wi-Fi ? <p> No . You must use the DJI GO app to connect to your aircraft . <p> How can I set the Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> Connect to your Mavic via Wi-Fi and then enter Camera View . Now enter Wi-Fi settings to manually set the SSID and password . <p> How do I reset the Wi-Fi password back to default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the linking button and hold for 5s . <p> What is the benefit of dual-band Wi-Fi ? <p> The 2.4G Wi-Fi frequency was developed a long time ago , 5G Wi-Fi is newer . As 2.4G is older , more devices use this frequency , making it more likely to suffer from interference . 5G is less prone to interference as there are less 5G devices , but not all phones support the 5G frequency . You can switch between these two frequency bands in the Wi-Fi Settings menu in the DJI GO app . <h> Propulsion <p> Do I have to take the propellers off when in transit ? <p> No . Just fold the propellers and you are good to go . <p> What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight ? <p> Once the rotors start spinning , the centrifugal force will automatically push the propellers into the correct position , so you do n't  need to worry about not having unfolded them perfectly . <p> The Mavics motors are not all on the same plane . Will this affect its flight performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind the Mavic can resist ? <p> The Mavic can withstand a level 5 wind , also called a fresh breeze . This is defined as wind speeds of 1924mph ( 2938kph ) . <p> How far can the Mavic fly on a single charge ? <p> In calm weather and under ideal conditions , the Mavic can fly up to 8 miles ( 13km ) at 31 mph ( 50 kph ) . Real-world performance will vary though , so we urge you to monitor your battery level at all times . <p> Why does the Mavic have a longer flight time than hover time ? <p> Thanks to its rotor system optimized for forward flight and its aerodynamic design , when flying at the optimum speed for energy consumption , the Mavic consumes less energy then it does hovering . This is why it is able to give you a 27 minute flight time , while its hover time is 24 minutes . <h> Video Transmission <p> What is the main benefit of the OcuSync video transmission system ? <p> OcuSync has a range of up to 4.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a higher transmission throughput . At shorter ranges it can stream footage to you at 1080p resolution and also allows photo and video downloads at 40Mb/s . <p> 160ms from the Mavics camera to your device screen under ideal conditions . <h> Vision <p> What is the difference between quick calibration and advanced calibration ? <p> When the Vision System fails to function normally , you can do a quick calibration in the DJI GO app , or connect the aircraft to a computer to perform advanced calibration for higher precision . <p> What is the difference between the Mavics Intelligent Vision Positioning System and an Optical Flow Vision Positioning System ? <p> The Mavic combines dual forward and downward vision sensors to realize precision hovering . Therefore , it requires no more than a patterned surface and enough available light to be able to hover stably up to 13m above the ground . Even if the Mavic is unable to identify reference points on the ground , it can still rely on its forward vision sensors to hover . In contrast , an Optical Flow system , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces . <p> An example to show the difference between the two systems is when the aircraft is returning to you where you are standing on a balcony . When flying in over the balcony , drones using Optical Flow will receive data from two data sources that measure its height above the below surface differently one being its height above the ground , and another the height above the balcony . As the data is not compatible , an Optical Flow system may become confused . <p> Another example is when the ground below the drone is covered by vegetation . Plants and trees do not reflect sound as well as other surfaces , causing the Optical Flow systems ultrasonic sensors to be unable to gather altitude data . <p> In conclusion , the Mavic 's Intelligent Vision Positioning System requires fewer inputs and is therefore more robust in its functionality . <p> What is the minimum distance and maximum flight speed at which the Mavic can fly while avoiding obstacles ? <p> The Mavic will automatically avoid obstacles 50ft ( 15m ) in front of it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles is 22mph ( 30kph ) . <p> What are the conditions required for Precision Landing ? <p> Precision Landing is an upgraded version of GPS RTH . It needs a GPS signal strong enough to initiate Precision Landing , so that the Mavic can be navigated back to the vicinity of the take-off point . Then , the aircraft needs to be able to visually recognize the pattern of the ground it took off from , for example cracks or other identifiable patterns . A uniform patch of sand , however , is not suitable for Precision Landing . Finally , the Mavic needs to capture footage of the ground during take-off to record its appearance . This means that you should give the Mavic sufficient time during its ascent , instead of flying away immediately after take-off . <h> Charging <p> Can the Mavics charger charge both its Intelligent Flight Battery and its remote controller ? <p> Yes , it can charge a battery and two other devices simultaneously via USB . However , it will take longer to fully charge the devices . <p> Does the Mavics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligent Flight Battery supports quick charging at nearly 2C , with a maximum charging power of 100W . The rated power of Mavic Battery Charger is 50W , and the rated power of the Mavic Car Charger is 78W . When using the Mavic Advanced Charging Hub with a 100W adapter , the battery can be charged at 100W . <p> What is a Battery Charging Hub ? What is the difference between the two versions of the Mavics Charging Hub ? <p> The two Charging Hubs can both charge up to 4 batteries at one time . In order to fully charge the first battery as quickly as possible , the Intelligent Flight Batteries are charged in sequence according to their power levels , from high to low . This gives you the fastest way of getting all your batteries fully charged.There are two main differences between the two Charging Hubs . First , the standard Charging Hub only supports the Mavics 50W Battery Charger and Mavic Car Charger , while the advanced version also supports the 100W Battery Charger and Car Charger from the Phantom 4 . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery cell to improve charging efficiency . When one batterys charging enters the second-half of its charging phase , the next battery will enter the first-half of its charging phase . With 4 batteries all at 15% , the advanced charger can get 4 batteries fully charged in 140 minutes using the Phantom 4s 100W charger , while the standard version will need 270 minutes with the Mavics 50W charger . <p> What is the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> This adapter can be connected to the Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery , turning it into a power bank . Thanks to its high capacity , an Intelligent Flight Battery at 25% charge can fully charge the Mavics controller , or an iPhone 6 . <p> What is the maximum output current for the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> The adapter has two USB ports which can be used simultaneously . The output voltage is 5V , and the max current is 2A + 2A . <h> Travel Notice <p> How many batteries can I carry in the Mavics Shoulder Bag ? <p> Four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bag , and on in each of the two side pockets .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 180 panel antenna range extender was created and fitted to the Phantom 3 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered <p> Surpassing an industry-standard like the current range of the Phantom 3 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4x more power and the resulting signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 4+ miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203393 3392 @qwx203392 <p> For the most immersive experience , the optional 3-Axis Trinity Head Tracker module can be inserted into a slot on the opposite side of the headset , accessed through a second removable door panel .

It also covers accidents which with this latest generation drone should be easier to avoid . <p> Even though this bird for me is mostly for commercial/Industrial use , I would not think twice about rolling in with the included case on a documentary shoot . <p> The price for all this is worth it even if you 're an advanced hobbiest but do n't want to tinker but would rather fly worry free . <p> ( Posted on 7/28/2016 ) <p> Brent Baker DJI Phantom 4 Review by Alex Keith <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> I did a lot of research looking at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a freind who bought a bare DJI 4 drone form an unknown place . I googled it and I saw Drone World . I inquired and talked to Brent Baker . He listened to me realized what I wanted and recommended the Phantom 4 2.0 kit . I ordered it but there was a slight problem with the extended range kit for it . He let me know it was a little behind and to compensate me for it he gave me overnight shipping for free and a free Military bag upgrade . I received my Drone the next day and there is no way I could be any happier . It is past incredible with the pictures and the things it can do . I even received a follow up call to make sure all was ok and if I needed any help . If you are looking for a Phantom 4 any u buy one anywhere else u are missing out .

Review by Tabor <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> I began my search for a drone a few months ago and was just about to pull the trigger on the P3 long range kit . I am sure glad that I did n't ! The P4 executive kit is awesome !

Review by Robert G <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> My last drone purchase ( the Phantom 3 Pro ) I decided to just buy the drone itself and buy all the accessories down the road as I needed them . I figured DJI would have included all the basics one needs to use there product to its full capacity right ? Wrong . I ca n't even count how many orders I had to make ordering len 's filters , extra batteriess , etc . <p> This time I did it right - and boy am I glad I did . These guys thought of everything without any " filler " products . Everything included I 've already used in the first week . The case is bullet-proof , you really do end up using the 64 GB memory card , and the len 's filters drastically change the video quality outdoors . <p> This is a big jump from the P3 4K I had . A BIG jump . I think buying the exec kit is a part of that . ( I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top the 950 case and insert work without any hassle . The accessories were top notch , all from major brands , so it works out to a great overall value . <p> The magic here is the P4 . The P4 steers way smoother than the 3 . I also notice its hover , land , and takeoff are stabler . The video and live feed looks good . Real good . And the shell and landing gear feel higher grade . Even the underside vents feel firm and smooth . I have n't had much chance to try the autonomous features . Performance wise I 've gotten to 51 MPH which is alot fater than my P3 . Battery life has been in the low 20s , but I fly it pretty hard and that 's 5min more than I averaged before . I have n't compared the range extender to the P3 without , but I got 720p on my HTC sending my P4 across the channel from Corona del Mar into Balboa . <p> ( Not sure I was supposed to do that . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4/15/2016 ) <p> The best purchase ever !

Before purchasing I called to get a little information and I must say their support line is so helpful . They sound willing to help , unlike other companies . Thank you Drone World for the amazing bundle and price especially . I can go on and on , the packaging was so clean and I got more than I could have imagined .

The Phantom 4 quadcopter manages to do what the Phantom 3 did one year earlier : Set a new bar for the prosumer aerial drone . <p> We know what you 're thinking : Phantom 4 vs Phantom 3 ... How much of a leap forward is the Phantom 4 ? Is it worth the extra $200 over the Phantom 3 Professional ? Is it worth investing in a new Drone World Phantom 4 Executive Kit ? ( Answer : Yes ... we 're not biased ... ) <p> Let 's answer those other questions . <h> Its Faster : 45mph+ &amp; Improved Performance <p> The Phantom 4 is considerably faster thanks to more powerful and efficient motors , a low-drag shape , a superior battery , and a new Sport Mode . ( Engadget initially referred to this as a " speed mode . " ) Sport Mode , combined with larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashes the drones full potential , sending more power to its four enhanced motors to give better lift and acceleration . Our own engineer managed to reach 56 MPH ( with some backwind ) , but some Phantom 4 owners have reported speeds of almost 70 MPH ! <p> If you 're interested in the FPV racing experience , the Phantom 4 is a great entry point . The excellent handling and speed make it a serious competitor in the field , one made all the better with the right Phantom 4 FPV goggles .

Where the Phantom 3 Pro eeked out as little as 16 min. of flight , the Phantom 4 battery enables the drone to stay in the air for up to 28 min . The radio and antenna now operate on 23 decibels of gain versus 20dBm for the Phantom 3 , providing a more focused signal . Drone Worlds new Phantom 4 Executive Kit with its recently unveiled Ver . 2.0 Range Extender is expected to push the Phantom 4 range to 5+ miles . Who needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the company says that this over-engineering let 's the system to operate much better than stock in close range environments , allowing for better signal penetration in and around trees , near large clusters of home wifi routers that cause interference , or when flying long distances at low levels . <h> Its Sharper : Superior Camera Quality and Ultra-Smooth Gimbal <p> The Phantom 4 camera and gimbal is similar to that on the Phantom 3 Professional , but with a few tweaks . The Phantom 4 gimbal has a support link mounted into the drone , thus providing sturdier camera-work . Tweaked software gives quicker feedback between pilot and camera , as well as in auto-focus . Like the Phantom 3 Pro , the Phantom 4 camera puts out 12 MP and 4K video ; unlike the Phantom 3 Pro , the Phantom 4 can film at a rate of 120fps in 1080p res . Lastly , an eight-element lens and some nifty sensor mods produce a more dynamic range of colors and saturation than either the Phantom 3 or the pricier Inspire 1 . <p> Check out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below : <p> Some reviewers have been very impressed with the Phantom 4 's updated camera .

" <h> Its Smarter : Obstacle-Avoidance &amp; Smart-Tracking <p> The Phantom 4 brings with it multiple new frontal sensors to help accurately " sense " objects around it . " ActiveTrack " is a new mode that allows a user to follow a subject while managing to avoid obstacles from as far away as 50 ft . A pilot can also send out the Phantom 4 to a point on a map without worrying about the drone hitting a stray branch or power line : the destroyers of many a Phantom 3 .

A dual GPS/GLONASS navigation brings in over 30 satellites to pinpoint the P4s location anywhere on the globe ; about 10 more than the Phantom 3 . A very sturdy body that is modular makes repairs and disassembly easier ( and cheaper ) , too . The " quick-release " propellers have an ingenius design that is foolproof and sets up in 10 seconds versus about a minute respectively compared to the Phantom 3 . <h> Conclusion <p> The Phantom 4 's many new modes , multiple sensors , easy setup , and fool-proof systems make this the perfect drone for beginners . And with its bevy of features , beginners wo n't " outgrow " their Phantom 4s anytime soon .

Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from your fingertips . Combine that with 4x more power and the resulting signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 4 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 
@@22062593 @2062593/ <p> Given DJIs status as the No. 1 drone-maker , its no surprise the Webs abuzz with wonder over its next-gen hardware . Most of that buzz is directed toward the Phantom , the best-selling consumer drone on the market . And the fourth-generation is just about to make its debut . <p> So , just what is the rumor-mill saying about DJIs next-gen wonder ? <p> What We Know <p> DJI will release a preview in New York on March 1st , with retailers taking deliveries that same month A few purported Phantom 4 images have leaked on the Web , showing a larger battery and motors . If the leaked images are genuine , they point to a logical direction : Improved thrust , range , and flight time . The Phantom 3 Professional can fly for 23 min. and up to 35 MPH . Those are solid benchmarks for any next-gen aircraft . Bet that DJI will pass them . <p> What We Hear ... <p> A LOT . Many analysts disregarded the idea of a detachable camera like the Inspire 1 's , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will offer a detachable and upgradeable 4.6K camera . There also seems to be some sort of " panoramic " mode , but no certainty as to whether or not the camera offers 360-degree rotation . No 360 camera signals no dual-remote . <p> It also sounds like the Phantom 4 will be even smarter . Taking cue from Yuneec 's Typhoon H hexacopter , DJI may include an enhanced object-avoidance system for the next Phantom . This will be a cause for celebration to many drone owners who 've seen their beloved machines fall victim to tree branches and power lines . <p> Alleged leaks hint that DJI is making the Phantom even sturdier . The latest prototype seems to sport a more aerodynamic body made from a tougher composite , no doubt addressing complaints from current Phantom owners about the 3 's frailty . Addressing another complaint : easier and bigger access to the battery . The landing gear still looks fixed , meaning pilots will have to yaw their way out of an interrupting landing gear shot . <p> DJI 's made much of its new Lightbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video wirelessly . The new system automatically adjusts channels to prevent latency at up to 1.2 mi. , or 2 km , yielding 30-50% better range and video quality The Lightbridge 2 is cutting-edge tech even by commercial standards ; having it integrated into the consumer-grade Phantom would be a game-changer--just do n't expect SDI signal output ... that 's Inspire territory . <p> The most recent leaks have pointed to DJIs patent for " Systems and Methods for Target Tracking . " Simply put : DJI patented a drone system where a user taps on a subject on his tablet/smartphone screen and the drone tracks that subject . The drone will automatically pitch , yaw , zoom , and focus to maintain a steady and clear shot . If true , this would lift the burden that a drone operator has piloting and filming . ( Interestingly enough , DJI trademarked the nameTapFly on Feb. 8th . ) An auto-adjusting , auto-targeting system done with a simple tap on a screen is a monumental step toward simplifying drone operation for the masses . <p> Another interesting rumor : DJI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated Phantom . DJI 's CEO has been open about his admiration for Apple , and word is he may want to go the Apple route when it comes to naming . ( Think Phantom 3 , 3+ , or Phantom Sense . ) Do n't expect anything clear about this till March 1st . <p> The most we have ? DJI 's teaser video seen above . <p> The teaser video points to a larger battery with grips and some elements from DJI 's " Guidance " system . Here 's DJI 's explanation of Guidance taken straight from its website : <p> Guidance is a revolutionary visual sensing system . With a powerful processing core , integrated visual cameras , ultrasonic sensors , and the most advanced computer vision algorithms in the world , Guidance protects your platform and gives you a new level of safety and confidence in flight . Guidance includes five sensor modules and one central processor . <p> Look closely at the above video ( around 0:25 ) and you will spot what appears to be a mesh screen ventilation cover for the taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thrust . ) Also notice the holes at the end of the arm tips ( about 0:35 ) , just around the motors , which may be for better prop guards . If so , this would be in response to the failure of many prior aftermarket guards . <p> What of price ? The number bandied about--and it 's unclear for which variant--has been around $1,400 . That 's $700 more than the Phantom 3 Pro , which points to the 4 as being an addition to ( not a replacement of ) the current range . <p> In the Meantime <p> Do n't  discount the Phantom 3 yet . DJIs bread-and-butter drone is still the segment leader , consistently ranking at the top of comparison tests . It also accounts for the overwhelming majority of the consumer drone sales , and will likely continue to for quite some time .

Nicknamed " Karma , " the media have hyped the upcoming aircraft to almost messianic levels . And for good reason : GoPro defined the action cam and dominated the market in just a few years , accounting for over 80% of the action cams sold . No matter which way you look at it , the GoPro Karma is a big deal to a lot of people . <p> Just what do we know about the Karma and business around it ? Let 's find out . <p> Investors Rejoice ! <p> Sales for consumer drones soared almost nine times over between 2013 to 2015 . Analysts project over an 80% hike in sales for 2016 alone , jumping from a half-billion to almost a full billion units . Consumer drones are affordable , ranging between $500 and $2,000 , and getting easier to use . Da-Jiang Innovations ( DJI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building seven out of every ten consumer drones sold . The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) reported about 300,000 registrations for consumer drones in one month .

The drones terrific range and altitude give amateur pilots and career videographers alike incredible footage . That 's a ripe market for GoPro to enter . <p> And enter it must . GoPro suffered in 2015 because of troubled product launches . Investment analysts see the the Karma as a chance to rejuvenate the GoPro brand , expand the drone market , and maybe even redefine it . If so , expect to see the GoPro IPO soar . <p> Target : Phantom <p> The DJI Phantom Series is the standard in consumer drones .

Launched in March , the Phantom 4 offers advanced obstacle-avoidance technology , wider range , and even greater performance , hitting a top speed of 45 MPH . The Phantom 4 's many " smart features " led The Verge to declare it " the first drone for everyone . " <p> How will the GoPro Karma stack to DJIs compact phenom ? <p> Quad Design <p> Many bloggers have speculated that the GoPro Karma will resemble the Hexo+ ( or " Hexo Plus " ) , a French hexacopter drone compatible with GoPro cameras .

Some industry insiders are claiming a 30+ MPH follow speed . If true , the Karma will be a step toward truly autonomous drone tech . 
@@22062598 @2062598/ <p> With the arrival of the DJI Spark in May 2017 , DJI introduced a drone even smaller than their Mavic Pro , equipped with plenty of exciting features . As an ultra portable , lightweight drone , the Spark is groundbreaking in more ways than one . DJI has fashioned the Sparkwith a high quality camera , 16 minutes of flight time , and innovative gesture controls . The Spark is so small , it actually makes the Mavic Pro look big by comparison - a drone widely praised for its compact size . A DJI Spark vs DJI Mavic Pro comparison is important for newcomers to DJI and longtime DJI drone owners , which is why we 've put this together . <p> Ultimately , the Spark crushes all non-DJI competition across the board . Join us as we explore how the Spark and Mavic Pro are alike and dissimilar in our breakdown , and be sure to also review how these drones compare to the Yuneec Breeze , with our three way comparison . <h> Size and Weight <p> It 's important to first evaluate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spark and the Mavic Pro are designed to travel well and be ready to fly in seconds , rather than minutes . The Spark weighs 0.66 pounds ( 300g ) with the battery , while the Mavic Pro weighs a pound more at 1.62 pounds ( 734 g ) . With fixed arms , the Spark can not fold up , and is therefore slightly wider than the Mavic when folded . At its most compact , the Mavic Pro is slightly smaller than the Spark , with dimensions of 3.2(H)x3.2(W)x7.8(L) inches ( Mavic ) and 2.1(H)x5.6(W)x5.6(L) inches ( Spark ) respectively . When fully extended and ready to fly , the Mavic is 3.5 x12x11 inches , approximately double in size . <p> Winner : Spark , because of its small size and weight , although it does lose points for having fixed arms . <h> Camera <p> The Spark camera is nearly as good as the Mavic , with Spark capable of FHD : 1920+1080 at 30 frames per second with 12 MP photographs . The Mavic records 4K video at 30 frames per second and photos with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared to the 3-axis gimbal of the Mavic . The two drones match up in terms of sensor size , sporting a 1/2.3 CMOS . In terms of aperture , the Mavic is the better choice , boasting f/2.2 while the Spark has f/2.6 . This is significant because the wider aperture of the Mavic allows for more light , resulting in better , brighter photography in low light conditions . Also of note is the gesture control on the Spark that allows drone pilots to take a picture without the use of a dedicated controller or their phone . A simple camera gesture with their hands will snap a photo . Last but not least , the Mavic Pro camera can be adjusted prior to shooting , including different color profiles and style settings , while Spark pilots are restricted to the default camera settings . <p> Winner : Mavic . With the video resolution advantage , bettergimbal , better aperture , and the inclusion of other camera adjustments , Mavic is a sure winner in this category . <p> Spark <p> Mavic Pro <p> Sensor Size <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP and FHD 1920x1080 <p> 12.35 MP and 4K Video <p> Shutter Type <p> Electronic <p> Electronic <p> Aperture <p> F/2.6 <p> F/2.2 <p> Max Video Bitrate <p> 24 mbps <p> 60 mpbs <p> Camera Image <h> Flight Time <p> Being a mini drone , the DJI Spark utilizes a smaller battery than the Mavic Pro , and therefore flies for a shorter amount of time , clocking in at 16 minutes . This duration puts it at the front of the pack for flight time among comparable mini drones . Meanwhile , the Mavic can fly up to 27 minutes . For comparison 's sake , the Spark battery is 1480 mAh while the Mavic battery is 3830 mAh . The Mavic is so aerodynamically inclined that it flies longer while flying than it does hovering . One final element worth mentioning is how both drones charge : the Spark uses a handy dock that you place the drone in to begin charging , while the Mavic Intelligent Flight battery must be removed and placed in the charging station alone . ( All of the details for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mavic Pro Specs , Spark Specs ) <p> Winner : Mavic Pro easily outstrips the Spark , besting its flight time with ease . <h> Flight Modes <p> The flight modes built into the Spark are where it stands out when evaluating Spark vs Mavic Pro . The Mavic Pro has all of the traditional Intelligent Flight Modes DJI is known for , including Active Track , TapFly , and Terrain Follow . The Spark has all of those too , and is also compatible with the DJI Goggles for FPV flight like the Mavic . But the real eye-catching capabilites of the Spark are the brand new QuickShot flight modes DJI crafted for it . Currently the Mavic does not have these modes , but we suspect a firmware update could be coming down the pipeline that would change that . <p> Rocket- Ascend with the camera pointing downward , revealing a unique perspective from above . <p> Dronie- Fly backward and upward , with the camera locked on your subject , creating an epic shot that captures the big perspective of the world around the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame , as the Spark automatically flies a circle around it . <p> Helix- Starts close to the subject before flying up , away , and around in larger and larger circles . <p> The PalmControl gestures are unique to the DJI Spark , giving pilots control with their hands after first being identified through facial recognition . This technology is incredible to watch , and illustrates how DJI innovation continues to be a high priority . Upon confirmation through the facial recognition , the Spark can be controlled by moving your palm up , down , left , right , backwards , and forwards . A camera motion with your hands engages the camera , taking a picture of you and your surroundings . Wave one hand to active ActiveTrack , which means the Spark will track you as you move around . Wave two hands and the Spark will come back to you and identify your palm before landing precisely on it . Watch the video below to see these phenomenal gesture controls in action : <p> Winner : Spark . Like the camera modes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro , giving it the victory . <h> Transmission Distance <p> The two drones definitely differ in their respective remote controller transmission distances . With a mobile device , their distances are identical : 109 yards in distance and 54 yards in height . Using the dedicated remote controller and Wifi the Spark can travel 1.2 miles . On the other hand , the Mavic Pro transmits up to 4.3 miles thanks to OccuSync technology , and can even fly beyond this distance with our Maxx Mod Remote Controller . The difference with a controller between the two drones is substantial -- the 1.2 mile range is reminiscent of the lackluster performance of the Phantom 3 Standard . Many everyday field tests indicate a drop , with the Spark reaching between 1/4 and 1/2 of a mile in urban areas with mild interference . <p> Winner : Mavic Pro . By virtue of its stronger , robust OccuSync technology , the Mavic can fly much greater distances . <p> Sensors <p> Both the DJI Spark and DJI Mavic Pro come equipped with obstacle sensing , but the Mavic Pro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mph , the Spark will detect objects in front of it between 1-16 feet . The Mavic Pro can travel up to 22 mph while detecting objects between 2-49 feet in front of it .

This is another category in which the Mavic Pro is simply better , using components that allow for bolstered distances in obstacle avoidance . <p> Price <p> This is a very important factor for customers old and new . The Spark is considerably cheaper than the Mavic Pro , costing just $499 without the controller that comes in the Fly More Combo . Conversely , the Mavic Pro standard package costs $999 .

@@22062601 @2062601/ <h> DJI Mavic Pro vs . GoPro Karma Comparison <p> With so many drones flooding the market these days , it can be hard to know which one to choose . From the gold standard , DJI , to the camera experts at GoPro , there are many things to consider . Fortunately , we 're here to help you wade through the decision making process and secure a better understanding of the pros and cons of the top drones for sale today . <p> As a premier high end dealer of DJI drones , we here at Drone World know a thing or two about this amazing flying phenoms . Allow us to break down the differences and similarities between two competing drones : The DJI Mavic Pro and the GoPro Karma . <h> Introduction <p> It 's important to have some background , to create a firm base of knowledge to conceptualize these two drones and where they come from . DJI ( based in China , full name : DaJiang Innovations Science and Technology Company ) is currently the global leader in drone engineering , owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since 2006 they 've crafted great products , and their stranglehold on the drone industry has only grown in the recent years . Their Phantom series of drones are some of the most beloved drones on the planet , plus they continue to create massively popular high end models like Matrice and the Inspire 2 . Most recently , the DJI Mavic Pro made a splash in November 2016 , the first drone of a smaller size created by DJI with racing drone-esque proportions and speed . Undoubtedly , the Mavic Pro represents DJI 's latest venture into compact drones , made to be folded up to approximately the size of a water bottle and carried with ease for a fly-anywhere mentality . <p> Meanwhile , GoPro is American-born , getting its start with wrist-based camera technology designed for taking photos during action sports like surfing , snowboarding , skydiving , etc . When they unveiled video capability in 2006 with their flagship HERO GoPro camera , they quickly became a household name in action sports-based photography . For the last decade the GoPro name has been synonymous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique perspectives ; most notably from a first-person viewpoint . <p> Another bit of interesting background surrounds the inception of the GoPro Karma drone itself . Initially GoPro wished to collaborate with DJI , entering into discussions in 2014 to create a private label model . Once those negotiations fell through , GoPro sought the assistance of 3D Robotics for a similar partnership but this time for 3DR 's flight controllers . Unfortunately 3DR failed to meet deadlines , resulting in GoPro taking complete control of the development halfway through 2015 . <h> How Are They Alike ? <p> In comparing these two drones , we felt it was important to evaluate how they mirror one another before diving into how they are dissimilar . <p> Speed : The two are comparable in overall speed , with the Mavic taking a slight edge . <p> Mavic : 40 mph <p> Karma : 35 mph <p> Weight : Although the Mavic Pro becomes more compact when folded , overall these two drones are in the same range for weight . <p> Mavic : 1.64 pounds <p> Karma : 2.2 pounds <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack up pretty close to one another . The Mavic has three kinds of tracking shots : Spotlight , Profile , and Trace , while the Karma counters with Cable Car , Orbit , and Reveal . With the Mavic you can also use gestures and Terrain Follow mode , which keeps the drone at a defined height , ascending and descending as you move . <p> Flying Modes for Mavic- <p> Spotlight : Your subject is the center of attention , no matter where the drone flies . <p> Profile : The Mavic flies beside the subject , moving parallel and keeping the same distance away from the subject , even if they move toward it or away . <p> Trace : Mavic will follow behind your subject as they move away , even if they change direction . If they move towards the Mavic , it will fly backwards ( but only if you 've enabled BackwardsFly ) . Plus , while it is flying you can circle around your subject by hitting left or right on the control stick . <p> Terrain Follow : Keeps the Mavic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Preset shots for Karma- <p> Dronie shot : comes up close , zooms out , seen in a lot of drone videos <p> Cable car : goes from point A to point B , while focusing on a moving subject parallel <p> Orbit : focus on a subject while orbiting around it <p> Reveal : camera follows the ground before panning up towards horizon <p> How Are They Different : <p> Flight distance : Mavic 8 miles , Karma 1.8 miles <p> This category can not be understated , the Mavic Pro quite simply demolishes the Karma in its flight distance . The FCC compliant distance is 4.3 miles , which means nearly every Mavic Pro pilot wo n't be reaching 8 miles , but it 's nice to know that it can ! <p> Ascent height : 3.1 miles , Karma 1.98 miles <p> Similar to the flight distance , the Mavic wins the ascent height category , climbing higher than its GoPro counterpart . A mile higher can make a huge difference , spelling the difference between flying around a mountain or flying around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mavic has the edge in flight time , but only just . Mavic Pro owners can tell you to take the 27 minute threshold with a grain of salt , because typical flight times tend to hover around 20 , 21 minutes tops . One intriguing note is that the Mavic can fly longer while moving due to its well-designed aerodynamics . <p> Gimbal : Mavic : -90 to +30 Karma : -90 to 0 <p> Novice drone pilots wo n't bat an eye at the gimbal difference , but we point it out for a reason . The Mavic can tilt its camera upwards to 30 , which it does because while flying the aircraft leans forward . In this away it allows for an uninterrupted shot free of any visual impairment . <p> We ca n't forget about price , which is where Mavic shines once again . At just $999 , it is a full $200 cheaper than the GoPro Karma with Hero 5 camera , which sells for $1100 . If you already own a Hero camera , the Karma alone will come to $800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second or third battery is almost a necessity ; but again the Mavic bests the Karma , selling for $10 cheaper at $89 compared to $99 . <p> Another factor is the responsiveness of the drone , of which the Mavic is again the victor . The argument could be made that the Karma has a nice smooth video because of its reduced responsivity , but the downside of that is a drone that is slow to react . A drone that is slow to react is a drone that is prone to accidents , whether the pilot runs into sudden high winds , an unexpected obstacle , or some other issue .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a sleek design featuring white-on-white simplicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created and fitted to the Phantom 3 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered <p> Surpassing an industry-standard like the current range of the Phantom 3 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from your fingertips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3395 @qwx203395 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203374 3373 @qwx203373 3391 @qwx203391 <p> POWERFUL MOBILE APPComplete power is at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all from your mobile device . 3377 @qwx203377 3375 @qwx203375 3359 @qwx203359 3401 @qwx203401 3403 @qwx203403 3406 @qwx203406 <p> *Support for additional Android devices available as testing and development continues <p> Phantom 3 Advanced : <p> Part Number : CP.PT.000160 <p> GTIN : 00784672983280 3346 @qwx203346 <p> Please note : tablet is not included <h> Reviews <h> Customer Reviews ( 4 ) <p> Great product .

Kit has changed slightly ( I got 3 batteries and extra plastic propellers , a 16GB card ) but it has also dropped in price ( I paid $2200 ) . The kit is very nice : extras are nice , compact charger , nice carbon fiber props . The case is super heavy duty . Caution with the case - if you leave the props on ( possible to still fit it in case ) it is easy to close the case on the props and destroy them ( lost first set that way ) . I suggest either taking the props off every time or being very careful when closing the case . Also no good place to store prop guards in the case , just sort of need to lay them on top .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a sleek design featuring white-on-white simplicity and style , the resulting 180 panel antenna range extender was created and fitted to the Phantom 4 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom 4 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from your fingertips . Combine that with 4x more power and the resulting signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 4 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites.

Do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was watching reviews and unsure if I wanted to spend the money on the Mavic but it does not disappoint . It is fun to fly and even if you do n't have any drone experience it 's still easily piloted . Video and Photo quality is amazing and you have easy access to review the shots in the DJI app . Also , the Fly More package is worth the extra money too . Having extra batteries and the ability to put them all on the Multi-charger is very convenient .

( Posted on 4/22/2017 ) <p> Amazing drone ! Review by KonaSwede <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> After having had a few other drones , from toy beginner drones to the very capable 3DR Solo , I decided to buy the Mavic Pro here . Because of its advanced features and small travel friendly size . The built quality is amazing , its solid , yet light weight . And very innovative , how the arms fold out . The various flight modes are more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable and hovers better than any other drone I 've seen . Various camera settings are great for the more advanced photographer . Contrary to most other drones , its also complete and needs no modifications . No change of GPS , antennas and so on . But get an ND filter , since aperture is set to a large 2.2 . I cant wait to go traveling with mine . A regular drone would be to big to take around the world , but the Mavic will be a great travel companion . ( Posted on 4/17/2017 ) <p> Question : Can a tablet be used instead of a phone ? I realize it may not fit between the control grips . It would need to be velcroe 'd to the top surface . <p> 21 <p> Question by : Robert Stewart on 10/06/2016 <p> Answer : You can use both Apple and Android devices so long as for Apple IOS is 8.0 or later , for Android software must be 4.1.2 or later . You can use phone or small tablet . The Mavic will fit up-to the following dimensions : Thickness Supported:6.5-8.5mm Max length : 160mm

 @qwx203390 3345 @qwx203345 3389 @qwx203389 <p> The VideoMicro is a compact microphone designed to improve the audio quality of your videos . It incorporates a high-quality cardiod condenser microphone capsule for great quality audio recordings when used with the DJI Osmo <h> Features <h> Details 3346 @qwx203346 <h> Reviews <h> Customer Reviews ( 1 ) <p> Smooth as butter ! Review by BM <p> Quality <p> Price <p> Value <p> I recently received my DJI Osmo Mobile gimbal in the mail and put it to work . Amazingly smooth footage ! Many of my subscribers on my Instagram gave good comments and some people thought I was actually using a drone to film . I 'm still in the process of learning how to use it effectively but right away I 've been able to film some great footage with my iPhone 6 ( soon to get a 7 ) . These things are currently a bit pricy but compared to the quality you get these things are very accessible to consumers . ( Posted on 1/25/2017 ) <h> FUNCTIONS <p> Is Osmo Mobile able to hold any phone ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 8.4mm thick . This covers most phones currently available , from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 6s Plus and Android phones of similar sizes . The type of phone being used will also have an effect , for instance if the phone has an additional case , special lenses or additional side buttons . <p> How to power on Osmo Mobile in my first use ? <p> Step 1 , activate the battery first before powering on Osmo Mobile , connect the charger cable to the handheld gimbal to charge and activate the battery.Step 2 , power on Osmo Mobile , connect it to the DJI GO app , follow the instructions to connect and activate Osmo Mobile then you can start to use it . <p> What is the hardware requirement of my phone when using the Osmo Mobile ? <p> The Osmo Mobile connects with a phone via Bluetooth 4.0 , so Bluetooth 4.0 is required in your phone , most smart phones made after 2015 support Bluetooth 4.0 . <p> Can I use ActiveTrack in any operation mode i.e. Standard , Portrait , Underslung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes except Portrait Mode due to the limited width of the cameras view . When shooting in Portrait Mode , a fast moving subject will move out of shot easily , which will affect the final recording . As a result , ActiveTrack is disabled for Portrait Mode . <p> Can I set the ActiveTrack speed ? How fast can it move ? <p> No . Tracking speed can not be set . The Osmo Mobile will adjust its movement according to the speed of the object , so you do not need to set its speed according to how you use it . The fastest it can track is the same as its Max Controllable Speed , 120/s . <p> Is ActiveTrack compatible with all phones ? <p> No . ActiveTrack is not compatible with certain phones ( i.e. iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 ) due to limitations within the phones . <p> Does the different resolution of front and rear cameras affect ActiveTrack performance ? <p> No . ActiveTrack is not affected by camera resolution . <h> HANDLE <p> Can I add an external microphone to the 3.5mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the gimbal uses your phone to record video and sound , the 3.5mm Stereo Jack on the handle of Osmo Mobile does not support microphones . Instead , its been converted into a Charging/Upgrade Port . By connecting your Osmo Mobile to an external adaptor/power bank through the Power Cable , you can charge your Osmo Mobile any time . This jack is also used the Osmo Mobiles firmware upgrades . <p> Are the Control Panel and trigger still the same as the Osmo ? <p> Yes . The Osmo Mobile uses the same handle design as the Osmo . You can use the trigger for multiple controls for both the gimbal and camera hold it down for locking the gimbals direction , double tap for re-centering . Unlike other Osmo cameras , tapping the trigger three times does not rotate the phone . Instead , it switches your phone from front camera to rear camera . <p> Can I zoom when using Osmo Mobile ? <p> Yes . Pressing the trigger and moving the joystick upward and downward will control digital zoom , but this may affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Osmo Mobile with a Zenmuse X3 ? <p> No . The Osmo Mobile is sold as a complete unit . The gimbal is therefore non-detachable . <h> DJI GO <p> Can I control shutter speed and ISO etc. from my smartphone ? <p> Yes . DJI GO allows you to control Shutter Speed , ISO and White Balance from your phone . This function is only supported on iOS devices . <p> When recording video , can I record at whatever resolution I have set inside the DJI Go app ? <p> The DJI Go app will select the best resolution based on the status of your phone . If you want to change the videos resolution , go to DJI GO &gt; Camera Settings and change the related settings . Maximim video and photo resolution depends on the phone used , for example the iPhone 6s can shoot at 4K . <p> Can I use the charging cable for other electronic products like my phone and computer ? <p> No . <p> Can other USB cables work with my Osmo Mobile ? <p> No . Please always use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upgrading . <h> BLUETOOTH <p> Does the Osmo Mobile connect to my phone via Wi-Fi just like the Osmo ? <p> No . The Osmo Mobile connects to your phone via Bluetooth with a few easy taps in the DJI GO app . <p> How is Bluetooth connection better than Wi-Fi ? <p> The connection speed of Bluetooth is faster than Wi-Fi . Once your phone is connected to the Osmo Mobile , it will automatically connect again the next time you use the same phone . <p> How do I know which device is mine when there are several Osmo Mobiles around my phone ? <p> We give every Osmo Mobile a unique serial number , which is located on the left of the phone holder . You can easily locate your device by finding the serial number . You can also change the name of your device in the DJI GO app . <h> ACCESSORIES <p> Does the Osmo Mobile support all Osmo accessories ? <p> The Osmo Mobile has the same rosette mount as the Osmo meaning that accessories are interchangeable for both . We recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extension Rod with the Tripod for longer exposures or Motion Timelapses . <p> Can I attach an external lens to my phone when using Osmo Mobile ? <p> Yes . However external lenses may affect the balance of the gimbal . Large , heavy lenses are not recommended .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a sleek design featuring white-on-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extender was created and fitted to the Phantom 3 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered <p> Surpassing an industry-standard like the current range of the Phantom 3 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3395 @qwx203395 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203374 3373 @qwx203373 3391 @qwx203391 <p> POWERFUL MOBILE APPComplete power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , all from your mobile device . 3377 @qwx203377 3375 @qwx203375 3359 @qwx203359 3401 @qwx203401 3403 @qwx203403 3406 @qwx203406 <p> *Support for additional Android devices available as testing and development continues <p> Phantom 3 Advanced : <p> Part Number : CP.PT.000160 <p> GTIN : 00784672983280 3346 @qwx203346 <p> Please note : tablet is not included <h> Reviews <h> Customer Reviews ( 7 ) <p> Fantastic .

The day it came he was home so I could n't help myself and gave it to him . I chose the Phantom 4 because of it 's features . Self take off , self land , obstacle avoidance . See my husband is not techy at all and I hoped he would n't have any problems learning how to fly . Plus I needed him to learn how to fly it before we went to Fla. and he dropped it in the ocean . We took it out of the box and was really pleased to see how durable the case is and the quality of the Drone seems commercial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app to the phone and went for our first flight . It was amazing , it did a gps lock and lift off was ready . We tried the beginner mode first and immediately switched to regular fly mode . We did set out height perimeter , calibrate the compass and turn on sensors after watching the youtube video of how to operate it . Our first real flight was awesome my husband had no problem and it comes right back to the gps lock to self land . He is very happy , then he saw the receipt . I said sorry ca n't send it back we flew it and he said I would n't send it back for anything I love it . Enough said ! We look forward to making many wonderful memories with our drone and I already have my first Aerial shot of the house . The camera and video images are very high quality .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a sleek design featuring white-on-white simplicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created and fitted to the Phantom 3 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered <p> Surpassing an industry-standard like the current range of the Phantom 3 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from your fingertips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3395 @qwx203395 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203374 3373 @qwx203373 3391 @qwx203391 <p> POWERFUL MOBILE APPComplete power is at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all from your mobile device . 3377 @qwx203377 3375 @qwx203375 3359 @qwx203359 3401 @qwx203401 3403 @qwx203403 3406 @qwx203406 <p> *Support for additional Android devices available as testing and development continues <p> Phantom 3 Advanced : <p> Part Number : CP.PT.000160 <p> GTIN : 00784672983280 3346 @qwx203346 <p> Please note : tablet is not included <h> Reviews <h> Customer Reviews ( 17 ) <p> i love this drone Review by glenn <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> you can not get more for your money than this drone it is the best . this than halls ass in the air . you will not be disappointment I guarantee you that ( Posted on 4/19/2016 ) <p> Excellent Deal Review by Andy <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> After doing some extensive research online and then calling the guys at Drone World , I ended up choosing to purchase the Phantom 3 Advanced kit .

Flight time is good but would like to see better and longer distances . <p> I 'm totally satisfied with my product . The Phantom 3 speaks for itself . The case is just what I needed . It even has space for other small accessories , and it is easy to travel with . ( Posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review by Kelvin <p> Quality <p> Price <p> Value <p> - The case is well designed and made . The outer meartial feels durable , the inner shell soft and well padded . The overall case is well formed and seams look carefully done . I bought this to be used with the Western Digital Passport II ( black ) WDXMSxxxx drives ( 5.1 x3.1 x0.6 ) and the case is a tad too big for it . The drive has a little too much wiggle room despite the elastic strap inside . I imagine the case will be better fitted for slightly bigger drives , e.g. Seagate 's ST9xxxxx1U2-RK.VA:F 1.9.221171please wait ... VA:F 1.9.221171 ( from 0 votes ) ( Posted on 7/15/2015 )

The product was easy to assemble , the flying is great . I recently flew it in the BVI when the tropical storm was afloat and I was able to handle it pretty well .

Its new OcuSync transmission system has a longer transmission range and 1080p resolution . Due to its larger size , the Phantom 4 has a higher maximum speed and can withstand stronger winds . <p> Does the folding mechanism wear out and will it need replacing ? <p> The folding mechanism has been tested to last at least 5000 folds . It is unlikely that it will wear out during the Mavics lifetime . <p> What 's difference of camera between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The two cameras have the same features , but the Mavics camera has a smaller FOV , is able to focus as closely as 0.5m and can be rotated 90 for portrait shots and selfies . The Phantom 4s larger FOV makes it better suited for landscape imaging . <h> Remote Controller and Wi-Fi <p> What is the difference between using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartphone to control it via Wi-Fi ? <p> The Mavic remote controller uses DJIs OcuSync transmission technology , giving it an increased range of up to 4.3mi ( 7km ) in open areas without interference , FCC compliant . When using a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi , the controllable range is 80m , and maximum altitude is 50m , making it suitable for short-range shots like selfies and for setting up ActiveTrack . You can also download photos and videos directly from the Mavic to your mobile device via Wi-Fi . By sliding the Control Mode switch on the right hand side of the aircraft , you can choose easily between Wi-FI and RC mode depending on which transmission type you need . <p> How do I switch between the two controller modes ? <p> First , make sure that your aircraft is powered off . Then , open the small cover on the right hand side of the aircraft body . Slide the switch to the left to enable Wi-Fi control , or to the right to use the remote controller . <p> What sizes of smartphone can fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller can fit smartphones between 6.5-8.5mm thick and up to 160mm long , without a phone case . Phones and tablets larger than this do not fit the remote controllers device holder . <p> Can I use a regular USB cable to connect my phone and remote controller ? <p> Yes , you can . However , for the best user experience , we recommend that you use a dedicated Mavic RC ( Remote Controller ) Cable to connect your phone . <p> The phone on the left has a standard Micro USB Connector ; the phone on the right has a Reverse Micro USB Connector.The Remote Controller Cable ( Standard Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : Samsung , Huawei , Motorola and more . The Remote Controller Cable ( Reverse Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : HTC , Mi , OPPO and more . For Sony , VIVO , and other brands , phone compatibility differs by model . Please take care to choose the correct type for your phone . <p> What Remote Controller Cables are included with the Mavic upon purchase ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightning connector and one with a standard Micro-USB connector . <p> What is the default Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> For security purposes , each Mavic has its own SSID and password that can be found on a sticker on one of the forearms of the aircraft and inside the battery compartment . For your first use , you can scan the QR code with the DJI GO app to connect to the aircraft* , or enter the password manually under your phones Wi-Fi settings . ( *Only available for Android devices ) . <p> Can I use other QR code apps to scan the QR code and connect to the aircraft via Wi-Fi ? <p> No . You must use the DJI GO app to connect to your aircraft . <p> How can I set the Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> Connect to your Mavic via Wi-Fi and then enter Camera View . Now enter Wi-Fi settings to manually set the SSID and password . <p> How do I reset the Wi-Fi password back to default ? <p> Turn on the Mavic in Wi-Fi mode , press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the benefit of dual-band Wi-Fi ? <p> The 2.4G Wi-Fi frequency was developed a long time ago , 5G Wi-Fi is newer . As 2.4G is older , more devices use this frequency , making it more likely to suffer from interference . 5G is less prone to interference as there are less 5G devices , but not all phones support the 5G frequency . You can switch between these two frequency bands in the Wi-Fi Settings menu in the DJI GO app . <h> Propulsion <p> Do I have to take the propellers off when in transit ? <p> No . Just fold the propellers and you are good to go . <p> What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight ? <p> Once the rotors start spinning , the centrifugal force will automatically push the propellers into the correct position , so you do n't  need to worry about not having unfolded them perfectly . <p> The Mavics motors are not all on the same plane . Will this affect its flight performance ? <p> No . <p> What 's the highest level of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level 5 wind , also called a fresh breeze . This is defined as wind speeds of 1924mph ( 2938kph ) . <p> How far can the Mavic fly on a single charge ? <p> In calm weather and under ideal conditions , the Mavic can fly up to 8 miles ( 13km ) at 31 mph ( 50 kph ) . Real-world performance will vary though , so we urge you to monitor your battery level at all times . <p> Why does the Mavic have a longer flight time than hover time ? <p> Thanks to its rotor system optimized for forward flight and its aerodynamic design , when flying at the optimum speed for energy consumption , the Mavic consumes less energy then it does hovering . This is why it is able to give you a 27 minute flight time , while its hover time is 24 minutes . <h> Video Transmission <p> What is the main benefit of the OcuSync video transmission system ? <p> OcuSync has a range of up to 4.3 miles ( 7 km ) with improved resistance to interference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream footage to you at 1080p resolution and also allows photo and video downloads at 40Mb/s . <p> 160ms from the Mavics camera to your device screen under ideal conditions . <h> Vision <p> What is the difference between quick calibration and advanced calibration ? <p> When the Vision System fails to function normally , you can do a quick calibration in the DJI GO app , or connect the aircraft to a computer to perform advanced calibration for higher precision . <p> What is the difference between the Mavics Intelligent Vision Positioning System and an Optical Flow Vision Positioning System ? <p> The Mavic combines dual forward and downward vision sensors to realize precision hovering . Therefore , it requires no more than a patterned surface and enough available light to be able to hover stably up to 13m above the ground . Even if the Mavic is unable to identify reference points on the ground , it can still rely on its forward vision sensors to hover . In contrast , an Optical Flow system , requires information from ultrasonic sensors to supplement its view of patterned surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two systems is when the aircraft is returning to you where you are standing on a balcony . When flying in over the balcony , drones using Optical Flow will receive data from two data sources that measure its height above the below surface differently one being its height above the ground , and another the height above the balcony . As the data is not compatible , an Optical Flow system may become confused . <p> Another example is when the ground below the drone is covered by vegetation . Plants and trees do not reflect sound as well as other surfaces , causing the Optical Flow systems ultrasonic sensors to be unable to gather altitude data . <p> In conclusion , the Mavic 's Intelligent Vision Positioning System requires fewer inputs and is therefore more robust in its functionality . <p> What is the minimum distance and maximum flight speed at which the Mavic can fly while avoiding obstacles ? <p> The Mavic will automatically avoid obstacles 50ft ( 15m ) in front of it . The maximum speed at which the Mavic is able to avoid obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions required for Precision Landing ? <p> Precision Landing is an upgraded version of GPS RTH . It needs a GPS signal strong enough to initiate Precision Landing , so that the Mavic can be navigated back to the vicinity of the take-off point . Then , the aircraft needs to be able to visually recognize the pattern of the ground it took off from , for example cracks or other identifiable patterns . A uniform patch of sand , however , is not suitable for Precision Landing . Finally , the Mavic needs to capture footage of the ground during take-off to record its appearance . This means that you should give the Mavic sufficient time during its ascent , instead of flying away immediately after take-off . <h> Charging <p> Can the Mavics charger charge both its Intelligent Flight Battery and its remote controller ? <p> Yes , it can charge a battery and two other devices simultaneously via USB . However , it will take longer to fully charge the devices . <p> Does the Mavics battery support quick charging ? <p> Yes . The Mavics Intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum charging power of 100W . The rated power of Mavic Battery Charger is 50W , and the rated power of the Mavic Car Charger is 78W . When using the Mavic Advanced Charging Hub with a 100W adapter , the battery can be charged at 100W . <p> What is a Battery Charging Hub ? What is the difference between the two versions of the Mavics Charging Hub ? <p> The two Charging Hubs can both charge up to 4 batteries at one time . In order to fully charge the first battery as quickly as possible , the Intelligent Flight Batteries are charged in sequence according to their power levels , from high to low . This gives you the fastest way of getting all your batteries fully charged.There are two main differences between the two Charging Hubs . First , the standard Charging Hub only supports the Mavics 50W Battery Charger and Mavic Car Charger , while the advanced version also supports the 100W Battery Charger and Car Charger from the Phantom 4 . Second , the advanced version will balance the voltage of each battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters the second-half of its charging phase , the next battery will enter the first-half of its charging phase . With 4 batteries all at 15% , the advanced charger can get 4 batteries fully charged in 140 minutes using the Phantom 4s 100W charger , while the standard version will need 270 minutes with the Mavics 50W charger . <p> What is the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> This adapter can be connected to the Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery , turning it into a power bank . Thanks to its high capacity , an Intelligent Flight Battery at 25% charge can fully charge the Mavics controller , or an iPhone 6 . <p> What is the maximum output current for the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> The adapter has two USB ports which can be used simultaneously . The output voltage is 5V , and the max current is 2A + 2A . <h> Travel Notice <p> How many batteries can I carry in the Mavics Shoulder Bag ? <p> Four . One mounted on the Mavic , one at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side pockets .

" Taking a page out of the German car manufacturer 's book , Drone World went to Europe for its ultimate flying machine . Drone World 's Range Extender Panel Antenna was developed in partnership with the European Union Association of Technology and leading US suppliers . Using commerical-grade , gold-plated wiring , while taking cues from BMW with a sleek design featuring white-on-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extender was created and fitted to the Phantom 3 remote controller for unrivaled connection between craft and pilot . <p> Aerospace Engineered <p> Surpassing an industry-standard like the current range of the Phantom 3 is no easy task . You 'll need the brightest minds and engineers in the business . Drone World spared no expense , bringing in a head engineer with aerospace industry expertise and FAA credentials . <p> The result is a range extender system that does not require a HAM radio license , while being designed with the most cutting edge technology available . That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting signal penetrates through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3395 @qwx203395 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203374 3373 @qwx203373 3391 @qwx203391 <p> POWERFUL MOBILE APPComplete power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , all from your mobile device . 3377 @qwx203377 3375 @qwx203375 3359 @qwx203359 3401 @qwx203401 3403 @qwx203403 3406 @qwx203406

The video quality is amazing and it is also quiet faster than I expected . There are couple of small negatives that I encountered . First of all phantom 3 is LOUD . Also do n't expect to fly it indoors much . The wind it creates is much stronger than what you expect and you can easily break things or even crash you drone indoor . Especially if you are a beginner and are flying in smaller rooms . Also the bag that I came in is perfect . Light , Spacious , and well Built .

Love having three batteries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to fly and reliable . Absolutely in love with the video quality as well ! The only thing I do n't like is that it automatically returns " home " when the battery hits about 25% . If you 're just on a short flight within 100 yards , this kinda stinks . And the battery warning alarm at 32% makes it really annoying to fly any longer ! How do I turn that thing off or set it for a different percentage ? Great product and I HIGHLY recommend the Mavic Pro AND Drone World 's customer service !

Review by melted3 <p> Price <p> Value <p> Quality <p> I purchased a Mavic Pro bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DJI supply chain issue that put the drones on back order for months . Initially , Drone World thought they would be shipping within a month to a month and a half . However , it turned out to be over two . That was a bummer , but the way the folks at DW handled the situation was outstanding . As soon as they had information , they passed it along to the consumers . They were apologetic about the entire situation . Their responsiveness regarding communication is second to none as I typically received a response to my questions , and I had three or four over the course of the first month , within 24 hours ! Drone World 's bundles are the best I found on the Internet , and after experiencing their superb customer service , I would venture to guess they offer the best of class service on the Internet as well ! <p> As for the Mavic Pro , all of the YouTube reviews highlighting its awesomeness are spot on ! This is my first drone , but not my first RC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard ( as well as the field behind it ) without a runway or prep production with all the safety and " no-brainer-to-fly " features makes the Mavic Pro an absolute home run in my book .

The Mavic Pro itself is an awesome drone and is pretty much fool proof to fly ! Drone-World 's bundle , coupled with DJI 's fly more package , topped off with their world class customer service makes them the only place to buy this drone ! Check out my video review and see how easy it is to take off and land . I did everything with one hand ! The folks at Drone-World OVER communicate throughout the order and ship process .

( Posted on 3/6/2017 ) <h> Product <p> What 's the main difference between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> The Mavic is smaller , lighter , and easier to carry with you thanks to its foldable design . Its new OcuSync transmission system has a longer transmission range and 1080p resolution . Due to its larger size , the Phantom 4 has a higher maximum speed and can withstand stronger winds . <p> Does the folding mechanism wear out and will it need replacing ? <p> The folding mechanism has been tested to last at least 5000 folds . It is unlikely that it will wear out during the Mavics lifetime . <p> What 's difference of camera between Mavic and Phantom 4 ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mavics camera has a smaller FOV , is able to focus as closely as 0.5m and can be rotated 90 for portrait shots and selfies . The Phantom 4s larger FOV makes it better suited for landscape imaging . <h> Remote Controller and Wi-Fi <p> What is the difference between using the remote controller to control the Mavic , and using your smartphone to control it via Wi-Fi ? <p> The Mavic remote controller uses DJIs OcuSync transmission technology , giving it an increased range of up to 4.3mi ( 7km ) in open areas without interference , FCC compliant . When using a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi , the controllable range is 80m , and maximum altitude is 50m , making it suitable for short-range shots like selfies and for setting up ActiveTrack . You can also download photos and videos directly from the Mavic to your mobile device via Wi-Fi . By sliding the Control Mode switch on the right hand side of the aircraft , you can choose easily between Wi-FI and RC mode depending on which transmission type you need . <p> How do I switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that your aircraft is powered off . Then , open the small cover on the right hand side of the aircraft body . Slide the switch to the left to enable Wi-Fi control , or to the right to use the remote controller . <p> What sizes of smartphone can fit inside the Mavic remote controller ? <p> The Mavic remote controller can fit smartphones between 6.5-8.5mm thick and up to 160mm long , without a phone case . Phones and tablets larger than this do not fit the remote controllers device holder . <p> Can I use a regular USB cable to connect my phone and remote controller ? <p> Yes , you can . However , for the best user experience , we recommend that you use a dedicated Mavic RC ( Remote Controller ) Cable to connect your phone . <p> The phone on the left has a standard Micro USB Connector ; the phone on the right has a Reverse Micro USB Connector.The Remote Controller Cable ( Standard Micro USB Connector ) is compatible with : Samsung , Huawei , Motorola and more . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with : HTC , Mi , OPPO and more . For Sony , VIVO , and other brands , phone compatibility differs by model . Please take care to choose the correct type for your phone . <p> What Remote Controller Cables are included with the Mavic upon purchase ? <p> Two cables are included in the box : one with Lightning connector and one with a standard Micro-USB connector . <p> What is the default Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> For security purposes , each Mavic has its own SSID and password that can be found on a sticker on one of the forearms of the aircraft and inside the battery compartment . For your first use , you can scan the QR code with the DJI GO app to connect to the aircraft* , or enter the password manually under your phones Wi-Fi settings . ( *Only available for Android devices ) . <p> Can I use other QR code apps to scan the QR code and connect to the aircraft via Wi-Fi ? <p> No . You must use the DJI GO app to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wi-Fi SSID and password ? <p> Connect to your Mavic via Wi-Fi and then enter Camera View . Now enter Wi-Fi settings to manually set the SSID and password . <p> How do I reset the Wi-Fi password back to default ? <p> Turn on the Mavic in Wi-Fi mode , press the linking button and hold for 5s . <p> What is the benefit of dual-band Wi-Fi ? <p> The 2.4G Wi-Fi frequency was developed a long time ago , 5G Wi-Fi is newer . As 2.4G is older , more devices use this frequency , making it more likely to suffer from interference . 5G is less prone to interference as there are less 5G devices , but not all phones support the 5G frequency . You can switch between these two frequency bands in the Wi-Fi Settings menu in the DJI GO app . <h> Propulsion <p> Do I have to take the propellers off when in transit ? <p> No . Just fold the propellers and you are good to go . <p> What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically push the propellers into the correct position , so you do n't  need to worry about not having unfolded them perfectly . <p> The Mavics motors are not all on the same plane . Will this affect its flight performance ? <p> No . <p> What 's the highest level of wind the Mavic can resist ? <p> The Mavic can withstand a level 5 wind , also called a fresh breeze . This is defined as wind speeds of 1924mph ( 2938kph ) . <p> How far can the Mavic fly on a single charge ? <p> In calm weather and under ideal conditions , the Mavic can fly up to 8 miles ( 13km ) at 31 mph ( 50 kph ) . Real-world performance will vary though , so we urge you to monitor your battery level at all times . <p> Why does the Mavic have a longer flight time than hover time ? <p> Thanks to its rotor system optimized for forward flight and its aerodynamic design , when flying at the optimum speed for energy consumption , the Mavic consumes less energy then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a 27 minute flight time , while its hover time is 24 minutes . <h> Video Transmission <p> What is the main benefit of the OcuSync video transmission system ? <p> OcuSync has a range of up to 4.3 miles ( 7 km ) with improved resistance to interference and a higher transmission throughput . At shorter ranges it can stream footage to you at 1080p resolution and also allows photo and video downloads at 40Mb/s . <p> 160ms from the Mavics camera to your device screen under ideal conditions . <h> Vision <p> What is the difference between quick calibration and advanced calibration ? <p> When the Vision System fails to function normally , you can do a quick calibration in the DJI GO app , or connect the aircraft to a computer to perform advanced calibration for higher precision . <p> What is the difference between the Mavics Intelligent Vision Positioning System and an Optical Flow Vision Positioning System ? <p> The Mavic combines dual forward and downward vision no more than a patterned surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 13m above the ground . Even if the Mavic is unable to identify reference points on the ground , it can still rely on its forward vision sensors to hover . In contrast , an Optical Flow system , requires information from ultrasonic sensors to supplement its view of patterned surfaces . <p> An example to show the difference between the two systems is when the aircraft is returning to you where you are standing on a balcony . When flying in over the balcony , drones using Optical Flow will receive data from two data sources that measure its height above the below surface differently one being its height above the ground , and another the height above the balcony . As the data is not compatible , an Optical Flow system may become confused . <p> Another example is when the ground below the drone is covered by vegetation . Plants and trees do not reflect sound as well as other surfaces , causing the Optical Flow systems ultrasonic sensors to be unable to gather altitude data . <p> In conclusion , the Mavic 's Intelligent Vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its functionality . <p> What is the minimum distance and maximum flight speed at which the Mavic can fly while avoiding obstacles ? <p> The Mavic will automatically avoid obstacles 50ft ( 15m ) in front of it . The maximum speed at which the Mavic is able to avoid obstacles is 22mph ( 30kph ) . <p> What are the conditions required for Precision Landing ? <p> Precision Landing is an upgraded version of GPS RTH . It needs a GPS signal strong enough to initiate Precision Landing , so that the Mavic can be navigated back to the vicinity of the take-off point . Then , the aircraft needs to be able to visually recognize the pattern of the ground it took off from , for example cracks or other identifiable patterns . A uniform patch of sand , however , is not suitable for Precision Landing . Finally , the Mavic needs to capture footage of the ground during take-off to record its appearance . This means that you should give the Mavic sufficient time during its ascent , instead of flying away immediately after take-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Intelligent Flight Battery and its remote controller ? <p> Yes , it can charge a battery and two other devices simultaneously via USB . However , it will take longer to fully charge the devices . <p> Does the Mavics battery support quick charging ? <p> Yes . The Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery supports quick charging at nearly 2C , with a maximum charging power of 100W . The rated power of Mavic Battery Charger is 50W , and the rated power of the Mavic Car Charger is 78W . When using the Mavic Advanced Charging Hub with a 100W adapter , the battery can be charged at 100W . <p> What is a Battery Charging Hub ? What is the difference between the two versions of the Mavics Charging Hub ? <p> The two Charging Hubs can both charge up to 4 batteries at one time . In order to fully charge the first battery as quickly as possible , the Intelligent Flight Batteries are charged in sequence according to their power levels , from high to low . This gives you the fastest way of getting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Charging Hubs . First , the standard Charging Hub only supports the Mavics 50W Battery Charger and Mavic Car Charger , while the advanced version also supports the 100W Battery Charger and Car Charger from the Phantom 4 . Second , the advanced version will balance the voltage of each battery cell to improve charging efficiency . When one batterys charging enters the second-half of its charging phase , the next battery will enter the first-half of its charging phase . With 4 batteries all at 15% , the advanced charger can get 4 batteries fully charged in 140 minutes using the Phantom 4s 100W charger , while the standard version will need 270 minutes with the Mavics 50W charger . <p> What is the Mavics Battery to Power Bank Adapter ? <p> This adapter can be connected to the Mavics Intelligent Flight Battery , turning it into a power bank . Thanks to its high capacity , an Intelligent Flight Battery at 25% charge can fully charge the Mavics controller , or an iPhone 6 . <p> What is the maximum output current for the Mavics Battery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports which can be used simultaneously . The output voltage is 5V , and the max current is 2A + 2A . <h> Travel Notice <p> How many batteries can I carry in the Mavics Shoulder Bag ? <p> Four . One mounted on the Mavic , one at the bottom of the bag , and on in each of the two side pockets .

That means we 're talking 4 to 5 miles of range in ideal conditions . And using approved tech that is safe from wind , heat and frequency interference . <p> More Power , More Range <p> If you 're going to fly farther than anyone else , you 'd better have the juice to do it . Drone World 's range extender system was designed with a panel antenna to not only look different but perform different , too . Upgrading to the panel antenna means 180 of coverage emanating from your fingertips . Combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through trees and is n't affected as badly by pesky wi-fi signals generated from commerical transmitters and home routers in your area . <p> So what does all this mean in the end ? Better technology , advanced design , genius engineers and a Phantom 3 that flies up to 5 miles is impressive . But there 's more . Greater distance in a straight line is n't enough . That 's thinking only linearly . Drone World 's long range system has maximized the Phantom 's range up to 5x in a straight line but applied to the area of coverage in 360 , the added area of what your Phantom can see is exponential . Five miles turns into 17x the area a stock Phantom could survey and film , opening up an endless amount of possibilites. 3388 @qwx203388 3395 @qwx203395 3394 @qwx203394 3393 @qwx203374 3373 @qwx203373 3391 @qwx203391 <p> POWERFUL MOBILE APPComplete power is at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all from your mobile device . 3377 @qwx203377 3375 @qwx203375 3359 @qwx203359 3401 @qwx203401 3403 @qwx203403 3406 @qwx203406 <p> *Support for additional Android devices available as testing and development continues <p> Phantom 3 Advanced : <p> Part Number : CP.PT.000160 <p> GTIN : 00784672983280 3346 @qwx203346 <p> Please note : tablet is not included <h> Reviews <h> Customer Reviews ( 6 ) <p> Great experience with Drone World .
