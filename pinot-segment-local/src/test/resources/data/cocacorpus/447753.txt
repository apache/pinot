It was an older car with some mileage on it , and not as flashy as newer models , but it still looked serviceable . It used to make me feel wistful every time I saw it . <p> I recently noticed I do n't see that car anymore . <p> But in the past couple weeks I 've started to see a shiny new Audi sports car around .

@@79253305 @753305/ <h> Boss / Event Mechanics <p> Just a post to see what kind of mechanics we can think up , and what we 'd really like to see in the game . Throw out whatever , be silly , be serious , be edgy , be fun . <p> If possible , make sure to note whether its for a group boss , raid boss , or event ( Event being open world event ) . <p> I 'd like to make a note , I 'm one of the few people who believe in soft rage timers . I 'll be adding ways that they can be added with what I believe is a reasonable way . <p> Boss : Mad Doctor Zoloctor Type : Group <p> Mad Doctor Zoloctor ( Now MDZ ) will be in a large hexagon room . On each side will be reinforced glass , with either large vats , or machines on the other side . In the middle will be a small circle . <p> At the start , MDZ will start in the middle of the circle . The players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the vats/machines will activate and if MDZ is standing in the middle , he will be buffed with more damage , and potentially a new ability ( Electricity or something will zap whose in the circle ) . These buffs are permanent for him . <p> If players start beating on the reinforced glass , MDZ will leave the circle in an attempt to stop you . When the glass is broken , the vats/machines will activate again , and MDZ will head back to the circle to be buffed . <p> If a vat/machine is destroyed ( Takes a bit of damage to destroy it still ) , it will slightly reduce the buff that the circle provides . If all of them are destroyed , the circle will be deactivated . <p> If MDZ runs off the circle to stop the players , a player can stand on the circle before MDZ gets back to it , the player will receive the buff instead of MDZ . However , the player is not equipped properly , and will be driven to a frenzy , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random ( Including MDZ and other players ) . After the frenzy ends , the buff will slowly dwindle . However they will be left a stacking debuff , each time that same player goes on the circle , the buff will be increased , and the frenzy will last longer . <p> Strategies : 1 . Players can either just try to burn down MDZ before he simply gets too strong . 2 . Players can attempt to destroy the vats/machines reducing the buffs MDZ receives , and eventually stopping them all together . 3 . Players can pull MDZ off the circle , and steal the buff themselves . Hoping that their own players wo n't kill them . 4 . A mix between 2 and 3 <p> Aliens invade , with a few drops flying around teleporting troops to the ground . As the outside of the ships are made of a material too strong for players , the only way to destroy them are to go inside . Once inside , players can go through destroying key components while fighting ship crew . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if left alone , ground troops will create shield generators , which will prevent players from boarding the ships , and causing reinforcements to arrive on the ships making things far more difficult on the ships . If continued to be left alone , ground troops will also create portals on the ground , that will bring in even more ground troops . Kind of a snowball effect essentially . <p> The idea is , having players work together on clearing the ground forces ( Maybe having the weaker players deal with ground troops ) , while other players board the dropships and take them down . Ca n't focus on just one , need to bring down both . <p> I 'd like to see at least a few boss fights where stealth and/or extreme range are useful mechanics for managing aggro and tricking the boss into being less dangerous to a player with non-traditional , non-face-tanking defenses .

That 's fine for enemies with super-senses , but if applied to every boss , this eliminates some fun tactical options for the players . <p> In a sort of similar fashion , but maybe not quite ? I personally would love situations where specific powers might give you a slight edge over a boss . Maybe flight / super jump you can reach a control at the top that might hurt the boss . Or super strength , might be able to toss a boulder on a device the boss is using . Etcetc <p> Would have to be fairly minor though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see groups specifically requiring that stuff . <p> I think it would be interesting to see a boss who could absorb energy and get more powerful the more energy it absorbed . So any attack or ability cast upon it would make it more powerful . And I see there could be a few ways to beat it . <p> One would be to overwhelm it with too much energy . So if everyone was able to pump attacks into it , it would overload and turn into a puddled mass or maybe break up into a bunch of smaller masses with lower threshholds that could then be dispatched easier . ( but each could also potentially become as dangerous as the original if not ) I think it would be extra cool to make heals extra effective against it . <p> another way to defeat it would be to starve it by taking out its current power source and surviving those defenses as well as the boss 's attacks , remembering that any attack on the boss gives it fuel <p> another way would be to somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenders and somehow getting the power source 's defenders to attack and overload the boss with you . <p> So this could be a DPS battle , a survival battle or a control battle or all of the above . And I think it could really highlight momentum effects . <p> Counter-proposal ... " input " to the Boss above a threshold amount is " absorbed " and powers up the Boss , meaning you want a Death Of A Thousand Cuts rather than a Nuke strategy in order to be successful . Sort of an " inverse " Rage Timer . Do " too much " and you are n't helping your own cause , you 're harming it , because you 're aiding the enemy rather than advancing your own side ( faster ) towards success . That way , you wind up with a " steady ... steady ... steady ...

You 're either heroes looking to stop the bad things , or you 're villains who wants to haz his evil stuff . <p> Underground map because ambiance and it 's the only real way for the map layout to work . Five mini-bosses at the points of the pentagram that the map appears to be arranged in . Or if that symbolism is too dark or might be found offensive ( no , I do n't want to have that conversation again , it 's been done to death , no pun intended this time ) , it can be skull-shaped . With horns or something . Either way , five mini-bosses can be arranged at the points and the players can draw their own conclusions if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . ( NMJr ) is at each point . Each one will have a different mechanic based on their respective adds : *NMJr-1 has adds ( black ) that gives him a life-boost when killed or Sacrificed ( special move by the mini-boss , interruptible ) *NMJr-2 has adds ( red ) gives the boss a damage boost when killed or Sacrificed *NMJr-3 has adds ( orange ) that explode in a PBAoE when killed or Sacrificed *NMJr-4 has adds ( purple ) that also explodes but leaves caustic blood that 's damage to stand in when killed or Sacrified *NMJr-5 has adds that are just sheer damn numbers , literally five times the normal mob size ( or just five mobs in extremely close proximity ) <p> The map is laden with environment traps , like any good and classic encounter . And I like traps that encourage different travel powers to circumvent or that respond to different conditions . *Spiked pits ( with impaled cultists that also temporarily poison the player , vaguely alluding to the mini-boss adds that explode and leave caustic blood ) are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit wall and out ( or maybe he was so fast , he ran right over the hole ) . Teleporter can just TP over it . Flyer does n't give a damn like honey badger . Destructable obstacle . *Spiked ceiling dripping acid to harass the flyer and speedster , but the TPer can get through relatively easily . Destructable obstacle . *Collapsing cave tunnel ceiling keeps the flyer from getting through , but the TPer might have an option to get passed it , or maybe even the speedster can phase through the wall too , if they 've invested enough into their respective travel powers . If it were possible , I 'd make the wall clickable so that the speedster or TPer could get through , even if they did n't actually have that power . You do n't want to force someone to take a power just to get through some bit of content . It would just trigger a map-based TP based on the clickable object to the other side of the wall . And if the TPer or the speedster gets through by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which 'll be challenging to defeat on their own or in their limited numbers . If in the strange edge-case condition were to happen that everyone in the team was a flyer , I 'd have the rubble wall be defeatable through damage . Edit : Actually , it 's destructable , now that I 've thought about it , due to later mechanics with adds . Note : Flyers definitely wo n't set off the weight-based traps , but stealthy characters might if they 're ground-based . Stealthy-flyers would definitely have the advantage . But that 's a very specific combination of skills/abilities . Maybe Limited Stealth only has a chance to circumvent certain types of traps . Perhaps their Limited Stealth is based off a certain portion of the light spectrum , but they 're still visible to thermal imaging , pheromone detection , or sound . Perhaps Improved Stealth , if that was an option , would expand their capabilities to cover the limitations of a lesser skill/ability .

It 's in the center area of the pentagram or in the mouth of the horned skull or whatever . Depending on the order of the Necro-Man Jrs. killed/arrested , the team enters the room from a different tunnel . Either way , there are ( potentially ) five tunnels that lead into the central room . The reason I say ' potentially ' is because if the team rushes to the end room , the encounter is different . I would want to balance the encounter depending on the route taken ( e.g. time invested ) . *If you do n't defeat the NMJrs along the way , the tunnels are open behind you , leaving the final fight available to additional ambush adds . The boss has only 75% HP for some strange reason ( re : NMJrs are actually homunculus connected to Necro-Man Sr. , they 're like life-energy reservoirs ) . He actually starts at 100% but drops to 75% when he starts casting the summoning spell . *If you defeat the NMJrs along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or limiting adds from getting to the room . This takes time , but the final boss fight is theoretically shorter due to less boss HP ( 50% at start , drops to 25% at start of summon spell ) and less ambush adds . The NMJrs are not required to start the final boss fight , but if players choose to do so , I feel they should be rewarded not only with the additional potential drops from the mini-bosses , but the end fight should also be theoretically easier . <p> I 'd prefer the fight to not be focused on the boss itself . That 's done time and time again . Instead , it 's the adds you have to focus on . So the boss ca n't be dealt damage directly from the players . Necro-Man Sr. is surrounded by a Wall of Force ( or it 's non-trademarked equivalent ... ) that ca n't be phased or TPed through or flown around/above/under . And since he 's surrounded by such a perfect defense , he ca n't access his externally-derived stygian energies . Makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrier is attackable , but I 'd like to make so that only upper tier attacks can damage it , due to it 's resilience . So , he 's going to use his own tained life-force as the juice for his spell and summon his demonic patron , Reficulnatas ( Satan + Lucifer backwards because I 'm making this up as I go ) . That name is ( forked ) tongue-in-cheek . I do n't actually expect that name to stick . Anyways . The room is also full of timed and/or triggerable ( damage-able ) traps and mysterious ( mildly-hidden ) switches . <p> Boss ' HP is ticking down . If he gets to full HP , encounter over . More on this in The Aftermath . Now , NMSr needs to stain his soul just a bit darker to pull this off , but if the party defeated the NMJrs along the way , since those were his life-force reservoirs , he does n't have enough HP to cast the spell . However , what he can do is use the life-force of his cult-followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adds from getting to the Barrier where they die and do things . The adds are the same type of adds that were seen ( or not ) in the NMJr fight(s) . One of the advantages of fighting the NMJrs is that the team knows what each color-coded add does . If the party did n't defeat the NMJrs , they 're going to arrive as ambushes with their adds because NMSr needs their life-energy to finish the spell . They contain approximately 10% of his total max HP ( 50% divided amongst the five of the NMJrs , that 's why he 's at 50% if you defeat them before this ) . Fret not , fellow adventurers . Why would I punish players like that ? So what if they zerg rushed the boss ? Maybe that 's how they like to roll . Do n't worry . I 'm not that evil . Since they did n't fight the NMJrs , the tunnels are open ... which means the traps are still there . If the team can find the switches ( more on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse the tunnels and/or trigger the traps to impede that incoming adds . This wo n't keep them out forever . It will only slow them down . Necro-Man Sr. will also burn a bit of his life-force to summon adds ( randomly ) . They could be the exploding kind or they could be the life-force kind or whatever . They 're summoned ( also randomly ) somewhere in the room where there could be enough time to intercept them with CC or AoEs or whatever , but not always . If the traps in the room are destroyed , that 's just more surface area on the map where they could be summoned . So there are advantages to leaving them there . Or player placement in the room , as a mob ca n't be summoned directly on top of a player . <p> All the adds can be used to the players ' advantage under certain conditions , such as being Confused . Usually if a mob is confused , there 's some measure of penalty like reduced XP or some nonsense . I get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be either information or they do what they would have done for the boss BUT instead to the team . If the aforementioned trap switches have n't been triggered because the players have n't located them ( they 're not out in the immediate open but certainly discoverable ) , the first time a mob is confused , it will go for the switches and trigger one of them . He 's confused , after all . He 's working for the team now . Five confused mobs , if not activated by the players , will trigger five switches that activate the five separate traps in the five separate tunnels . If the switches have been thrown , then they 'll just do their thing but it will positively affect the team instead . The confused adds will either heal the team , damage buff the team , PBAoE explode on the Barrier , explode and leave caustic acid blood on the ground to damage the Barrier or damage-able traps in the room or hurt other adds . <p> So you have multiple options of how the final boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they ca n't get to the boss until he drops to zero HP. *Confuse the adds so that they do n't help the boss and attack either other adds or the Barrier and then hopefully the boss directly . *Ignore all the adds , and rush the boss by trying to take down the Barrier and then Necro-Man Sr. himself with overwhelming damage . *Any and all variations in-between . <p> The Aftermath *If the team loses , Reficulnatas is successfully summoned and banishes the team from his presence . This sets up for a later boss fight with Reficulnatas ( yay ! ) . *If the team wins , Necro-Man Sr. is defeated , collapsing to the ground , form shriveled and desiccated like an ancient mummy . However , a diminutive twinkle wafts up from his corpse and whisks off with dark foreboding . This also sets up for a later boss fight with Reficulnatas ( yay ! ) . I did consider that Reficulnatas escaping , even at reduced capacity , may seem like it takes away some of the shine of actually defeating Necro-Man Sr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ( for first time accomplishment ) and then because they won , they of course get that sweet , sweet reward of loot or gear or IGC or whatever . <p> I really like the boss fight , and the detail put into it . My issue though , is the losing . If you lose , you just continue the fight to the last boss ? I could easily see people purposely losing the fight , just to get to the last boss quicker . I 've legit seen stuff like this become the standard , and you can get kicked from groups if you do n't exploit stupid crap like that . <p> I really like the boss fight , and the detail put into it .

If you choose to go to the last fight without dealing with the other mini-bosses , that 's going to influence the parameters of the encounter , such as higher HP and those additional ambushes that include the mini-bosses . That is , unless you use the switches that trigger the traps , which slows the ambushes etc etc etc . <p> Another option to discourage failing for speed in multipart encounters ( besides Cobalt Azurean 's very valid plan ) is to provide a good reward matched to the difficulty of each stage . It also helps in cases of internet connection issues or family emergencies that would otherwise deprive a player of the entire completion reward . <p> I think there is another thread out there with a similar purpose where we discussed various boss mechanics . One in particular was a " running " boss , where the goal would be to attempt to divert , slow , trap , or stun/mez the boss by various means in order to prevent it from reaching a target or escaping .

So going with that , but going to try and make each one unique . Going to add several types in a Tier , mostly hoping for multiple cosmetic choices , over just 1 . <p> Tier 1 : Zombies / Skeletons / Ghouls <p> Mechanics - This is low tier , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely low health , and will actually be timed . I would love this to actually be one of the Necromancers main abilities he uses . Sending waves and waves of weak undead at his enemy . <p> Tier 2 : Death Knight / Abomination / Horror / Shadow <p> Mechanics - This will be your mid tier minion . You will only get 2 of these at a time . They are permanent despite their predecessor , and are generally sturdier than other Commander Tier 2 equivalents . Lore wise , these are creatures the Necromancer took their time creating , and are usually used as the Necromancer 's personal bodyguards . <p> They move with purpose and discipline , unlike the frantic movements of Tier 1 , as if they actually have a mind of their own . They hit like trucks , but generally attack slower . <p> Ability 1 - Soul Link - The Tier 2 minions have the special ability of taking a % of the damage the Necromancer receives . They are his bodyguards after all . However , if one of the Tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the Necromancer vulnerable , causing him to take increased damage for a period of time . <p> Ability 2 - Harvest of Fear The Tier 2 minions will amplify any fear of the surrounding enemies . Causing them to deal less damage , or take more damage . Weak enemies have a chance of being stunned with fear temporarily . <p> Tier 3 : Liche / Apprentice / Enslaved Spirit <p> Mechanics - A being with intelligence , enslaved to your will , or willingly attempt to learn from you . While this minion does n't deal direct damage , they do however buff your minions , causing your Tier 1 to last longer , healing your Tier 2 , and debuffing your enemies when passive . <p> Ability 1 - Necromantic Servant - The Tier 3 minions knows , or is learning Necromancy . With this , when an enemy unit is defeated , they will summon a Tier 1 minion in their place . Depending on lore , they may just be arrested . If so , the Tier 3 can just periodically summon a Tier 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 - Bone Armor - A buff that surrounds a minion with either swirling bones , or a shield made out of bone . It increase their resistance to damage for a period of time . Only cast on a minion taking damage . <p> Ability 3 - Undeath Enchantment - Enchants all the attacks of a minion type to drain the health of an enemy , healing the minion in the process . <p> Note : These are not in order . Just a list of Necromancer specific abilities I would like . <p> Necromantic Blast : This is super figgn cliche , and I 'd be happy for suggestions . But a energy blast that essentially causes some life drain . Healing yourself , and your Tier 2 and 3 minions . <p> Necromantic Corruption ( Alternative to Blast ) : As I 'd prefer Tier 1 Minions , and controlling your minions be your primary focus , I 'd prefer this ability over Blast . Corruption is a channeled ability where the Necromancer places his hand on the ground , causing the ground the become corrupted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their life drained for a small amount of damage per second , which will directly heal the Necromancer and their minions . <p> Sacrificial Explosion : An ability that cause all of your Tier 1 minions to explode . Healing you , and your tier 2/3 minions for a % of their combined health . They will also damage any enemies around them . <p> Death 's Hunger : The Necromancer will choose any minion . An etheral Scythe will appear in their hands , which they will swing once in a massive arc . The Scythe will deal a % of damage ( Capped to a certain amount of damage for the sake of bosses ) . If they are under a certain % of health , this will outright defeat them ( Bosses/stronger enemies are immune to this ) . <p> Fury of the Underworld : All Tier 1 minions go into a frenzy , increasing their attack speed dramatically . However , it will also halve the amount of time they have . Meant to burst down a target . <p> The Grave Rises : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 minions to temporarily halt their timer within the area . Also , hands will reach out , slowing enemy units in the area . <p> Reign of Undeath : This would be an ultimate ability of sorts , if such things exist . A channeled ability , where a torrent of Tier 1 minions rise behind you , and charge directly ahead . These are not quite Tier 1 minions though , they have basically no intelligence at all . They will essentially run into something and either explode on contact , or just attack once or twice before expiring . <p> In short , the ability will last for a period of time where the Necromancer ca n't do anything else . Supposed to give the user the feel of true mastery of Necromancy , as they summon seemingly endless waves of undead . As I realize system limitations , why I did n't want them to actually be minions . More just a regular cone type attack that gives the look of minions ( Hence the expiring after hitting something ) .

An ancient Necromancer who had great power , but was defeated and burned alive . Little did Xerial 's enemies know , that he was actually immortal . Now in-cased in his skull , Xerial has offered the Necromancer his aid as long as the Necromancer keeps him around for his adventures , instead of rotting underground for eternity . <p> While not even close to his normal power , Xerial is still able to buff the Necromancer and his minions .

@@79253314 @753314/ <h> Combos <p> there were a combo system in which using your powers in various combinations could have different advantages it would make for a more diverse PvP/ End Game . <p> Let 's use Brand from League of Legends as an example ( since that 's what I got the idea from really ) Your abilities all apply a condition and when that condition is active when you use other abilities it can have an additional effect . Each of your abilities could apply a different condition that affected the next ability used on the same enemy or enemies . <p> I 've played several games with combo-building mechanics and they all seem to share a fatal flaw . One 's target may change in the process of combat , thus disrupting the combo-chain and forcing one to start all over again . <p> The premise of combos seems to be that one accepts the tyranny of making a series of ( weak ) attacks in a specific order , to earn a big payoff when the combo completes .

Or maybe the " penalty " is that the combos take tertiary slots or similar ? <p> ( FYI , I have no info from the actual game side of the operation ; this is purely me speculating . And I doubt you 'd see this at launch . ) <p> Come to think of it , I do n't see why " combos " have to be limited to attack chains .

I would very much like to see more AoE heals and less targeted heals . I would like to see the AoE heals centered around the healer , as well as centered around a telegraph on the floor as well as centered around targets , whether those targets are allies or enemies . <p> I am very good at playing whack-a-mole healer because that 's what I 've grown up on , but I know we can do better . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the game ? <p> I agree playing The Team Window made it hard to keep up with what was going on around me . What helped me was setting up a special set of keybinds for my healer , arranged in the order of the team UI , so I could target each teammate more easily . Eventually , it got where I could spot who needed what with my peripheral vision and keep an eye on the whole battle more easily . <p> I found the whole ' Healer game ' complicated by the way that the different ' Support ' powers did healing differently . Some were single-target , some were AoE from the target , some were AoE from the Caster , and some were ground-placed . Some ' Support ' powersets had little or no healing at all . <p> Worse , was when the Team , or more often the team Leader , did n't know and did n't care about these differences , and screamed when they did n't get healed as much as they thought they should . I 've been abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team , because I spent time attacking and debuffing , instead of ' just healing ' . <p> I know that has nothing to do with the Team UI . I actually used it more often as a Tanker , to ' assist-target ' my Taunt and pull a little aggro off a teammate that was suffering . So the Team UI clearly needs to be visible and show health-bars . <p> I also play healers mostly . I think the absolute best experience I have ever had playing healers is in TERA . Yes , it is an " Action Combat " game , but when it came to healing it required so much more situational awareness . There are basically three heals a priest usesTargeted heals on up to 5 allies . Heals a lot but draws a lot of aggrolarge AoE regeneration centered around the priest at the time it is cast and causes almost no aggroa smallish to medium sized AoE centered exactly 10m in front of your character that does a good amount of healing and regen and not a lot of aggro.I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal , and that was always good in a pinch , but I rarely had to resort to it .

Why should healers be playing the UI while everyone else is playing the game ? <p> To an extent , we had a lot of this in CoH . The most common heal was some form of AoE ( be it **30;160;TOOLONG , EnemyTargetAoEKin , TargetRequiredPBAoEDark , or even ConeNature or LocationAoEalso Nature ; so what mattered the most when it came to healing was actually positioning . Only a handful of sets even had targeted heals . This worked well because , as we all know , CoH/V was far more reliant on Buffs/Debuffs and Control than Heals for mitigation . If CoT follows suit , then it 's really not such an issue . 
@@79253318 @753318/ <h> Mastering Your Character - A Primer on Masteries <p> Beyond your powers , beyond your classification , beyond your archetype , there is some method for defining your character . Often called inherants , talents , or even innate abilities , in many games this is a fixed system while others allow you to improve or alter it as you level up . We call this the Mastery . We have designed five Masteries per classification with the goal to ship with three for launch . Each Mastery enables evolution of your character in a different way . <p> Masteries are not a single selection , not a single defining attribute . They are themselves a growth path for your character , a three tiered evolution . As you select , and evolve the mastery , it enables the role of your character to subtly shift in various ways . <p> For launch , the goal is to allow you to have three choices for Mastery evolution before the initial level cap of 30 . You can focus on one , or expand to different mastery options - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here are the current list of Masteries we are working with . Remember , the plan is to launch with three for each of the Classifications , and introduce the rest later on . <p> Rage : The more you fight , the stronger you get . Surprise Strike : You gain bonuses for attacks against unsuspecting targets . Inspiration : Your allies are rallied with each foe it defeats . Predation : You are the single-target master , gaining bonuses the longer you fight the same enemy . Reinforcement : You have a winning presence for your allies . <p> Saving Grace : The more your allies need your help , the stronger your help becomes . Aftermath : Your effects can quickly stack and spread . Balance : You grant bonuses to your team with your presence . Sentry : You gain bonuses as you or your team has the tide turn against you . Vindication : You and your team gain bonuses against more difficult enemies . <p> Commander Masteries : <p> Magnitude : Improves the Commander 's ability to land critical controls . Oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Focus : Attacks by allies on controlled targets gain bonuses . Restrainment : Your controls gain effectiveness as your target 's health is lowered . Supremacy : Attacks enable you to build up to unlocking your full potential . <p> With three tiers in each group , and our plan to launch with three from each list , the ultimate goal here is to enable each of you to further refine your gameplay to meet your own preferences . Pick all three from the same Mastery , to get the Tier 3 , or to pick the Tier 1 from each , the option is up to you . Some Masteries are more team oriented , some more for solo . But they are designed to enable you the opportunity to further refine your characters to reflect the way you want to play them . <p> One of the design goals was to prevent the forcing of role , where if you failed to take a particular build your game experience would be hurt . We also aim to enable players to recreate play experiences they enjoyed in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of these Masteries . <p> In almost every MMORPG out there you can find a " hide " class , one which is defined by stealth in some manner or another . From the Rogue to the Stalker , we all are familiar with one form of it or another . You know the drill : Sneak in , stand behind biggest target , BACKSTAB , run away , wash , rinse , repeat . But we did not want to just have another " oooo , I 'm invisible " class . <p> So , we analyzed the style , to figure out how we could replicate that playstyle for people who enjoyed it , but also expand it for more options . That is where this Enforcer mastery came from : <p> Notice , it says nothing about being invisible , hiding . In our study of various MMO 's which have such a role , and there are a lot of them , the same thing came up over and over again . The stealth mechanism was used to get that super-strong strike - it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new perception system , and our new aggro system . <p> That began the process of turning what was a one-trick-pony into a robust and unique Mastery . While yes , you can select to take a stealth power to gain the bonus , it now is not the only avenue . You can sneak up on people , drop on them from above , use a disguise , or , in a team , rely on your teammates to distract them so you can metaphorically sink that dagger into the enemy 's back . <p> Now , let us take another one for breakdown , this time , let us take a more team-centric Mastery one from the Commander classification : <p> Focus : Attacks by allies on controlled targets gain bonuses . <p> One of the staples in comic books is for the figure who can control the enemy to open it up for their allies to attack some weak spot , We built upon this idea , that the players allies get an edge in battle from the Commander locking down the enemy . And not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , with allied attacks improving the ability to hold the opponent down , while simultaneously improving the other players on the team . <p> To make it work , we broke down the potential bonuses to then build the tiers . The basic Tier 1 for this is built such that each attack adds a small duration buff to the control effect . This means that the Commander gets a buff from its teammates attacks , while the next two tiers will then grant bonuses to the other teammates . Tier 2 adds a short recharge improvement and Tier 3 grants an energy recharge bonus for those who turn their attention on the Commanders opponent . The more enemies are locked down , the greater the bonuses get for allies who attack them . <p> Some are more straightforward , others more nuanced . But the goal with each is to open up opportunities for players to define who their characters are . Some are more team-centric , others more solo-focused .

@@79253320 @753320/ <p> 1 . What is City of Titans ? City of Titans is the title of a new Superhero MMO in development , inspired by the late MMO City of Heroes and being designed as a spiritual successor . It is being developed by Missing Worlds Media , a game studio formed of volunteers from the City of Heroes community . <p> 2 . Who are Missing Worlds Media ? Missing Worlds Media is a virtual studio of volunteers who have come together to create a new superhero MMO , taking the principles of what made City of Heroes special and using them as a springboard to create a brand new game that learns from City of Heroes ' successes and failures , and takes full advantage of all the advances technology has made since City of Heroes ' release . <p> 3 . When are you going into Beta ? Not for some time . Thanks to the way we were founded , the project has been publicly known since someone first had the idea , but most games are only announced after years and years of development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are soft goals , as predicting what will happen and how long things will take at this stage is very difficult . This is normal for game development " how often has the release date on some AAA title you were waiting for been pushed off ? The date listed below will be kept updated . The date will be preceded by alpha and beta testing for Kickstarter backers . Current Estimated Beta release : Fall 2018 . <p> 4 . Will this game be Free to Play or Subscription based ? Yes . <p> More seriously , our plan is something of a hybrid . You will have to ' buy the box ' for an upfront fee equal to three months subscription , but that purchase will give you both lifelong access and three months VIP status , all perks included ( like the hefty cash shop allowance ) . Subscribing after those three months expire will be optional , and of course there will be a cash shop for all kinds of micro-transactions . We promise that ' no pay to win ' is high on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you donated 50 dollars or more to the Kickstarter , you already own the box , and the game will be effectively Free to Play to you . We 're basically treating your donation as a form of advanced purchase ( 25 dollars or more gets you beta access ) . <p> 5 . Should it really be taking so long ? Your videos do n't even look like a game yet ! Yes , it really should . Again , a studio usually does n't admit the existence of a game until it has already been in production for years , whereas our community has known about us since someone first suggested we make a spiritual successor of our own if the Save CoH campaign failed . It simply takes a lot of time to develop a game to the point where we can produce strong videos that look like a polished game . Most of game production is actually very dry stuff , not to mention technical , and it 's hard to find ways to share it that you all can understand and appreciate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually applied late in the process . As far as genuine production goes , we are doing fine . <p> 6 . Can we give you money ? Money would help right ? Thanks to our amazing community , our Kickstarter campaign succeeded beyond our expectations last year , netting us more than double the goal we 'd set . We 're still planning a slacker backer , but if you want to help , you can go visit our official City of Titans webcomic , Hijinx , and contribute via Patreon . All proceeds not for the artist and writer go to support development . <p> 7 . Do you need more volunteers ? I want to help ! We always need more help somewhere , and if we do n't need your particular skills today , we might need them tomorrow . So everyone who wants to help is encouraged to send an email to to the Contacts address listed at the top of the page , with the details of what you have to offer . If you are applying for 2D or 3D art positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or links to online equivalents , to be considered . This is not elitism on our part , it 's just that we ca n't create a quality game if we do n't hire quality people.Current most needed positions : 3D artists of all breeds , 2D artists , Coders and Programmers <p> Hijinx is what we hope to be the first of many diverse webcomics based in the City of Titans universe . Like most webcomics these days it is Patreon funded . And yes , proceeds that do n't go to the artists and writers who make it will go towards game development , so this is also a great way to support City of Titans and Missing Worlds Media . It 's better than a donation - it 's a genuine business model with returns for your money . To cover a few of the most likely questions about this new business venture : <p> 8a . What 's it about ? <p> It 's the story of a teenager who gets pretty great powers and does n't really give a flip about responsibility . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had crazy luck powers , would n't you go have a little fun ? <p> 8b . Why make it ? And do n't you need these guys for developing City of Titans ? <p> We 've got a lot of talented writers , and a lot of talented artists . Some of the most talented , though , need a little money in their lives - they 're willing to work for us , but they need the dough . Since we always wanted to produce CoT related comics , we decided to have Dale ' Black Gold ' Yaddow ( artist ) and Tom ' Kid Dynamo ' Stillwell ( writer ) spearhead an attempt to launch one . <p> Even better , the constraints of telling the comic 's story will help us design the city better - what parts look right , what parts do n't . Basically , everything you see is concept art for us . <p> 8c . What happens if Hijinx succeeds ? <p> The artists and writers get a nice salary to keep producing it full time , MWM gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting developed , and we launch another one that we are considering calling ' Breakout ' . It 's on the darker side and heavily inspired by Secret Six . And if that succeeds ? Then new webcomics may well become a regular feature . We 'd love for that to happen . <p> 9 . What engine are you using ? Unreal Engine 4 . We originally wanted Cryengine , and then switched to Unreal 3 due to licensing issues . We developed the game in Unreal 3 up until the Kickstarter . During our Kickstarter , Epic made us an offer : early entry into Unreal 4 development . We accepted . <p> These engine shifts have had an impact on our progress , but nothing we ca n't overcome . Unreal 4 is bleeding edge and holds incredible potential , but its early status means we are in many ways beta testing it , which has created many temporary setbacks and delays . In the long run , we expect the change to bring great benefits and much , much faster and more flexible game design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes . Unreal 4 supports it natively , so there 's no extra development time involved " we just export the game client for Macs as well as Windows . There 's some tweaking for the changes in controls ( different keyboards ) , and it 'll need to be bug tested separately , but that 's about it . <p> 11 . Will I need an expensive/high end computer to run City of Titans ? Nope . Our goal is to be lower end computer friendly . While it 's far too soon for us to be able to provide exact specs , I can tell you the specs of the two machines our tech lead and current president , Nathaniel Downes , uses when developing the game . One is a Mac Mini Core 2 Duo with 4 gigs of ram " that 's for Mac testing . The other is an HP Dv7 laptop with an AMD A6 quad core processor with 4 gig of ram . Both are running on integrated graphics cards . The HP was chosen by Nate walking into a Best Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 dollar laptop , following the logic that what was the best selling mid-range laptop then , would be a reasonable lower end build when the game was released several years later . <p> 12 . What about Playstation/Xbox/other consoles ? Probably not , certainly not at launch . We can make an alternate UI for game controllers , and plan to , but adapting an MMO for consoles involves a lot more than that . Trying to make an MMORPG work on both PCs and consoles is not only very expensive , but a very difficult task design wise , and what few examples in the industry have tried so far have usually ended up compromising the game 's playability on one or both platforms . As such , we do n't currently plan to try . But as time goes on new options may surface , new approaches may be found by enterprising studios , and we may reconsider the question . <p> 13 . Can I use my Sentinel+ saved characters in your game ? Yes and no . We are not replicating City of Heroes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made some changes to how powers work , and altered costume modularity , in order to provide new levels of control for whole new worlds of character creation , one of City of Heroes ' most legendary aspects . Because of this , a clean import is not possible , whether for powers or costumes . However , third parties have vowed to do their utmost to provide an import program , and we intend to cooperate with those efforts . The end results of this program , should they succeed in developing it , can only be an approximation , but it should bear a strong resemblance if we 've made our system as flexible as we want to . <p> And no matter how imports work , you 're starting at level one : P <p> 14 . Is this the same thing as Heroes and Villains/Valiance Online ? No , but they are also successor projects . Heroes and Villains was formed by a splinter faction of former MWM members in our early development days who simply had very strong and opposing views on how things should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiance Online is being made by a pre-existing indie game studio . Their team happened to consist of many CoH veterans and was already using CoH as inspiration to some extent in their ongoing projects . Hearing about the push to create a CoH successor , they decided to make one of their own . Their existing game code and heavily modified engine have been adapted to give their efforts a powerful head start . They are well worth following . <p> We did seriously discuss merging with Valiance Online at one point , but eventually decided it would n't work . Mutual support has been the rule though " we each promoted the other 's Kickstarter , for instance . Our teams get along well and have no problem sharing the internet : ) <p> 15 . Are you associated with the Titan Network ? Only to the extent that all former CoH players , and all CoH related efforts , are . Which , admittedly , is a lot . Most of MWM 's staff , and all of its core founding members , were there for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media there . These days we 're well established on our own sites , servers , and forums , but our ties with Tony and the Network are still strong . <p> 16 . Are you former COH developers ? No , we are not . While having former developers would have been great , there were many legal issues with hiring them when MWM was being formed ( if you 've heard about Valiance hiring one , do n't worry " it should be safe now ) . We are , for the most part , former players , often veterans from Beta onward . We all have a wealth of experience in our respective fields , but we were never involved in the creation or maintenance of COH . We simply played it . A lot . <p> 17 . How can I tell you my awesome idea for something that should be in the game ? The forum right here on this site is the best place " social media posts will get shoved down , out of sight and out of mind , but we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a **28;192;TOOLONG - can I interview you ? How about some art assets ? Of course you can . Send an email to the contact@ address listed at the top of the page , and we 'll be happy to arrange something . <p> 19 . What 's all this about your president trying to talk NCSoft into releasing the IP for City of Heroes ? On September 1 , 2014 , Nate Downes said that he was part of the negotiating team who had been in touch with NCSoft about a POSSIBLE deal which COULD see the City of Heroes IP made available for licensing , and City of Heroes lore available to the successor projects . A legacy server deal may also be possible , but not the recovery of character data . <p> While there are a few members of Missing Worlds Media who have been involved in the discussions , this is not a Missing Worlds Media project , per se . <p> Early on , it was decided not to involve MWM directly in the negotiations , in case the discussions or the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also freed up our team to keep on working on City of Titans . Perhaps more importantly , if this should work out , it would be incredibly unfair for only one segment of the community to benefit , particularly when there are a number of ' spiritual successor ' projects underway . <p> The negotiating team is still discussing terms , ideas and limits and people are being asked to remain cautiously optimistic - the whole thing may fall apart and nothing is guaranteed , although negotiations are continuing in good faith . <p> 20 . If the deal succeeds , or CoH comes back some other way , what will you do ? Keep right on going . CoH was a ten year old game , and while it was a wonderful place , it was n't perfect : there are plenty of lessons to be learned from it to make the next game better . Not to mention all the wonderful possibilities ten years of tech advancement offer . City of Titans is meant to be strong enough to stand beside its predecessor .

It was originally settled under the Massachusetts Bay charter from the British crown , the northernmost edge of that charter just outside of Salem . Due to its proximity to the harbor areas , Weston became the home of many sailors and their families . Captains and high-ranking officers were drawn to the exclusive Widow 's Reach area , while their crews found easy boarding on Mercy Street . By the 1730 's , the dominant industry was in supporting the Whalers out of Nantucket . The deep harbor with natural shelter made it ideal for construction , and when the reservoir was built , using a primitive lock system , construction of whaling ships became their largest industry . <p> During the Revolutionary War , Weston was a loyalist stronghold .

The town was already so close to collapse , when the opportunity to join with its neighbors in the establishment of Titan City was offered , they jumped at the chance . These two factors brought with it an influx of new money into the area , which in turn lead to rapid urbanization . Mercy Street and Rose Boulevard became shining beacons of modern industry with high-class shops , restaurants and theaters filling the streets . <p> However , this flood of money became a trickle after the second World War , as the devastated areas had been rebuilt to grandeur .

The area consists of larger homes of a historic bent ( nineteenth and early twentieth century construction ) . Some of the homes in Widow 's Reach are listed on the city 's register of historic buildings . There are very few businesses in Widow 's Reach . Nearly all businesses in the neighborhood are in converted homes . The main exception to this rule is the Harborside Playhouse which was built in the 1890s to cater to Reach residents .

The neighborhood truly is the resting place of many mariners who lived or sailed into Titan City over the centuries . <p> Mercy Street Before Weston 's fall , Mercy Street was a nice place to live . A middle and upper-middle class neighborhood , Mercy Street housed many families . The Mercy Women 's League once operated out of the area and helped found many charitable organizations around Weston . The League was also influential in helping purchase several homes to function as retirement residences for aged sailors .

During the 1910s and 1920s , Rose Boulevard was a glamorous , vibrant part of Titan City . Shops , theaters , clubs and speakeasies lined the main drag , with quieter tea rooms and cafes along the side streets . It was very much a haunt of the city 's young , rich crowd . As Weston began to fall , Rose Boulevard was the worst hit . Business after business closed their doors , either permanently or through relocation .

It sprang to life to accommodate , and collect money from , the crews that sailed into Steward Harbor . Downturn Alley once boasted the cheapest rooms and most watered-down beer in the entire Titan City area . When the area began to prosper , Downturn Alley tried to shift as well . Some bars became cafes , hotels became homes , but it was always a glossy exterior over a rotten core . It is said that the fall of Weston spread like a disease from Downturn Alley .

Though what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection sets so far . I still think that invulnerability makes the most sense . Agility is more likely to have dodge based animations rather than " take it on the chi- shield " type animations .

Businessmen fought savagely for a chance to ply their wares or establish games along the boards . Citizens and tourists alike flocked in droves to spend a day of fun along the beaches or play a few games of chance .

They offered to cover the financial and logistic aspects of renovation in exchange for joint ownership with the DuPree family .

@@79253344 @753344/ <h> You are here <h> Old Bradford <p> At the end of the English Civil War , the city of Bradford in Yorkshire , the final stronghold of the Roundheads , fell upon hard times . With the opening up of land in the new world , many former supporters of Oliver Cromwell decided to take their leave . When they arrived in the newly founded colony of Portsmouth , they found themselves unwelcomed by the loyalist founders , so moved south . In order to avoid the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay colony , they found themselves on a peninsula , across the bay from the northernmost Massachusetts Bay colony town of Kingsport , and named themselves after their former home in England . <p> Following the Glorious Revolution , and the ascension of William and Mary to the throne of England , Bradford found itself in a rather precarious state . Much like the Plymouth Bay colony , Bradford was never legally chartered as a colony in the first place , effectively being created by squatters . To resolve this , William and Mary merged Bradford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single charter , the newly christened Province of Massachusetts Bay . <p> With the increase in Trans-Atlantic trading in the 17th and 18th centuries , many port towns simply found themselves with more ships arriving than places for them to unload . Bradford became one of the many towns outside of the primary colonial trade hub of Boston which grew rapidly to accommodate the demand . But when Bradford existed in a quasi-legal state , traders had avoided it rather than risk their lucrative trade charters . Now legally part of Massachusetts , Bradford 's location became attractive to these various trading groups , and by the end of the 19th century was a moderately sized hub of its own . <p> After the fire of 1908 , Bradford was one of the first districts to be rebuilt . Now referred to as Old Bradford following the formation of Titan City , it became filled with cheap housing designed to house workers and displaced families in the immediate aftermath . As these groups moved on and the city rebuilt , Old Bradford became neglected , almost forgotten as Titan City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of what defines Old Bradford today . <p> By the 1960 's , Old Bradford was reborn a neighborhood of artists and musicians , thespians and pulp writers , struggling to make ends meet while practicing their crafts and passions .

This in turn generated what can be considered a mini-renaissance , defining the district we know today . <p> In gradual waves , however , the consumers of art began to move into the neighborhood , bringing with them lots of new money .

" It is an area of old residences , mostly Victorian houses that managed to survive the fire . <p> The Park and Garden district is centered around a large public park , Byrne Park . Around it , one can find multiple privately owned smaller gardens , open-air shops , restaurants , clubs and party halls . <p> One of the very first areas to be rebuilt after the fire , Firetown still has many many of its turn-of-the-century rowhouses intact , having been carefully ( or carelessly ) maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurricane Atlas incident and then reconstructed . <p> The Theater District was planned to be Titan Cities answer to Broadway , but today mostly consists of shopping venues , museums , and clubs .

I could know a ton ( even hundreds ) of people yet I will only know a small fraction of the player base on the whole and never meet or play with a dev . As such , should I pass , if the hundred people ask for a memorial for me would I get one ? where 's the line who would be included and who is not ? <p> I would say this memorial should be a one time gig ... especially when it comes to displaying a character of a player who has passed ( much less one who only played a game that no longer exists ) . I there is still this need I would say make a plaque at the base that only lists the names of the departed and there also should be a set criteria set forth for one to qualify for said memorial inclusion . <p> Again , I have a feeling I am in the minority here but figured I would say something none the less . This is tricky territory given we are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of a character who is more than likely nothing at all like the person in question . <p> There is a similar sentiment over in the Let 's Argue : Endgame thread concerning using your character without you at the helm . Using your character 's image might not go over too well with some people . Having an Opt In checkbox in whatever buried menu might weird people out . Plus the memorial is more for those of us remaining than for those that are gone . I think that a creative memorial like the one for Ascendant hits the right kind of mark . <p> I agree with WhitePeregrine . What is the criteria . This memorial is n't even for a player of CoT , a long gone backer of the KS or a CoT forum goer . This is a memorial for a guy who played a different game . <p> This whole project is an homage to City of Heroes , and if Ascendant was deemed to be a bright star in the City of Heroes community constellation , then I think memorializing him is a wonderful thing to do .

@@79253355 @753355/ <h> Inspiration <p> So I just got back from watching Wonder Woman and the movie is freaking fantastic . The only bad part is that now I want to make and play a sword and board heroine but there is no CoX . That 's one of the biggest things I miss . Happens to me all the time . I watch something or read something and then I want to make a character . Ca n't wait for this game to come out ! But that got me thinking on what a sword and board character would be like in CoT . The CoX sword and board archetypes were great however , having played more actiony games lately , I wonder how this power set would look and feel if it were combo based instead . What do you guys think ? I think it would be awesome if I could use the melee weapon set that uses the combo system CoT has planned ( if they have one planned . I 'm not sure if they do or do n't  ) . <p> So in COT this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive set with combos and pick a weapon based aesthetic set . Then pick a Sword for your prop . For your defensive set you 'd pick whatever floats your boat , probably something in the invulnerability style and select the shield aesthetic and pick a shield for your prop .

My search fu is not as good as it used to be . I will dig through the forums and hopefully find some golden nuggets of info . <p> I too am a big fan of having variety as well . With the aesthetic decoupling mechanic in cot being so baked into the system I 'm sure that Doc and the team will have a slew of choices for us .

My search fu is not as good as it used to be . I will dig through the forums and hopefully find some golden nuggets of info . <p> Yes , one of the melee sets will be " combo " based . Though from what I have read it is more like a freeform chain/follow-up system rather than combos in the more traditional sense . <p> Since there is no specific mechanic for " deflection " ( afaik ) then I guess the Agility protection set is the closest one to what you want . <p> Right right , I think that was supposed to be " Brawn " I could easily see " SS " and maybe " kinetic " working for a WW-esque character . Though what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection sets so far . I still think that invulnerability makes the most sense . Agility is more likely to have dodge based animations rather than " take it on the chi- shield " type animations . But it 's just conjecture not fact till we start to see the form and function of the powersets.

While Disney certainly is a great company that 's produced many great products over the decades they are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length animation films . <p> Now I believe the same thing exists in the superhero genre when it comes to most potential mainstream players . If you were to ask most Americans about what they think " comic book superheroes " are or to list some examples I 'd once again bet 19 out of 20 would only mention either Marvel or DC characters/properties . Once again even though those companies have produced great products over the years they are n't the ONLY people in the world who have ever created good superhero comic books or games . <p> So when it comes to creating good superhero computer games the world is firmly stuck in the mode of expecting them to be either DC or Marvel based . It 's extremely hard for a game like CoT to sprout up when the very idea of an INDEPENDENT ( or at the very least a NON-DC/NON-MARVEL ) world of superhero characters is almost an alien concept to most people . Sadly the vast majority of current superhero-based computer gamers are content with playing directly as Spider-Man or Batman and have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they could create their OWN characters . <p> Lothic wrote : So when it comes to creating good superhero computer games the world is firmly stuck in the mode of expecting them to be either DC or Marvel based . Pikers . Hinduism is LOADED with superhero stories ! Heck , Durga IS a superhero ( ine ! ) as far as the lore goes , since she could do what none of the other gods could ! <p> Yeah I thought I was being concise enough in my post but to be clear when I said " the world " at the point I was pretty much just referring to the world of potential and/or current computer game players in North America . <p> But since you mentioned it the actual " world " ( this time referring to all the people who live on planet Earth ) has come up with countless stories/myths that could be translated bit-for-bit into a " superhero " game without missing a beat . This was the wealth of non-DC/non-Marvel content I was alluding to . For a very simple example a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game allow/account for a character like Darna : <p> Sure she might be a sort of Philippine version of Wonder Woman who somehow manages to expose even -more- skin than Wondie typically does but she 's just one of millions of examples out there in the world 's collective media . <p> Lin Chiao Feng wrote : Brand X wrote : Wildstar , Blade &amp; Soul , Tera ... there 's some fun combat mmos .

There are indeed fun mmo where you cant . <p> True in regards to the movies , but this has been done many times over with the Ultimate Alliance series .

If you ask a non-Marvel player why they do not play , the common answer is " You cant create your own heroes " <p> The first mmo ever implemented a character creator . There is the standard for a mmo , and mmo enthusiast expect it . You are losing a large chunk of the mmo community by shunning role-players . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Would you , a mmo player , play CoT if there were no character generator , but they simply implemented their own heroes for players to play as to be different than VO and SoH ?

Action must provide strategic improvement not the contrary , not more chaos and button spam . <p> In that light , DCUO was a so much better combat compared to BDO , since it 's simple , slow and strategic . I liked the hybrids too like Champions Online and Neverwinter from Cryptic , I think it 's fine for a mmorpg . City of Heroes was the first attempt to hybridate imho , with those buttons and animations it really wanted to pass like more action oriented compared to other mmorpgs of that age . <p> By the way , many in this forum ( other topics ) seem to forget that City of Heroes was in the first 5 successful mmorpgs for some years after his release ( With Lord of the Rings Online being there and World of Warcraft being first , just so you understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still so " basic " , City of Heroes was a GTA-mmorpg in 3d ... with innovations all around like moving cars , thugs doing things around and not just standing , appearing from behind doors or walls and not from thin air in front of the hero , acting like cooperating npcs in groups and not just walking around with the same animation , best fly system ever at that age , best character creator , mentor-system etc. etc. ) , so copying City of Heroes would be outdated but still would be to copy a success , not a failure at all . Some of those systems are still rare out there , the combat and animations would still be better compared to some mmorpgs of today ( ElderScrollsOnline for example , where the feel to hit something is unexistant and so the will to arm the opponent , I deleted it for the melee animations and I 'd prefer the super strong punchs of my CoH-hero any time ) . <p> City of Heroes was the first attempt to hybridate imho , with those buttons and animations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other mmorpgs of that age . <p> I 've played CO , DCUO , TSW , and , for that matter Injustice : Gods Among Us and other console games with my son , and , while CoH was n't twitchy and was more strategic in build and tactical in gameplay , to me it had BY FAR the best action . <p> ThunderCAP wrote : <p> ... so copying City of Heroes would be outdated but still would be to copy a success , not a failure at all .

On the other hand as good as CoH was it clearly did not have enough sliders . <p> I have the feeling that the CoT Devs are going to strike a good balance with offering many more sliders than CoH did while still making sure that what they do provide is not useless/redundant . <p> Brand X wrote : Greyhawk wrote : Phararri wrote : Would you , a mmo player , play CoT if there were no character generator , but they simply implemented their own heroes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SoH ?

I 'm fairly certain they also mentioned a more involved intro to get a better grasp of how to pick your skills and such . All the content is exactly what it was before , which is what is keeping me away from trying it again . I played all the way up to waiting for Tokyo , but after what seemed like 1346 months of waiting and being capped at 10.4 gear and a full skill and auxiliary wheel , I moved on . I did hear Tokyo was pretty good though . <p> The Secret World was fun . I played it with a guild and ran dungeons and raids in it . I left after the Tokyo campaign because at that point it was just grind grind grind grind grind the same two dungeons to get stuff you needed to upgrade your gear to then be able to run the same two dungeons and previous raids at a harder level . The biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endgame . The story getting up to that point is fan freaking tastic . Hands down best story I 've played in any game and I 've played most MMOs out there . Everything is connected and the choices you make in game regarding how you interact with the old gods affect the reward you receive at the end of Tokyo . There are also puzzle missions that you really need to research offline to figure out or use an online guide . The modern setting is also a really nice change to the fantasy genre . There is also a large RP community in the game if you are into that sort of thing . The guild I was in had many RPers . PvP though is rather meh . I highly recommend the game . Although I would suggest you start with a hardy type build to begin with because the mobs are no joke . Those zombies in the first zone will literally eat your face quickly and they have a long aggro distance .

People were shooting at other people with Intent , not just spewing bullets at random , with no concern for where they landed .

This is one of them . <p> No , it 's a little trick called ' being patronizing ' , and you nailed it . Must be one of those habits you picked up from television , movies , novels , comic books , etc . At this juncture , there 's no point on my part to even attempt to enter into intelligent discourse with someone who does n't appear remotely interested in the possibility that they could be wrong . Finally , analysis is as only as good as the data , but not when it is clearly being bent through personal/observational bias , as seen here . I think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me names for having an opinion dissenting from the majority . I 'm used to it . However , in my own defense , here is a little video clip that showed up in my Facebook newsfeed a couple days ago . It is entirely unrealistic , horribly unsafe , and completely hilarious ! <p> Indulge me another " patronizing " moment while I attempt to explain the difference . <p> The video of the anime character dancing while firing off two handguns in random directions is targeted at teenagers . For all I know , it might have been made by a teenager . The person who made the video depicts firearms as mere props . There is no awareness nor understanding of the lethality of firearms . As close as the two characters in that video are , even if the handguns are loaded with blanks , there is a very high probability that either the dancing girl or her friend would be severely injured by a ricochet . The cardboard or wax plug in a blank can be lethal at such close ranges , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never considered either of those qualities to be " funny " . <p> In the video clip from the DOA movie there is never any doubt of the lethality of the firearms . In fact , lethality is exactly the point of the video clip . The intended audience are adults , mature people who understand the consequences of foolish choices . The scene is carefully choreographed and filmed in a manner that displays excellent muzzle awareness on behalf of the choreographer , even if that awareness is completely accidental . The humorous quality of the scene is created by the unexpected outcome and enhanced by the clear depiction of lethality . Is it realistic ? No . Is it safe ? No . Is it funny and entertaining ? Yes . It is exactly the opposite of the anime clip . <p> Sooner or later some teenager is going to attempt to duplicate that dancing anime character . It is inevitable . It is what they do . Anyone who has raised teenagers knows and understands this . No one is ever going to attempt to duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choreography itself emphasizes the potential lethality of the scene . No one is going to come into these forums and say , " Look at these cool moves ! CoT has to have these fight animations ! " <p> That is what makes the anime character dancing while firing handguns so dangerous . It creates a sense of harmless fun and that sense of harmless fun encourages mimicry in an audience that is naturally inclined to use mimicry as a way of developing their own personal values . <p> I can not help but wonder , how many of you calling me a " stick in the mud " or something similar have raised children to adulthood ? How many of you have seen firsthand a teenager experimenting with life by duplicating some scene from a popular anime ? How many of you have seen the disastrous results of someone using a firearm in imitation of something they saw in a cartoon or movie ? <p> I am a Patron member of the NRA . I am an avid firearms enthusiast with a pretty fair collection of handguns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a week . I am in favor of a global version of the Second Amendment . I want to see more non-law enforcement , non-military , everyday people all around the world carrying a firearm for self-defense . I also want to see far more scenes like the one in DOA and none like the video clip of an anime character firing off handguns with no sense of muzzle awareness . <p> If that makes me a grumpy old man that 's perfectly fine by me . <p> Edit : for what it 's worth ( and I realize it 's worth nothing ) I did not see the good Doctor 's admonition before posting this . <p> I think in general it is fair enough to say that people try so hard to be understood that they forget to try to understand others . @Greyhawk , your last post ( #59 ) is well written and I think makes an excellent case for anyone who would attempt to understand you . <p> But to complete the circle , we must have two things : First we need people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to understand others ' points of view . I think you have demonstrated that you understand them , but you disagree . No one could ask for more . <p> If others admit they understand you and still disagree , claiming that the anime video is still funny in their eyes and that you are still being a stick in the mud who takes himself too seriously , then this entire discussion is over . No one should expect other people to be anything other than who they are . Some jokes and stuations are funny to some people and not to others . We 're all individual humans and to expect otherwise is quite fruitless . <p> I am reminded of sitcoms with friends , like Friends or Big Bang Theory , or That 70 's show . There are people in those ensembles who would never be friends in real life because in real life we are far less forgiving and far less understanding of people who see things differently than we do . But I 've always wondered what life would be like if we accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of trying to change them or prove them wrong . <p> I think a good example we could all follow is the jiggle thread . There were moments in that thread where it got nasty , but in the end it became somewhat of a comedy as everyone just accepted themselves for who they were and what they believed ; that they were never going to change other people 's minds . And I think the participants ended up with a bit more respect for each other as a result , and I think people were able to laugh at each other and themselves as well . I would hope that we all can still respect each other here , whether we agree or not . I think that respect is something we can bring to City of Titans when it launches . City of Heroes was known for its great community and still is remembered for it . Let 's keep that spirit alive .

This is one of them . <p> No , it 's a little trick called ' being patronizing ' , and you nailed it . Must be one of those habits you picked up from television , movies , novels , comic books , etc . At this juncture , there 's no point on my part to even attempt to enter into intelligent discourse with someone who does n't appear remotely interested in the possibility that they could be wrong . Finally , analysis is as only as good as the data , but not when it is clearly being bent through personal/observational bias , as seen here . I think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me names for having an opinion dissenting from the majority . I 'm used to it . However , in my own defense , here is a little video clip that showed up in my Facebook newsfeed a couple days ago . It is entirely unrealistic , horribly unsafe , and completely hilarious ! <p> Indulge me another " patronizing " moment while I attempt to explain the difference . <p> The video of the anime character dancing while firing off two handguns in random directions is targeted at teenagers . For all I know , it might have been made by a teenager . The person who made the video depicts firearms as mere props . There is no awareness nor understanding of the lethality of firearms . As close as the two characters in that video are , even if the handguns are loaded with blanks , there is a very high probability that either the dancing girl or her friend would be severely injured by a ricochet . The cardboard or wax plug in a blank can be lethal at such close ranges , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never considered either of those qualities to be " funny " . <p> In the video clip from the DOA movie there is never any doubt of the lethality of the firearms . In fact , lethality is exactly the point of the video clip . The intended audience are adults , mature people who understand the consequences of foolish choices . The scene is carefully choreographed and filmed in a manner that displays excellent muzzle awareness on behalf of the choreographer , even if that awareness is completely accidental . The humorous quality of the scene is created by the unexpected outcome and enhanced by the clear depiction of lethality . Is it realistic ? No . Is it safe ? No . Is it funny and entertaining ? Yes . It is exactly the opposite of the anime clip . <p> Sooner or later some teenager is going to attempt to duplicate that dancing anime character . It is inevitable . It is what they do . Anyone who has raised teenagers knows and understands this . No one is ever going to attempt to duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choreography itself emphasizes the potential lethality of the scene . No one is going to come into these forums and say , " Look at these cool moves ! CoT has to have these fight animations ! " <p> That is what makes the anime character dancing while firing handguns so dangerous . It creates a sense of harmless fun and that sense of harmless fun encourages mimicry in an audience that is naturally inclined to use mimicry as a way of developing their own personal values . <p> I can not help but wonder , how many of you calling me a " stick in the mud " or something similar have raised children to adulthood ? How many of you have seen firsthand a teenager experimenting with life by duplicating some scene from a popular anime ? How many of you have seen the disastrous results of someone using a firearm in imitation of something they saw in a cartoon or movie ? <p> I am a Patron member of the NRA . I am an avid firearms enthusiast with a pretty fair collection of handguns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a week . I am in favor of a global version of the Second Amendment . I want to see more non-law enforcement , non-military , everyday people all around the world carrying a firearm for self-defense . I also want to see far more scenes like the one in DOA and none like the video clip of an anime character firing off handguns with no sense of muzzle awareness . <p> If that makes me a grumpy old man that 's perfectly fine by me . <p> Edit : for what it 's worth ( and I realize it 's worth nothing ) I did not see the good Doctor 's admonition before posting this . <p> I think in general it is fair enough to say that people try so hard to be understood that they forget to try to understand others . @Greyhawk , your last post ( #59 ) is well written and I think makes an excellent case for anyone who would attempt to understand you . <p> But to complete the circle , we must have two things : First we need people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to understand others ' points of view . I think you have demonstrated that you understand them , but you disagree . No one could ask for more . <p> If others admit they understand you and still disagree , claiming that the anime video is still funny in their eyes and that you are still being a stick in the mud who takes himself too seriously , then this entire discussion is over . No one should expect other people to be anything other than who they are . Some jokes and stuations are funny to some people and not to others . We 're all individual humans and to expect otherwise is quite fruitless . <p> I am reminded of sitcoms with friends , like Friends or Big Bang Theory , or That 70 's show . There are people in those ensembles who would never be friends in real life because in real life we are far less forgiving and far less understanding of people who see things differently than we do . But I 've always wondered what life would be like if we accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of trying to change them or prove them wrong . <p> I think a good example we could all follow is the jiggle thread . There were moments in that thread where it got nasty , but in the end it became somewhat of a comedy as everyone just accepted themselves for who they were and what they believed ; that they were never going to change other people 's minds . And I think the participants ended up with a bit more respect for each other as a result , and I think people were able to laugh at each other and themselves as well . I would hope that we all can still respect each other here , whether we agree or not . I think that respect is something we can bring to City of Titans when it launches . City of Heroes was known for its great community and still is remembered for it . Let 's keep that spirit alive .

I would think the chances that MS paid " licensing fees " to nearly countless notable building owners both foreign and domestic is just about nil . Remember that versions of MSFS were actually buried as a " free Easter eggs " in some of MS 's more famous Office applications so it 's hardly likely that MS would freely hand out a product that they themselves ever had to pay licensing fees for . <p> Yes I get that some specific things ( like your F-22/V-22 model example ) could have licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ) could claim they were the " sole owner " of that object being licensed . On the other hand I would suspect that most modern skyscrapers are not technically " owned " by a single company that could impose such a mandate on a global scale . Let me put it this way : The image of the Burj Khalifa is plastered on every kind of tourist trinket imaginable in the U.A.E. The chances that all of those items ( even within the confines of the U.A.E. ) have accounted for a " licensing fee " is almost laughably remote . Even if the big malls pay fees the smaller souk venders certainly do n't . <p> Anyway as I pointed out I 've already asked for " modifications " to my Mogul the likes of which are probably enough to pass any foreseeable " fair use " legal concern , assuming there is any in the first place . I would be amazed if I were the only Mogul player who asked for something that could even remotely be considered " copyrighted " so if this actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible they may be dealing with a bunch of " questionable " cases . <p> Regardless I 'll be happy to work with the art Devs and would obviously accept any modifications they think would be needed . Remember that this ENTIRE GAME is technically under at least a vague amount of legal jeopardy from NCsoft for trying to effectively " copy " CoH . I doubt my single Mogul building would add to that to any serious degree .

The Devs do n't ( and frankly should n't ) have to spoon-feed everything to you . <p> I 'm not implying that he writes it . I was just pointing out that some of the ideas he came up with on the fly were very interesting to me and I would even love to read more on those ideas . Unfortunately , some of the lore they have been producing for some reason does n't grab my attention . <p> I have many characters who are empowered by ' magic ' . There 's the 10-thousand-plus year-old priestess of the various goddesses , who channeled so much divinity , that it soaked into her body . There 's the stubborn ( anti ) Valkyrie whose power is in dark seidr and ancient battle-wisdom . There 's the Nazi-era archaeologist , reborn and transformed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ancient wizard-philosophers , with his arcane understanding of the nature of gravity and his magical artifact . There 's the young guardian , whose only means of hiding the mystic object was to stuff it into his death-wound. where it got embedded and healed him . There 's the ' black paladin ' , the latest victim of an ancient family curse . I have the young girl whose origin can only be described as ' magic ' , spawned and empowered from the mists of ' dreamspace ' . And then there 's the caryatid . Mmm , and the ' demon ' spawned by backlashing magic and the sacrifice of a boy and his kitten . <p> To me magic itself " just exists " in the same way that electromagnetic radiation " just exists " . <p> The explanations I have seen here so far lean much more towards usage and/or manifestation of magical energy rather than its ultimate origin . For extra dimensional energy there still needs to be an explanation of how to tap into it so something in our dimension must exists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation of how those realities manifest in " our " reality and how to find the other reality with the effect one wants . <p> There is an infinite universe , multiverse , of options . Is it extra dimentional energy ? Is it trapped ribbons of faith ? Is it esoteric knowledge passed down through the ages ? Is it bargains with beings some would call demons or angels ? Is it being born with the essence of a long dead deity ? You tell us ! <p> Or ... all and none of these because every magical tradition has it 's own theory or belief about what magic is , but none really know . I always liked that one . Very encompassing . <p> Magic is the go-to word when the user of something does n't understand how that thing works . I think origin stories should be left up to the players . I would actually love for there to be a way for players to integrate their origin stories into the game ( perhaps like cross between Champions Online 's Nemesis system and CoH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly appreciate it if there were a variety of magical origins in the game . Magical origins whose lore may be based on various other sources from literature , comics , games , movies , and whatever else , but which are rooted in the unique lore of the game world . <p> Two reasons for this rationale:1 . Legal issues with intellectual property rights . This was something the CoH devs understood from the start . By now , i doubt there 's a single person on this forum who does n't know what i 'm talking about . So i wo n't go into detail . <p> 2 . Mundus Mysterium . That is , the mystery of the world . CoT is set to be one of the most customizable games in the history of gaming . Over time , MWM could add story missions that span every genre . If magic and technology are treated as two different lenses into the fundamental nature(s) of reality , then , as a writer , you have a cohesive framework upon which to setup and play with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of self , rational suppression of superpowers , the horror of the Other , and the discovery of the mystery of the world , just to name a few . <p> If my character can finish off an enemy by turning him to stone with a gaze , and your character can pull off that same feat by blowing magical dust , then i think that 's great ! There 's variety there . And we may each have our own explanations , as players and as characters , for how we do that . But i think the game world itself should offer actual lore mechanics that players must eventually buy into ( even if one of those choices is just " It 's magic because it 's magic . No one really understands how i do it yet . " ) . <p> For example , let 's say i have a power that brings down lightning bolts from the sky , because i launched a giant power crystal of my own making into orbit using a big ole rocket . That 's the start of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no concept of this beforehand , except insofar as it offers the power customization options to drop lighting bolts from overhead . Through a series of missions , i discover that there are others who can also call down lightning bolts from above . In fact , there 's an entire secret society of people who command various powers of the elements . Many of them have different explanations for how they harness the power , but at the root of what they do , they harness the " elementalism " lore mechanic . As a reward for joining their society , i can chose to have that lighting bolt power tagged as an elementalism power . This may then grant certain advantages and disadvantages throughout the rest of the game . Or i can decline to join them , believing that my power comes from somewhere else . Eventually , through another series of missions , i may discover that my lightning power is based on something else . <p> Cobalt Azurean wrote : To answer the OP : CoH played with this a bit in the Rikti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic was their anathema , which the Paragon Wiki confirms in the Spoiler Warning section .

Making your own up , is how we saw people putting the World of Darkness in City of Heroes and then seeing them screw that up . As a fan of the WoD and CoH , I found it so annoying : p Of course , them giving us lore wo n't stop that , so it comes down to " Why not give us lore reasons for things " ? We already know there 's going to boatloads of lore in CoT . The Devs have already given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the various factions over the years on this forum . If you want to base your characters 100% off of the lore pre-established by the Devs then have fun with that . My point is that this game should be open enough that if I want my " version " of magic ( as far as my character concepts goes ) to work differently from yours or from whatever the Devs come up with in their " lore " there should be absolutely no problem with that . Frankly no matter how good the Devs ' lore turns out to be I STILL do n't want to ever be locked into having to define my characters by it . Let me put it this way : Let 's say for example you hate " style X " but you love all things " style Y " . Now let 's say the Devs of CoT decided to try to make CoT as close to " style X " as they possibly could and even geared it so that your characters could only really be " explained " as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? That 's exactly why CoT should never " force itself " on the playerbase as far as its lore goes . The lore it provides should only be used as examples - it should never be there as things that we players must blindly accept as absolutely mandatory . <p> As an RPer , I like a little more lore in my RPs , so , in my hopes , it will avoid the " I put Mage : the Ascension into CoT ! " : p <p> By your theory , we can have vampires every hero knows about ( because that 's how it was in CoH , I will guess the same for CoT : p ) but then by your theory , we the players can also say " No one knows of the vampires , because they 're secret for my Vampire : the Masquerade background ! " : p <p> Magic is just the Force being used by everyone ! Throw some Star Wars in there ! <p> See , more concrete things , I believe , will help make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be nice to have some theories or schools of the many kinds of magic .

That points to the existence of the World Turtle . <p> " <p> " The illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths . " - PushkinVice Naivecrat <p> I would assume that the magic npc 's will have lore that explains the source of their particular magic . Players who have difficulty or who want inspiration could look to those npc 's for a ready made definition . <p> " Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect .

Not just something they threw together fast . <p> See , more concrete things , I believe , will help make a more solid RP community : p <p> One more time I 'm quite sure CoT will provide enough lore/story content so that if you want to define things like magic in terms of something " concrete " that the game will provide then knock yourself out with that . But by the same token I do n't think a game like this , which almost by definition must cater to a multiverse of ideas and concepts , should ever try to -dictate- any one specific definition for how ANYTHING works . <p> Let me put it this way : If this was going to be a Star Wars based game I would expect it to come up with a fairly well defined interpretation of the Force and how it works within the game . But since CoT is not going to be based on any specific preexisting universe it should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homebrewed optional " examples " based on its own internal lore/stories . <p> I get that what I 'm saying might make things " chaotic " from the point of view that every player who plays CoT might have their own definition of what a " vampire " is or might bring RP elements in from hundreds of other games . The trick is not to try to force everyone else to play the way you want them to - you just need to find the people most " like-minded " to you and play with those people . Let everyone else do whatever they want to do and be happy with that . <p> My interpretation of magic has been , for a long time , that it 's always user defined . So the user understands their own magic . Another magic user might never understand how perform the feats of another art . Or what might be a simple a feat as waving a hand for one might require the sacrifice of 100 toads , or their livers . And a person might be able to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultural or heritage limit on the art thus you get groups of people who understand magic in the same way . <p> Another part of this question , and this may get dicey ; ) In an arc I 'm writing , the villain collects artifacts from various gods of various religions .

Yep , Hell exists in CoX . <p> Leaving things " open " by way of just a lack of information or a lack of elaboration is very frustrating , personally . I want a greater level of depth sometimes in stories or universes , but at the same time , overwhelming someone with just a tidal wave of information is n't useful ( although , you might be able to achieve a feeling of wonder by revealing just how much stuff you *don't* know about the world ) .

Old deities are forgotten and rediscovered and the old religous practices of forgotten civilizations are adapted into new forms of magic .

If the power levels are to high for that to be plausible , perhaps you are actually dealing with the trident of +gir or the staff of Hades , misnamed by the mortals who believed the wrong mythology .

Do you really think CoT needs to be hyper-structured the way a Star Wars game should likely be ?

She was supposed to have a futuristic rifle and a cross-hairs-shaped tattoo over her one eye ( or just a cybernetic eye with a gowing crosshairs in it ) , and her name was " Cross-Eyed Mary " . I just never really got into playing her and deleted her after a while . <p> Edit : and my Mastermind was a character Dave Foley played on a sketch from Kids in the Hall . <p> I think leaving room for headcanon is one good thing CoH and CO had in common .

When in doubt , suggest instead of proscribe . <p> ( Speaking of anti-mutant sentiment and inferring lore I had an interesting conversation with a Champions PnP contributor on the CO forums over anti-AI sentiment in CO , since there were no android NPC heroes like Citadel or Luminary , but plenty of villainous Destroids , VIPER-hacked Snake Gulch robots , and Mechanon drones to beat up . I 've had a story idea simmering on a back burner about Mechanon , partisan media , and the act of Congress that gives AIs limited rights as citizens , but alas , CO will never get Foundry support .

Individual nutcases or groups thereof may disagree to the point of taking violent action , and concerned non-nutcases may disagree to the point of trying to change the law , but as it stands the worst the government in the Titanverse can legally do to your weird character without cause is try to have it sent home if it is an illegal alien . 
@@79253375 @753375/ <h> Super Group The 52 <p> I tried to start this group in CoH but did n't get too many . Not to be confused by DC comics , this group 's members would all be named after playing cards . It left the hero open to powers and costume design with exception to the red or black and white color scheme and of course the suit logo . This would also have limited membership of 52 or maybe 53 if you add the joker card . <p> That sounds like an interesting concept . You could even keep it to yourself and make 52 alts ! Each one styled after its own playing card ! You could even have certain common traits to all the hearts , diamonds , clubs and spades . There are a lot places you could take this . <p> I 'm thinking someone who 's more of a black ops type of character , it would make more sense for him to be one because the group is called the 52 making him an unlisted member kind of ... and the joker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like how an espionage type of character can throw a monkey wrench into the enemy 's plans without them even realizing <p> I was n't so much into making them all a certain type . I wanted the creators to have some freedom . For instance Ace of Spades was a darkness controller , My 2 of Diamonds was an archer with illusion powers . Jack of Clubs wielded double short swords . My Joker was a tanker with a giant club . I really thought as long as the group had the color theme and the heart club diamond or spade logo it would look great as we patrolled . Instead of stealing the name The 52 how about stealing House of Cards instead ? 
@@79253376 @753376/ <h> Idle Stances ? <p> Not sure if this has been asked or answered before , but I just thought I 'd go ahead and ask anyway . <p> With all this talk of aesthetic decoupling and being able to chose different animations for powers and stuff , I always wondered if it 'd be the same for our characters ' idle stances . When Champs Online launched , they promised ( and never delivered ) a bunch of different standing and moving animations , with only 4 making it into the game since launch and one of them is just an uglier version of the previous one . <p> So my question is , will we be able to chose how our characters stand and walk as well ? Things like standing around with a confident , puffed-up chest and a confident stride for the brave hero , or a cold , calculating stance with tented fingers tapping against each other for the plotting villain who likes to go " eeeexcellent .... " Or perhaps that a seductive stance for those sexy anti-heroines or even a floating stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something far too mundane for their personal tastes . <p> It 'd definitely add a whole lot more to the customization , that 's for sure ! <p> Yeah like Brainbot said I 'm like maybe 98.5% sure I remember talk of having alternative stances and walk cycles in CoT . <p> I played CO for its first few months and I recall being able to choose a stance was a cool feature that I wished CoH had . Perhaps having new versions periodically added to CoT after launch could be something they could sell in the game 's cash store . <p> Two words for y'all : idle animations Okay , technically , there are actually several variants of it that we 'll need to make sure are " compounded " right , but the Unreal system has some tricks that should work to our advantage there . This is not a promise , by any stretch , but things I would not be surprised at all to see ( because , well , we used a very pared-down version of them in the demo ) would be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight idle " , and what I will tentatively call a " combat idle " , which is the ' neutral pose ' used when in combat but not playing a specific animation . Any of these could potentially have " as many options as the Art department can come up with and the Business department will approve " . Whether it can switch " in sync " with costumes as a no-brainer is a lot less clear , but at the very worst it should be straightforward to have " some equivalent of " a macro that fires both a costume change and an animation-set update for you . This set of stuff depends on some technical details around *exactly* how we implement variant animations ( as in , things down in the gory details could have impact out this far ) , so I 'm afraid that it is n't possible to get more detailed than that , yet . However , a *lot* of this , or at least how it would be set up in the game , hinges on at least one crucial detail that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple weeks yet ( it involves how the engine handles a couple of specific things , internally ) . Signs that a clean and elegant solution would be possible are hopeful , but not more than that . <p> Any of these could potentially have " as many options as the Art department can come up with and the Business department will approve " . <p> This is the only sentence I needed to see . In the classic tradition of players taking what Devs say out of context this one sentence means we can have whatever stances we want whenever we want them ! : ) <p> While a sexy walk , I did n't think sex pot when it came to the walk . Confident , but sexy . What did people want ? Slouched with poor posture ? : p <p> The very first couple of Youtube vids I got when I googled " CoH female walk " both had soundtracks that suggested the people who created them probably thought it was a very , very sexy walk . Let 's just say there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway model " : <p> Now please do n't get me wrong here - like I said before what these vids show really did " fit " with many of my female characters . I really do honestly hope that CoT can recreate something like it for CoT . My point was that if I were to ask for -anything- related to female walking from the CoT Devs it would be that we get MORE than one style of it . I ca n't really see how you or anyone else could disapprove of having MORE options . <p> For example there 's really nothing wrong with having a slightly less " suggestively hip-swaying " version of walking . You know , really just a " basic " walk . And since you mentioned it having a " slouched with poor posture " version would not be bad either ( obviously assuming that was n't the ONLY version we had ) . What if I wanted to have a sort of " female zombie/hag " type character or some-such ? All I 'm saying is that there 's probably at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could have for both males and females from the very beginning and more could be added as time goes on . <p> Or how about the Marv strut from Sin City ? from 2:10 to 2:25 in the following video is the best example I could find : Mickey Rourke said he got that walk from watching an Irish gangster . <p> Sure that 's a good one . <p> I would also hope/assume any version of Walk they create would not be gender-locked . They already said they 're going to allow all costume items to be shared equally between males and females so doing the same for Walks makes sense . <p> Doctor Tyche wrote : I 'll be honest , we have a pile of idle stances , but wiring them up will be a late stage development . Well aslong as we can pick and choose from a small number of them , I 'll be happy : <p> notears wrote : Doctor Tyche wrote : I 'll be honest , we have a pile of idle stances , but wiring them up will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick and choose from a small number of them , I 'll be happy : Oh , you 're going to pick ? * brandishes Dance Gun . * smirks . <p> Yay on stances . I 'm not terribly picky as long as I can opt out of the common MMO idle stance where it seems that I 'm terribly out of breath . <p> Yeah I 've always thought that was a little funny . In the Devs ' desperate attempt to make it look like your character is actually " alive " by showing it actively breathing they always seem to take the breathing part a notch or two too far and make you look more like you 're trying to catch your breath after running a marathon . Sometimes adding a detail that 's almost unnoticeable ( like a normal person 's breathing ) is far better than making it too overt . I do n't mind if I have to pay REAL close attention to notice something subtle like that . 
@@79253378 @753378/ <h> Some successful Idea 's for PvP <p> I have been a part of many , many types of MMORPG 's over the years , whether they were Open world , Sandbox , whatever classification you you bring up I have most likely been a part of it . It goes all the way back to Ultima Online , Dark Age of Camelot , City of Heros , DC Universe , Age of Conan and everything in between all the way up to Conan Exiles , Gloria Victis , Life is Feudal and so on . So I have seem many many failures in the realm of PvP . One unsolved puzzle in super hero type games seems to be the PvP aspect because of the balancing issues with the powers , I can understand the issue because pairing a few powers together from a few players can create a dominating force , not only that but having the ability to upgrade those powers along the way through leveling , buying upgrades , Drops and so on can also provide a player with a great advantage over a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea 's for a successful ( What I consider successful ) start when CoT implements PvP into the game . <p> #1 . Open world PvP , This by far seems to the be most successful and loved by all players in games that I have played most recently . The idea of being able to log in and get into immediate action is what large number of players want these days , because let 's face it , once you are capped on level and towards the end game this is the style of PvP that keeps players logging in daily even when the most hardcore player only has say 30 minutes to an hour to play . On the same token , there will need to be provided a safe zone or a few to keep the other players safe who just love the story line quests , or just PvE grouping . My idea , Have the higher tier zones ... i.e. level 40 - 50 that you have to log into to get to large scale end game content , but also have it a PvP zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss area . Not only that but a large portion of the map just a mass PvP zone . <p> #2 . Players also want some recognition for being out there defending or hunting down villains in PvP .. aka other players . There should be some thought to impliment a point based system , example : A level 40 player kills a level 50 player in a PvP zone , that lower level player will receive points based on the difficulty of him taking down a higher player . These point then could be spent once a lot have been accumulated on gear , or special powers to that can only be used in assisting him a PvP zone . Similar to the Realm Point system in Dark Age of Camelot . You could call it Fame , or Renown points . Also a continually updated point list on a web site somewhere would be helpful and keep players out there and in the PvP zones , it 's a drive towards a goal . <p> #3 . PvP controlled areas for Guild or Clans . This is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Areas that Guilds , Clans , whatever you want to call them in game , that players can control to obtain materials for crafting better armors , mods to amplify their powers and so forth . I have never seen this idea in a Super Hero game and would like to . It would definitely give it a unique twist . <p> #4 . Resistances and attack bonuses. ! With a game like this where a player can potentially be attacked on an X , y , and Z , angles . I would like to see the potential for powers to be potentially cancelled by other players as a form of crowd control , if a player is flying overhead a tank type character , who only has jump that battle will not go so well , unless that tank has the ability to pull the flying player to the ground somehow . You can see this will get into the balancing issues that will come about in the early stages of the game . <p> I could go on and on because I really enjoy PvP in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth PvP action . <p> In what I have seen , in games that want to include PvP , the classes themselves all have to be viable . This means that classes that are n't viable , like dedicated healers , really have no place in PvP unless they are part of a team . Arenas make 1v1 PvP an optional thing so support specialists need not apply . And team PvP such as 5v5 or 20v20 are excellent showcases for good support players . But if you want open world PvP , you 'd have to find a way to make healers and tanks and support classes viable in solo PvP . <p> I thoroughly enjoy PvP and that 's why I am supporting Camelot Unchained . But unless CoT is 100% dedicated to PvP like CU is , I see open world PvP being a hindrance to CoT rather than a benefit . It is all about having to make sure the character classes are all balanced against each other . <p> So I would expect to see some arena PvP and some battlefield PvP between teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PvP for the sole reason that the developers would have to design the support and healer classes to be viable in that environment . I would prefer my support and healer characters to be able to specialize as supporters and healers without worry of being ineffectual in PvP . <p> City of Heroes had some PvP areas where anyone could fight against anyone . These have been the subject of more than a few threads in these forums and I ca n't repeat all that has been discussed therein . So for further opinions on open world PvP you could look in them to see the kinds of things people discuss , fond stories and frustrating ordeals . <p> The issue with a system of PvP in a game that increases your health etc through leveling will always cause problems . In Open PvP you will always get a subsection of the community that will pick off newer targets so that they can never risk losing . <p> As some others say a game really needs to be designed round open pvp , ive always viewed the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a standard hp rate that can increase only through taking an ability that affects the health pool , that way everyone both player and npc have similar hp levels and it becomes viable for a newer player to get lucky and take out that boss etc . <p> #1 .

I like the ingenuity of players to use powers in interesting and creative ways . <p> What I dislike are PvPers . The vast majority of my discontent with them comes initially from CoX and their PvP community . And that 's not to say that I have n't tried time and time again in the various games ( TSW , Rift , SWTOR , etc ) that I 've played since the sunsetting of CoX , but I 've been proven repeatedly that they 're cut from the same cloth . Not all of them , sure , since I also dislike broad generalizations , but the overall collective of them behaves in the same infuriating manner no matter what environment you put them in . <p> If it 's Open World PvP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't step foot in any game that has open world PvP , for that matter . And I can honestly say that most people that I played with would also not play a game that has open world PvP . Open world PvP removes the option for people to even do PvE . If you 're going to have a game that allows players flexibility in how they want to advance their characters , such as solo or grouped , then having the entirety of the world map being a place where you can get ganked , camped , your loot stolen and/or your home invaded and possibly taken , and therefore your fun time ruined for the sake of someone else 's enjoyment is n't even the vaguest notion of an option . <p> Quote : <p> Well , I believe the plan is to have a PvP instance of the game .

@@79253379 @753379/ <h> Twitch Stream <p> Hey guys , just wanted to mention that Doc and a few other devs are streaming every Friday night @ 7pm pacific / 10pm Eastern . Last night 's stream was very informative and Doc answered all of our questions . The stream is a great place where we can interact with the devs and get a look into the sausage making process . Sadly though the chat was n't recorded but Doc still answered the questions we posted . Hopefully in the future the chat will be recorded as well . All in all a great stream and well worth looking at . 
@@79253380 @753380/ <h> Super Group The 52 <p> I tried to start this group in CoH but did n't get too many . Not to be confused by DC comics , this group 's members would all be named after playing cards . It left the hero open to powers and costume design with exception to the red or black and white color scheme and of course the suit logo . This would also have limited membership of 52 or maybe 53 if you add the joker card . <p> That sounds like an interesting concept . You could even keep it to yourself and make 52 alts ! Each one styled after its own playing card ! You could even have certain common traits to all the hearts , diamonds , clubs and spades . There are a lot places you could take this . <p> I 'm thinking someone who 's more of a black ops type of character , it would make more sense for him to be one because the group is called the 52 making him an unlisted member kind of ... and the joker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like how an espionage type of character can throw a monkey wrench into the enemy 's plans without them even realizing <p> I was n't so much into making them all a certain type . I wanted the creators to have some freedom . For instance Ace of Spades was a darkness controller , My 2 of Diamonds was an archer with illusion powers . Jack of Clubs wielded double short swords . My Joker was a tanker with a giant club . I really thought as long as the group had the color theme and the heart club diamond or spade logo it would look great as we patrolled . Instead of stealing the name The 52 how about stealing House of Cards instead ?

I did n't find it entertaining either , but I certainly was n't bothered by it ... other than it being just weird . Perhaps it was the outlandish portrayal of the animated characters that convinced me that it could n't possibly be taken serious .

This is one of them . <p> No , it 's a little trick called ' being patronizing ' , and you nailed it . Must be one of those habits you picked up from television , movies , novels , comic books , etc . At this juncture , there 's no point on my part to even attempt to enter into intelligent discourse with someone who does n't appear remotely interested in the possibility that they could be wrong . Finally , analysis is as only as good as the data , but not when it is clearly being bent through personal/observational bias , as seen here . I think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me names for having an opinion dissenting from the majority . I 'm used to it . However , in my own defense , here is a little video clip that showed up in my Facebook newsfeed a couple days ago . It is entirely unrealistic , horribly unsafe , and completely hilarious ! <p> Indulge me another " patronizing " moment while I attempt to explain the difference . <p> The video of the anime character dancing while firing off two handguns in random directions is targeted at teenagers . For all I know , it might have been made by a teenager . The person who made the video depicts firearms as mere props . There is no awareness nor understanding of the lethality of firearms . As close as the two characters in that video are , even if the handguns are loaded with blanks , there is a very high probability that either the dancing girl or her friend would be severely injured by a ricochet . The cardboard or wax plug in a blank can be lethal at such close ranges , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never considered either of those qualities to be " funny " . <p> In the video clip from the DOA movie there is never any doubt of the lethality of the firearms . In fact , lethality is exactly the point of the video clip . The intended audience are adults , mature people who understand the consequences of foolish choices . The scene is carefully choreographed and filmed in a manner that displays excellent muzzle awareness on behalf of the choreographer , even if that awareness is completely accidental . The humorous quality of the scene is created by the unexpected outcome and enhanced by the clear depiction of lethality . Is it realistic ? No . Is it safe ? No . Is it funny and entertaining ? Yes . It is exactly the opposite of the anime clip . <p> Sooner or later some teenager is going to attempt to duplicate that dancing anime character . It is inevitable . It is what they do . Anyone who has raised teenagers knows and understands this . No one is ever going to attempt to duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choreography itself emphasizes the potential lethality of the scene . No one is going to come into these forums and say , " Look at these cool moves ! CoT has to have these fight animations ! " <p> That is what makes the anime character dancing while firing handguns so dangerous . It creates a sense of harmless fun and that sense of harmless fun encourages mimicry in an audience that is naturally inclined to use mimicry as a way of developing their own personal values . <p> I can not help but wonder , how many of you calling me a " stick in the mud " or something similar have raised children to adulthood ? How many of you have seen firsthand a teenager experimenting with life by duplicating some scene from a popular anime ? How many of you have seen the disastrous results of someone using a firearm in imitation of something they saw in a cartoon or movie ? <p> I am a Patron member of the NRA . I am an avid firearms enthusiast with a pretty fair collection of handguns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a week . I am in favor of a global version of the Second Amendment . I want to see more non-law enforcement , non-military , everyday people all around the world carrying a firearm for self-defense . I also want to see far more scenes like the one in DOA and none like the video clip of an anime character firing off handguns with no sense of muzzle awareness . <p> If that makes me a grumpy old man that 's perfectly fine by me . <p> Edit : for what it 's worth ( and I realize it 's worth nothing ) I did not see the good Doctor 's admonition before posting this . <p> I think in general it is fair enough to say that people try so hard to be understood that they forget to try to understand others . @Greyhawk , your last post ( #59 ) is well written and I think makes an excellent case for anyone who would attempt to understand you . <p> But to complete the circle , we must have two things : First we need people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to understand others ' points of view . I think you have demonstrated that you understand them , but you disagree . No one could ask for more . <p> If others admit they understand you and still disagree , claiming that the anime video is still funny in their eyes and that you are still being a stick in the mud who takes himself too seriously , then this entire discussion is over . No one should expect other people to be anything other than who they are . Some jokes and stuations are funny to some people and not to others . We 're all individual humans and to expect otherwise is quite fruitless . <p> I am reminded of sitcoms with friends , like Friends or Big Bang Theory , or That 70 's show . There are people in those ensembles who would never be friends in real life because in real life we are far less forgiving and far less understanding of people who see things differently than we do . But I 've always wondered what life would be like if we accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of trying to change them or prove them wrong . <p> I think a good example we could all follow is the jiggle thread . There were moments in that thread where it got nasty , but in the end it became somewhat of a comedy as everyone just accepted themselves for who they were and what they believed ; that they were never going to change other people 's minds . And I think the participants ended up with a bit more respect for each other as a result , and I think people were able to laugh at each other and themselves as well . I would hope that we all can still respect each other here , whether we agree or not . I think that respect is something we can bring to City of Titans when it launches . City of Heroes was known for its great community and still is remembered for it . Let 's keep that spirit alive .

Last night 's stream was very informative and Doc answered all of our questions . The stream is a great place where we can interact with the devs and get a look into the sausage making process .

@@79253387 @753387/ <h> Some successful Idea 's for PvP <p> I have been a part of many , many types of MMORPG 's over the years , whether they were Open world , Sandbox , whatever classification you you bring up I have most likely been a part of it . It goes all the way back to Ultima Online , Dark Age of Camelot , City of Heros , DC Universe , Age of Conan and everything in between all the way up to Conan Exiles , Gloria Victis , Life is Feudal and so on . So I have seem many many failures in the realm of PvP . One unsolved puzzle in super hero type games seems to be the PvP aspect because of the balancing issues with the powers , I can understand the issue because pairing a few powers together from a few players can create a dominating force , not only that but having the ability to upgrade those powers along the way through leveling , buying upgrades , Drops and so on can also provide a player with a great advantage over a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea 's for a successful ( What I consider successful ) start when CoT implements PvP into the game . <p> #1 . Open world PvP , This by far seems to the be most successful and loved by all players in games that I have played most recently . The idea of being able to log in and get into immediate action is what large number of players want these days , because let 's face it , once you are capped on level and towards the end game this is the style of PvP that keeps players logging in daily even when the most hardcore player only has say 30 minutes to an hour to play . On the same token , there will need to be provided a safe zone or a few to keep the other players safe who just love the story line quests , or just PvE grouping . My idea , Have the higher tier zones ... i.e. level 40 - 50 that you have to log into to get to large scale end game content , but also have it a PvP zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss area . Not only that but a large portion of the map just a mass PvP zone . <p> #2 . Players also want some recognition for being out there defending or hunting down villains in PvP .. aka other players . There should be some thought to impliment a point based system , example : A level 40 player kills a level 50 player in a PvP zone , that lower level player will receive points based on the difficulty of him taking down a higher player . These point then could be spent once a lot have been accumulated on gear , or special powers to that can only be used in assisting him a PvP zone . Similar to the Realm Point system in Dark Age of Camelot . You could call it Fame , or Renown points . Also a continually updated point list on a web site somewhere would be helpful and keep players out there and in the PvP zones , it 's a drive towards a goal . <p> #3 . PvP controlled areas for Guild or Clans . This is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Areas that Guilds , Clans , whatever you want to call them in game , that players can control to obtain materials for crafting better armors , mods to amplify their powers and so forth . I have never seen this idea in a Super Hero game and would like to . It would definitely give it a unique twist . <p> #4 . Resistances and attack bonuses. ! With a game like this where a player can potentially be attacked on an X , y , and Z , angles . I would like to see the potential for powers to be potentially cancelled by other players as a form of crowd control , if a player is flying overhead a tank type character , who only has jump that battle will not go so well , unless that tank has the ability to pull the flying player to the ground somehow . You can see this will get into the balancing issues that will come about in the early stages of the game . <p> I could go on and on because I really enjoy PvP in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth PvP action . <p> In what I have seen , in games that want to include PvP , the classes themselves all have to be viable . This means that classes that are n't viable , like dedicated healers , really have no place in PvP unless they are part of a team . Arenas make 1v1 PvP an optional thing so support specialists need not apply . And team PvP such as 5v5 or 20v20 are excellent showcases for good support players . But if you want open world PvP , you 'd have to find a way to make healers and tanks and support classes viable in solo PvP . <p> I thoroughly enjoy PvP and that 's why I am supporting Camelot Unchained . But unless CoT is 100% dedicated to PvP like CU is , I see open world PvP being a hindrance to CoT rather than a benefit . It is all about having to make sure the character classes are all balanced against each other . <p> So I would expect to see some arena PvP and some battlefield PvP between teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PvP for the sole reason that the developers would have to design the support and healer classes to be viable in that environment . I would prefer my support and healer characters to be able to specialize as supporters and healers without worry of being ineffectual in PvP . <p> City of Heroes had some PvP areas where anyone could fight against anyone . These have been the subject of more than a few threads in these forums and I ca n't repeat all that has been discussed therein . So for further opinions on open world PvP you could look in them to see the kinds of things people discuss , fond stories and frustrating ordeals . <p> The issue with a system of PvP in a game that increases your health etc through leveling will always cause problems . In Open PvP you will always get a subsection of the community that will pick off newer targets so that they can never risk losing . <p> As some others say a game really needs to be designed round open pvp , ive always viewed the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a standard hp rate that can increase only through taking an ability that affects the health pool , that way everyone both player and npc have similar hp levels and it becomes viable for a newer player to get lucky and take out that boss etc . <p> #1 . Open world PvP , This by far seems to the be most successful and loved by all players in games that I have played most recently .

My idea , Have the higher tier zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log into to get to large scale end game content , but also have it a PvP zone where players can fight for the right to farm a boss area . Not only that but a large portion of the map just a mass PvP zone . <p> I like the idea of PvP . I like the ingenuity of players to use powers in interesting and creative ways . <p> What I dislike are PvPers . The vast majority of my discontent with them comes initially from CoX and their PvP community . And that 's not to say that I have n't tried time and time again in the various games ( TSW , Rift , SWTOR , etc ) that I 've played since the sunsetting of CoX , but I 've been proven repeatedly that they 're cut from the same cloth . Not all of them , sure , since I also dislike broad generalizations , but the overall collective of them behaves in the same infuriating manner no matter what environment you put them in . <p> If it 's Open World PvP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't step foot in any game that has open world PvP , for that matter . And I can honestly say that most people that I played with would also not play a game that has open world PvP . Open world PvP removes the option for people to even do PvE . If you 're going to have a game that allows players flexibility in how they want to advance their characters , such as solo or grouped , then having the entirety of the world map being a place where you can get ganked , camped , your loot stolen and/or your home invaded and possibly taken , and therefore your fun time ruined for the sake of someone else 's enjoyment is n't even the vaguest notion of an option . <p> Quote : <p> Well , I believe the plan is to have a PvP instance of the game . That 's because the majority of our community has zero interest in PvP . <p> I , for one , hope this is the case . Again , I enjoy PvP from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divide between PvE and PvP because that allows options for people that enjoy either or both . <p> I do n't understand ppl that are against open world PVP .

I played a stalker and a Dom and it was such a thrill pwning another player and talking trash . It became a strategy , a hunt , and changed the whole aspect of the game for me . From time to time it was fun to just hang out and talk about random crap but knowing that at any moment you could get targeted and ganked made it so much more fun . <p> I remember this one time , I was happily flying back to my base , and I was so close but I suddenly got tped into a giant crate .

Besides did n't always seem weird that you had to travel all the way to Recluse 's Victory just to be able to PvP in a zone that looked identical to Atlas Park ? ; ) <p> In a game that 's just heroes vs. villains , it 's pretty clear how you can split zones between blue , red , and PvP . <p> In this game , with its three-orthogonal-axis alignment system , it 's not clear at all how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three steps on each axis ( -1 , 0 , +1 ) , that 's 27 combinations .

Are all of these likenesses " copyrighted " in such as way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an interesting legal question to say the least . ; ) <p> Regardless of all that I did actually ask for a slight " modification " to my version of the building for CoT which could very well make it " different " enough so that it is n't legally considered an exact duplicate . I 'm also reasonably sure that the CoT art Devs would be able to " tweak " whatever else they 'd consider necessary to make it work for the game . I do n't need my building to be 100% identical to the real thing down to the nuts and bolts - as long as it looks even remotely like it I 'll probably be happy with it . <p> Can a real life building be " copyrighted " to prevent anyone from recreating a reasonable facsimile of it in a computer game ? <p> I wish I could say " No . " But in the past couple decades , the rich folk realized there was a lot of money to be made selling the rights to images/shapes/whatever of real things they own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . <p> You know those plastic models of things like cars and military aircraft that people put together ? About when the F-22 went into service , Lockheed realized they could be selling licenses for those model kits and sent their lawyers after the kit makers . Makers had to pay license fees around $50/kit for kits they had been selling in the $20-30 range . I bought a V-22 model for my uncle last Christmas and it was almost $100 . <p> So yeah , I 'll bet that the landlords , architects , and so forth have a hand in the till and license this stuff out , and your copy of Flight Simulator or whatever covers in part licensing fees to any building owners who asserted rights . The key is when the building was built . Maybe the Empire State Building has passed into the public domain , but the Burj Khalifa probably has n't . And your Lego kits probably have the same license fee buried in them , though not the ruinous levels model kits have . Lego , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out of business if they do n't get that license . <p> I wish I could say " No . " But in the past couple decades , the rich folk realized there was a lot of money to be made selling the rights to images/shapes/whatever of real things they own . Rent-seeking to a T. It was like free money for them . <p> You know those plastic models of things like cars and military aircraft that people put together ?

Lego , at least , can full well just drop a kit ; they 're not out of business if they do n't get that license . <p> You do know that MS Flight Simulator ( MSFS ) had accurate renditions of buildings in cities all around the world . I would think the chances that MS paid " licensing fees " to nearly countless notable building owners both foreign and domestic is just about nil . Remember that versions of MSFS were actually buried as a " free Easter eggs " in some of MS 's more famous Office applications so it 's hardly likely that MS would freely hand out a product that they themselves ever had to pay licensing fees for . <p> Yes I get that some specific things ( like your F-22/V-22 model example ) could have licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ) could claim they were the " sole owner " of that object being licensed . On the other hand I would suspect that most modern skyscrapers are not technically " owned " by a single company that could impose such a mandate on a global scale . Let me put it this way : The image of the Burj Khalifa is plastered on every kind of tourist trinket imaginable in the U.A.E. The chances that all of those items ( even within the confines of the U.A.E. ) have accounted for a " licensing fee " is almost laughably remote . Even if the big malls pay fees the smaller souk venders certainly do n't . <p> Anyway as I pointed out I 've already asked for " modifications " to my Mogul the likes of which are probably enough to pass any foreseeable " fair use " legal concern , assuming there is any in the first place . I would be amazed if I were the only Mogul player who asked for something that could even remotely be considered " copyrighted " so if this actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible they may be dealing with a bunch of " questionable " cases . <p> Regardless I 'll be happy to work with the art Devs and would obviously accept any modifications they think would be needed . Remember that this ENTIRE GAME is technically under at least a vague amount of legal jeopardy from NCsoft for trying to effectively " copy " CoH . I doubt my single Mogul building would add to that to any serious degree . 
@@79253394 @753394/ <h> REST <p> Hi , I recently asked this on another post and was encouraged to post it here . <p> Is CoT going to have its own version of the Rest power ? <p> And if it is , is it going to have any downfalls such as , being more susceptible to damage while in Rest mode ? <p> I feel like this is an obvious question because how else are we going to get our health and end back up without some form of rest , but i 'm curious if its going to be called the same and if the animation will also be the same , dropping down to one knee and all that . <p> They better have a Rest power .

So unless they make something ridiculous like when you toggle Rest , you lay down on the ground , I 'm confident it will be identical to what COH had . <p> I 've played games ( e.g. Tabula Rasa ) where you heal fast as soon as you get out of combat . No rest power . It made out-of-combat healing kind of pointless . <p> Hmm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different reasons . I 'll use COH as an example . <p> In PVP , it was like winning the lottery when you came across another player who thought they had hidden pretty well , and were resting . Their defenses were down , their attention was unfocused . It made for an easy kill . It rarely happened , most people knew not to do that , but when it did , it was hilarious . <p> In PvE , there was something about the visual of seeing other players/heroes/villains , needing to rest and take a breather , especially after defeating a boss or a huge mob . It showed the vulnerable side of being a hero/villain . I 'm not trying to get all deep with this , but when the team had to rest after a huge fight , it gave us all a chance to crack a joke or enjoy the brief moment of the craziness of the last battle before moving on to the next group . <p> Sometimes I think going from mob to mob without a break takes some of the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. Tabula Rasa ) where you heal fast as soon as you get out of combat . No rest power . It made out-of-combat healing kind of pointless . <p> Yeah I think that 's the real point here . I 'm not worried about how the " animation " for a Rest power might look in CoT ; I 'm more interested in whether or not the game mechanics will even call for needing a Rest power in the first place . <p> In PVP , it was like winning the lottery when you came across another player who thought they had hidden pretty well , and were resting .

But again if the game mechanics of CoT are such that the idea of having a separate independent Rest power is obsolete I would n't be too upset by that . As I mentioned earlier about the only substantial use I ever got out of the Rest power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even I would n't consider that a " meaningful " or " intended " use of the power . <p> There is a version of Rest . Having high out of combat health recovery is too much of a leverage in maintaining combat pace . You 're only focrced to slow down " just enough " before the next encounter . Which in turn , makes maintaining Momentum a lot easier . And in case the idea if making Momentum deplete faster out of combat to compensate - would make Reserves restore that much faster . Hence , we will have a version of Rest in order to offer players a way to recover from time to time . <p> Hence , we will have a version of Rest in order to offer players a way to recover from time to time . <p> Good to know either way .

Do you have a link to the badge it helped you get ? : ) <p> Using Rest by itself did n't give you badges directly . It was primarily used while farming for the Immortal damage badge ( and by extension the other 5 lesser damage badges ) so that you could take more damage per unit time . The net effect could allow you finish off damage farming many weeks ( or even months ) quicker . Rest was simply a part of the overall damage farming exploit . <p> But as I said as long as CoT does n't make the same mistake of making its Immortal-type badge requirement be so high that you 're effectively FORCED to resort to farming for it then you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *shrugs* <p> I agree strongly with having a Rest power instead of using fast regen out of combat . Out-of-combat state is not always correctly detected in games and has - annoyingly - prevented me from properly healing even when safe . CoH 's rest power never had this problem , and worked perfectly whenever it was needed . It also allowed a team to take aggro from and defend a resting , injured teammate mid-fight , which was a nice feature . <p> I feel like this is an obvious question because how else are we going to get our health and end back up without some form of rest , but i 'm curious if its going to be called the same and if the animation will also be the same , dropping down to one knee and all that . <p> I 'm sure that would be one option but I certainly hope it 's not the only one since I can fully see that other animation would be much more appropriate for certain character concepts . <p> Tannim222 wrote : Hence , we will have a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from time to time .

That 's like giving the winner of the superbowl a free cookie as a reward for not having to punt or something . <p> Radiac , bringing momentum into the discussion was a good call .

I suppose this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerset . <p> So you would in effect be exchanging reserves for a quicker recovery , but rather than actually using reserves you are tapping into momentum directly . <p> I would prefer this because what if you had used up your reserves in battle and now had to wait for your momentum to bleed into more reserves to use them to rest ? That seems too convoluted and would take too long to be useful . Using momentum directly would bypass all that and bring you back up faster . <p> It does seem to logically follow that you 'll probably only WANT a Rest power for use when you need to recover HP and endo , but have no Reserves left with which to do that the fast way . Thus , the price you pay for squandering all of your Reserves on buffs while fighting is that you now have none for healing and catching a breath when you need it .

@@79253395 @753395/ <h> REST <p> Hi , I recently asked this on another post and was encouraged to post it here . <p> Is CoT going to have its own version of the Rest power ? <p> And if it is , is it going to have any downfalls such as , being more susceptible to damage while in Rest mode ? <p> I feel like this is an obvious question because how else are we going to get our health and end back up without some form of rest , but i 'm curious if its going to be called the same and if the animation will also be the same , dropping down to one knee and all that . <p> They better have a Rest power .

No rest power . It made out-of-combat healing kind of pointless . <p> Hmm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different reasons . I 'll use COH as an example . <p> In PVP , it was like winning the lottery when you came across another player who thought they had hidden pretty well , and were resting . Their defenses were down , their attention was unfocused . It made for an easy kill . It rarely happened , most people knew not to do that , but when it did , it was hilarious . <p> In PvE , there was something about the visual of seeing other players/heroes/villains , needing to rest and take a breather , especially after defeating a boss or a huge mob . It showed the vulnerable side of being a hero/villain . I 'm not trying to get all deep with this , but when the team had to rest after a huge fight , it gave us all a chance to crack a joke or enjoy the brief moment of the craziness of the last battle before moving on to the next group . <p> Sometimes I think going from mob to mob without a break takes some of the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. Tabula Rasa ) where you heal fast as soon as you get out of combat .

But again if the game mechanics of CoT are such that the idea of having a separate independent Rest power is obsolete I would n't be too upset by that . As I mentioned earlier about the only substantial use I ever got out of the Rest power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even I would n't consider that a " meaningful " or " intended " use of the power . <p> There is a version of Rest . Having high out of combat health recovery is too much of a leverage in maintaining combat pace . You 're only focrced to slow down " just enough " before the next encounter . Which in turn , makes maintaining Momentum a lot easier . And in case the idea if making Momentum deplete faster out of combat to compensate - would make Reserves restore that much faster . Hence , we will have a version of Rest in order to offer players a way to recover from time to time . <p> Hence , we will have a version of Rest in order to offer players a way to recover from time to time . <p> Good to know either way .

Do you have a link to the badge it helped you get ? : ) <p> Using Rest by itself did n't give you badges directly . It was primarily used while farming for the Immortal damage badge ( and by extension the other 5 lesser damage badges ) so that you could take more damage per unit time . The net effect could allow you finish off damage farming many weeks ( or even months ) quicker . Rest was simply a part of the overall damage farming exploit . <p> But as I said as long as CoT does n't make the same mistake of making its Immortal-type badge requirement be so high that you 're effectively FORCED to resort to farming for it then you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *shrugs* <p> I agree strongly with having a Rest power instead of using fast regen out of combat . Out-of-combat state is not always correctly detected in games and has - annoyingly - prevented me from properly healing even when safe .

It also allowed a team to take aggro from and defend a resting , injured teammate mid-fight , which was a nice feature . <p> I feel like this is an obvious question because how else are we going to get our health and end back up without some form of rest , but i 'm curious if its going to be called the same and if the animation will also be the same , dropping down to one knee and all that . <p> I 'm sure that would be one option but I certainly hope it 's not the only one since I can fully see that other animation would be much more appropriate for certain character concepts . <p> Tannim222 wrote : Hence , we will have a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from time to time .

I just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the avoidance of using a specific basic power like Rest because again if the Devs gave us a scenario where it 's better NOT to use such a power you could logically ask the question why the power should even be in the game in the first place . <p> Whether or not you might get rewarded for not using Rest , the question in my mind currently is this : <p> Should Rest cause you to lose or burn off Reserves in order to reset your HP and Endo to full ( while simultaneously draining your Momentum into refilling Reserves , presumably ) ? <p> I 'm assuming that normal use of Reserves will be able to heal you and/or recover endo , so if you have any Reserves , just burning Reserves might get you more bang for the buck than stopping to Rest . As such , maybe Rest ought to give you the ability to reset your green and blue bars to full without it costing you any Reserves . But then what is the opportunity cost of using Rest instead of burning Recerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rest has a long recharge , can be interrupted , makes you vulnerable while Resting , etc ? If so , what happens when you get interrupted , you just get defeated outright , presumably ? Assuming you choose to Rest like we did in CoX , after the mob is defeated but before we go to aggro the next mob , then Rest is slowing you down , which in itself is reason to try to make a build that does n't need to Rest like ever , if you can avoid it . Rewarding people MORE for doing something they 're already trying to do in this sense does n't seem necessary . That 's like giving the winner of the superbowl a free cookie as a reward for not having to punt or something . <p> Radiac , bringing momentum into the discussion was a good call . As I understand it , momentum naturally bleeds away ; turning into reserves as it does . <p> So what if we had a way of diverting that bleed into a rest instead . I suppose this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerset . <p> So you would in effect be exchanging reserves for a quicker recovery , but rather than actually using reserves you are tapping into momentum directly . <p> I would prefer this because what if you had used up your reserves in battle and now had to wait for your momentum to bleed into more reserves to use them to rest ? That seems too convoluted and would take too long to be useful . Using momentum directly would bypass all that and bring you back up faster . <p> It does seem to logically follow that you 'll probably only WANT a Rest power for use when you need to recover HP and endo , but have no Reserves left with which to do that the fast way . Thus , the price you pay for squandering all of your Reserves on buffs while fighting is that you now have none for healing and catching a breath when you need it . Unless , of course , you 're playing on a team and you 've got a friend who can give you healz and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party , by allowing the DPS person to waste more Reserves on Damage buffs or whatever .

@@79253402 @753402/ <h> This is how I wound up here <p> I 've been getting some pushback lately from folks making assumptions about my state of mind or my intent . That 's not surprising , really , all anyone knows is my forum tag and my wizard profile pic . Still , there are a few things that I 'd like to share in order to avoid such confusion in the future . <p> I 'm 56 years old . I doubt I 'm the oldest person in these forums , but I 'm certainly in that neighborhood . My two sons are 28 and 29 , probably about the same age as the average forum user here at City of Titans . This is important because there are many assumptions folks make about the gaming industry that just are n't true . I know . I 've been here since Pong , and before that I owned the top spot at half the arcade games in town . I 've been active online since the days of TCP/IP and dial up BBS connections so slow I had to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packets would get lost along the way and all that would be left would be gibberish . <p> I moved to Tokyo with my brand new Japanese wife right after I left the U.S. Army . That would be in February 1985 , long before Nintendo rewrote entertainment history with the Famicom and Super Mario . In those days , " Made in Japan " was just beginning to be something associated with quality . Not even ten years earlier no one in the US would even consider buying a Sony product because getting any kind of warranty service was a gamble with worse odds than Keno . A lot has changed since then , as everyone knows . <p> I first became familiar with NC Soft products with the Japan Closed Beta for Lineage II . My Japanese subscription pushed me to the head of the line for Closed Beta keys for the US release . In those days regionalism had not yet become a problem with online games . Soon I had both an American and a Japanese subscription to Lineage II . I got an email with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heroes . I went and joined their forum and participated in a few discussions . Then I wrote them back thanking them for the opportunity and suggesting they pass it on to someone else because I had no means to reserve or purchase a copy of the game client . I got a nice letter back asking if the postal address I used at PlayNC was my real address . I assured them it was . Two weeks later I received an air freight box with Lineage II and CoH tee shirts , a Lineage II Coca Cola can from Korea , and a copy of City of Heroes . <p> In those days NC Soft had some of the best customer service in the world . I know that 's hard to believe now . <p> Day One of the first Closed Beta of City of Heroes ( there were two , as I recall , though I do n't remember why ) . I 'm in Atlas Park right around an hour after the server went live . I get my first Skulls mission . I still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if any ) leads to some zone called , " Galaxy City " . I 'm standing in front of Ms. Liberty trying to figure this all out when a new character pops into existence and immediately sends me a Team Invite . I tried to dismiss it and accidentally accepted it . Next thing I know I have the star , I 'm the team leader , two more people have joined the team , I 'm level 5 , they 're all level 2 , I 'm trying to figure out how to use Team Chat , and they 're all asking where the next mission is . <p> So I scream out in Broadcast , " Go ! Hunt ! Kill Skulls ! " <p> Two or three days later the " kill skuls " graffiti shows up , the forum is buzzing with condescension , and I 'm still trying to figure out why my level 10 hero ca n't survive more than two minutes inside the Hollows . <p> ESRB , CERO , and all the rest are partly my fault . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress suggesting an age standard be applied to video games , especially online games . I had no idea the monster we were unleashing on the world . I had two ten year-old sons who loved video games . The problem was , walking into a video game store in Tokyo was no better than walking into a porn shop . Easily two-thirds of the boxes featured naked or semi-naked women with promises of seduction and pleasure hiding inside the box . SoE was just getting warmed up , Japanese versions of PC games were being shipped to the US by the tens of thousands and most of those games were n't simple side-scrolling adventure games . Many of the first top-selling Japanese games in America were anime-style dating sims and some of those sims were more graphic than XXX-rated American porn . <p> American video game makers pushed the early version of what became the ESRB rating system not as a way to preserve the innocence of young children , but as a way to stop the flood of dating sims being bought up by teenage boys . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from American Customs Enforcement , created CERO . <p> It was Issue 3 before I became a regular in City of Heroes , but City of Villains is what really started my obsession . By then it was already becoming clear that NC Soft Korea was not fond of American players . As Lineage II blossomed to tens of millions in Korea for a short while NC Soft considered closing down their American servers altogether and abandoning the American market entirely . Three times my PlayNC account was locked out on accusations of " farming " , not because I had rich characters ( I did n't ) but simply because I was accessing from Asia for a few months , then back to America for a few months , then back to Asia . Every time I moved from one country to the other my account got locked until I sent them copies of my drivers license , original box labels , and passport . That got to be very annoying very quickly . <p> Unknown to most people in the US is something that was headline news over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NC Soft were debating the future of the CoH franchise NC Soft was being sued in Korea by two different subsidiary partner companies that were trying to achieve a hostile takeover of the company . NC Soft Korea was spending millions maintaining Paragon Studios , money that they needed to fight off these two hostile takeovers . Even though CoH was profitable , the cost structure represented a far higher figure than the profit , making it highly beneficial for them to close down Paragon Studios and use that money for lawyers in Korea . The reason they did not sell the franchise is because none of the cash offers would have been enough to make a meaningful dent in their legal fees . Additionally , Asian companies in general never sell intellectual property rights . They steal them , ignore them , corner them , or hoard them , but they never sell them . <p> So next time I throw out a sentence that some of you do n't understand and do n't agree with , please do n't assume my opinion is based on some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry for a very long time and I 've spent decades trapped in this weird space between two different legal systems , two different player communities , two different markets , and two radically different cultures . <p> More often not , I know what I 'm talking about from firsthand experience . <p> Glad to know you , Greyhawk , I 'm only a little younger than you and not nearly as well-travelled . I , too , started with Pong and lost too many quarters at the arcade . I missed the whole console thing , basically due to culture , and got my first experience of video games on a brand new 128k Mac . I can still remember the ' song ' of a 5600 baud modem dialing-in . In the early 90s I was introduced to EverQuest and I 've been an MMO player ever since . I still get a touch weepy , when I think of my first guild . *sigh* <p> Huh , I 've never seen a post of yours that struck me as bigoted or ignorant . I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then of course I have n't read every single thread and post , so maybe I just missed em . <p> I was n't Beta , but I was a serious player right from initial release straight through till lights off--cause my friends who already played UO through to WoW , none of which interested me , told me there was a game out where you could make up a freaking Superhero and play , and I absolutely grew up on comics . Matter of fact , I never played any other MMO before or during , only AFTER lights out . And my ( 8 yr old at the time ? I think ? ) son who 's 21 now grew up on the game . My first character was a six-slotted rad/rad " Offender " named Dr. Megaton ! My son 's first character was a giant grey feline broadsword scrapper named Big Bad Cat ! <p> Even though i 'm in my early 30s I have the memory of a 70 year old . I do n't remember much but I do remember when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not having friends or a job , I was kinda bored and lonely . I remember one day seeing the box set of COH on clearance at Target . I had no idea what COH was but the art on the cover intrigued me so I bought the game and installed it . When I first logged in , I was captivated by the amount of customization for my character . I spent hours just playing around with costumes and power sets . I think the first night I stayed up until 6am . One of the very first memories I had was logging into Atlas Park and running around excited to kill my first enemy . I remember using one of the lightning powers to kill an enemy that had been fighting another player and I thought I was being helpful . That 's where I first learned you do n't steal someones kill lol . <p> Greyhawk ! Great insight ! Thanks . I 've been gaming since the 70 's . First the arcade , then the Atari , then NES , SNES , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all just been PC gaming . And only in America . Thanks for sharing your story with us . <p> I can still vaguely remember the first time i logged into City of Heroes . I 'd played EQ for years . Yet , everything was so new in CoH , back in 2004 ! Somehow , the combination of art style , music , missions , powers , baddies , atmosphere , base building , lore , and the other players all came together in the perfect synthesis : I felt like i had found " home " . I loved the character creator . I loved being able to fly . No matter what was going on in my life , regardless of whether i wanted to log in on a particular day , or whether i even could log in ( if i was off doing something else of importance ) , just knowing that that virtual world existed and was waiting for me was comforting . I have n't felt quite right since 2012 . Since my home was taken from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've been looking forward to CoT 's release for these past 4 years . I wish i could quit my day job and just contribute to building this world . I need a new home .

So the robot ( wizard ) remarks about the boring cop ( dog person ) and the other player asks the wizard ( robot ) if he spend too much time staring in crystal balls to see the dog ( boring cop ) .

The way he sways a bit and how close together the legs are and how high the feet go up makes the animation look a bit off . I saw this on the untextured models but I figured it was still early and you guys would tidy it up a bit but seeing it in this new clip , I wanted to make sure you guys noticed it and hopefully tweak it a bit <p> Cinnder wrote : Doctor Tyche wrote : No mod needed .

Again I am working on the movement system now just wanted to point this out . <p> I would like it as an option .... I mean supers is n't really the most realistic .... someone who defies GAIT should atleast be possible once ... <p> IIRC native Americans would often walk with one foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from riding a bicycle . <p> Years ago , when I remembered my Dynamics class , I could have written up something that shows exactly how much left-to-right sway you 'll have given mass , center of gravity , foot spacing , pace , and so forth . Just eyeballing it , you 'll have noticeable sway if your feet are n't passing under your ribs . <p> Maybe as another option for the parkour travel power ? For people who want to superhumanly acrobatic rather than naturally trained acrobatic .... also super speed should avoid GAIT too , to make it look faster and because superspeed by itself is a superhuman ability . We need to strike a balance between realism and fantastical here ... too much realism makes stuff a lot like a Zack Snyder film especially since this is n't supposed to be a capepunk MMO . It becomes a mess where none of the elements really click together , since we 're supposed to believe that an alien species looks exactly like humans and yet the work keeps reminding you that it 's trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief is scattered and flawed . Too much fantasy and it fails to be relatable to our world at all . <p> Hmmm , Using Aesthetic Decoupling with hold powers , I never even thought about that being an option . That opens my mind to brainstorming what else it could be used for .... Cotton Candy Storm Summoning anyone ? ? : ) <p> " <p> The Carnival of Light in the Phoenix Rising " We never lose our demons , we only learn to live above them . " - The Ancient One <p> The dynamics change at speed too . ( via the video ) The stance part of walking is usually comprised of the three phases : Heel - Mid - Propulsion . When you are sprinting the contact surface gets compressed to toes only ( speeds up the transition to Propulsion ) . The stance phases still occur , but they are compensated by tendon &amp; muscle strength . <p> I was thinking about such a power , that could be probably psionic in nature ( forcing peoples around you to dance ) . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make them dance ? <p> I guess the players must have the freedom to invent something out-of-mind like " I control the very basis of the universe which is vibrations and sounds , we 're all sounds " or something like that ( there is a theory where several universes are all at the same place but vibrating at different paces , therefore creating different " reality planes " overlapping each other , and since all planes are just different vibration levels the " ghosts " and " dreams " are just moments where we see other universes temporarily slowing down or accelerating to our vibration level ) . Or another possibility more religious would be that you emit some angelic/demonic song and you touch their souls , making them dance of happiness or in despair or things like that . Or again , something else I did n't think about . <p> But the most obvious choice ( the one most players will think about imho ) would still be the psionic master forcing a mental command . In that case , I suggest you to put two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for previous examples , specifically related to sound-based-heroes ) and one for mind controllers , where the " hip hop " status effect is just one of several possibilities .

It would be another funny and useful use of the emotes , you could even say that your emotes are really part of the gameplay that way . <p> Summary : imho you need to add this " hip-hop " status effect in a random list of outcomes for psy-control powers/animations , not just dance-powers . <p> I was thinking about such a power , that could be probably psionic in nature ( forcing peoples around you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psionic hero/villain can only make them dance ?

Each person or character in this case experiences the world from their perspective . This allows super scientists to skirt those strict rules of physics in the same way that a magi can completely subvert them but neither operates in the same way . The rules for their universe exist only for them . So I 'm completely comfortable with any animation set even ridiculous ones like " make-em-dance " or " dance-fever. "

You must be looking forward to Cable in Deadpool 2 which is also coming out next year .

You must be looking forward to Cable in Deadpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really enjoyed Deadpool so I feel like they will do Cable justice . <p> Deadpool is fairly easy to pull off , and he 's up against , and this is no offense to the baddos in the movie , but they 're lower-tier power-wise . So when they bring someone in like Cable , I feel that they 'll need to step up their game , which may detract from that ' merc-with-a-mouth ' style . I also never played any of the Deadpool game ( s ? ) , but I did have a funny scene pointed out to me that involved Cable and ended with Deadpool shooting himself in the head to end the super boring conversation . The reason I bring that up is because I prefer them not to make references to other " source material " ( " I 'm the Juggernaut , bitch ! " comes to mind ) because it 's cringe-worthy and low-brow .

One of the things that Marvel managed to do right is tie their content together in the MCU , which highly encourages people to see the next movie , even if it does n't include characters that they might not otherwise be interested in seeing . That 's pretty much why I saw Dr. Strange . I do n't even like Dr. Strange but I was interested in seeing how they 'll push the over-arching Infinity Gauntlet storyarc with Thanos and co . That being said , Marvel has a large cast of characters in which to spin this story , where Sony or Fox or whomever , does not . Even Deadpool made a point to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion was and it 's like they could n't afford to pay to have more characters in the movie .

To be honest though , I have n't seen Legion or the most recent Wolverine movie , which I hear good things about . <p> I 'm sorry but i 'm going to have to disagree with your statements here . Mutation is a great explanation for their powers which I believe is completely valid . Not to mention , the fact that they are all an evolved form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believable than , " oops he fell into a radioactive puddle " , or " he got bit by a spider " <p> ... really ? come on . <p> There is actual proof of evolution in our genes in the real world so why would the idea that humans evolved into a mutated form that gave them abilities be so farfetched ? And the fact that their abilities manifest during puberty goes along perfectly with how humans change when they reach that age . <p> What 's interesting is that you seem to write off that all the x-men characters do n't even have an origin story . Where they come from and how they came to be what they are has nothing to do with how they got their powers(mutation) . Their powers are a part of their origin story because trust me they all have one . From being raised by African priestesses and being worshipped as a goddess ( Storm ) to having been scientifically engineered as a weapon by painfully going through a procedure where your bones are laced with the hardest metal on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories within the X-Men and outside of the team , and they are much more believable than what 's currently out there with other superheroes . <p> I think you should read more about the x-men before you write them off as some bad memory of comic book sales , and with statements that they have no origin story ... because to me , they have some of the best . <p> I never meant to imply that I do n't buy mutation as a source of abilities on the basis of realism , I only meant that using it for a very large number of your characters and leaving it at that takes away the origin story from the individual character and to me cheapens the character itself by making them all the same in that sense . To me , for the characters that have them , the origin story is like the BEST story . It 's the defining story that tells you , the reader , what the main character is all about , how they got this way , and what their motivations are . Radioactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how Spidey learned that with great power must come great responsibility IF AND ONLY IF that story ever get 's written for us to read in the first place , and for many mutants , there 's no reason to bother . It makes him ( Spidey ) way more compelling as a protagonist than say , Iceman , whose origin story I never read , if they ever published it . Say what you want about radioactive spiders , gamma bomb accidents , etc , even if they were far-fetched deus ex machina plot devices , at least they were devices used in stories we actually got to read . <p> Case in point , Wolverine , who was one of the X-Men whose origin we actually got to read about in LONG detail , is one of the most beloved and iconic of them all , I think for that reason . At first he was just a short , Canadian guy in a yellow and blue costume with claws on a team . Being able to say " Because mutant " as a response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just write for the here and now and have them fighting badguys because the badguys are bad and the bood guys are good . <p> I do n't HATE the X-Men , but I was never as fond of them as I was of the other , non-mutant characters , and I think this is the reason , looking back . <p> I never meant to imply that I do n't buy mutation as a source of abilities on the basis of realism , I only meant that using it for a very large number of your characters and leaving it at that takes away the origin story from the individual character and to me cheapens the character itself by making them all the same in that sense .

Say what you want about radioactive spiders , gamma bomb accidents , etc , even if they were far-fetched deus ex machina plot devices , at least they were devices used in stories we actually got to read . <p> What you are defining here as their origin is a one panel page in a comic book of how they actually got their power . Why is that so important ? The spider bite does n't make spiderman as you stated yourself , its about learning with great power comes great responsibility . Well , all the mutants that have existed in the Marvel universe have also had a story to tell after they discovered their abilities . Obviously depending on how much they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you want every mutant to have gotten their powers in a unique way , well all the " unique " ways have been taken . I do n't want a cookie cutter superhero story like you seem to enjoy . And if you do n't know their origin story , maybe take the effort to read about it . <p> If they ever bothered to write origin stories for half of the mutants characters in the X-book , I never read them because at the time the character was introduced to me , the answer to " why is the person superpowered and what motivates them ? " got the immediate response of " Because mutant . " and was left at that . Then later they filled in those origins for the more popular characters as needed , or so it seems to me . <p> Anyway , all I 'm saying is the characters with unique individual origins were more compelling , to me . Your mileage may vary . Read what you like . <p> All that said , personally , I like the Marvel Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least the ones I 've seen .

Sadly , when Fox got the rights to the X-men movies , they INSISTED that it include the right to the term Mutant as well , because the X-men were mutants . And totally missed that point that ALL of the Marvel Heroes were mutants . Sadly the other studios are locked out of the ability to use the same term . <p> Stan might have said that ( though I 've never seen that quote ) but that 's not the official stand of Marvel Comics . Mutants are born with their powers ( though they might be dormant until puberty ) , and are considered to be a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive their powers later on " artificially " .

They are looking at Jessica Chastain to play Lilandra . Of course , this sounds great and all but its just like Fox to ruin something good . They are casting her to play the Villain . Which in the comic and TAS story line , Lilandra was not the villain . I am wary of how this movie is gon na end up so my expectations are not gon na be too high . <p> Are you confusing Marvel and Champions ? According to Champions cosmology , all powers are derived from magic . From the Hero System 6th Ed . Champions Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the " meta-setting " of which the Champions Universe is just one part ) , superpowers can exist because magic exists . The Hero Universe is suffused with magic . ... Because of the ambient magic in the Champions Universe , accidents that would normally kill or maim people sometimes -- very rarely , but sometimes -- cause the victims to manifest superpowers instead . It also makes genetic mutations that create superpowers possible , and allows some extremely gifted inventors to create technology the general public ca n't necessarily understand , use , or reproduce . However , this has no effect on the special effects of any given character 's superpowers . The special effects of Defender 's powers are " super-technology " , even though it 's the ambient magic that allows him to manufacture his suit of powered armor and make it work . The special effects of Sapphire 's powers are " mutation " , even though it 's magic that made so beneficial a mutation of her genes possible . Neither character registers as in any way magical -- because they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " magic " by the Hero System as " that vague generic quality that allows characters in the game to do things that defy normal physics in the real world " . So it includes not only " Harry Potter " type magic but also the type of " magic " that makes Iron Man 's suits work . Basically it becomes the comic book version of the " God of the Gaps " that allows anything " not possible " in the real world to be possible in a comic book setting . 
@@79253405 @753405/ <p> There were failed zones Like the Hollows and such where no one ever went ... they were ruined and full of vast mobs that were just there for farming and no stories . <p> I suggest a different take . Add a dimensional portal in a corporate office . It leads to a temporary zone that is an existing city zone , just repainted. multiple stories , same skin . The key here is story not mobs . <p> You could have a post apocalyptic zone that could lead to several stories . this would be the same city zone , but windows are broken . trash and burned out cars are in the streets . <p> opposite world . a repaint but this time supers are dictators . Repaint is just posters posting allegiance to Anthem . Join the resistance fighters . But remember , Athem has a corporation too , and she can come after you . <p> YOU are the villain . all the supers are after you . You have to find and defeat yourself ( no repaint needed ) <p> Giant monster world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team ... the monster is ALL YOURS ! <p> Just a suggestion to add strange new story content for a minimum of work on the devs part . What do y'all think ? <p> Depending on when you played , The Hollows was n't to be considered a " failed zone " . For a good while , it was almost certainly the next zone players went to from AP because that 's where the initial AP contacts sent you to talk to the officer in charge of the zone . Sure , later on players could just DFB until they were in level for Posi , head to Steel Canyon and go from there after the TF , but to say that The Hollows was a " failed zone " is a bit of a stretch . They even added creature comforts like a field hospital and a trainer so players would n't have to take the death train to the AP hosp to train up since Ms. Liberty was the closest trainer previously . <p> As for other zones that are essentially re-paints , while it serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts along those lines tend to smack of laziness and would very likely receive negative feedback from the playerbase , especially if it is very obviously just a re-skin of something else . <p> Post-apocalyptic zone : Boomtown is a great example of a hazard zone that had a solid story behind it but no one really seemed to play through anything there other than to get the exploration badges required for a specific accolade or if you wanted to fight Babbage outside of the Syn TF spawn for the badge . I was just as guilty of it as much as the next player , but once you 've played through it once and remembered the struggle to navigate through the rubble of the zone to get to an elevated mission door , you tend to find other zones to play in that are n't as frustrating for someone with just superspeed . Now , if SS could run up walls and such ... it would n't have been as much of a hassle , if any at all . That being said , I do enjoy post-apocalyptic content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a single play-through . <p> Opposite World with oppressive supers might seem a bit too much like Praetoria and the Going Rogue content that it could lead to legal issues , particularly for a game that 's viewed as the spiritual successor to CoH/V . After all , CoT is n't CoH/V2 . That 's not to say that it ca n't be done or has n't been done , but I think it would have to be done carefully . Maybe if it was truly Opposite World , where supers are the normal population and people without powers are the minority , now that might fly ( no pun intended ) . <p> You Are The Villain : I would personally rather wait until I can play a real villain from an expansion release from MWM , although if they had a storyarc that alluded to the next release being about playing a villain , that 'd be super ( again , no pun intended ) . <p> Giant Monster World : For a period of time , I was THE giant monster guy on our server , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting people together ad hoc and hunting GMs across their respective world zones . I have mentioned instancing in a separate thread that also included GMs as an example , but it was more related to raiding and the controls required to manage one when it comes to dissenting elements versus a world boss situation . This is n't a bad idea , per se , but I think the instancing portion takes away from the environmental threat of the GM in the actual zone(s) . Why bother having them in the zones if players can just go to an instance and fight them ? Players would n't then seek them out in the zones , and would likely only serve as a minimized problem for a new(er) player who happened across them unknowingly . <p> As for a zone suggestion , I would n't mind seeing an underwater zone or even a series of zones related to the four elements . Maybe it 's to boost or enhance your current powers or even recharge your fire- , air- , earth , or water-power(s) that have been weakened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air content could involve the Aether Pirates trying to fill the skies with poison , and the fire content could be a pyromaniac 's dreams that you need to extinguish , and the earth content could involve spelunking into the depths of the earth to relieve pressure to prevent an earthquake , and the final water content could take you to the lost capital city of Atlantis where you have to fix their shield machine that keeps their city safe from the crushing pressure of the ocean . Maybe you learned a little something along the way from each of those other pieces of the content that enables you to fix the machine ; a shiny tech-widget from the Aether Pirates ' ship , a precious stone formed from the geological forces of the earth , the imaginative and possibly illuminating power of dreams , etcetera .

With that you could choose to play it as seriously as you 'd like . ; ) <p> Actually kind of disagree with turning off animations selectively ... just because this might make things confusing if different players are seeing different things . How do you react to something when everyone 's seeing something different ? You see dancing , and at the same time , someone else sees cowering or sleeping . Someone says " wow , they really looked scared " and you 're wondering wtf they 're talking about because you saw dancing . <p> Sure , there are other games with silliness settings , like the Fallout franchise . You could choose " wild wasteland " and get attacked by a gang of elderly women in pink dresses , or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , that 's a single-player game . In multi-player games , it 's important for everyone to be witnessing the event the same way for coherence . <p> Let 's take this to a ridiculous extreme just to make a point . In one of the story posts , it mentions a police officer who 's part canine . Well , what if one player does n't like that , so turns that off , and sees it as a regular cop . That player is playing as a robot , but another player is burned out on sci-fi so turns that off , and sees the " robot " player as a wizard instead . So the robot ( wizard ) remarks about the boring cop ( dog person ) and the other player asks the wizard ( robot ) if he spend too much time staring in crystal balls to see the dog ( boring cop ) . This could get extremely confusing extremely fast , so I vote against any sort of setting that let 's you change what you see other people do , aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their character . The only filter on other people should be the usual optional profanity filter in chat . <p> I think this looks great so far but the animation in the legs is kinda weird . The way he sways a bit and how close together the legs are and how high the feet go up makes the animation look a bit off . I saw this on the untextured models but I figured it was still early and you guys would tidy it up a bit but seeing it in this new clip , I wanted to make sure you guys noticed it and hopefully tweak it a bit <p> Cinnder wrote : Doctor Tyche wrote : No mod needed .

Again I am working on the movement system now just wanted to point this out . <p> I would like it as an option .... I mean supers is n't really the most realistic .... someone who defies GAIT should atleast be possible once ... <p> IIRC native Americans would often walk with one foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from riding a bicycle . <p> Years ago , when I remembered my Dynamics class , I could have written up something that shows exactly how much left-to-right sway you 'll have given mass , center of gravity , foot spacing , pace , and so forth . Just eyeballing it , you 'll have noticeable sway if your feet are n't passing under your ribs . <p> Maybe as another option for the parkour travel power ? For people who want to superhumanly acrobatic rather than naturally trained acrobatic .... also super speed should avoid GAIT too , to make it look faster and because superspeed by itself is a superhuman ability . We need to strike a balance between realism and fantastical here ... too much realism makes stuff a lot like a Zack Snyder film especially since this is n't supposed to be a capepunk MMO . It becomes a mess where none of the elements really click together , since we 're supposed to believe that an alien species looks exactly like humans and yet the work keeps reminding you that it 's trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief is scattered and flawed . Too much fantasy and it fails to be relatable to our world at all . <p> Hmmm , Using Aesthetic Decoupling with hold powers , I never even thought about that being an option .

Cotton Candy Storm Summoning anyone ? ? : ) <p> " <p> The Carnival of Light in the Phoenix Rising " We never lose our demons , we only learn to live above them . " - The Ancient One <p> The dynamics change at speed too . ( via the video ) The stance part of walking is usually comprised of the three phases : Heel - Mid - Propulsion . When you are sprinting the contact surface gets compressed to toes only ( speeds up the transition to Propulsion ) . The stance phases still occur , but they are compensated by tendon &amp; muscle strength . <p> I was thinking about such a power , that could be probably psionic in nature ( forcing peoples around you to dance ) . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make them dance ? <p> I guess the players must have the freedom to invent something out-of-mind like " I control the very basis of the universe which is vibrations and sounds , we 're all sounds " or something like that ( there is a theory where several universes are all at the same place but vibrating at different paces , therefore creating different " reality planes " overlapping each other , and since all planes are just different vibration levels the " ghosts " and " dreams " are just moments where we see other universes temporarily slowing down or accelerating to our vibration level ) . Or another possibility more religious would be that you emit some angelic/demonic song and you touch their souls , making them dance of happiness or in despair or things like that .

Each person or character in this case experiences the world from their perspective . This allows super scientists to skirt those strict rules of physics in the same way that a magi can completely subvert them but neither operates in the same way . The rules for their universe exist only for them . So I 'm completely comfortable with any animation set even ridiculous ones like " make-em-dance " or " dance-fever. "

You must be looking forward to Cable in Deadpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really enjoyed Deadpool so I feel like they will do Cable justice . <p> Deadpool is fairly easy to pull off , and he 's up against , and this is no offense to the baddos in the movie , but they 're lower-tier power-wise . So when they bring someone in like Cable , I feel that they 'll need to step up their game , which may detract from that ' merc-with-a-mouth ' style . I also never played any of the Deadpool game ( s ? ) , but I did have a funny scene pointed out to me that involved Cable and ended with Deadpool shooting himself in the head to end the super boring conversation . The reason I bring that up is because I prefer them not to make references to other " source material " ( " I 'm the Juggernaut , bitch ! " comes to mind ) because it 's cringe-worthy and low-brow .

One of the things that Marvel managed to do right is tie their content together in the MCU , which highly encourages people to see the next movie , even if it does n't include characters that they might not otherwise be interested in seeing . That 's pretty much why I saw Dr. Strange . I do n't even like Dr. Strange but I was interested in seeing how they 'll push the over-arching Infinity Gauntlet storyarc with Thanos and co .

The jury is in on JuRe and they 're an explosive combination ! : ) The only reason it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happened in the comics : ( I can only recall Jubilee and Gambit specifically teaming-up during Extinction Agenda , and yes , it was quite explosive but certainly short-lived . As in , six panels short and nothing romantic . As for them getting together , I can really only see that happening since they effectively removed the Wolverine/Jubilee angle . I had n't even heard that there was going to be a New Mutants movie until literally just now , but that sort of makes sense since they 're introducing Cable in Deadpool 2 . Makes me wonder how longer they 'll stick with New Mutants before they switch to X-Force ( maybe New Mutants 2 : X-Force ? ) . As much of an x-men fan that I am , I never heard about new mutants up until recently when the security guard at my job noticed my X-men tattoo and we started having a convo . He 's a huge fan of New Mutants and let me borrow some of the graphic novels he has . I really like Magik and I am glad they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a little nervous to see if they depower her in the movies , since she is an extremely powerful mutant/sorceress in the comics but ... here 's to hoping ! Also , the actress they chose to portray Magik was spot on . <p> Yyyeeeaaahhh , she starts off as basically a TPer with a fancy magickal sword . She does n't go half-demon Queen of Limbo crazy until quite a bit later , what with the horns and hooves and all , after she loses most of her soul . That makes a sort of sense , since they 've already introduced Colossus in the Deadpool movie , and he 's her brother . If they 're going to do Dark Phoenix , that makes me question if they 'll do it differently with the Phoenix Five storyarc , since they 're introducing the New Mutants and Magik . Things that make you go , " Hmmm ... " <p> So apparently Magneto and Mystique ( Fassbender and Lawrence ) are returning for the next X-men movie Dark Phoenix ... <p> I would just like to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Fox is not confident enough to make a good X-Men movie that they have to bring in A list actors in hopes they will bring in more fans . Why would Magneto or Mystique even need to be in the Dark Phoenix movie ? <p> Its just annoying , I do n't want to see Magneto play good guy turned bad guy turned good guy one more time and I could do without jlaws unenthusiastic performance . Shes obviously so over playing this character , she 's just doing it for the money . <p> I do n't know if I 'd consider Fassbender an A List actor . He also made a better Magneto than McKellan . <p> As to the reason they would need to be in a Dark Phoenix movie ? This is n't the comics . This is another universe entirely . I like that , as I like Jennifer 's Mystique as a hero : ) Though , you 're right , enough with the bad guy good guy bad guy good guy Magneto : p <p> Also , do n't all actors do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope she does get a little more enthused with the role , however , for all we know , she was less than enthused because of the movie itself . It needed work . <p> My real question is , after Logan , I think they screwed over the whole X-Men movie verse . <p> I do n't know if I 'd consider Fassbender an A List actor .

It needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they screwed over the whole X-Men movie verse . <p> Fassbender is pretty close to Alist especially after doing Assassins Creed and the X-Men movies . He is definitely better than McKellan but Magneto was just one of the many villains that the X-Men encountered and I think he has outlasted his welcome . As for jlaw , yeah all actors do it for the money , and she possibly was n't inspired with the script in Apocalypse , but then why come back ? <p> I would hope after Logan , they could do one more movie with the original cast i.e Halle Berry , Famke Jansen , dude who played Cyclops . Since Logan took place in 2029 , and DOFP took place in the current time , they have a good 10 years where they can bring them back for one last movie , before Logan where they <p> SPOILER <p> all died ... <p> Maybe even take advantage of the Deadpool craze and have him make a cameo in that movie <p> Brand X wrote : I do n't know if I 'd consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better Magneto than McKellan .

They want to connect them all , have their own X-Men Extended Movie Universe , beyond just X-Men sequels , but they messed it all up : p <p> I grew up in the 80s when the X-books X-ploded from a single team title into like half the Marvel comic books and you had to read like all of them to understand the ongoing story . It felt like a grab for more cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the stories all being inter-related , but also because they printed a new X-Men title with 5 different covers for issue 1 , but it was the same story inside . The X-Men were the poster children of the " It 's collectible ! It 'll put your kids through college some day ! So buy like TEN copies right now ! ! ! " lies perpetrated by the comicbook manufacturers and sellers . <p> To this day X-Men comics , characters , movies , etc remind me of all that . It 's also a cheap cop-out , to me , to come up with a single source of superpowers that can explain away everyone 's powers like that . They do n't have to write an origin story for every new character , so it saves money and time and you can just skip the " wait , how does this person have the ability to turn into living ice and freeze stuff and shoot ice out oft heir bare hands ? " in a way that takes away every compelling character 's best story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like the Marvel Netflix and the MCU movies that are not X-Men way better than the X-movies so far . To be honest though , I have n't seen Legion or the most recent Wolverine movie , which I hear good things about . <p> I grew up in the 80s when the X-books X-ploded from a single team title into like half the Marvel comic books and you had to read like all of them to understand the ongoing story .

As for the movies , I like the Marvel Netflix and the MCU movies that are not X-Men way better than the X-movies so far . To be honest though , I have n't seen Legion or the most recent Wolverine movie , which I hear good things about . <p> I 'm sorry but i 'm going to have to disagree with your statements here . Mutation is a great explanation for their powers which I believe is completely valid . Not to mention , the fact that they are all an evolved form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believable than , " oops he fell into a radioactive puddle " , or " he got bit by a spider " <p> ... really ? come on . <p> There is actual proof of evolution in our genes in the real world so why would the idea that humans evolved into a mutated form that gave them abilities be so farfetched ? And the fact that their abilities manifest during puberty goes along perfectly with how humans change when they reach that age . <p> What 's interesting is that you seem to write off that all the x-men characters do n't even have an origin story . Where they come from and how they came to be what they are has nothing to do with how they got their powers(mutation) . Their powers are a part of their origin story because trust me they all have one . From being raised by African priestesses and being worshipped as a goddess ( Storm ) to having been scientifically engineered as a weapon by painfully going through a procedure where your bones are laced with the hardest metal on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories within the X-Men and outside of the team , and they are much more believable than what 's currently out there with other superheroes . <p> I think you should read more about the x-men before you write them off as some bad memory of comic book sales , and with statements that they have no origin story ... because to me , they have some of the best . <p> I never meant to imply that I do n't buy mutation as a source of abilities on the basis of realism , I only meant that using it for a very large number of your characters and leaving it at that takes away the origin story from the individual character and to me cheapens the character itself by making them all the same in that sense . To me , for the characters that have them , the origin story is like the BEST story . It 's the defining story that tells you , the reader , what the main character is all about , how they got this way , and what their motivations are . Radioactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how Spidey learned that with great power must come great responsibility IF AND ONLY IF that story ever get 's written for us to read in the first place , and for many mutants , there 's no reason to bother . It makes him ( Spidey ) way more compelling as a protagonist than say , Iceman , whose origin story I never read , if they ever published it . Say what you want about radioactive spiders , gamma bomb accidents , etc , even if they were far-fetched deus ex machina plot devices , at least they were devices used in stories we actually got to read . <p> Case in point , Wolverine , who was one of the X-Men whose origin we actually got to read about in LONG detail , is one of the most beloved and iconic of them all , I think for that reason . At first he was just a short , Canadian guy in a yellow and blue costume with claws on a team . Being able to say " Because mutant " as a response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just write for the here and now and have them fighting badguys because the badguys are bad and the bood guys are good . <p> I do n't HATE the X-Men , but I was never as fond of them as I was of the other , non-mutant characters , and I think this is the reason , looking back . <p> I never meant to imply that I do n't buy mutation as a source of abilities on the basis of realism , I only meant that using it for a very large number of your characters and leaving it at that takes away the origin story from the individual character and to me cheapens the character itself by making them all the same in that sense .

Say what you want about radioactive spiders , gamma bomb accidents , etc , even if they were far-fetched deus ex machina plot devices , at least they were devices used in stories we actually got to read . <p> What you are defining here as their origin is a one panel page in a comic book of how they actually got their power . Why is that so important ? The spider bite does n't make spiderman as you stated yourself , its about learning with great power comes great responsibility . Well , all the mutants that have existed in the Marvel universe have also had a story to tell after they discovered their abilities . Obviously depending on how much they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you want every mutant to have gotten their powers in a unique way , well all the " unique " ways have been taken . I do n't want a cookie cutter superhero story like you seem to enjoy . And if you do n't know their origin story , maybe take the effort to read about it . <p> If they ever bothered to write origin stories for half of the mutants characters in the X-book , I never read them because at the time the character was introduced to me , the answer to " why is the person superpowered and what motivates them ? " got the immediate response of " Because mutant . " and was left at that . Then later they filled in those origins for the more popular characters as needed , or so it seems to me . <p> Anyway , all I 'm saying is the characters with unique individual origins were more compelling , to me . Your mileage may vary . Read what you like . <p> All that said , personally , I like the Marvel Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least the ones I 've seen . Note , by the way , that all 4 of the Netflix shows did the origin stories in their first seasons . <p> If they ever bothered to write origin stories for half of the mutants characters in the X-book , I never read them because at the time the character was introduced to me , the answer to " why is the person superpowered and what motivates them ?

And yes , maybe Marvel is doing something better with their characters in terms of film compared to ( 20th Century Fox ) * Xmen movies , but that is not what we have been discussing here . And I am glad Netflix has the budget and time and freedom to allow us to understand each character 's origin stories which btw they do n't discuss how they got their powers either just what they did with them and what they went through afterwards , which is what Marvel has done in the comics btw and in subsequent series for other characters . <p> While they 've made some good mutant characters , I also thought one of the biggest mistakes Marvel ever did was getting it to the point that like 25% of the world was a mutant of some sort . : p <p> X-Men imo was a storyline you could n't get to the " everyone accepts mutants " or it ruined their story . This does n't mean there could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Avenger , Beast !

I think Marvel is realizing they will never get the X-Men back . 20th Century Fox has too much of a good thing with those movies even if they do n't break records they still bring in some good cash . Its evident with the latest FF movie which was absolute crap , Fox will still reboot it and try again rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably never have the movie rights back they are slowly starting to push out X-Men content once again even if they make little money . There 's new X-Men toys bobbleheads , and they are working together with Fox for the new Gifted show about teens coming to terms with their powers and on the run with their parents . So , I think Marvel is starting to warm up to the X-Men again which is a good thing for us fans . They also came out with X-Men blue and gold comics . Now only if I did n't hate X-Men Blue : p X-Men Gold might be promising . Might .

@@79253411 @753411/ <p> And ... just in case Greyhawk was wondering ... have n't stopped working ... Getting there ... not done yet ... but closer to what I was thinking ... <p> Wow .... <p> Just , wow .... <p> Overwhelmed . <p> Just one tiny caveat . It kind of looks like she is firing backwards and hitting her own robot . The backflare from the pistol in her left hand is probably not necessary ? Right now it looks like it either functions like a LAW with massive backblast or she 's somehow aiming it behind her . <p> But do n't take that as harsh criticism . The overall impact is very powerful and very well done ! <p> It 's still a work - so the backflare is something that 's easy to work with . Also need to fix the flare on her feet and saber . <p> I do n't worry about criticisms much - I put in 2-3 hrs a week on these so it 's not like I 'm personally attached to them . I enjoy doing them and love it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure one of the artists here will jump in and do a proper one for someone . <p> I started doing sketchings and such with a goal of spending no more than 1 night - about 2 hrs a week on a drawing and then never going back to it . Goal was to get to the level of speed where I could whip out something quickly that would be useful for storyboards or such for work . I got very tired of waiting a week to get back basically 10 wire sketches of something . <p> Probably the single greatest unsung masters of art are comic book artists . They 'll do 300-600 semi-detailed drawings a month at a quality level that 's really impressive . I read an interview with John Buscema where someone asked him how he could just do that like a machine and he said , " You just do it . Every day . Draw something . Give yourself a deadline and stick to it . " . Which I always thought was some of the best advice . <p> I 'm not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to the point where when I need a mock up I can do my own in five hours . Get it approved , and then hand it off to an artist to get the final done . That 's been my goal and it seems to have worked . So , when I say I 'm not an artist - I really am not . I sketch quick and then use tools to make up for my lack of skill ; ) So I take no criticism as an issue - it 's probably dead on . And in this case it is most definitely . : ) <p> I played around a bit with the flare - so it 's not quite so oppressive . But the intent actually was a pistol with enough blast to say ... blow the top off a building . So a LAW is n't too far off - maybe a little under powered . This is Enalios , who based the description - was a Holy Terror in the Rogue Aisles so was going for a bit of overkill there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot behind her - and I figured out that moving it ... was a serious pain . I may try this again with a bit more landscape shape to the image which will give me more room to play with . <p> I played around a bit with the flare - so it 's not quite so oppressive .

This is Enalios , who based the description - was a Holy Terror in the Rogue Aisles so was going for a bit of overkill there . <p> This is a huge improvement ! Comparing the two side by side is very revealing . Now it appears there is chaos all around her but she stands apart from it like a true supervillain . I really like this version ! Very powerful . <p> I 'll clean it up a bit - the coat shadows are still off and there 's some blurs which need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the most part that 's about as far as my skill will take it . <p> I 'll post a final here in a day or two but ... RL is telling me I have new projects spooling up . So need to clean up Dem 's and this one and then it 'll be back to being more of an observer around here for a bit . : ( <p> @Foradain , I 'm going out of my comfortzone for you ! Based on what you put in your thread I made this sketch . However , it may be the language barrier , I ca n't quite figure out what you mean with how the staff looks , so I gave her a basic wooden staff for now . Further updates will be posted in my thread <p> one of these day I need to get an actual tablet . still do the old fashion way here ... pencil and paper then scan in. of course then I get the mind numbing job of redueing all the lines with the ole mousey but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) <p> should be easy enough . just use the round edge at the end of the staff as reference . then draw other round part just like the end all the way up the staff but extend then a smidge wider than the staff itself . : ) of course everything is " easy " when talking about it ... it 's the actual doing that becomes the bear ... and stars above know that I have a lot of issues when trying to figure things out sometimes . LOL <p> Once you go drawing tablet , you never want to go back drawing with your mouse ! I advise it strongly to every digital artist . Truly you do n't need a fancy one . Just do n't get a tiny one . I have the Wacom Intuos 3 ( wide , but it really does n't matter ) . Got it for 50% off too , but that was .. wow ... 5 years back already . You can get those for even less now , lesser than less if you search for a used one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll love working with it . <p> It 's not so much the how do I add the details as it 's .. what details . I may be interpreting the words incorrectly , see something completely different due to a language difference , but that 's alright . I 'll just try something , show it , see if I have the right idea and if not , I 'll retry after some new explaining from your side . It 's all good practise <p> I 've always really admired the old 60 's and 70 's ad art works , the old Tales to Astonish kind of magazine and even the pin up girl painting looks . Those ... were artists . They still used paint and ink and brushes and did fifty full paintings a month . Those guys were art machines . : ) And they had more skill than 99% of our best artists today . Untaught , untrained - just ... they did art . <p> You look at the Buscemas , who could sketch entire epics on napkins while having lunch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan covers happened on Deli napkins ) , or people like Gil Kane or Steranko who are literally taught in software design because of the elegance and efficiency of their layouts ... a lot of ' old school ' artists . We do n't see that in the modern styles that have come since . <p> They 're slicker and more realistic and gritty but .. they 've lost a lot . So I like to work to get that look if I can - it takes a lot to do it right . I 've been working on this for a good part of two weeks now just playing with the colors and still do n't have it anywhere near where it should be . I get basically an hour or two every couple days - but even still - if this were a more modern look I 'd have had it done by now . You just slap the colors using an overlay and multiply - and done . : ) But there 's no strokes because you basically use markers and airbrush strokes . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The only flaw that caught my eye , even in the pencils , is that the shadow under her arms and on her breast seems too hard , sharp , and dark . I thought , at first , that her costume had a tabard on the front , so the line was caused by darker material there . <p> As time goes by you 'll see those disappear ... In fact since just updated your post may confuse some . I 've started actually putting more time on my stuff . Last year my rule was to never spend more than a couple days on something and move on . I 'd been told to try that as I needed to work on speed for deadlines . I do this for fun , but my main focus was to add a skill . Basically get to where I felt competent I could if needed meet deadlines on design work . <p> It helped tremendously so I 'm now enjoying working on better quality and spending time actually putting in more effort , taking time to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more confident in my finished stuff - develop work flows again . <p> Here 's as far as I can take it today . Have another 2 weeks of shifts coming up so probably wo n't be on much for a bit here but I 'll update it when it 's done . Here 's the direction -- as you can see a lot of the lines are cleaned up - first pass on the hair and starting in on the giant robot - I 'll drop the spacey background on it again when it 's done . But that 'll be a couple weeks from now . <p> LOL ... no , actually Fly Girl was a character of mine . She was one of those bizarre builds people talked about but rarely did . Flight , air superiority , 5 slot punch ( which ironically was very useful in pvp since it dropped toggles like crazy and was very useful against scrappers and tanks ) , hurricane , pretty much nothing but air based abilities like group fly and other essentially useless powers . : ) <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow kid in kickball . : ) <p> With me getting ready to move on to another position at work I 'll have some more time ( hopefully ) and wanted to get my hand back into some stuff . I need to go back and fix several drawings I started . There 's the android with the tuxedo made of circuits I want to take another stab at ... and a few others .. Enalios for example . So I started with FlyGirl to get my hands back into things . <p> As you can see - we dropped the cutlass ( it was in the way ) and opted for a 2nd pistol , and I 'm starting to look at colors , added the skull belt buckle and we 'll start looking at more details . I 'll also do one that 's just straight up the character 's costume with no embellishments when I 'm done . <p> Fly Girl is um ... um ... no idea . But I 'm sure someone will create her eventually .

If people want to see her they 'll have to look for it ! <p> J/K but you raise a valid point . We have enough threads for personal things - this one should be reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . I 'll make up for it by working extra hard on requests here : ) <p> I have plenty ! How about Cloudwatcher ( aka Jonathan Winchester ) ? - His face is mostly covered underneath a helmet ( it 's a kind of computerised thing that , when it 's searching , has a orange/yellow colored hud in front of it ) . It should be right up your alley Here is a reference ... given , not a very good one . <p> I was actually looking at robots at a presentation this week where I work and they had a pic of ... it 's not an android and it 's not really a robot , was designed for the International Space Station . One of the faces they had ( which is not the final version ) had this wire mesh speaker where the mouth and nose where , but shaped like that . <p> The face plate was off , and there were these camera eyes , and that speaker and the rest was this kind of West World robot guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human - almost alien - robotic look . <p> Okay ... all joking aside . That 's where I got it . I went for more of an organic techno look , which based on the description - we 're not dealing with a human but new life form completely . If you look at the sketch reference - it 's not entirely far off . Granted head on , this is a kind of almost beak - but the mask itself is St. Croix cross like thing so I just opened it up and instead of having facial features that a new life form might have we 're looking inside the man/machine . Its disturbing but it 's supposed to be so you know this is n't anything like what you 've seen before . <p> And I 'm a huge fan of things like the original Sandman with the gas mask look too so ... there is that also . Its that whole , you ca n't see eyes , just these sort of lenses and there 's no mouth it 's a rebreather like thing . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is clearly a man with a hat . Here I 'm just taking a Korean pop hair cut and a open neck tux/suit and doing something similar with the St. Croix cross by making it a mask with goggles and a rebreather ... it just happens to also be his / its / face so it 's doubly creepy to me . If that thing looked at me and started walking toward me I 'd pee my pants . : ) <p> mikenovember wrote : As you can see - we dropped the cutlass ( it was in the way ) and opted for a 2nd pistol , and I 'm starting to look at colors , added the skull belt buckle and we 'll start looking at more details .

I had grandparents in their 30s during WWII and I do n't consider myself to be " very very old " quite yet . One of my grandfathers worked on the Liberty ships for the war effort . Just saying Terwyn could have known a grandparent or other relative involved at Dunkirk without having to be ancient . <p> It was a cousin of my grandfather 's ( So to speak , we were a Scottish Acadian family at the time , so the Clan mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Clearances ) . My grandfather was the youngest in his family and at 17 , tried to lie about his age to join the air force after his brother went MIA in Italy ( He was a tail gunner in a Lancaster Bomber ) . My grandfather 's cousin , on the other hand , knew what he was getting into as early as 1938 , as his father served in the First World War and lost a leg and most of his mates in the process . He evacuated to Britain safely , and later returned to Canada for some specialized training . <p> It 's because the memory and emotion of his mother having my grandfather read the telegram about his brother is still very strong that I became a historian . I 'm only 33 , but like most other historians , I can often feel centuries older . : ) <p> " <p> That 's not too much of a headache .

Then again both of these comic book heroes ( to various degrees ) basically did the same thing as far as their wartime stories go so if anything I think we can blame the original comic book writers ( of the 1940s era ) at least as much as the people who created these modern movies . Yes they attempted to be a bit different with Wonder Woman by setting her in WWI instead of WWII but ultimately it was the same " Superhero fighting Germans in a World War " trope that almost every big comic book character used at the time . <p> For the most part I think this Wonder Woman movie was well done excusing it only for following the same basic " formula " that most of the American comics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story well enough ( since there 's been at least a dozen versions of that over the years ) and even Chris Pine handled this version of the " Steve Trevor " character well enough . All in all it was about the best " non-Lynda Carter " WW story they probably could have come up with . <p> My mom went to see it and commented that she did n't remember any " children of Zeus " stuff from the comic books way back when . I had to tell her that was something DC changed with their relaunch in The New 52 some years ago , and they sure as hell would n't let the movie revert that . <p> My mom went to see it and commented that she did n't remember any " children of Zeus " stuff from the comic books way back when .

Had Hollywood gotten their collective act together and produced a -real- Wonder Woman show or movie during that time Lawless probably would 've been an easy pick for it . <p> Lin Chiao Feng wrote : My mom went to see it and commented that she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic books way back when .

But I 'd agree that he somehow did n't quite " look " right for his final battle appearance . Let 's just say I would have never picked a guy that looks like that to be who he was actually supposed to be in the movie . <p> And with all due respect to Lucy Lawless I think she might be a bit too old now to play an Amazon other than maybe Hippolyta , and if they were going to be that " on the nose " about it they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawless could have been a character Diana met in London or she could have been like a resistance fighter in that Belgian ( ? ) village . <p> Oh I agree that actor is great and has great range . I just do n't think he fit this specific role . I still think Lucy could have played Antiope instead of the Princess Bride . They are both around the same age ( Lucy is 49 and Robin is 51 ) and it would have been a huge boon to fans everywhere . Lucy is one of the main characters in the new series Ash vs the Evil Dead and she plays a bad ass . I think with some prep time she could have gotten back in to the amazon spirit . Linda Carter would have been an awesome addition but I think she is in her late 60 's by now ? I could totally see her playing as an elder on the amazon council or something like that but not as Hyppolyta . <p> I still think Lucy could have played Antiope instead of the Princess Bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 49 and Robin is 51 ) and it would have been a huge boon to fans everywhere .

I guess its just my bias that when I think of Amazon badass I think of Lucy Lawless . The Linda Carter Wonder Woman was way before my time Although I did watch it on Nickelodeon 's old TV programs channel . I forget what its called ( TV Land I think ? ) . Robin Wright did a great job as Antiope but I still think that Xena would have been a better choice and her sidekick Gabriel should have been in the movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater if I would have seen them in the Themyscira scenes .

The reasons for the cameos would have been obvious . <p> Ann Wolfe as Artemis was basically just that , a cameo . Hell , they likely wasted such a cameo on Artemis , as Ann Wolfe likely ca n't act : p So casting Ann in the role was a waste , as Artemis is a significant enough character in WW to waste the part on Ann . <p> For the record ? I 'm going to put my 2 cents here .... Man of Steel and Suicide Squad where okay .... just okay for me atleast and I hated Batman vs Superman ... the problem with the DC cinematic universe before Wonder Woman is the problem I have whenever a superhero film tries to be " realistic " , especially when you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capepunk in the first place like the DC universe .... the line of disbelief becomes too staticy to make a coherent story ... a story like that seems to pick and choose what 's realistic and talks to down to you if you do n't immediately take it at it 's word ... I mean we 're supposed to believe that an alien species that looks exactly like a human and can touch things without piercing them immediately due to such a great force of power behind such a small surface area yet I 'm supposed to believe that a physical god could n't save metropolis ? It feels weird and tone deaf .... when making something from a fantastical genre you have to make a clear line of disbelief and you have to have ways of pushing that line of disbelief down . Take for instance Paul Dini 's run on Batman the Animated Series . It was dark sure but it also had multiple ways of pushing the line of disbelief down so that you could believe in mad science and magic and all that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things very clear that this was n't our world , Gotham city was a place with modern technology that had 1930 's dress gothic architecture and Zeppelins . From the moment you began watching an episode to the moment you stopped you knew for a fact that this was n't our world . Another thing they did was add humour and memorable quotes to the show , not enough that it overshadowed the more serious nature of the show but enough that you knew that it was okay not to take everything seriously , thus pushing that line of disbelief down even further . Wonder Woman ? Brought that back , the thing that made Batman the Animated series so popular in a way that the DC cinematic franchise should have been all along ... Wonder Woman was dark for a properly done Superhero movie , not a capepunk movie , but a superhero movie , and sure while it had light elements it still made you question the nature of evil and war and it did show the audience the consequences of war , but most importantly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people die just to save lois or batman lighting someone on fire , these where elements that served the story and the story 's message . <p> As wonderful as this dramatically climactic scene was in highlighting Clark 's everlasting love for Lois if you analyze what Supes actually did to the Earth in terms of simple physics you 'd realize that the change in acceleration of the Earth 's rotation being reversed and then turning it back again would have likely killed maybe 99.999% of the Earth 's multi-cellular animal ( much less human ) population .

The game could start with those 3 and -never- pick any others who passed on -before- launch .

So I started with FlyGirl to get my hands back into things . <p> As you can see - we dropped the cutlass ( it was in the way ) and opted for a 2nd pistol , and I 'm starting to look at colors , added the skull belt buckle and we 'll start looking at more details . I 'll also do one that 's just straight up the character 's costume with no embellishments when I 'm done . <p> Fly Girl is um ... um ... no idea . But I 'm sure someone will create her eventually .

MUAHAHA ... ahem ... <p> Too late ... she 's moving to her own place ... well ... over to another thread . If people want to see her they 'll have to look for it ! <p> J/K but you raise a valid point . We have enough threads for personal things - this one should be reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . I 'll make up for it by working extra hard on requests here : ) <p> I have plenty ! How about Cloudwatcher ( aka Jonathan Winchester ) ? - His face is mostly covered underneath a helmet ( it 's a kind of computerised thing that , when it 's searching , has a orange/yellow colored hud in front of it ) . It should be right up your alley Here is a reference ... given , not a very good one . <p> I was actually looking at robots at a presentation this week where I work and they had a pic of ... it 's not an android and it 's not really a robot , was designed for the International Space Station . One of the faces they had ( which is not the final version ) had this wire mesh speaker where the mouth and nose where , but shaped like that . <p> The face plate was off , and there were these camera eyes , and that speaker and the rest was this kind of West World robot guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human - almost alien - robotic look . <p> Okay ... all joking aside . That 's where I got it . I went for more of an organic techno look , which based on the description - we 're not dealing with a human but new life form completely . If you look at the sketch reference - it 's not entirely far off . Granted head on , this is a kind of almost beak - but the mask itself is St. Croix cross like thing so I just opened it up and instead of having facial features that a new life form might have we 're looking inside the man/machine . Its disturbing but it 's supposed to be so you know this is n't anything like what you 've seen before . <p> And I 'm a huge fan of things like the original Sandman with the gas mask look too so ... there is that also . Its that whole , you ca n't see eyes , just these sort of lenses and there 's no mouth it 's a rebreather like thing . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is clearly a man with a hat . Here I 'm just taking a Korean pop hair cut and a open neck tux/suit and doing something similar with the St. Croix cross by making it a mask with goggles and a rebreather ... it just happens to also be his / its / face so it 's doubly creepy to me . If that thing looked at me and started walking toward me I 'd pee my pants . : ) <p> mikenovember wrote : As you can see - we dropped the cutlass ( it was in the way ) and opted for a 2nd pistol , and I 'm starting to look at colors , added the skull belt buckle and we 'll start looking at more details .

Then again both of these comic book heroes ( to various degrees ) basically did the same thing as far as their wartime stories go so if anything I think we can blame the original comic book writers ( of the 1940s era ) at least as much as the people who created these modern movies . Yes they attempted to be a bit different with Wonder Woman by setting her in WWI instead of WWII but ultimately it was the same " Superhero fighting Germans in a World War " trope that almost every big comic book character used at the time . <p> For the most part I think this Wonder Woman movie was well done excusing it only for following the same basic " formula " that most of the American comics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story well enough ( since there 's been at least a dozen versions of that over the years ) and even Chris Pine handled this version of the " Steve Trevor " character well enough .

They are both around the same age ( Lucy is 49 and Robin is 51 ) and it would have been a huge boon to fans everywhere .

The Linda Carter Wonder Woman was way before my time Although I did watch it on Nickelodeon 's old TV programs channel . I forget what its called ( TV Land I think ? ) .

What 's it like to be so jaded and cynical ? <p> I agree with you . : ) <p> It 's not like actors do n't like to cameo in movies .

The reasons for the cameos would have been obvious . <p> Ann Wolfe as Artemis was basically just that , a cameo . Hell , they likely wasted such a cameo on Artemis , as Ann Wolfe likely ca n't act : p So casting Ann in the role was a waste , as Artemis is a significant enough character in WW to waste the part on Ann . <p> For the record ? I 'm going to put my 2 cents here .... Man of Steel and Suicide Squad where okay .... just okay for me atleast and I hated Batman vs Superman ... the problem with the DC cinematic universe before Wonder Woman is the problem I have whenever a superhero film tries to be " realistic " , especially when you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capepunk in the first place like the DC universe .... the line of disbelief becomes too staticy to make a coherent story ... a story like that seems to pick and choose what 's realistic and talks to down to you if you do n't immediately take it at it 's word ... I mean we 're supposed to believe that an alien species that looks exactly like a human and can touch things without piercing them immediately due to such a great force of power behind such a small surface area yet I 'm supposed to believe that a physical god could n't save metropolis ? It feels weird and tone deaf .... when making something from a fantastical genre you have to make a clear line of disbelief and you have to have ways of pushing that line of disbelief down . Take for instance Paul Dini 's run on Batman the Animated Series . It was dark sure but it also had multiple ways of pushing the line of disbelief down so that you could believe in mad science and magic and all that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things very clear that this was n't our world , Gotham city was a place with modern technology that had 1930 's dress gothic architecture and Zeppelins . From the moment you began watching an episode to the moment you stopped you knew for a fact that this was n't our world . Another thing they did was add humour and memorable quotes to the show , not enough that it overshadowed the more serious nature of the show but enough that you knew that it was okay not to take everything seriously , thus pushing that line of disbelief down even further . Wonder Woman ? Brought that back , the thing that made Batman the Animated series so popular in a way that the DC cinematic franchise should have been all along ... Wonder Woman was dark for a properly done Superhero movie , not a capepunk movie , but a superhero movie , and sure while it had light elements it still made you question the nature of evil and war and it did show the audience the consequences of war , but most importantly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people die just to save lois or batman lighting someone on fire , these where elements that served the story and the story 's message . <p> As wonderful as this dramatically climactic scene was in highlighting Clark 's everlasting love for Lois if you analyze what Supes actually did to the Earth in terms of simple physics you 'd realize that the change in acceleration of the Earth 's rotation being reversed and then turning it back again would have likely killed maybe 99.999% of the Earth 's multi-cellular animal ( much less human ) population .

@@79253419 @753419/ <p> This is a good point . I 'm not sure how I feel about playing in an interactive environment because I never really experienced that in COH and I do n't  know if its something that is useful or would even be entertaining enough for them to take the effort in making it happen . But I do think that sitting may be something they could do at the very least . I always felt that should be a must . If there 's a bench , and we have butts , why not ? It would also be cool if your powers affected the environment around you in a limited way ( ex : wind attack could send a car flying ) . But I do n't  think rescuing a cat or returning a ladies stolen purse would be worth it . <p> This is actually a good question . I 'm not sure the CoT Devs have covered this topic much ( or if they have I do n't recall it offhand ) . <p> I 'm sure there 'd be a difference between " non-anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " anchored environmental " items ( like trees or lampposts ) in terms of how easy it would be to implement . Things that could change how the environment would " permanently " look to other players would clearly be trickier to support than more temporary type items . <p> Frankly I might just settle on getting to sit in any type of " chair " that exists in the game . Not being able to sit in most chairs in CoH was surprisingly annoying to me . ; ) <p> I 'll be honest , it is a low priority at this time . If we do not have the time to implement by launch , it will come later on . We know how to do it , but taking the time to do it is the concern . <p> Yeah I could see how many types of " environmental interaction " would be relatively hard and/or time consuming to do . But I 'll still put my two cents in for eventually letting us sit in more chairs than we could in CoH . : ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoT to be a MUCH more developed game a few years in than at the start--especially because MWM seems to have pre-planned as much as possible to make future development relatively easy . <p> But I do think that sitting may be something they could do at the very least .

@@79253421 @753421/ <h> How common are " powers " as a whole ? <p> So I was thinking , from my understanding of the details we 've seen . That " powers " themselves are quite rare at the very least those gained from mutation etc etc , do we have any details regarding how many people have even if they are incredibly weak levels aka might have fire-powers but the level that you would light a cigarette with or something ? <p> In addition , do they occur randomly or is it more common in the offspring of " mutated " supers and how does this affect the world and relationships within it . Are we going to see npc 's hinting at for example if its strengthened by certain bloodlines tactical marriages to improve the powers of those supers in the next generation , while i 'm sure many people would say ooh heroes would n't do that . Not all of them are going to be lovely dovey people and might look for anything that would make " them " the strongest . <p> Well from what I recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoT world . This has a double edge sword effect where people with powers go to live without fear . The other edge is Titan City becomes a testing grounds for criminal types . From mad scientist testing out the latest evil robots or creations to villains wanting to make a name for themselves taking out the big Heroes . So the statistics of the CoT Powers are a bit off because Titan City is the anomaly when it comes to ratios . I also remember somewhere the idea that you will see NPC civilians with powers from time to time . An example would be club bouncers or a fire type keeping an outdoor location warm during cold weather . <p> So we might be seeing three classes of the population . 1 . The Active hero/villain types who either fight crime or commit crimes . 2 . Powered people who just live normal lives . A hot dog vendor with angle wings perhaps . 3 . The normal human population . <p> " 106451 @qwx726451 <p> I imagine a lot of what you 're talking about might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would play through .

You can always create your own characters that are involved in as much or as little of all that as you want . <p> As to the general day-to-day world of Titan City goes I think RottenLuck nailed it pretty well . As far as how common powers are you have to figure that people who are strong enough to be " player character strong " are fairly rare .

At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " 106451 @qwx726451 <p> True 15 million supers would make the world a nightmare to live in . I 'm tired so my thinking is n't at 100% . <p> No worries . We 're just collectively making up numbers anyway . The main point is that fully super-powered people should probably be pretty rare in the population regardless . <p> Now if we wanted to get more picky we could factor in an estimate of people with powers who are actually using their powers in public . For example if you 've been watching the current Supergirl TV show part of her backstory ( at least as far as the TV show is concerned ) was that she basically lived as a normal human for like 12 years before she " came out " to the world as a superhero . So with that in mind we could make a guess that maybe as many as 50% of people who have powers might be flying " under the radar " living anonymously and not counting against the total numbers we 've been talking about here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CoT universe is that there has always been those with Powers . They were the inspiration of the " Gods " of old and stories of Hercules and other powered beings . Over time the number of Powered beings dropped but never disappeared . The drop in powered people is why we are n't ruled by a race of " Supermen " . Then WWII happened and the population of powered people started to rise again . At least that 's what my take on the Lore so far . <p> I 'm sure that 'll work . Maybe the Devs of CoT will get around to giving us their estimates for the " numbers " at some point . <p> In the real world , each person has the potential at birth to do almost anything , if given the right opportunities , having the right fortune , and being at the right place at the right time . However , each of us has more potential to do some things than others . My lack of color perception would make several jobs less than ideal , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , let us think of powers for a moment less as a mutation in the X-men world , but more like my color-blindness , a minor oddity that just pushes you to or against certain areas . We all have cases like this , but a great many have no idea about it . I recall a 12 year old girl who was normal , showed no interest in sports or athletics , until she saw a contortionist . She got curious , how did someone do that , so tried it herself like kids are apt to do . Turned out , she had a mutation which made her joints very pliable . Today , she works for Cirque d'Solei , but she would never have had she not seen that contortionist . <p> Just having that mutation was not going to put her on stage . She needed training , from those with more experience . For example , while growing up , I was introduced to computer programming early on , after my maternal grandfather purchased a TI-99A computer and my uncle thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants off my grandmother by programming it to produce what , from a distance , looked like a busted TV tube pattern on their brand new television it was hooked up to . This resulted in my skills and knowledges progressing in a particular direction , because the concept was introduced to me early on . From there , I had books , magazines and other people to turn to and expand this well of information , improving my capability . And this goes for any skill , be it computer coding , twisting yourself into amazing shapes , or even powers . <p> So , let us take your cigarette lighting guy example . He has some kind of innate difference , but has not developed it far . Perhaps , had he found it earlier on , and sought out training , he would be throwing fireballs today , instead of offering someone a complimentary bic service . <p> Then the question becomes , why were there ancients who openly used powers , whom we now call the gods , but not until recently ? <p> Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes opportunity , and it takes training . <p> In the dark ages , those who were different , who expressed that difference , were literally burned at the stake , isolated , cut off , oppressed . This means even if they had the innate and awareness , they would find it far more difficult to have the opportunity , or to locate training . It was only when such prejudices began to fade into legend that powers began to pop up , but always in isolation , and always in a minor way . Not having anything to measure against , few knew the limits possible , so could not push themselves to be better . Much like sports challenges , the immediate aftermath of a record being broken is a slew of other people also surpassing that old record . There was a time that it was claimed nobody could run a 4 minute mile , or lift over 140kg , but today both are common . Once that barrier was broken , people knew they *could* push past it , so they did . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth of powers , particularly around Titan City . The first was the public announcement of super powered beings in the 1930 's . The next was World War 2 , where nations engaged in a crash program to find , secure , and improve the talents they did have . Then it was a fall off , you had people with talent certainly , but they were viewed as throwbacks , of a former era . This led to ever darker fates and empowered beings , until those with powers were viewed as no better than criminals . <p> Then in Titan City , a traumatic event around empowered beings occurred , the Hurricaine of ' 98 incident . A single powered villain , Cumulus Rex , somehow managed to tap into a larger power source , and lost control of his city destroying storm . The handful of powered folk in the city , heroes and villains alike , stopped him , at the cost of their own lives . This inspired the people of the city , who then not only welcomed powered folk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This focus on recruitment , giving the support network needed , was a two fold step . One , by getting those with powers elsewhere to relocate , they could then be tapped to train . Two , by having powers so in the open , it resulted in ever more people trying to see if they even could . And by having more opportunities to improve ones powers , one would see a huge growth in super powered individuals in a short time . <p> We set this two decades in the past , because that mirrors the typical foundation work we find for such programs . The immediate results are there , certainly , but the explosion happens roughly 20 years after such a program begins , when those who grew up under it , the new generation , come into their own . <p> As a result , in just 20 years the very term for those with powers now is tied to the city which welcomed them : Titans <p> " 106465 @qwx726465 106462 @qwx726462 <p> As a result , in just 20 years the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city which welcomed them : Titans <p> Thanks for the overview . Clearly there will be different groups of people who 'll have the " potential " to become powerful and whether they seize those opportunities or not will determine how many " supers " will be actively operating in Titan City . Also there 's the clear difference between people who have " built-in " powers vs. " naturals " who managed to use skills/tech to become super . <p> But like a typical Dev you managed to completely avoid the issue of even offering ballpark " numbers " in terms of what you think are the percentages of the population who could be considered powered or not in Titan City . No need to let sticky things like definitive statements come back to haunt you later lol . <p> We put numbers at roughly 1 in 400 to have the potential for great power worldwide , roughly the same chance as a person being born with red hair and green eyes .

@@79253426 @753426/ <h> How common are " powers " as a whole ? <p> So I was thinking , from my understanding of the details we 've seen . That " powers " themselves are quite rare at the very least those gained from mutation etc etc , do we have any details regarding how many people have even if they are incredibly weak levels aka might have fire-powers but the level that you would light a cigarette with or something ? <p> In addition , do they occur randomly or is it more common in the offspring of " mutated " supers and how does this affect the world and relationships within it . Are we going to see npc 's hinting at for example if its strengthened by certain bloodlines tactical marriages to improve the powers of those supers in the next generation , while i 'm sure many people would say ooh heroes would n't do that . Not all of them are going to be lovely dovey people and might look for anything that would make " them " the strongest . <p> Well from what I recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoT world . This has a double edge sword effect where people with powers go to live without fear . The other edge is Titan City becomes a testing grounds for criminal types . From mad scientist testing out the latest evil robots or creations to villains wanting to make a name for themselves taking out the big Heroes . So the statistics of the CoT Powers are a bit off because Titan City is the anomaly when it comes to ratios . I also remember somewhere the idea that you will see NPC civilians with powers from time to time . An example would be club bouncers or a fire type keeping an outdoor location warm during cold weather . <p> So we might be seeing three classes of the population . 1 . The Active hero/villain types who either fight crime or commit crimes . 2 . Powered people who just live normal lives . A hot dog vendor with angle wings perhaps . 3 . The normal human population . <p> " 106451 @qwx726451 <p> I imagine a lot of what you 're talking about might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would play through .

We 're just collectively making up numbers anyway . The main point is that fully super-powered people should probably be pretty rare in the population regardless . <p> Now if we wanted to get more picky we could factor in an estimate of people with powers who are actually using their powers in public . For example if you 've been watching the current Supergirl TV show part of her backstory ( at least as far as the TV show is concerned ) was that she basically lived as a normal human for like 12 years before she " came out " to the world as a superhero . So with that in mind we could make a guess that maybe as many as 50% of people who have powers might be flying " under the radar " living anonymously and not counting against the total numbers we 've been talking about here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of CoT universe is that there has always been those with Powers .

The drop in powered people is why we are n't ruled by a race of " Supermen " . Then WWII happened and the population of powered people started to rise again . At least that 's what my take on the Lore so far . <p> I 'm sure that 'll work . Maybe the Devs of CoT will get around to giving us their estimates for the " numbers " at some point . <p> In the real world , each person has the potential at birth to do almost anything , if given the right opportunities , having the right fortune , and being at the right place at the right time . However , each of us has more potential to do some things than others . My lack of color perception would make several jobs less than ideal , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now , let us think of powers for a moment less as a mutation in the X-men world , but more like my color-blindness , a minor oddity that just pushes you to or against certain areas . We all have cases like this , but a great many have no idea about it . I recall a 12 year old girl who was normal , showed no interest in sports or athletics , until she saw a contortionist . She got curious , how did someone do that , so tried it herself like kids are apt to do . Turned out , she had a mutation which made her joints very pliable . Today , she works for Cirque d'Solei , but she would never have had she not seen that contortionist . <p> Just having that mutation was not going to put her on stage . She needed training , from those with more experience . For example , while growing up , I was introduced to computer programming early on , after my maternal grandfather purchased a TI-99A computer and my uncle thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants off my grandmother by programming it to produce what , from a distance , looked like a busted TV tube pattern on their brand new television it was hooked up to . This resulted in my skills and knowledges progressing in a particular direction , because the concept was introduced to me early on . From there , I had books , magazines and other people to turn to and expand this well of information , improving my capability . And this goes for any skill , be it computer coding , twisting yourself into amazing shapes , or even powers . <p> So , let us take your cigarette lighting guy example . He has some kind of innate difference , but has not developed it far . Perhaps , had he found it earlier on , and sought out training , he would be throwing fireballs today , instead of offering someone a complimentary bic service . <p> Then the question becomes , why were there ancients who openly used powers , whom we now call the gods , but not until recently ? <p> Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes opportunity , and it takes training . <p> In the dark ages , those who were different , who expressed that difference , were literally burned at the stake , isolated , cut off , oppressed . This means even if they had the innate and awareness , they would find it far more difficult to have the opportunity , or to locate training . It was only when such prejudices began to fade into legend that powers began to pop up , but always in isolation , and always in a minor way . Not having anything to measure against , few knew the limits possible , so could not push themselves to be better . Much like sports challenges , the immediate aftermath of a record being broken is a slew of other people also surpassing that old record . There was a time that it was claimed nobody could run a 4 minute mile , or lift over 140kg , but today both are common . Once that barrier was broken , people knew they *could* push past it , so they did . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth of powers , particularly around Titan City . The first was the public announcement of super powered beings in the 1930 's . The next was World War 2 , where nations engaged in a crash program to find , secure , and improve the talents they did have . Then it was a fall off , you had people with talent certainly , but they were viewed as throwbacks , of a former era . This led to ever darker fates and empowered beings , until those with powers were viewed as no better than criminals . <p> Then in Titan City , a traumatic event around empowered beings occurred , the Hurricaine of ' 98 incident . A single powered villain , Cumulus Rex , somehow managed to tap into a larger power source , and lost control of his city destroying storm . The handful of powered folk in the city , heroes and villains alike , stopped him , at the cost of their own lives . This inspired the people of the city , who then not only welcomed powered folk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This focus on recruitment , giving the support network needed , was a two fold step . One , by getting those with powers elsewhere to relocate , they could then be tapped to train . Two , by having powers so in the open , it resulted in ever more people trying to see if they even could . And by having more opportunities to improve ones powers , one would see a huge growth in super powered individuals in a short time . <p> We set this two decades in the past , because that mirrors the typical foundation work we find for such programs . The immediate results are there , certainly , but the explosion happens roughly 20 years after such a program begins , when those who grew up under it , the new generation , come into their own . <p> As a result , in just 20 years the very term for those with powers now is tied to the city which welcomed them : Titans <p> " 106465 @qwx726465 106462 @qwx726462 <p> As a result , in just 20 years the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city which welcomed them : Titans <p> Thanks for the overview . Clearly there will be different groups of people who 'll have the " potential " to become powerful and whether they seize those opportunities or not will determine how many " supers " will be actively operating in Titan City . Also there 's the clear difference between people who have " built-in " powers vs. " naturals " who managed to use skills/tech to become super . <p> But like a typical Dev you managed to completely avoid the issue of even offering ballpark " numbers " in terms of what you think are the percentages of the population who could be considered powered or not in Titan City . No need to let sticky things like definitive statements come back to haunt you later lol . <p> We put numbers at roughly 1 in 400 to have the potential for great power worldwide , roughly the same chance as a person being born with red hair and green eyes .

COX took a different path , and for much of its existence endgame was essentially rolling up another alt .

EDIT : And I think we have successfully derailed this thread . <p> Oh no I apologize if I gave the impression that I meant " gold spam will not be a problem . " I just wanted to add my two inf that CoH had some fairly solid natural deterrents . I fully agree that there need to be tools in place to stop it before it gets out of hand . <p> FFXIV is actually a full in subscription game , rather than just buy to play . HOWEVER , it seems that there is such a huge market for gil spammers that the subscription is n't a deterrent ( imagine if it was b2p or f2p ; dear lord that would be hell ) . They and ESO are both good cautionary tales , imo , for how not to adequately prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put anything in place to fight it from the outset , and then dilly dallied in reacting to it when it was getting out of hand . FFXIV is going on 4 ( or is it 5 ? ) years old , and they just implemented a gold spam report button that , imho , should have been in place right away . <p> On the other hand CoH , aside from the things i mentioned , responded quickly to killing the market for inf spam in , i think it was 2007 , after innovation enhancements entered the field and started opening a potential market . Iirc the devs added /ignorespammer or something like that into the game , among other things , to shut it down fast . This I do n't  know for sure . I was not in the game until 2009/2010 , so the only info i have on this is based on reading I did on this topic . <p> Has a life-time subscription plan been considered ? I went that route on The Secret World , which had transactions and other stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for subs in advance might mean I could pay for some time I do n't use , for whatever reason , but the opposite might be true as well , and I kind of like the idea of not having a recurring payment if I can help it . <p> Life-time subscription options always sound like an interesting option initially , but they seem to end up being a cash grab red herring . If MWM does implement a lifer sub , I hope they really think it through . <p> What will be MWM 's approach towards competitive balance , especially since not all powersets and archetypes will be available at launch ? Will you nerf based on pvp whining , creative team synergies or large segments of the population skewing towards one build/mechanic ? <p> Life-time subscription options always sound like an interesting option initially , but they seem to end up being a cash grab red herring .

They were a gimmick used some years back , but yes , as you pointed out they seem to inevitably become .... less is the best word . <p> Speaking as a lifer in both CO and LOTRO , I understand exactly what you mean . In both games , I 've been able to more or less live off the monthly stipend of cash shop currency . From the day I bought my LOTRO lifetime sub , I 've spent zero dollars on Turbine Points . ( Or whatever they 're calling them post-Turbine . I have n't looked , TBH . ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had bought Zen for CO after they switched from a " put what customers want in the Zen Store " model to the " put what customers want in lockboxes and make the Zen Store the only place to get keys " model . <p> In other words , I 'm a drag on both of those games ' regular cash flows , because I 'm not spending even small amounts of real money on a consistent basis . ( Well , LOTRO 's cash flow . I 'll probably never darken a doorstep in Millennium City again . ) CO still offers a subscription option , but I 'm long past the time that the lifer purchase has paid for itself in monthly sub fees . And even after not playing LOTRO for years and burning through accumulated stipend to catch up on expansions , I still have free money in their store that 's unspent . <p> ( And as an aside , I still have n't spent a dime on LOTRO lockboxes because the boxes themselves and their keys are both very rare drops from mobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along with one or two freebies they threw in as anniversary gifts , I have yet to be stuck with a box and no key . ) <p> As I recall , CoX did n't  seem to have any real problem with gold spammers ( inf spammers ? ) <p> Gold spammers became " a thing " thanks to World of Warcraft and its huge market of ( captive ? ) players . The methods and techniques got ... honed ... in World of Warcraft , and what the scammers learned from that experience ( and income ) then proliferated to other games . <p> Safehouse wrote : <p> Also helps that the CoH community , for the most part , was mature enough that it was n't as likely to have people in it who would buy inf to get ahead . <p> That 's only viable AFTER a community has " congealed " into a coherent identity that can be self-reinforcing .

Basically , you get like two deletes that reset after 24hours or so . Prevents creating toons after getting blocked for spamming and then just making new ones ad infinitum . So this limits you to one new spambot per day per account in the long run . Du n no if they have a problem with fraud accounts from stolen cards .

This was back in 2007(ish) , its going back 10 years or so , but I know it was definitely before 2010 ... possibly around the GvE edition . *shrugs* <p> Yes I explicitly acknowledged in a later post the fact that CoH had , at one point or another , issues with it . However , by the time I had joined the game it had died down precipitously to just about nothing ; I read that it spiked in 2007 , but even at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . Not nonexistent , but nothing like what I have encountered in other games . <p> I have not been remotely disagreeing with the notion that there need to be things in place to combat gold selling from the get go . I was more just trying to voice my opinion that CoH handled gold selling really well , and that the gear system , as something that was different than how other mmos handle endgame gear , might have helped that . But at this point , it 's kind of a moot point and I 'm talking in circles , lol <p> If it helps , I think I have a story about how the gold spammers went about starting in CoH . ( Quick disclaimer : My evidence is only circumstantial . ) This was on redside Victory server before the inf spam started . Victory was never the largest server and the villain side was small enough that folks " knew " each other as often as not . Two players soon became WELL known for odd behavior . " Good Dog " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always the same way . On teams they would NEVER speak . Their play seemed solid enough , but the conduct started to wear on folks . If you went out of your way to talk TO them then silence was the only response . The only way they responded was to accept a team invite . Now for the most part , no one would have bothered tracking this behavior , but I had an interest in doing so as Good Dog had joined my VG . Other VG members and coalies started grumbling about the invite spam our name was attached to and I noticed something else . Good Dog had NEVER earned any prestige for my VG . We were n't enforcing any strict quotas by that point but zero prestige was unheard of . Over the course of a few weeks I sent several tells requesting some time in SG mode with silence as response . <p> Eventually I made the call to kick him from the VG . ( Hard call as he had n't done any one thing wrong , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Had to wonder WHY he had joined a VG if he had no intent to be social whatsoever ? The answer I came up with was the zone teleporters sped up his relentless grinding . <p> Soon after the inf spam started and I drew a connection . Spammers would need some level 50s to best grind the inf . My VG and coalition had some highs and lows over time , but Good Dog remained a shadowy smudge on our history that I had n't talked about until now . <p> 1 ) Before Freedom , the starting mission arc after the tutorial was based on your character 's origin and which starting zone you selected , meaning you could play 10 characters before replaying the same initial arc . CoV of course started with only one arc , increasing to two after many player complaints .

Two examples come to mind : <p> 1 ) Some CoH attack powersets had special effects that built on using your powers in certain combinations . Dual Blades and Street Fighting ( Combos/Finishers ) , Psionic Melee ( Insight ) , Beam Rifle ( Disintegration ) , Water Blast ( Tidal Power ) , Savage Melee ( Blood Frenzy ) , Titan Weapons ( Momentum ) and probably a few others I 'm forgetting . Personally I felt this made using your powers more interesting than just spamming 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . Some of this could probably fall under the proposed CoT momentum system , but there could be some other interesting applications as well . <p> 2 ) Interactions between powers or the environment - first thing comes to mind is the Oil Slick from Trick Arrow igniting from any Fire or Energy damage applied to it . Another is targetable fires ( like the burning buildings in Steel Canyon ) being affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plans/insights/ideas feel free to let them slip ; p <p> 1 ) Some CoH attack powersets had special effects that built on using your powers in certain combinations .

What you mention here is exactly why I did n't like some of those sets . The combos of dual blades I found locked me into an attack chain too forcefully , whereas with other sets I could mix up my chain more depending on the situation--focusing on controls , AoEs , etc. as circumstances determined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't have the opportunity to try some of the other sets , as an arm injury kept me from playing CoH the last 18 months or so . <p> Some more questions : <p> 1 . Is there any update on pets ? Do we know more about how they will be controlled ? ( Like **33;320;TOOLONG ? ) Will Commander control sets have access to pets ? Will pets be accessible through tertiaries ? <p> 2 . City of Heroes characters accessed their primary 's tier 9 power at 32 ; CoT is initially planned to be playable to level 30 . Of course I do n't know the powers design , but this suggests we may not see all the powers available in a set at launch . If so , do you anticipate this affecting balance or player choice at all ? It may not really matter depending on how soon afterwards you expect to raise the level cap , but I am curious . <p> 3 . Some questions on combat : <p> CoH had a default assumption of 3 even-level minions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I would describe CoH 's pacing of combat as moderate , and yet it managed to maintain a steady stream of action . How would you describe the intended pace in CoT ? <p> Low-level characters in CoH often had long gaps in attack chains due to having few powers and recharge often being long relative to activation time . I do n't necessarily see this as a negative , as it gave players a chance to learn a character at a gradual pace , but I note CoH filled these gaps more over time by introducing origin powers , vet powers , removal of brawl 's endurance cost ( IIRC ) , etc . How are you handling this issue ? <p> How will these assumptions--and combat in general--change as you level up ? <p> You announced the fall of 2018 launch .

That said in GW2 there are some combos that take effect if there are multiple effects in the same area . IE if someone lays down a DOT field ( think hot feet ) and someone uses a blast type power ( fireball ) in that field there is a bonus damage associated with that or it can feed a buff back to the blast user ( damage/acc/crit ) . So that may be a way to work it . Basically it 'd end up that certain powers might enhance the damage rating or crit chance for other users resulting in " combo " damage . Without being " logical " combos like oil slick and fire arrow . <p> I 've been really interested in a sample powerset . To get a better idea of how combat will work .

Give us 4 topics for the next update and see which one comes out on top . Next update covers that topic . <p> One of the features of our old City that was a great boon to players with busy lives was the fact that if you were playing instanced content solo and Real Lifetm intervened , you could find a safe spot , go deal with the rl issue , and come back to a not-dead , not-logged-off character . Obviously there were exceptions , such as timed missions , but for most content this was the case . <p> Will there be adequate solo/small-group content ? I KNOW it 's an MMORPG but some people like to play loner characters and/or just prefer to play solo or in very small groups .

And is there going to be any kind of drop system for gear ? <p> There will be a way to set the ' difficulty ' ( level and number of mobs ) for your missions and also a ' dynamic ' difficulty function based on the number of people in the team . So most of the content will be soloable . Some missions may have a minimum team-size . <p> Drops should go directly into your inventory and there wo n't be ' gear ' in the usual sense . There will be items to improve your existing powers . 
@@79253432 @753432/ <h> Boss Rage Timers <p> One of my pet hates from MMO 's as time has gone hard is to artificially force the removal of tactics and rather create tank and spank mechanics through the introduction of a concept called rage timers . <p> Rage timer , the idea that for no reason in an rp sense the boss turns into pretty much a one hit killing machine due to a time-frame that a team has sustained conflict with it . <p> I would much rather boss fights be difficult but reward alternative tactics for bringing the bosses down , for example if you can sustain long enough to get a victory that should still be a victory . <p> Ways to prevent just wars of attrition could be the removal of the ability to regenerate mana/energy through normal means , this would mean you would burn through supplies to replenish through fights . <p> Never liked rage timers myself since they just devolve into DPS races . <p> As for removing normal resource regen , please no . If it is anywhere near to how it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we can gain new ones and it would make it mandatory to have at least one person on the team with an ability that can replenish resources for the whole team . <p> As for removing normal resource regen , please no . If it is anywhere near to how it was in CoH then we would burn through those supplies way faster than we can gain new ones and it would make it mandatory to have at least one person on the team with an ability that can replenish resources for the whole team . <p> I believe rage timers will not be present here . I did n't quite understand your explanation , but I think you mean when a boss let 's loose with some sort of super-attack when it gets to 25% health or something like that , right ? <p> In any event , MWM have told us they will be using something called momentum . And as momentum builds , it can be used to fuel various effects , it also dissipates and when it does , it gets turned into a resource equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NPC 's get momentum , so I would expect that boss monsters have some pretty cool momentum-fueled attacks .

Now that 's just lazy game design . <p> I can think of 101 different ways to implement a " you took too long to clear the encounter " ending . Enraging the boss is not one of them . Besides , if we 're going to have instanced raids , I would hope the encounters do n't have a timer like this . The marathon battles where the last healer has to solo the boss and chips away at his last 2% for 15 minutes are the stuff of legends .

Also note that it would break the design-philosophy of that any group composition should be viable for any content by effectively mandating that those support sets are present for some content . <p> Afaik the only boss in COH that had a " rage " mode was an early incarnation of Hamidon . Part of that was due to player tactics . Essentially if the assault force , around 200 players in this case , were not able to hold the Hamidon during a particular phase the Hamidon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone . Because players were typically in large clusters this created a diabolical cluster of Mitos that would tear apart anything that got within range . <p> Like I said this had more to do with player tactics than an actual rage timer . The design was that only a few dozen people would be engaged in combat with the Hamidon and they would clear the mitochondria each time they spawned However , because players were trying to get the most rewards possible that meant coming up with tactics that rewarded the most people possible . Thus cramming the zone with 200 combatants became a desirable endeavor . The raid was eventually changed and the zone limited to 50 players to prevent this sort of event engineering . <p> Anyway , long tales from times gone by aside , seems like a no-brainer to me . Let the people fight if they want to fight even if they never win . In COH there were plenty of people who would take on impossible fights solo , just to see if they could . I was one of them .

Just to be clear , the issue here is n't about classes but rather specific power sets . Considering that there will be some classes with support secondaries then forcing specific classes would be hard , only way I can see that being done would most likely go against another design philosophy that of no class exclusive power sets ( at least outside of epic ATs ) . <p> Guess you did n't raid much in CoH ( well , technically I did n't either ) but from the experience I had in it buffers and debuffers were more than welcome since in aggregate they brought more than straight up DPS would , even when you include their secondary effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , mainly tanks , the synergy with support shifts . Take a regen tank , they synergise better with defense and/or resistance buffers than with " straight healers " since they cover the areas that the regen tank is most lacking in . <p> There are other ways to make control/support classes viable , especially when you look at the whole " piece " of content being done and not just a single event ( a.k.a the boss fight ) in it . <p> Rage timers and lockout were two mechanics that absolutely flabbergasted me when I started playing other games after CoH shut down .

Not ... a ... fan . I 'm not saying that there could n't possibly be good , fun ways to implement these things if they were needed for some reason , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to see them implemented in a fun way . If this is in reference to The Secret World , I absolutely agree . CoH/V will always have a strong place in my heart , but TSW was also a fantastic game that was n't so much as ruined by them but the aforementioned rage timers and dungeon lockouts certainly did n't make it any better . It forced players to limited chances at and therefore experience in dungeons ( they should have had a loot lockout instead ) , which made it difficult to learn fights and get better , and then rage timers reduced the very expansive and creative skill wheel to canned , highly optimized FotM builds that if you did n't have , you would be kicked nigh-immediately from teams because you either were n't purely in DPS gear or heal gear or tank gear . I get it , these are n't the early 2000s and people ca n't commit to hours-long raids anymore , but rage timers are NOT the solution . I 've mentioned this before previously that I severely hope that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TSW , many MMO 's have such limitations . Rage timers are not so much about reducing the time it takes to kill the boss since during the time it takes for you to learn the boss having to start over again once you hit the rage-timer can extend the total time to several times that of what it would have taken if they could just keep going . From what I 've heard it was more about " forcing " you learn the encounter and then to do it in an efficient manner which somewhat makes sense , but imo that is the worst way of doing it . Personally I think that having varying amount of loot based on different criteria would be a better way to do it since it does n't force you into doing it a specific way . I was n't inferring that TSW was the only one to do it , just that it was the one for me that leapt immediately to mind . Literally every dungeon in TSW had rage timers , not just their raid . I 've played about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down ( TSW , SWTOR , Neverwinter , Tera , etc ) and I never ran into rage timers to the extent that I did in TSW , which is why I thought of it first . I ca n't say for certain what it 's intent was , but I as I mentioned before I certainly saw what it 's implementation did in regards to it 's effect on the game . Sorry if I made it sound like that but we are talking to a larger audience here and not everyone may have the experiences that we have , so to be one the safe side it 's not a bad idea to add in a bit more clarity . <p> I did raid occasionally in CoH , but at the time I was fairly young . I was raiding Burning Crusade in WoW at age 12 . However , The city of heroes account was n't mine my father had three I think by the end and I had two characters that i mained a Blaster and a Scrapper , Occassionally I would get brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue moon . <p> Now I agree CoH was how I would say before recent trends , Now the holy trinity is much more strict . After playing games like wildstar , having no ability in the raiding/high tier dungeon environment to play hybrid support type characters because of the lack of " dps " . Its why i believe its nessassary to create a 4th part and break the trinity , otherwise we will get into the cycle of a raid have X number of tanks , X number of healers and XX numbers of dps . Its always made the players wanting to play tanks often get forced into DPS if they want to field on raid parties . <p> I 've always been lucky in my case ive always served in guilds that have needed experienced raid tanks , up until Wildstar when i decided i would give a support build and in the end it was pointless because it was n't viable due to the games rage mechanics . <p> The first raid i did with Serenity in SWTOR , how many times that the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reason , all it goes to show is the boss is so badly designed and weak that they had to develop a mechanic to make it impossible to beat unless it had 1% health left . <p> EDIT : while i do n't have fears of the CoH/CoV community being inclusive , if the game design does n't allow for it and the content forces a tank and spank play type , hybrids and the laugh that comes with them get wiped out . <p> Raid timer or not , if the condition for success is to defeat the target by bringing it to 0 hit points , no matter the method , there will be one constant : some metric of required dps . <p> CoH allowed for a huge range of possible combinations to achieve success . There were all tank teams ( hinTanker Tuesdays ) , all defender teams ( hello fellow Repeat Offenders ! ) , and anything in between . We certainly want to provide the same range of play in CoT . <p> I 'm not a fan of rage timers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular encounter . i do n't feel it should be part of every encounter . It can be a tool in the kit , just not the only one to grab . <p> While CoH relied on high regen , which either required sufficient straight dps , or leaned heavily on regen debuffs , we 're looking to impart amwider range of useful mechanics . Every type of power should have its uses . Say a big bad has no evasive powers , and you have a support with evasion debuffs - those debuffs will still have some impact on the encounter . <p> Controls being non-binary will mean they will always have some effect in game play even if the big bad ismdifficult to control . <p> We will have our Momentum mechanic which can make encounters interesting : what happens when high dps on the big bad builds its momentum that let 's it use a game-changing power ? Suddenly , the encounter becomes less about defeating the big bad as fast as possible , but about pacing . <p> And we can still rely on other mechanics such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat to trigger a new form . <p> One thing I 'd like to experiement with ( this is by far no promise ) , is different conditions of " defeat " , instead of the tried and true 0 hp to win , including a Captured status - where the target is fully controlled for a certain length of time - now it is control-output over time instead of dps , or Demoralized status - where the target is debuffed to such a degree for a long enough time that it can not itself " win " by defeating the players and it " gives up " . <p> These would be very new types of mechanics and again , would need some serious testing , but could open up more comvinations for ways to win for the players . <p> One thing I 'd like to experiement with ( this is by far no promise ) , is different conditions of " defeat " , instead of the tried and true 0 hp to win , including a Captured status - where the target is fully controlled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time instead of dps , or Demoralized status - where the target is debuffed to such a degree for a long enough time that it can not itself " win " by defeating the players and it " gives up " . These would be very new types of mechanics and again , would need some serious testing , but could open up more comvinations for ways to win for the players . <p> I like these ideas . The ' Captured ' status reminds me of the days when lag was the true enemy of original Hami Raids , and we used to just spam holds on the boss and defeat him with Containment damage . We 'd have the DPS run in towards the end to get their one hit and then stay out of the jello to reduce the chance of failure due to lag as much as possible . It was slower and boring , but it would help to guarantee a win for the server and HOs all around .

It is a matter of parity of types of effects and time .

There are a couple of ways to peel away a layer : one way is to remove all the hit points of that layer . Another way is to completely mez/stun/stop the boss fully . Once all the layers are gone , the boss is defeated . How the boss actually loses will depend on whether the last layer was removed by damage or mez . <p> since mez/stuns are not binary and since the boss has the ability to shake them off by spending its own momentum , it could be possible to make it so both methods could take about the same amount of time and effort on the part of the group . Allowing the boss to use different momentum effects depending on whether it is being mezzed or damaged would go a long way towards balancing the encounter . <p> This way , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mez party to fall back on damage if their mezzers get taken out half-way through or if he just proves to be too tough to mezz down . ... or vice versa . <p> Tactical response team lobs a stun grenade into a room .

Tactical response team rushes in , throws bad guy to the ground and handcuffs him . <p> I assume this is the kind of thing introduced in the last ten or so posts ? <p> If so , I like it . I 'm not sure how to implement such a defeat condition in a way that is both intuitive and satisfying , but I would very much like to see it attempted . <p> Especially as a choice that affects the three-way morality parameter . Soft take down vs. hard take down vs. termination . That would fit nicely . <p> the mechanics still lean toward damage being thr most consistent method . <p> Having a " lean " in the Defeat methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damage Only is ... less than satisfactory .

However , times have sadly changed . <p> I do tend to get ranty depending on the subject , but in all honesty that was n't one of those occasions , believe it or not . This , on the other hand ... <p> Firstly , I apologize . I should have defined TSW ( The Secret World ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mistakenly assumed you knew what it was . And you did state that you had n't read everything , so that was on me . <p> Secondly , thank you for the clarification on the hard/soft timers . <p> Third , I ca n't say I agree that CoH/V " failed . " Yes , it was shut down , but Posi even stated that going to their hybrid model was extremely profitable for them in one of his AMAs on Reddit , so saying that they unabashedly failed ( without further definition ) is hard for me to let pass . I 'm going to hazard a guess and say that you meant that they failed at raid mechanics , but I ca n't agree with that they failed because of lack of more involved raid content . Now , to be fair , I agree with some of the points you made . Original Hamidon was boring . It 's safe to say , as you mentioned , that many of us were guilty of putting an attack on auto after putting the bubbler on follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I feel that they did do better with later Incarnate Trial content , such as the Avatar of Hamidon in the Underground Trial and Tyrant in Magisterium , but yes , they were never as complicated ( some might say overly complicated ) as WoW raid boss encounters . And I might not 've been a dev in CoH/V , so it 's my opinion that they never intended raid encounters to be that way , that they should be more accessible to the average , even casual , gamer . Do I think they should have reduced the difficulty for the lowest common denominator ? Absolutely not , but they should n't get to the point where people are wiping on them , hour after hour , night after night , for weeks to months , like vanilla WoW . That 's just frustrating , and many of us are n't college-dorm dwelling kids anymore that have ridiculous amounts of free time at our disposal . And my personal frustration with rage timers comes from playing TSW following CoH/V 's shutdown . In all of their dungeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage timer ( vis a vis the players ) literally forced a very imaginative and creative skill system into canned builds to try and maximize DPS . People would literally kick you off the team if you were n't in full DPS gear , even if your hybrid build was better due to gear/skill synergy . All people looked at was your 1410 health and knew that you had all DPS gear on . If you did n't , boom , gone . Players were trying to ensure that they could deal enough DPS to beat the rage timers , which resulted in poorer gameplay and unimaginative gearing options . It was literally the only mechanic they had . So , suffice it to say , I 'm a little salty on the concept and implementation of rage timers . As I mentioned before , it 's not like I do n't think that CoT should n't have them . They should have them sparingly and with igoodi reason . Big Boss fight in dungeon 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 should n't all have rage timers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through content . I also enjoy tinkering with builds and coming up with clever synergies , in addition to playing for challenge . That does n't mean everyone should be encouraged or even required to play that way . Again , like I mentioned before , I believe in options . And those options should include difficulty sliders , much like CoH/V had . That way , if you want easily bash your way through hordes of flunkies , knock your ( or their ) socks off . If you want to run through mobs of elite bosses for the difficulty , that should be available to you too . This also applies to raid content . A previous suggestion of mine was that it should scale to the number of people involved , either in health/damage , or even in mechanics , such as the boss switching from single target attacks to targeted AoE and/or PBAoE . Thankfully , the devs have said that they 've looked at other " defeat conditions " to beat bosses . So I 'm all for more challenging content and keeping players engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredibly annoying amount of damage templates or forcing them to bring only certain characters/builds/gear for a certain amount of DPS . <p> As for the holy trinity , there 's a whole other epic thread about that . Let 's just say I 'm a fan of asymmetrical warfare . <p> Ah , a good response ! Nice to have people who are willing to actually discuss something . That said , for rants , it would be nice if you broke it up a bit better ; - ) . Purely because I 'm one who has to re-read sentences often , and easy to get lost in gigantic paragraphs . Also , I meant mine was a rant , not yours . <p> Also , CoX did n't exactly FAIL , you 're correct . I do think it could have been a bit better with a better progression system , and end game . But they had a seriously loyal fanbase , and I 'm sure the fanbase alone would have kept the game alive . NCSoft truly allowed for such great things to hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also , I think any of the major named bosses should have had some sort of mechanic to them . Instead of just being a damage sponge with hero/villain abilities . Some of the Arch-Nemesis fights could have truly been memorable . And some were downright difficult , but all in all , pretty bland . Just simple mechanics , like if they were about to do Energy Nova , players had to go hide behind something , or anything like that . As for raids , I 'd personally rather see map wide events over instanced raids . <p> As for TSW , that sounds terrible . That is taking a single mechanic , and running with it to extremes just to make it seem like the fight is difficult . Horrible horrible design . And I 'd never want to see that in CoT . If CoT did have rage , I would want it to be strict enough where people just ca n't afk in a fight . Or basically go 100% survivability , and turn what should be a 5-10 minute fight , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to beat it . <p> I 'm for holy trinity , and asymmetry . Either or works fine for me , as long as the bosses have some sort of mechanic that make me think . Guild Wars 2 had horrific battles at first , but they certainly have grown with the asymmetry and added a lot of really neat mechanics . So it is definitely possible . <p> As for " casuals " ( Not used as derogatory term ) , I agree that sometimes you just want to smack an instanced and have some fun . I 'm 100% for that , I just want to make sure there is some challenging content that makes me think during combat , not just mash the most powerful button available . <p> Considering creating a boss mechanic thread to see what things we can think of . <p> Considering creating a boss mechanic thread to see what things we can think of . <p> If it has n't already been posted , I 'm interested in seeing what people throw against the wall to see what sticks . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of joy to find the exact vague image I was looking for . <p> If MWM implements rage timers , which I hope is very sparingly , then I seriously hope they justify it better than what essentially is the standard " you took too long so I 'm gon na hulk out and smash your heads in " justification . <p> Yeah ... I 'm not liking this idea of rage timers unless used very , very sparingly as blacke4dawn says . It sounds a little too much like " you must fight this boss in this one way only . " Likewise , I 'll never be a fan of any encounter that requires a specific mix of ATs or power sets . I would hope one of the best parts of our old game that will see a resurrection in CoT is the idea that you can run any content with any mix of characters . <p> I could see value in a few rage timers to add flavor to lore-appropriate bosses , but only if there 's a way to counter each one - maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players can trigger to de-rage the boss , such as immobilizing it for ten seconds or making it move to a certain debuffing location built in to the map . These conditions should also be matched to the nature of the boss , grounded in lore , and explained in-game . If a boss is designed with no de-rage mechanic , then I 'd like to see it suffer a massive weakness in exchange for its rage damage ( or whatever buff the rage timer gives them ) . For example , perhaps the boss becomes unable to use its ranged attacks , or gets stunned when attacked from above . <p> Another way of saying it - I 'd like any rage timers to simply mean a change in tactics , not an automatic loss . <p> +1 to blacke4dawn and Cinnder . Timers fix tactics too much . As an occasional novelty they 'd be fine , but not as the general , or even a common , type of boss . <p> I 'm too tired , so I 'm going to be blunt , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say that sounds pretty terrible . There needs to be some sort of set variables to a boss changing their tactics . A random boss here and there would be fine . But if it is random , unless the bosses are literally so easy it does n't matter , you 're looking at mass RNG fights . Meaning , you could quite often be screwed in a fight , simply because the dice roll of their tactics . <p> I believe I understand what you want , but it is better on paper than reality . <p> Empyrean wrote : +1 to blacke4dawn and Cinnder .

I was n't clear in that what I meant was that I would n't want timers to be the ONLY or the MAIN mechanic , but in most cases there should be a mechanic other than just a DPS RNG fights--though once in a while even these can be fun . <p> Yeah but CoX bosses did n't have mechanics at all . CoX had only spank and tank , there was nothing else to it . <p> Granted , I think I only did 1 or 2 trials ( They were kinda after my days ) , but I do n't really remember them having anything memorable either . <p> Although very few task force AVs ( bosses ) below level 45 had memorable mechanics beyond a few special attacks , I actually liked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that content a try without worrying about reading " dungeon guides " or being afraid to join a pick-up group ( PUG ) . <p> I remember all of the trial AVs having at least one " mechanic " , though I realize we could be working off of different definitions of that word . Some involved temp powers , mini-rage timers , avoiding location AoE killzones , keeping summons under control , and triggering events to buff the players ( without which , they would die or be unable to harm the boss ) . Most trials also had time limits on several of their phases , including the final AV . In some cases , the trial put less emphasis on the final AV and more into the overall sequence of events - I tended to see these as if the trial itself was the boss , along with its mechanics as a whole . <p> Back to the higher-level , more traditional task forces : &gt; Kahn TF 's Reichsman brought in other AVs to the fight and would repeatedly go nearly invulnerable until a temp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work poorly at times or give no indication it was working . The summoned AV often stayed at range and seemed to ignore a tank . &gt; The ITF could be considered to have mechanics involving the interactions of the final 3 AVs and how to separate them or otherwise trick them into being more easily defeated . Players could try several methods to avoid the AV-death stun. &gt; Lady Grey 's two final AVs were surrounded by masses of Rikti with plenty of ranged stuns , too many to effectively " tank " , so non-defensive characters had to work around that problem . &gt; Statesman TF had some mechanics built into the buffing towers at the end , but also encouraged some thought ( even if it was just oriented toward careful tanking/pulling ) during the prior multi-AV fight . <p> Of course , some non-trial mechanics could be overcome with enough damage/buffs/debuffs , and commonly were on a fully-IO 'd team or after Incarnate abilities were added to the game . Some might call this a problem , but I 'm fine with content that drops out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the overall pattern , once incarnate trials were added to the game , is worth using in CoT 's design . Low level bosses with no mechanics to encourage PUGs , higher level bosses with one or two basic mechanics , and trial bosses with a range of different mechanics . When possible , the mechanics should allow several tactics to work against them , so that most team compositions have at least one viable method to win . <p> Looks like I may be holding a minority position yet again in the forum . Oh well , at least I hope it adds to the discussion . While I ca n't say I am a huge proponent of boss rage timers per se , I get and agree with Klaleara 's point when it came to CoH . There 's something fundamentally " wrong " when people are n't required to understand the basic mechanics of their AT ( or even be present ) and yet consistently enjoy the fruits of victory . That happened all too often in CoH . IMHO , the downside of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skill ) wise is that it ultimately led to too much of a dumbing down of bosses to allow for that . <p> Say what you will about the trinity ( and I 'm not certainly not a proponent of forcing that on CoT players either ) and rage timers but at least it was an attempt at saying " do nothing or do something stupid and you may not be able to recover from that " . Maybe it 's just me . But while this multiple paths to victory thing sounds great on the surface , I do n't get how you accommodate that without making a bad situation even worse in terms of challenging and rewarding individual players within a team in an appropriate way . <p> With multiple routes , I agree that it is only great on the surface . I 'd hate to say it , but it would be a waste of time for the devs to really do that for a bunch of bosses . <p> The reasons I say this , I 've seen several MMO 's attempt this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had different routes . And know what happened ? Everyone found the quickest , easiest ways , and that was the only way to do it from there on out . <p> People will always find the quickest , most efficient way , and that will become the only way people to do it . You wo n't find groups who even want to try the other routes . <p> RIP the Oregon Trail scenario thing in Wildstar . Always wanted to try the other paths . <p> I liked the mechanics they originally had in the respec trial . Then they spaced out the spawns so much I spent most of the trial with /em newspaper . <p> Well the respec trial was presumably in the game to help players earn a way to correct their badly built characters . So technically the trial had to be easy enough that even the most gimpy group of players could succeed . This lead to it being nerfed down almost to the point that players could take naps between the waves at the end . <p> I do n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . I 'm just suggesting that using that mechanic for the " respec trial " was probably not a good decision overall . They maybe should have applied that concept to some other trial that did n't need to be , almost by definition , super easy to accomplish . <p> I see what Khaleara is saying . Many bosses were not very tactical . I disagree with rage timers being the correct way or rather only way to treat that . The most heroic I ever felt was fighting Countess Crey . I was on my Sonic/NRG blaster and was the last one left standing with her at over half . It took a long ass time but I beat her down . If she had a rage timer we 'd have been team wiped and had to start over . I 'm all for intuitive dynamics for boss fights . There 's a place for a rage timer but it 's not the only dynamic to consider . 
@@79253433 @753433/ <h> Boss Rage Timers <p> One of my pet hates from MMO 's as time has gone hard is to artificially force the removal of tactics and rather create tank and spank mechanics through the introduction of a concept called rage timers . <p> Rage timer , the idea that for no reason in an rp sense the boss turns into pretty much a one hit killing machine due to a time-frame that a team has sustained conflict with it . <p> I would much rather boss fights be difficult but reward alternative tactics for bringing the bosses down , for example if you can sustain long enough to get a victory that should still be a victory . <p> Ways to prevent just wars of attrition could be the removal of the ability to regenerate mana/energy through normal means , this would mean you would burn through supplies to replenish through fights . <p> Never liked rage timers myself since they just devolve into DPS races . <p> As for removing normal resource regen , please no . If it is anywhere near to how it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we can gain new ones and it would make it mandatory to have at least one person on the team with an ability that can replenish resources for the whole team . <p> As for removing normal resource regen , please no . If it is anywhere near to how it was in CoH then we would burn through those supplies way faster than we can gain new ones and it would make it mandatory to have at least one person on the team with an ability that can replenish resources for the whole team . <p> I believe rage timers will not be present here . I did n't quite understand your explanation , but I think you mean when a boss let 's loose with some sort of super-attack when it gets to 25% health or something like that , right ? <p> In any event , MWM have told us they will be using something called momentum . And as momentum builds , it can be used to fuel various effects , it also dissipates and when it does , it gets turned into a resource equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NPC 's get momentum , so I would expect that boss monsters have some pretty cool momentum-fueled attacks . However , I expect it will not be too different from what you refer to as rage attacks , If I understand your meaning correctly . <p> I believe rage timers will not be present here .

Now that 's just lazy game design . <p> I can think of 101 different ways to implement a " you took too long to clear the encounter " ending . Enraging the boss is not one of them . Besides , if we 're going to have instanced raids , I would hope the encounters do n't have a timer like this . The marathon battles where the last healer has to solo the boss and chips away at his last 2% for 15 minutes are the stuff of legends . ( I know , because I did that as a healer in a game once years ago and it felt so epic I 'm still blushing from the excitement as I recall it ) <p> blacke4dawn wrote : As for removing normal resource regen , please no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in CoH then we would burn through those supplies way faster than we can gain new ones and it would make it mandatory to have at least one person on the team with an ability that can replenish resources for the whole team .

Also note that it would break the design-philosophy of that any group composition should be viable for any content by effectively mandating that those support sets are present for some content . <p> Afaik the only boss in COH that had a " rage " mode was an early incarnation of Hamidon . Part of that was due to player tactics . Essentially if the assault force , around 200 players in this case , were not able to hold the Hamidon during a particular phase the Hamidon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone . Because players were typically in large clusters this created a diabolical cluster of Mitos that would tear apart anything that got within range . <p> Like I said this had more to do with player tactics than an actual rage timer . The design was that only a few dozen people would be engaged in combat with the Hamidon and they would clear the mitochondria each time they spawned However , because players were trying to get the most rewards possible that meant coming up with tactics that rewarded the most people possible . Thus cramming the zone with 200 combatants became a desirable endeavor . The raid was eventually changed and the zone limited to 50 players to prevent this sort of event engineering . <p> Anyway , long tales from times gone by aside , seems like a no-brainer to me . Let the people fight if they want to fight even if they never win . In COH there were plenty of people who would take on impossible fights solo , just to see if they could . I was one of them .

Not ... a ... fan . <p> I 'm not saying that there could n't possibly be good , fun ways to implement these things if they were needed for some reason , but I do n't know why they would be needed and I 've yet to see them implemented in a fun way . <p> blacke4dawn wrote : Scipio wrote : blacke4dawn wrote : As for removing normal resource regen , please no .

Just to be clear , the issue here is n't about classes but rather specific power sets . Considering that there will be some classes with support secondaries then forcing specific classes would be hard , only way I can see that being done would most likely go against another design philosophy that of no class exclusive power sets ( at least outside of epic ATs ) . <p> Guess you did n't raid much in CoH ( well , technically I did n't either ) but from the experience I had in it buffers and debuffers were more than welcome since in aggregate they brought more than straight up DPS would , even when you include their secondary effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , mainly tanks , the synergy with support shifts . Take a regen tank , they synergise better with defense and/or resistance buffers than with " straight healers " since they cover the areas that the regen tank is most lacking in . <p> There are other ways to make control/support classes viable , especially when you look at the whole " piece " of content being done and not just a single event ( a.k.a the boss fight ) in it . <p> Rage timers and lockout were two mechanics that absolutely flabbergasted me when I started playing other games after CoH shut down .

After playing games like wildstar , having no ability in the raiding/high tier dungeon environment to play hybrid support type characters because of the lack of " dps " . Its why i believe its nessassary to create a 4th part and break the trinity , otherwise we will get into the cycle of a raid have X number of tanks , X number of healers and XX numbers of dps . Its always made the players wanting to play tanks often get forced into DPS if they want to field on raid parties . <p> I 've always been lucky in my case ive always served in guilds that have needed experienced raid tanks , up until Wildstar when i decided i would give a support build and in the end it was pointless because it was n't viable due to the games rage mechanics . <p> The first raid i did with Serenity in SWTOR , how many times that the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reason , all it goes to show is the boss is so badly designed and weak that they had to develop a mechanic to make it impossible to beat unless it had 1% health left . <p> EDIT : while i do n't have fears of the CoH/CoV community being inclusive , if the game design does n't allow for it and the content forces a tank and spank play type , hybrids and the laugh that comes with them get wiped out . <p> Raid timer or not , if the condition for success is to defeat the target by bringing it to 0 hit points , no matter the method , there will be one constant : some metric of required dps . <p> CoH allowed for a huge range of possible combinations to achieve success . There were all tank teams ( hinTanker Tuesdays ) , all defender teams ( hello fellow Repeat Offenders ! ) , and anything in between . We certainly want to provide the same range of play in CoT . <p> I 'm not a fan of rage timers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular encounter . i do n't feel it should be part of every encounter . It can be a tool in the kit , just not the only one to grab . <p> While CoH relied on high regen , which either required sufficient straight dps , or leaned heavily on regen debuffs , we 're looking to impart amwider range of useful mechanics . Every type of power should have its uses . Say a big bad has no evasive powers , and you have a support with evasion debuffs - those debuffs will still have some impact on the encounter . <p> Controls being non-binary will mean they will always have some effect in game play even if the big bad ismdifficult to control . <p> We will have our Momentum mechanic which can make encounters interesting : what happens when high dps on the big bad builds its momentum that let 's it use a game-changing power ? Suddenly , the encounter becomes less about defeating the big bad as fast as possible , but about pacing . <p> And we can still rely on other mechanics such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat to trigger a new form . <p> One thing I 'd like to experiement with ( this is by far no promise ) , is different conditions of " defeat " , instead of the tried and true 0 hp to win , including a Captured status - where the target is fully controlled for a certain length of time - now it is control-output over time instead of dps , or Demoralized status - where the target is debuffed to such a degree for a long enough time that it can not itself " win " by defeating the players and it " gives up " . <p> These would be very new types of mechanics and again , would need some serious testing , but could open up more comvinations for ways to win for the players . <p> One thing I 'd like to experiement with ( this is by far no promise ) , is different conditions of " defeat " , instead of the tried and true 0 hp to win , including a Captured status - where the target is fully controlled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time instead of dps , or Demoralized status - where the target is debuffed to such a degree for a long enough time that it can not itself " win " by defeating the players and it " gives up " . These would be very new types of mechanics and again , would need some serious testing , but could open up more comvinations for ways to win for the players . <p> I like these ideas . The ' Captured ' status reminds me of the days when lag was the true enemy of original Hami Raids , and we used to just spam holds on the boss and defeat him with Containment damage . We 'd have the DPS run in towards the end to get their one hit and then stay out of the jello to reduce the chance of failure due to lag as much as possible . It was slower and boring , but it would help to guarantee a win for the server and HOs all around . And who does n't like a shiny new HO ? <p> Tannim222 wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would need some serious testing , but could open up more comvinations for ways to win for the players .

Hey , that sounds familiar ... <p> Yeah , there you go again , cribb'in off my noted ; ) <p> And to be clear , I 'm soecifically speaking with regards to the topic , which is more along the lines of our version of an AV or monster . This would n't be applicable toward standard encounters . <p> I 've also identified where this concept will have some specific issues for debuffs which may not let it work at all , or at least make it so there is parity among all the possible permutations of " ways to defeat " the big bad . It is going to require a long , hard look but on the surface , the mechanics still lean toward damage being thr most consistent method . <p> snip . . .

It is a matter of parity of types of effects and time . Quite simply , doing health damage is the most consistent and intuitive method for players to grasp . <p> The issues I indentified may not be insurmountable , more of a matter of applying a path to victory system which does n't impart too much rigidness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety of combat mechanics . <p> Here 's an idea : If you consider that " the big bad " could have several ' layers ' , then it might work . <p> Let 's say this boss has four layers . There are a couple of ways to peel away a layer : one way is to remove all the hit points of that layer . Another way is to completely mez/stun/stop the boss fully . Once all the layers are gone , the boss is defeated . How the boss actually loses will depend on whether the last layer was removed by damage or mez . <p> since mez/stuns are not binary and since the boss has the ability to shake them off by spending its own momentum , it could be possible to make it so both methods could take about the same amount of time and effort on the part of the group . Allowing the boss to use different momentum effects depending on whether it is being mezzed or damaged would go a long way towards balancing the encounter . <p> This way , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mez party to fall back on damage if their mezzers get taken out half-way through or if he just proves to be too tough to mezz down . ... or vice versa . <p> Tactical response team lobs a stun grenade into a room . Bad guy is temporarily blinded by the flash , disoriented by the concussion , and deafened by the bang . Tactical response team rushes in , throws bad guy to the ground and handcuffs him . <p> I assume this is the kind of thing introduced in the last ten or so posts ? <p> If so , I like it . I 'm not sure how to implement such a defeat condition in a way that is both intuitive and satisfying , but I would very much like to see it attempted . <p> Especially as a choice that affects the three-way morality parameter . Soft take down vs. hard take down vs. termination . That would fit nicely . <p> the mechanics still lean toward damage being thr most consistent method . <p> Having a " lean " in the Defeat methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damage Only is ... less than satisfactory .

However , times have sadly changed . <p> I do tend to get ranty depending on the subject , but in all honesty that was n't one of those occasions , believe it or not . This , on the other hand ... <p> Firstly , I apologize . I should have defined TSW ( The Secret World ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mistakenly assumed you knew what it was . And you did state that you had n't read everything , so that was on me . <p> Secondly , thank you for the clarification on the hard/soft timers . <p> Third , I ca n't say I agree that CoH/V " failed . " Yes , it was shut down , but Posi even stated that going to their hybrid model was extremely profitable for them in one of his AMAs on Reddit , so saying that they unabashedly failed ( without further definition ) is hard for me to let pass . I 'm going to hazard a guess and say that you meant that they failed at raid mechanics , but I ca n't agree with that they failed because of lack of more involved raid content . Now , to be fair , I agree with some of the points you made . Original Hamidon was boring . It 's safe to say , as you mentioned , that many of us were guilty of putting an attack on auto after putting the bubbler on follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I feel that they did do better with later Incarnate Trial content , such as the Avatar of Hamidon in the Underground Trial and Tyrant in Magisterium , but yes , they were never as complicated ( some might say overly complicated ) as WoW raid boss encounters . And I might not 've been a dev in CoH/V , so it 's my opinion that they never intended raid encounters to be that way , that they should be more accessible to the average , even casual , gamer . Do I think they should have reduced the difficulty for the lowest common denominator ? Absolutely not , but they should n't get to the point where people are wiping on them , hour after hour , night after night , for weeks to months , like vanilla WoW . That 's just frustrating , and many of us are n't college-dorm dwelling kids anymore that have ridiculous amounts of free time at our disposal . And my personal frustration with rage timers comes from playing TSW following CoH/V 's shutdown . In all of their dungeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage timer ( vis a vis the players ) literally forced a very imaginative and creative skill system into canned builds to try and maximize DPS . People would literally kick you off the team if you were n't in full DPS gear , even if your hybrid build was better due to gear/skill synergy . All people looked at was your 1410 health and knew that you had all DPS gear on . If you did n't , boom , gone . Players were trying to ensure that they could deal enough DPS to beat the rage timers , which resulted in poorer gameplay and unimaginative gearing options . It was literally the only mechanic they had . So , suffice it to say , I 'm a little salty on the concept and implementation of rage timers . As I mentioned before , it 's not like I do n't think that CoT should n't have them . They should have them sparingly and with igoodi reason . Big Boss fight in dungeon 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 should n't all have rage timers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through content . I also enjoy tinkering with builds and coming up with clever synergies , in addition to playing for challenge . That does n't mean everyone should be encouraged or even required to play that way . Again , like I mentioned before , I believe in options . And those options should include difficulty sliders , much like CoH/V had . That way , if you want easily bash your way through hordes of flunkies , knock your ( or their ) socks off . If you want to run through mobs of elite bosses for the difficulty , that should be available to you too . This also applies to raid content . A previous suggestion of mine was that it should scale to the number of people involved , either in health/damage , or even in mechanics , such as the boss switching from single target attacks to targeted AoE and/or PBAoE . Thankfully , the devs have said that they 've looked at other " defeat conditions " to beat bosses . So I 'm all for more challenging content and keeping players engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredibly annoying amount of damage templates or forcing them to bring only certain characters/builds/gear for a certain amount of DPS . <p> As for the holy trinity , there 's a whole other epic thread about that . Let 's just say I 'm a fan of asymmetrical warfare . <p> Ah , a good response ! Nice to have people who are willing to actually discuss something . That said , for rants , it would be nice if you broke it up a bit better ; - ) . Purely because I 'm one who has to re-read sentences often , and easy to get lost in gigantic paragraphs . Also , I meant mine was a rant , not yours . <p> Also , CoX did n't exactly FAIL , you 're correct . I do think it could have been a bit better with a better progression system , and end game . But they had a seriously loyal fanbase , and I 'm sure the fanbase alone would have kept the game alive . NCSoft truly allowed for such great things to hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also , I think any of the major named bosses should have had some sort of mechanic to them . Instead of just being a damage sponge with hero/villain abilities . Some of the Arch-Nemesis fights could have truly been memorable . And some were downright difficult , but all in all , pretty bland . Just simple mechanics , like if they were about to do Energy Nova , players had to go hide behind something , or anything like that . As for raids , I 'd personally rather see map wide events over instanced raids . <p> As for TSW , that sounds terrible . That is taking a single mechanic , and running with it to extremes just to make it seem like the fight is difficult . Horrible horrible design . And I 'd never want to see that in CoT . If CoT did have rage , I would want it to be strict enough where people just ca n't afk in a fight . Or basically go 100% survivability , and turn what should be a 5-10 minute fight , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to beat it . <p> I 'm for holy trinity , and asymmetry . Either or works fine for me , as long as the bosses have some sort of mechanic that make me think . Guild Wars 2 had horrific battles at first , but they certainly have grown with the asymmetry and added a lot of really neat mechanics . So it is definitely possible . <p> As for " casuals " ( Not used as derogatory term ) , I agree that sometimes you just want to smack an instanced and have some fun . I 'm 100% for that , I just want to make sure there is some challenging content that makes me think during combat , not just mash the most powerful button available . <p> Considering creating a boss mechanic thread to see what things we can think of . <p> Considering creating a boss mechanic thread to see what things we can think of . <p> If it has n't already been posted , I 'm interested in seeing what people throw against the wall to see what sticks . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of joy to find the exact vague image I was looking for . <p> If MWM implements rage timers , which I hope is very sparingly , then I seriously hope they justify it better than what essentially is the standard " you took too long so I 'm gon na hulk out and smash your heads in " justification . <p> Yeah ... I 'm not liking this idea of rage timers unless used very , very sparingly as blacke4dawn says . It sounds a little too much like " you must fight this boss in this one way only . " Likewise , I 'll never be a fan of any encounter that requires a specific mix of ATs or power sets . I would hope one of the best parts of our old game that will see a resurrection in CoT is the idea that you can run any content with any mix of characters . <p> I could see value in a few rage timers to add flavor to lore-appropriate bosses , but only if there 's a way to counter each one - maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players can trigger to de-rage the boss , such as immobilizing it for ten seconds or making it move to a certain debuffing location built in to the map . These conditions should also be matched to the nature of the boss , grounded in lore , and explained in-game . If a boss is designed with no de-rage mechanic , then I 'd like to see it suffer a massive weakness in exchange for its rage damage ( or whatever buff the rage timer gives them ) . For example , perhaps the boss becomes unable to use its ranged attacks , or gets stunned when attacked from above . <p> Another way of saying it - I 'd like any rage timers to simply mean a change in tactics , not an automatic loss . <p> +1 to blacke4dawn and Cinnder . Timers fix tactics too much . As an occasional novelty they 'd be fine , but not as the general , or even a common , type of boss . <p> I 'm too tired , so I 'm going to be blunt , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say that sounds pretty terrible . There needs to be some sort of set variables to a boss changing their tactics . A random boss here and there would be fine . But if it is random , unless the bosses are literally so easy it does n't matter , you 're looking at mass RNG fights . Meaning , you could quite often be screwed in a fight , simply because the dice roll of their tactics . <p> I believe I understand what you want , but it is better on paper than reality . <p> Empyrean wrote : +1 to blacke4dawn and Cinnder .

There needs to be some sort of set variables to a boss changing their tactics . A random boss here and there would be fine . But if it is random , unless the bosses are literally so easy it does n't matter , you 're looking at mass RNG fights . Meaning , you could quite often be screwed in a fight , simply because the dice roll of their tactics . I believe I understand what you want , but it is better on paper than reality .

I was n't clear in that what I meant was that I would n't want timers to be the ONLY or the MAIN mechanic , but in most cases there should be a mechanic other than just a DPS RNG fights--though once in a while even these can be fun . <p> Yeah but CoX bosses did n't have mechanics at all . CoX had only spank and tank , there was nothing else to it . <p> Granted , I think I only did 1 or 2 trials ( They were kinda after my days ) , but I do n't really remember them having anything memorable either . <p> Although very few task force AVs ( bosses ) below level 45 had memorable mechanics beyond a few special attacks , I actually liked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that content a try without worrying about reading " dungeon guides " or being afraid to join a pick-up group ( PUG ) . <p> I remember all of the trial AVs having at least one " mechanic " , though I realize we could be working off of different definitions of that word . Some involved temp powers , mini-rage timers , avoiding location AoE killzones , keeping summons under control , and triggering events to buff the players ( without which , they would die or be unable to harm the boss ) . Most trials also had time limits on several of their phases , including the final AV . In some cases , the trial put less emphasis on the final AV and more into the overall sequence of events - I tended to see these as if the trial itself was the boss , along with its mechanics as a whole . <p> Back to the higher-level , more traditional task forces : &gt; Kahn TF 's Reichsman brought in other AVs to the fight and would repeatedly go nearly invulnerable until a temp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work poorly at times or give no indication it was working . The summoned AV often stayed at range and seemed to ignore a tank . &gt; The ITF could be considered to have mechanics involving the interactions of the final 3 AVs and how to separate them or otherwise trick them into being more easily defeated . Players could try several methods to avoid the AV-death stun. &gt; Lady Grey 's two final AVs were surrounded by masses of Rikti with plenty of ranged stuns , too many to effectively " tank " , so non-defensive characters had to work around that problem . &gt; Statesman TF had some mechanics built into the buffing towers at the end , but also encouraged some thought ( even if it was just oriented toward careful tanking/pulling ) during the prior multi-AV fight . <p> Of course , some non-trial mechanics could be overcome with enough damage/buffs/debuffs , and commonly were on a fully-IO 'd team or after Incarnate abilities were added to the game . Some might call this a problem , but I 'm fine with content that drops out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the overall pattern , once incarnate trials were added to the game , is worth using in CoT 's design . Low level bosses with no mechanics to encourage PUGs , higher level bosses with one or two basic mechanics , and trial bosses with a range of different mechanics . When possible , the mechanics should allow several tactics to work against them , so that most team compositions have at least one viable method to win . <p> Looks like I may be holding a minority position yet again in the forum . Oh well , at least I hope it adds to the discussion . While I ca n't say I am a huge proponent of boss rage timers per se , I get and agree with Klaleara 's point when it came to CoH . There 's something fundamentally " wrong " when people are n't required to understand the basic mechanics of their AT ( or even be present ) and yet consistently enjoy the fruits of victory . That happened all too often in CoH . IMHO , the downside of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skill ) wise is that it ultimately led to too much of a dumbing down of bosses to allow for that . <p> Say what you will about the trinity ( and I 'm not certainly not a proponent of forcing that on CoT players either ) and rage timers but at least it was an attempt at saying " do nothing or do something stupid and you may not be able to recover from that " . Maybe it 's just me . But while this multiple paths to victory thing sounds great on the surface , I do n't get how you accommodate that without making a bad situation even worse in terms of challenging and rewarding individual players within a team in an appropriate way . <p> With multiple routes , I agree that it is only great on the surface . I 'd hate to say it , but it would be a waste of time for the devs to really do that for a bunch of bosses . <p> The reasons I say this , I 've seen several MMO 's attempt this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had different routes . And know what happened ? Everyone found the quickest , easiest ways , and that was the only way to do it from there on out . <p> People will always find the quickest , most efficient way , and that will become the only way people to do it . You wo n't find groups who even want to try the other routes . <p> RIP the Oregon Trail scenario thing in Wildstar . Always wanted to try the other paths . <p> I liked the mechanics they originally had in the respec trial . Then they spaced out the spawns so much I spent most of the trial with /em newspaper . <p> Well the respec trial was presumably in the game to help players earn a way to correct their badly built characters . So technically the trial had to be easy enough that even the most gimpy group of players could succeed . This lead to it being nerfed down almost to the point that players could take naps between the waves at the end . <p> I do n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . I 'm just suggesting that using that mechanic for the " respec trial " was probably not a good decision overall . They maybe should have applied that concept to some other trial that did n't need to be , almost by definition , super easy to accomplish . <p> I see what Khaleara is saying . Many bosses were not very tactical . I disagree with rage timers being the correct way or rather only way to treat that . The most heroic I ever felt was fighting Countess Crey . I was on my Sonic/NRG blaster and was the last one left standing with her at over half . It took a long ass time but I beat her down . If she had a rage timer we 'd have been team wiped and had to start over . I 'm all for intuitive dynamics for boss fights . There 's a place for a rage timer but it 's not the only dynamic to consider .

I see movement-based attack powers and not so much ' movement powers ' . I also see that the hero is barely controlled in her movements and a strange disassociation with inertia and momentum , which a ' Gravity ' power would not do . I also see a Dependence on destructible terrain for some powers/effects . <p> Mostly , I see a single-player console game character , and not one designed to play in a persistent-world MMO . You get to be ' This Character ' with ' These Powers ' rather than your own character with powers selected from a menu . <p> Perhaps another way to discuss Gravity powers is to look at applications ? You 've got your ' Ambient ' gravity , which affects the environment , there 's ' Personal ' gravity , which affects how you relate to the environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guy 's relationship with the environment . <p> CoH ' Gravity Control ' was all ' Target ' centered . It was aggressive , not defensive . That simplified a lot . In fact , the way it was implemented , it did not have to be visualized as strictly ' gravity ' control , but could be seen as ' mysterious forces ' . Also , whether the User was resistant to gravity effects never became an issue . Is the user strong enough to function while weighing twice their usual weight ? Does the user explosively vomit in a micro-gravity environment , or when gravity is variable ? Instead , all that had to be considered was the effect on the enemy targets and that , Mostly , just ran the gamut of Controller effects , like immobilize and hold , with some special effects and damage powers thrown in . <p> I can imagine applying Gravity effects Ambiently and Personally , as well , but let 's discuss those as we go on . I 'm suddenly feeling the gravity of my bed . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives on things . <p> First up is STANDARD GRAVITY . This is whatever is " normally " imposed within an environment and usually defines " down " as pointing towards the nadir . This is the " use a plum line " method of of figuring out which way is " down " and therefore which way local gravity is attracting ( usually the ground or the floor ) . <p> After that you get ALTERED GRAVITY ( obviously ) , which would be the whole point and purpose of a Gravity Control Powerset . The simplest things to do , game mechanically speaking , would be to : <p> 1 . " null " the Standard Gravity ... so as to " float " in zero gravity ( momentum , inertia and friction still apply though ) 2. " add/multiply " the Standard Gravity ... so as to increase gravity acceleration , resulting in " faster falls " 3. " subtract/divide " the Standard Gravity ... so as to reduce gravity acceleration , resulting in " slower falls " ( and higher jumps ? ) <p> That just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is usually a constant in Standard Gravity . After that , there ought to be options for changing the orientation of the Gravity vector , including such tricks as " up is down " allowing walking on the ceiling ( indoors ) as well as redirecting gravity to work " sideways " so as to walk on walls without actually Wall Crawling . <p> The simplest means I can think of to pull off this trick of redirecting gravity using a stock ' n ' standard City of Heroes UI element would actually be the Teleport Rings kind of effect so as to define a vector direction to reorient gravity onto for the $Target ( which could be Self Only , or could be a VoE of some kind ) . The placement of the Rings defines a vector direction between the $Target and the Rings , so that " that way " is the new nadir for that $Target . Run the use of the Teleport Rings UI element as a Toggle Power , meaning once you define Gravity as pointing " that-a-way " it continues to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Toggle OFF ) . Set the recharge time for this toggle to be 1 second ( to tamp down on " twitchy " use ) and you 're set . <p> Rig the 1/2/3 options mentioned above to work as Toggles ... so you Toggle ON the " add/multiply " Power and it just keeps running until you either Toggle OFF or choose to Toggle ON either " null " or " subtract/divide " Gravity . That way the Toggles are mutually exclusive of each other ( toggling on one toggles off the other two automatically , kind of like Kheldian Shapeshifting ) . <p> I could easily see this sort of arrangement being handled much like Swap Ammo or the aforementioned Kheldian Shapeshifting ( Nova Form , Dwarf Form ) where you take 1 Power Pick and receive " multiple Power options " that come as a package deal . So you get a Gravity Manipulation Power and it includes the 1/2/3 Toggles as subsidiary Powers plus the Teleport Rings directional control Power as its component parts and pieces . <p> This setup then let 's you control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the mathematically inclined ) independently for ALTERED GRAVITY affecting a $Target ... whether that be Self , Ally or Foe . After that , it 's just a matter of defining the " shapes " of the ALTERED GRAVITY field : <p> The " Self Only " option is basically the default in the absence of any of the Volume of Effect options being Clicked ON . The Volumes of Effect would each be their own Power , would all be Clicks , and would also be mutually exclusive of each other . Again , all Clicks would have a 1 second recharge time . For the Target Volume of Effect ( Ally , Foe or Location ) , the difference is purely based on what you are TAB Locked onto at the time . If you have an Ally selected as your $Target , then the ALTERED GRAVITY only affects Allies within the TVoE and is " anchored " to your $Target . If you have a Foe selected as your $Target , then the ALTERED GRAVITY only affects Foes within the TVoE and is " anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locked then you anchor the effect onto the Location your cursor is pointing at ( Disruption Arrow comes to mind for how to handle this sort of thing ) . <p> The Powerset would " do damage " via Falling Damage , with the faster the velocity upon impact , the higher the damage inflicted . <p> A bit man/machine interface intensive , being something of a three step process of " build your Power use " every time you want to change things , meaning that Gravity Manipulation would n't be the " fastest " possible battlefield control ability ... but its ability to " rearrange the battlefield On Demand " would perhaps be unrivaled , since it would effectively almost be Direction Controlled Knockback ON DEMAND in a lot of ways . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of ' Altered Gravity ' to yourself , is that you are physically affected by that gravity . <p> Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any control , and it 's easy to injure yourself , since you still have inertia . Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> Gravity higher than 9.8 m/s2 can cause serious injury , even if you do n't fall down and crash into a surface . Using yourself as a missile means that You are subject to Newton 's Law , as well . How do you keep from splattering yourself all over the destructible environment ? <p> As for adding a Vector to ambient gravity ... that would require that you be able to Generate gravity on your own . All known gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . Speculative sources say it may/might/should be possible to generate gravity effects through a permutation of Magnetism , but we have no idea how it might work . <p> City of Heroes never tried to emulate actual gravitic forces , they simply applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! ) the effects . <p> *Now , there is a possibility ... one might declare that the Gravity Manipulator establishes and maintains a capsule of stable gravity around themselves and then applies ' altered gravity ' effects around/to that capsule . That might keep the effects of ' altered gravity ' from affecting them , personally , but that only works for up and down movement . And they still suffer from Inertia effects . *boom-splatter* <p> So , hit the bad guy with a Forklift and leave my tender corpus out of it . <p> Alright , now , instead of ' assault ' powers , let 's talk about ' defensive ' ones . I can not imagine a way to use Gravity as a defense , it 's pure attraction between masses , no repulsion . However , Mass is related to size and Density . <p> Low density would n't cause you to fly off into space , because your mass=gravity stays consistent . That is , unless you reduced your density to lighter than air , for instance Helium , which ' floats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , that of Sinking . A person-sized object with the density of Lead would be extremely heavy and tend to sink in dirt . One with the density of Osmium , or Uranium , might find itself sinking into Concrete ( or just exploding ) . One with a density approaching Neutronium would perturb the orbit and rotation of the Earth , if it did n't just sink straight to the core . <p> Wait , but Tractors and other heavy equipment are highly dense and do n't sink into the earth ... Right , because they spread their weight over large areas , with giant tires , or treads . So , Mister Lead-man could go for a walk in the park , if he wore Snowshoes , or something ... <p> Anyway , controlling one 's personal density ought to make one Very hard to hurt . You can ' float like a gas and sting like a mineral ' ! <p> From the videos provided , and some of what has been brought up , what I mostly see are things handled mostly by the animation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid being too specific on the outset . You take a concept , like gravity here , and you peel back the layers of the specific concept to it s basic theme . Fire is no longe Fire , it is Burning . The next step is defining the effect and application . Burning Blast has the effect of ranged health damage and is relies heavily on damage over time . Next we plug sets into a frame work which focuses the playstyle of the set . An attack set may be single target focused or are focused just as an example . As such having a wildly alterable set would certainly be a break from the most . <p> We try to avoid creating too many sets with variable requirements and extra UI elements like multiple toggles . We do intend to use such when thematic , but sparingly so . I can guarantee we wo n't see any standard set where the attacks change effect based on targeting self , friendly , or hostile . It would actually end up rather detrimental to the effectiveness of the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it can be used to make a power that can have different effects based on the target type , I would highly recommend any developer using the designer to avoid such . At best you may see an attack that has an effect on the target and on the user and / or friendly targets either in the vicinity of the initial target or the caster . <p> We would n't create a gravity set that actually utilizes the gravity actor and affects vectors differently . That is n't how the power designer works exactly . Instead the effects such as knocks are distinct with the power designer , separate from affecting actors directly , though they may utilize the physics engine ( may be required to be kept separate from the power designer too ) . Yes , me can make a power that does knock up , but give it a toggle to change the effect to knock down . As I said , it is something we are avoiding as much as possible . <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are physically affected by that gravity . <p> Uh ... that 's kind of the point ? 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . <p> Purely a costume editor issue . Has nothing to do with game mechanics or the animation and FX of Gravity Powers . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . <p> " Normally " ... yes . With Gravity Manipulation ... not necessarily . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> If the game environment were a planetary sphere rotating in space ... sure . However , when the game is n't even going to bother with incorporating the curvature of the Earth into its elevation mapping , the point effectively becomes moot at the game mechanical level . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Gravity higher than 9.8 m/s2 can cause serious injury , even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as a missile means that You are subject to Newton 's Law , as well . How do you keep from splattering yourself all over the destructible environment ? <p> Curious that this question never came up for the Leaping Pool . By the same token , why were n't Fire Tankers and Ice Tankers constantly taking Fire and Cold Damage from the effects of their own Damage Auras , even if they were highly resistant to those damage types ? <p> Short answer : superpowers . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> As for adding a Vector to ambient gravity <p> No no no no no . Not " add a vector to Standard Gravity " ... ALTER THE VECTOR of Standard Gravity . <p> You 're not doing this ... <p> ... plus this ... <p> ... to yield this ... <p> Instead you 're taking this ... <p> ... as the STANDARD GRAVITY and " overwriting " it with this ... <p> ... to be the ALTERED GRAVITY affecting the $Target . You are n't taking multiple vectors and averaging them together as a Gravity Manipulator . Instead you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to point in a different direction ( and with a different length/strength ) at the game mechanical level . So game mechanically you 're very directly ALTERING Gravity , which is ordinarily a constant . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> ... that would require that you be able to Generate gravity on your own . <p> Um ... you mean like Fire users create their own Fire , and Cold users create their own Cold and Storm Controllers create their own Storms , and Earth users create their own Earth ... and so on and so forth for every other superpower that generates thematic effects ? Should I throw in a mention of Kinetic Melee and Energy Blast for good measure ? <p> Not really seeing the contradiction here ... 106458 @qwx726458 <p> All known gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . <p> All known NATURAL sources of gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . Superpowers , by definition break a lot of ... rules ... for how things " work " if relying solely on " natural causes " ... 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a permutation of Magnetism , but we have no idea how it might work . <p> In other words ... Fluff TextG . Still not relevant to how Gravity Manipulation powers ought to work at the game mechanical level , let alone what kinds of animations and FX ought to pertain to their use . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> City of Heroes never tried to emulate actual gravitic forces , they simply applied control-conditions and hand-waved ( Woo-woo-woo , it 's Gravity , man ! ) the effects . <p> Exactly . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> So , hit the bad guy with a Forklift and leave my tender corpus out of it . <p> Game mechanically speaking , " chucking a forklift " using Gravity Manipulation is n't all that different from " throwing cars " using Super Strength . The only real difference is that Gravity Manipulation can be Ranged ( no touch required ) , while Super Strength is Melee Only ( requires touch ) to hurl the object . In other words , if you allow Super Strength to " tear up the scenery " for missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Gravity Manipulation to do the same thing ... except that with Gravity Manipulation it 's " spooky action at a distance " rather than being something done through muscle strength alone . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of ' Altered Gravity ' to yourself , is that you are physically affected by that gravity . Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . A problem is that it can be difficult to move with any control , and it 's easy to injure yourself , since you still have inertia . Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> The assumption would be that you have enough control to operate in a way akin to Star Trek 's inertial dampeners , and counter the force modifier in your local area so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's akin to hitting a baseball with a bat without forgetting to maintain your own balance so you do n't become the catcher 's new best friend . <p> Maybe " gravity control " is n't that great a name , because it 's really more like telekinesis or force beam ( tractor/repulsor beam ) kind of operation . <p> Redlynne wrote : <p> No no no no no . Not " add a vector to Standard Gravity " ... ALTER THE VECTOR of Standard Gravity . <p> Mathematically , it 's the same thing . Further , it 's easy to apply a delta vector to everything in a target volume and leave the rest of the world alone . It 's hard to stick code in that has to go through every moving object in the game and check what its gravity vector should be for where it is . <p> This probably needs to work with whatever system is in place to handle knockback/up/down , which also deals with external forces applied to moving objects . <p> The alternative , of course is to do an IF-THEN-ELSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then apply an inverse of that vector so as to " null " the STANDARD GRAVITY by default as a precursor to " overwriting " it with something else . Then simply apply the ALTERED GRAVITY vector(s) to the affected $Target(s)/Location and pass the popcorn . <p> Alternatively , as Lin Chiao Feng points out , there is the possibility of leveraging the Knockback system in a way that yields similar results via different means . I would expect this application to be used more for " attack " powers than for " control " powers . Thus a lot of the " force vector attack " powers would use Knockback , while a lot of the " mez " powers would rely on ALTERED GRAVITY to enforce their effects . Note that ALTERED GRAVITY could very likely be a source of Slow/Run/Jump Debuffing , in addition to Immobilize and Hold type effects . <p> A lot of the Gravity Smash ! G kinds of " vector attack " powers could instead be broadly similar to things like Shield Charge for use as a Gap Closer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blast and Energy Manipulation powersets , with their heavy emphasis on Knockback , as essentially being Gravity Manipulation styled powers . Same too with the Kinetic Melee powerset having several ideas incorporated into it which could be proliferated into a Gravity Manipulation powerset . I 'd even go so far as to suggest that Ki Push , Storm Kick and Burst of Speed powers out of the Blaster Martial Combat powerset could be proliferated into a Gravity Manipulation powerset in some form or fashion . <p> The larger point I 'd like to make is that there is n't any Good ReasonG why Gravity ca n't be used as melee , ranged , or a mixture of both as an assault powerset , in addition to the familiar Controller style set of powers that we remember from City of Heroes . Using Gravity as a Protection Scheme , whether it be Defense/Resistance/etc. might be a bit of a challenge , unless using it as a " keep away " method of PBVoE Knockback ( similar to HERDicane in Storm Summoning ) or using it as an analog to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that anything around you has a hard(er) time getting away from you . Basic idea being that the Gravity Defense is either at the " top " of the gravity well around the caster , with everything hostile preferring to " fall away " from them and struggling to get closer , or they 're at the " bottom " of the gravity well and everything hostile has to " fight upstream " to get away from them or be pulled closer . Obviously , the " push away " works better for Ranged powersets and the " pull closer " works better for Melee powersets , but that 's the basic shape of what synergizes well . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> My point about using Your Body as a missile , is that your body impacts the target and , unless your body is made of something very durable , then the ' destructible environment ' is YOU . Squishy human goes Squish ! <p> Lin 's suggestion of a ' personal kinetic dampening field ' would be a good solution . Such a field would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red seems to be so enamored with the Effects he 's envisioning , that he 's willing to ignore the sense of ' Gravity does not Work that way ! ' Still , if we postulate some form of ' encapsulation ' , which allows us to manipulate Local gravity without affecting the Ambient gravity field of the planet , then that might allow us to do things that are ' indistinguishable from magic ' . And we could just as easily call it ' Telekinesis ' . <p> I just want to make sure we all realize that , if we actually change Gravity in a spot , then Everything ' above ' that spot is affected too . Atmosphere , airplanes , satellites , moons , planets , stars ... everything that depends on the mutual attraction of masses goes ' whoopsie ! ' if you change Gravity . <p> That said , I Agree that ' Gravity ' would make a terrific power for a Tanker . I think tightly localized gravity effects would be More Powerful at melee range than at a distance . Inverse-Square Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about ' Pull ' . The only way to ' push ' with it , would be to set up an attractive resonance with a distant object , like Mount Rushmore , or Pluto and have the ' pushed ' object Pulled towards that distant object . We can get vertical ' Lift ' by neutralizing gravity in a location and letting the Earth 's spin hurl the affected object towards space . Selectively , delicately , controlling the strength of gravitic pull between the Earth and an object would allow a sort of pseudo-hover , or actually ' orbiting at a ridiculously low altitude ' . <p> Anyway , if we get selective enough about which rules of science we want to pay attention to , there is no reason not to go the route of CoH and simply choose the Effects we want to apply and then declare that we ' did it with Gravity ' . Add some ' field effect ' animations and it should be beautiful . That 's a particular Point , by the way . ' Gravity Melee ' is fighting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on face . The required ' personal isolation field ' would Prevent physical collision . <p> Hmm , I do n't really see how gravity manipulation as a mechanic would work within MWM 's design philosophy for powers , especially considering the separation between mechanics and aesthetics . Effect wise there is nothing truly unique within gravity control so building a mechanics system specifically for it does n't really make sense when considering the limited resources MWM has , and I 'm sure other mechanics that produce the same effects are more efficient execution wise than messing around with gravity . <p> Sure , you could use actual gravity manipulation mechanics but I just do n't see the benefit of doing so at this point . <p> Hmm , I do n't really see how gravity manipulation as a mechanic would work within MWM 's design philosophy for powers , especially considering the separation between mechanics and aesthetics . <p> As Tannim pointed out , above , it does n't work as its own power set . Provide the proper animations/effects and some power set could very well be gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle than it is in practice . Coming up with an idea for a power set , or powers for a power set , is easy enough . Creating a power set that is sufficiently versatile/generic that one can slap a dozen different animation sets on it , that 's tricky . <p> My point about using Your Body as a missile , is that your body impacts the target and , unless your body is made of something very durable , then the ' destructible environment ' is YOU . Squishy human goes Squish ! Lin 's suggestion of a ' personal kinetic dampening field ' would be a good solution . Such a field would also be a powerful defense against physical attacks . Red seems to be so enamored with the Effects he 's envisioning , that he 's willing to ignore the sense of ' Gravity does not Work that way ! ' Still , if we postulate some form of ' encapsulation ' , which allows us to manipulate Local gravity without affecting the Ambient gravity field of the planet , then that might allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . And we could just as easily call it ' Telekinesis ' . <p> Indeed . In a lot of ways , Gravity Manipulation ought to look a lot like Telekinesis . It is essentially " spooky action at a distance " except when it 's done at melee ranges , much like Telekinesis . The tricky part is that gravity , out in the Real WorldG is something you do n't " see " directly , but can only observe its effects on stuff that you can see ( or detect ) . Stuff " falls " but you do n't " see " ( visually ) something pulling the object(s) towards " down " ... making gravity an " invisible force " as far as visuals go . <p> As far as the " what are you pulling on ? " question goes , that 's WAY overthinking things for a game that wo n't even bother with the curvature of the Earth . I know what you 're getting at , Fireheart , but those concerns simply are n't relevant ( or helpful ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game mechanics " work " under the hood . At best , that 's something to put into Fluff TextG in your Bio , but beyond that it 's just not meaningful as far as the game design aspect of it goes . <p> Why can the Earth Controller make stalagmites shoot up out of the ground ? It 's not natural ! Because they 're an Earth Controller . <p> Why can the Gravity Controller make stuff " go flying " the way they do ? It 's not natural ! Because they 're a Gravity Controller . <p> Yes , you 're absolutely right , that out in the REAL WORLDG Gravity Manipulation would be an incredibly dangerous thing and highly likely to " squish Mere Mortals . <p> But in City of Titans , Gravity Manipulation would be a set of superpowers . At that point , a lot of the Real WorldG objections stop applying quite so forcefully . <p> I mean , if we get too hung up on " what 's real " in a superheroics game we run into problems with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deciding whether " rocks " need to breathe air at all ) , despite the fact that Stone Tankers transformed into this routinely . <p> In other words , worrying too much about how Game Reality would work in the Real World is a " this way lies madness " endeavor . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> While it 's true that we can suspend our disbelief , especially against stuff that requires knowledge for Newtonian or relativistic physics to even disbelieve in the first place , I think the main point here is that you can code up powers that look like telekinesis or gravity control or magical levitation or high tech ionic hyperdrive belts , or manipulation of the wind , or the magnetic field , etc and at the end of the day the only things that actually exist are the powers themselves , and they 'll be grouped into intentionally generic themed sets like " Ranged Burning " and " Melee Stunning " etc . How you justify all the seemingly impossible " Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon " animations they might have is entirely left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe your Fly power is some kind of antigravity thing . Or maybe you 're using Super Jump and justifying that via telekinesis for some reason , whatever . When someone else uses that same Fly power theirs is because they can control wind . Whatever . <p> So the question is not whether or not gravity manipulation could , per se , accomplish one seemingly impossible thing or another , but rather whether or not that power can be coded up and fit nicely into a set or pool or mastery or something that it makes sense in , given the context of the set . I could easily see making a " Knockdown Melee " set where you punch and kick really hard and do knockdown or whatever plus damage . Maybe you want to use gravity manipulation as the backstory for that , fine , works for me . I would also take Fly for the sake of that same theme , but you do n't have to . <p> City of Heroes ' ' Gravity Control ' had , in common with other Control powersets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four of Nine powers . But , Of Course , we 're not really worried about the bread and butter . We want to play with the Flashy stuff . <p> Lift : Toss your Target into the air and Smash it straight down ! <p> Propel : Summon a Forklift and Hurl it at your target ! - Great for Ranged characters , but in Melee this is probably a good spot for Red 's ' Gravity-assisted Body Slam ' . This could work similarly to ' Shield Charge ' . <p> Wormhole : Target a spot , then go find some enemies and teleport them through a hole in space-time into a pile at that spot . For Melee , I think it would work best if the Caster went along for the ride . <p> Singularity : The only ' flying ' Pet ... except Singy only had Hover , so he was horribly slow . <p> Last , I 'll mention Dimension Shift which might have had some usefulness in the game the Devs originally envisioned . Unfortunately , none of us ever played that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's an open power-slot , just waiting to be filled with something Brilliant . Perhaps this is for the ' Reach out and Yank your enemy Closer ' power ? <p> How might ' Gravity Control ' fit into the customizable power framework that we 've had described to us ? <p> I think the broadest possible description might be ' Crushing Fields ' . Forcefields , energy-fields , telekinetic fields ... this might even be extended to Plant , Ice , and Stone powers that encapsulate enemies and damage them Physically . This would be in contrast with ' Burning Fields ' , where the damage is done by Energy . There 's also Illusion and Mind Control , which do damage Psionically . <p> All of these ' Control ' powers have Targeted and AoE immobilize and hold powers . Where they differentiate are in the ' specials ' , the set-exclusive powers . These expand on the theme of controlling and manipulating the opponent through the special properties of the Controller 's ' element of power ' . Controller powers also include some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' touch free ' , in that one does not have to touch the opponent , in order to affect them . <p> Redlynne and I are particularly enamored of the idea of a ' Melee Controller ' , particularly in the form of the Stalwart/Tanker class , who we see as a demi-Controller anyway . Classically , Melee-fighters have some form of martial skill , with weapons or fists . However , what we 've been discussing is the idea of a character with strong defensive abilities , but whose Offensive abilities are through their ' elements ' and not dependent on brawn or physical skills . So , rather than manifesting a psionic weapon to stab their enemy , these fighters would look them in the eyes and hurl terrors directly into the minds of their opponents . <p> Or , in the case of Gravity , Hurl them into the air , Smash them down by giving them several times their normal weight , Pin them in place by making their feet too heavy to lift . One might yank them away from a friendly squishy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one might charge into an enemy group with a prodigious gravity-powered Leap , or by ' surfing ' a wave of gravitic force . Surfing a wave of gravitic force could be used to mow-down a cone of enemy , or as a short-range escape-tactic . One might leap into a crowd of enemy , throw down a broad circle of intense Gravity to capture them , then ' Vorp ' - hurl oneself and all of one 's ' new friends ' through a wormhole-portal in space and smash down at a previously placed anchor-point , where your pet Singularity and your whole team are waiting to greet the enemy with all their power . <p> All this , without risking your manicure by laying a single hand on the filthy beasts . <p> I have to sadly say , I did like Champions Online Quicksand power , where it would Attract All Nearby foes , closer . ; ) <p> Would n't PBAoE Aura powers , like that , be more appropriate to a Defensive powerset ? Dark Armor , Fire Armor , Electric Armor , Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected enemies . Stone Armor had ' Mud Pots ' for that . Alternately , Blaster ' Manipulation ' sets had something like that . Fire had ' Hot Feet ' . The ' Quicksand ' we had in CoH was , indeed , a Controller power , a ground-targeted AoE trap . Still , I do appreciate how useful such a power would be to a Melee character . Be Well ! Fireheart <p> yep Yep . <p> Would have been awesome if CoH/V had something akin to a power , in say the Kinetic Melee powerset that instead of repelling like the Repel power in Kinetics ( for squishies ) , it instead was an aura that Attracted enemies like a singularity ( black hole ) . This way i activate it , ehhh .. maybe should n't be a toggle , and instead of having to use Taunt , just Attracts any strays trying to run off after the blasters . ; ) <p> I think it bears note that a lot of the controller sets in CoX were very similar in effect and differed more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would hold , immobilize , slow to the point of stoping , sleep , fear , or stun targets individually and in groups . You had a single pet summon power that had a long recharge time , and you had one or two pretty mediocre attacks ( mediocre in terms of DPS I mean , Propel LOOKED awesome , but was outclassed for a long time by other stuff too numerous to mention ) . <p> So the challenge then is to find not different skins for the same powers , but in fact different controller sets that actually behave differently enough to make the distinct from each other while also being coherently themed in and of themselves AND being definitively " control " sets in their hearts and souls . <p> I suppose it ; s easy enough to make similar hold powers etc but make them do minor DoT or whatever of different types . So like one set immobilizes the target and does " Burning " damage while the other immobilizes the target and does " Slowing " or " Endo draining " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with a single target immobilize attack that is basically the same among controller sets , then all you have to do is pick animations for it , with the choices being block of what looks like ice or stone depending on choice of colors , or some kind of " trapped in a force field " type deal , which could be gravity , telekinesis , magnetic field , or whatever else you want to call it . <p> Hmm .. i recall that at one point Force Fields ( i think* ) powerset had a power that repelled all Foes Away from a Targeted Ally . If CoT added such a power , add a way to Toggle between Repel and Attract . ; D <p> The main problem with Propel was the slow animation time , particularly in comparison to other powers that became available near the same time . Issue 24 saw somw changes for Propel including reducing the animation time and making it into a cone area effect . <p> Animations being applicable to a broad rNge of sets is what really sets this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from first hand experience , it makes designing sets , and even naming sets , particularly with people whom have n't fully grasped the entire conceptual system , gery difficult . A power set that say , can be used with many knock effects in a variety of vectors , along with some more typical holds and a few other powers that does relies on more kinetic effects ( as oppossed to say something like burning ) can be ised to look like gravity , telekinesis , wind , vines grabbing and throwing / holding the target , stones blasting them away , thrusting up from the ground , raining down to crush them , and more . <p> I always interpreted City of Heroes ' Smashing Damage as being bludgeoning/blunt force applications , while Lethal Damage was done by slashing/piercing applications . That 's why Martial Arts and Staff Melee and Super Strength do Smashing Damage while Broadsword and Katana and Dual Blades do Lethal Damage . <p> Levitate from Mind Control did Smashing Damage and loads of KnockUP.Gale from Storm Summoning did ( token amounts ) of Smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smashing Damage with TONS of Knockback.Repulsion Bomb in Force Fields did Smashing Damage plus Knockdown . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> Tannim , if you 're looking for the broadest possible descriptor covering all of these myriad possibilities ... Gravity , Telekinesis , Wind , " Force " Fields ( with or without John Williams soundtrack ) , etc. ... you 're essentially looking at Kinetic Forces as the unifying field theory for how all of them work under the hood in game mechanical terms . The lowest common denominator is that all of these power types involve " shoving things around " ... regardless of HOW they go about doing it . Those things getting shoved around can be anything from people to bits of the environment that can be used as opportunity weapons for missile attacks ( i.e. throwing cars , manhole covers , boulders , library books ( helves ( loaded with books ) ) , etc . ) . The key thing that unifies all of these disparate power types is either MOVING THINGS ... or IMPAIRING their movement capacity ... which in Physics 301 terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce movement and momentum ( as opposed to just disintegration ) . <p> You can then further differentiate things into Attacks , Controls and Protections ... and divide even those categories into subgroups of Melee or Ranged , with the addtional qualifier of being either Single Target or Volume of Effect ( of which there is more than one variety ) . <p> What say you , Tannim ? <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> Hmm .. i recall that at one point Force Fields ( i think* ) powerset had a power that repelled all Foes Away from a Targeted Ally . If CoT added such a power , add a way to Toggle between Repel and Attract . ; D Tanks Will Loooove U ! ; ) Squishies will Curse Your Name ! &gt; : <p> Mmm , Force Fields had a PBAoE Repel toggle and a Targeted AoE ' Repulsion Bomb ' ... Sounds like a love-hate power . It might save your butt , or drive you crazy . Probably drives Scrappers nuts , even if it Does save their butts . *grin* <p> Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not increase the foes personal gravity ? By this I am calling on one of Newton 's laws witch states that every object pulls on every other object . Therefore , if you can crank up someones gravity it would be like standing in the center of the black hole with everything near by being attracted to you . This could also work for electrical powers as they could turn there foes into electromagnets like Static douse . <p> Mmm , Force Fields had a PBAoE Repel toggle and a Targeted AoE ' Repulsion Bomb ' ... Sounds like a love-hate power . It might save your butt , or drive you crazy . Probably drives Scrappers nuts , even if it Does save their butts . *grin* Be Well ! Fireheart <p> Repulsion Boms started out as a " Target ally , AoE repel effect happens on ally " power , with two problems . Firstly , it had a dreadfully slow animation , which is just not compatible with a " GO AWAY ! " power . You need that to come out immediately , like Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't expect is kind of confusing . <p> It later got turned into a simple AoE attack with knockback . I had it on my character since then . <p> Repulsion FIELD on the other hand ... I never found any use for . Is it supposed to keep me safe ? Force Bolt does that better . Is it supposed to be used to herd enemies ? It just draws aggro to the squishiest member of the team . I mean , Hurricane did something similar but had a huge ToHit debuff , which made it awesome . <p> Force Bubble had its moments , it was the king of the BAF trial , only the repel-immune enemies could get through , the rest got blocked . So , the AoE people had a clump of juicy targets , and the single target people could easily see the priority targets as they 'd run straight through . <p> I kind of want a Force Bolt and Force Bubble expy in the powers . Although , I would love it if Force Bubble became Force Wall , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <p> Did n't see anyone mention it we are talking gravity based powers why not increase the foes personal gravity ? By this I am calling on one of Newton 's laws witch states that every object pulls on every other object . Therefore , if you can crank up someones gravity it would be like standing in the center of the black hole with everything near by being attracted to you . This could also work for electrical powers as they could turn there foes into electromagnets like Static douse . <p> This is an example of something that could be done in a game just fine , but is actually not a physically accurate description of what would happen . ( see suspension of disbelief above , and fo rthe record I 'm not saying " so we ca n't do it because it 's not accurate " I 'm saying " we could do this , but it 's a bit of a hand-wavy excuse for the power ) Newton 's Third Law stipulates that the force of one object on another ( any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal and opposite tot he force of the second object back on the first . <p> For example , the Earth exerts exactly as much gravitational force on the moon as the moon does on the Earth . YOU exert exactly as much gravitation force on the Earth as the Earth does on you . The force of my fist hitting a brick wall is exactly the same as the force of the brick wall back on my fist , etc . <p> Anyway , the power set would likely not be called " Gravity " or anything like it , it would probably be called something more generic like " shoving stuff around using invisible forces " or as some have suggested , " Kinetics " or something like that . How you justify the actual power itself is completely open to interpretation . The only real question is how do you want the power set to work and does the power fit into that framework or not ? 
@@79253442 @753442/ <p> Now ... I do n't know about anyone else , but to me this looks like a rather novel way to handle a " Gravity Controller " in a way that is much more appropriate for a gap closing melee fighter , as opposed to a City of Heroes styled Gravity Controller who was all about Mez , Knockback and ( *ahem* ) ... corpse blasting with Propel . <p> The whole ability to " null " gravity ( so as to float/fly ) , " invert " gravity ( so as to jump really high ) , " redirect " gravity ( so as to change the direction of " down " away from the typical nadir ) , " increase " gravity ( so as to add power to strike with ) and so on just looks really interesting . Add in the destructible environment and the inclusion of " auras " of gravity that can be redirected and stuff has the potential to start getting a little complex . <p> So ... <p> Are there any ideas here on display in these videos that INSPIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even if Gravity Rush 2 is a mediocre game ( I had n't heard of it before today ) with boring gameplay , I 'd still be intrigued by the idea of ( *ahem* ) ... borrowing ... ( *cough* ) some of the power concepts on display in the above demo videos . <p> Thoughts ? <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> When one takes into account that we will probably have fairly free and generous choices when it comes to travel powers , I would find that making some kind of travel power a part of a power set to be a cop out in the vein of , " We could n't think of anything interesting to put here , so let 's throw in a poor man 's fly . " <p> There are some potentially interesting ideas in there but , as always , we need to keep in mind that it 's one thing to do cool stuff with " X " when " X " is a major feature of that game , or the entire game is dedicated to " X " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far when " X " is one of a dozen ( or dozens of ) options . ' cause if you make " X " super cool , then all the other options will also need to be super cool . <p> However , in the vein of throwing gravity control ideas out there , I 'll share this video again . <p> When one takes into account that we will probably have fairly free and generous choices when it comes to travel powers , I would find that making some kind of travel power a part of a power set to be a cop out in the vein of , " We could n't think of anything interesting to put here , so let 's throw in a poor man 's fly . " <p> Now , if all you get is an exact copy duplicate of an existing Travel Power ... then yes , it would be redundant . If all you get is a " worse copy " duplicate of an existing Travel Power ... then yes , it 's worse than redundant . <p> But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travel Power plus more ... it gets a lot harder to justifiably say you 're only getting a " poor man 's copy " of that Travel Power . <p> These look like some interesting powers for a Gravity Control Stalwart/Enforcer . I see movement-based attack powers and not so much ' movement powers ' . I also see that the hero is barely controlled in her movements and a strange disassociation with inertia and momentum , which a ' Gravity ' power would not do . I also see a Dependence on destructible terrain for some powers/effects . <p> Mostly , I see a single-player console game character , and not one designed to play in a persistent-world MMO . You get to be ' This Character ' with ' These Powers ' rather than your own character with powers selected from a menu . <p> Perhaps another way to discuss Gravity powers is to look at applications ? You 've got your ' Ambient ' gravity , which affects the environment , there 's ' Personal ' gravity , which affects how you relate to the environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guy 's relationship with the environment . <p> CoH ' Gravity Control ' was all ' Target ' centered . It was aggressive , not defensive . That simplified a lot . In fact , the way it was implemented , it did not have to be visualized as strictly ' gravity ' control , but could be seen as ' mysterious forces ' . Also , whether the User was resistant to gravity effects never became an issue . Is the user strong enough to function while weighing twice their usual weight ? Does the user explosively vomit in a micro-gravity environment , or when gravity is variable ? Instead , all that had to be considered was the effect on the enemy targets and that , Mostly , just ran the gamut of Controller effects , like immobilize and hold , with some special effects and damage powers thrown in . <p> I can imagine applying Gravity effects Ambiently and Personally , as well , but let 's discuss those as we go on . I 'm suddenly feeling the gravity of my bed . <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives on things . <p> First up is STANDARD GRAVITY . This is whatever is " normally " imposed within an environment and usually defines " down " as pointing towards the nadir . This is the " use a plum line " method of of figuring out which way is " down " and therefore which way local gravity is attracting ( usually the ground or the floor ) . <p> After that you get ALTERED GRAVITY ( obviously ) , which would be the whole point and purpose of a Gravity Control Powerset . The simplest things to do , game mechanically speaking , would be to : <p> 1 . " null " the Standard Gravity ... so as to " float " in zero gravity ( momentum , inertia and friction still apply though ) 2. " add/multiply " the Standard Gravity ... so as to increase gravity acceleration , resulting in " faster falls " 3. " subtract/divide " the Standard Gravity ... so as to reduce gravity acceleration , resulting in " slower falls " ( and higher jumps ? ) <p> That just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is usually a constant in Standard Gravity . After that , there ought to be options for changing the orientation of the Gravity vector , including such tricks as " up is down " allowing walking on the ceiling ( indoors ) as well as redirecting gravity to work " sideways " so as to walk on walls without actually Wall Crawling . <p> The simplest means I can think of to pull off this trick of redirecting gravity using a stock ' n ' standard City of Heroes UI element would actually be the Teleport Rings kind of effect so as to define a vector direction to reorient gravity onto for the $Target ( which could be Self Only , or could be a VoE of some kind ) . The placement of the Rings defines a vector direction between the $Target and the Rings , so that " that way " is the new nadir for that $Target . Run the use of the Teleport Rings UI element as a Toggle Power , meaning once you define Gravity as pointing " that-a-way " it continues to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Toggle OFF ) . Set the recharge time for this toggle to be 1 second ( to tamp down on " twitchy " use ) and you 're set . <p> Rig the 1/2/3 options mentioned above to work as Toggles ... so you Toggle ON the " add/multiply " Power and it just keeps running until you either Toggle OFF or choose to Toggle ON either " null " or " subtract/divide " Gravity . That way the Toggles are mutually exclusive of each other ( toggling on one toggles off the other two automatically , kind of like Kheldian Shapeshifting ) . <p> I could easily see this sort of arrangement being handled much like Swap Ammo or the aforementioned Kheldian Shapeshifting ( Nova Form , Dwarf Form ) where you take 1 Power Pick and receive " multiple Power options " that come as a package deal . So you get a Gravity Manipulation Power and it includes the 1/2/3 Toggles as subsidiary Powers plus the Teleport Rings directional control Power as its component parts and pieces . <p> This setup then let 's you control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the mathematically inclined ) independently for ALTERED GRAVITY affecting a $Target ... whether that be Self , Ally or Foe . After that , it 's just a matter of defining the " shapes " of the ALTERED GRAVITY field : <p> The " Self Only " option is basically the default in the absence of any of the Volume of Effect options being Clicked ON . The Volumes of Effect would each be their own Power , would all be Clicks , and would also be mutually exclusive of each other . Again , all Clicks would have a 1 second recharge time . For the Target Volume of Effect ( Ally , Foe or Location ) , the difference is purely based on what you are TAB Locked onto at the time . If you have an Ally selected as your $Target , then the ALTERED GRAVITY only affects Allies within the TVoE and is " anchored " to your $Target . If you have a Foe selected as your $Target , then the ALTERED GRAVITY only affects Foes within the TVoE and is " anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locked then you anchor the effect onto the Location your cursor is pointing at ( Disruption Arrow comes to mind for how to handle this sort of thing ) . <p> The Powerset would " do damage " via Falling Damage , with the faster the velocity upon impact , the higher the damage inflicted . <p> A bit man/machine interface intensive , being something of a three step process of " build your Power use " every time you want to change things , meaning that Gravity Manipulation would n't be the " fastest " possible battlefield control ability ... but its ability to " rearrange the battlefield On Demand " would perhaps be unrivaled , since it would effectively almost be Direction Controlled Knockback ON DEMAND in a lot of ways . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of ' Altered Gravity ' to yourself , is that you are physically affected by that gravity . <p> Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any control , and it 's easy to injure yourself , since you still have inertia . Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> Gravity higher than 9.8 m/s2 can cause serious injury , even if you do n't fall down and crash into a surface . Using yourself as a missile means that You are subject to Newton 's Law , as well . How do you keep from splattering yourself all over the destructible environment ? <p> As for adding a Vector to ambient gravity ... that would require that you be able to Generate gravity on your own . All known gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . Speculative sources say it may/might/should be possible to generate gravity effects through a permutation of Magnetism , but we have no idea how it might work . <p> City of Heroes never tried to emulate actual gravitic forces , they simply applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! ) the effects . <p> *Now , there is a possibility ... one might declare that the Gravity Manipulator establishes and maintains a capsule of stable gravity around themselves and then applies ' altered gravity ' effects around/to that capsule . That might keep the effects of ' altered gravity ' from affecting them , personally , but that only works for up and down movement . And they still suffer from Inertia effects . *boom-splatter* <p> So , hit the bad guy with a Forklift and leave my tender corpus out of it . <p> Alright , now , instead of ' assault ' powers , let 's talk about ' defensive ' ones . I can not imagine a way to use Gravity as a defense , it 's pure attraction between masses , no repulsion . However , Mass is related to size and Density . <p> Low density would n't cause you to fly off into space , because your mass=gravity stays consistent . That is , unless you reduced your density to lighter than air , for instance Helium , which ' floats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , that of Sinking . A person-sized object with the density of Lead would be extremely heavy and tend to sink in dirt . One with the density of Osmium , or Uranium , might find itself sinking into Concrete ( or just exploding ) . One with a density approaching Neutronium would perturb the orbit and rotation of the Earth , if it did n't just sink straight to the core . <p> Wait , but Tractors and other heavy equipment are highly dense and do n't sink into the earth ... Right , because they spread their weight over large areas , with giant tires , or treads . So , Mister Lead-man could go for a walk in the park , if he wore Snowshoes , or something ... <p> Anyway , controlling one 's personal density ought to make one Very hard to hurt . You can ' float like a gas and sting like a mineral ' ! <p> From the videos provided , and some of what has been brought up , what I mostly see are things handled mostly by the animation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid being too specific on the outset . You take a concept , like gravity here , and you peel back the layers of the specific concept to it s basic theme . Fire is no longe Fire , it is Burning . The next step is defining the effect and application . Burning Blast has the effect of ranged health damage and is relies heavily on damage over time . Next we plug sets into a frame work which focuses the playstyle of the set . An attack set may be single target focused or are focused just as an example . As such having a wildly alterable set would certainly be a break from the most . <p> We try to avoid creating too many sets with variable requirements and extra UI elements like multiple toggles . We do intend to use such when thematic , but sparingly so . I can guarantee we wo n't see any standard set where the attacks change effect based on targeting self , friendly , or hostile . It would actually end up rather detrimental to the effectiveness of the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it can be used to make a power that can have different effects based on the target type , I would highly recommend any developer using the designer to avoid such . At best you may see an attack that has an effect on the target and on the user and / or friendly targets either in the vicinity of the initial target or the caster . <p> We would n't create a gravity set that actually utilizes the gravity actor and affects vectors differently . That is n't how the power designer works exactly . Instead the effects such as knocks are distinct with the power designer , separate from affecting actors directly , though they may utilize the physics engine ( may be required to be kept separate from the power designer too ) . Yes , me can make a power that does knock up , but give it a toggle to change the effect to knock down . As I said , it is something we are avoiding as much as possible . <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are physically affected by that gravity . <p> Uh ... that 's kind of the point ? 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . <p> Purely a costume editor issue . Has nothing to do with game mechanics or the animation and FX of Gravity Powers . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . <p> " Normally " ... yes . With Gravity Manipulation ... not necessarily . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> If the game environment were a planetary sphere rotating in space ... sure . However , when the game is n't even going to bother with incorporating the curvature of the Earth into its elevation mapping , the point effectively becomes moot at the game mechanical level . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Gravity higher than 9.8 m/s2 can cause serious injury , even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as a missile means that You are subject to Newton 's Law , as well . How do you keep from splattering yourself all over the destructible environment ? <p> Curious that this question never came up for the Leaping Pool . By the same token , why were n't Fire Tankers and Ice Tankers constantly taking Fire and Cold Damage from the effects of their own Damage Auras , even if they were highly resistant to those damage types ? <p> Short answer : superpowers . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> As for adding a Vector to ambient gravity <p> No no no no no . Not " add a vector to Standard Gravity " ... ALTER THE VECTOR of Standard Gravity . <p> You 're not doing this ... <p> ... plus this ... <p> ... to yield this ... <p> Instead you 're taking this ... <p> ... as the STANDARD GRAVITY and " overwriting " it with this ... <p> ... to be the ALTERED GRAVITY affecting the $Target . You are n't taking multiple vectors and averaging them together as a Gravity Manipulator . Instead you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to point in a different direction ( and with a different length/strength ) at the game mechanical level . So game mechanically you 're very directly ALTERING Gravity , which is ordinarily a constant . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> ... that would require that you be able to Generate gravity on your own . <p> Um ... you mean like Fire users create their own Fire , and Cold users create their own Cold and Storm Controllers create their own Storms , and Earth users create their own Earth ... and so on and so forth for every other superpower that generates thematic effects ? Should I throw in a mention of Kinetic Melee and Energy Blast for good measure ? <p> Not really seeing the contradiction here ... 106458 @qwx726458 <p> All known gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . <p> All known NATURAL sources of gravity fields are caused by the presence of mass . Superpowers , by definition break a lot of ... rules ... for how things " work " if relying solely on " natural causes " ... 106458 @qwx726458 <p> Speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a permutation of Magnetism , but we have no idea how it might work . <p> In other words ... Fluff TextG . Still not relevant to how Gravity Manipulation powers ought to work at the game mechanical level , let alone what kinds of animations and FX ought to pertain to their use . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> City of Heroes never tried to emulate actual gravitic forces , they simply applied control-conditions and hand-waved ( Woo-woo-woo , it 's Gravity , man ! ) the effects . <p> Exactly . 106458 @qwx726458 <p> So , hit the bad guy with a Forklift and leave my tender corpus out of it . <p> Game mechanically speaking , " chucking a forklift " using Gravity Manipulation is n't all that different from " throwing cars " using Super Strength . The only real difference is that Gravity Manipulation can be Ranged ( no touch required ) , while Super Strength is Melee Only ( requires touch ) to hurl the object . In other words , if you allow Super Strength to " tear up the scenery " for missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Gravity Manipulation to do the same thing ... except that with Gravity Manipulation it 's " spooky action at a distance " rather than being something done through muscle strength alone . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> But , the problem I see with applying any sort of ' Altered Gravity ' to yourself , is that you are physically affected by that gravity . Micro-gravity causes bloating and discomfort , although , once you get over that , I understand it can be relaxing . A problem is that it can be difficult to move with any control , and it 's easy to injure yourself , since you still have inertia . Also , let 's not forget that all gravity works both directions . If you actually reduced your personal gravity=attraction vis-a-vis the Earth , you would immediately be flung into space by centripetal-force . Gravity is a two-way deal . <p> The assumption would be that you have enough control to operate in a way akin to Star Trek 's inertial dampeners , and counter the force modifier in your local area so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's akin to hitting a baseball with a bat without forgetting to maintain your own balance so you do n't become the catcher 's new best friend . <p> Maybe " gravity control " is n't that great a name , because it 's really more like telekinesis or force beam ( tractor/repulsor beam ) kind of operation . <p> Redlynne wrote : <p> No no no no no . Not " add a vector to Standard Gravity " ... ALTER THE VECTOR of Standard Gravity . <p> Mathematically , it 's the same thing . Further , it 's easy to apply a delta vector to everything in a target volume and leave the rest of the world alone . It 's hard to stick code in that has to go through every moving object in the game and check what its gravity vector should be for where it is . <p> This probably needs to work with whatever system is in place to handle knockback/up/down , which also deals with external forces applied to moving objects . <p> The alternative , of course is to do an IF-THEN-ELSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then apply an inverse of that vector so as to " null " the STANDARD GRAVITY by default as a precursor to " overwriting " it with something else . Then simply apply the ALTERED GRAVITY vector(s) to the affected $Target(s)/Location and pass the popcorn . <p> Alternatively , as Lin Chiao Feng points out , there is the possibility of leveraging the Knockback system in a way that yields similar results via different means . I would expect this application to be used more for " attack " powers than for " control " powers . Thus a lot of the " force vector attack " powers would use Knockback , while a lot of the " mez " powers would rely on ALTERED GRAVITY to enforce their effects . Note that ALTERED GRAVITY could very likely be a source of Slow/Run/Jump Debuffing , in addition to Immobilize and Hold type effects . <p> A lot of the Gravity Smash ! G kinds of " vector attack " powers could instead be broadly similar to things like Shield Charge for use as a Gap Closer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blast and Energy Manipulation powersets , with their heavy emphasis on Knockback , as essentially being Gravity Manipulation styled powers . Same too with the Kinetic Melee powerset having several ideas incorporated into it which could be proliferated into a Gravity Manipulation powerset . I 'd even go so far as to suggest that Ki Push , Storm Kick and Burst of Speed powers out of the Blaster Martial Combat powerset could be proliferated into a Gravity Manipulation powerset in some form or fashion . <p> The larger point I 'd like to make is that there is n't any Good ReasonG why Gravity ca n't be used as melee , ranged , or a mixture of both as an assault powerset , in addition to the familiar Controller style set of powers that we remember from City of Heroes . Using Gravity as a Protection Scheme , whether it be Defense/Resistance/etc. might be a bit of a challenge , unless using it as a " keep away " method of PBVoE Knockback ( similar to HERDicane in Storm Summoning ) or using it as an analog to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that anything around you has a hard(er) time getting away from you . Basic idea being that the Gravity Defense is either at the " top " of the gravity well around the caster , with everything hostile preferring to " fall away " from them and struggling to get closer , or they 're at the " bottom " of the gravity well and everything hostile has to " fight upstream " to get away from them or be pulled closer . Obviously , the " push away " works better for Ranged powersets and the " pull closer " works better for Melee powersets , but that 's the basic shape of what synergizes well . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> My point about using Your Body as a missile , is that your body impacts the target and , unless your body is made of something very durable , then the ' destructible environment ' is YOU . Squishy human goes Squish ! <p> Lin 's suggestion of a ' personal kinetic dampening field ' would be a good solution . Such a field would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red seems to be so enamored with the Effects he 's envisioning , that he 's willing to ignore the sense of ' Gravity does not Work that way ! ' Still , if we postulate some form of ' encapsulation ' , which allows us to manipulate Local gravity without affecting the Ambient gravity field of the planet , then that might allow us to do things that are ' indistinguishable from magic ' . And we could just as easily call it ' Telekinesis ' . <p> I just want to make sure we all realize that , if we actually change Gravity in a spot , then Everything ' above ' that spot is affected too . Atmosphere , airplanes , satellites , moons , planets , stars ... everything that depends on the mutual attraction of masses goes ' whoopsie ! ' if you change Gravity . <p> That said , I Agree that ' Gravity ' would make a terrific power for a Tanker . I think tightly localized gravity effects would be More Powerful at melee range than at a distance . Inverse-Square Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about ' Pull ' . The only way to ' push ' with it , would be to set up an attractive resonance with a distant object , like Mount Rushmore , or Pluto and have the ' pushed ' object Pulled towards that distant object . We can get vertical ' Lift ' by neutralizing gravity in a location and letting the Earth 's spin hurl the affected object towards space . Selectively , delicately , controlling the strength of gravitic pull between the Earth and an object would allow a sort of pseudo-hover , or actually ' orbiting at a ridiculously low altitude ' . <p> Anyway , if we get selective enough about which rules of science we want to pay attention to , there is no reason not to go the route of CoH and simply choose the Effects we want to apply and then declare that we ' did it with Gravity ' . Add some ' field effect ' animations and it should be beautiful . That 's a particular Point , by the way . ' Gravity Melee ' is fighting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on face . The required ' personal isolation field ' would Prevent physical collision . <p> Hmm , I do n't really see how gravity manipulation as a mechanic would work within MWM 's design philosophy for powers , especially considering the separation between mechanics and aesthetics . Effect wise there is nothing truly unique within gravity control so building a mechanics system specifically for it does n't really make sense when considering the limited resources MWM has , and I 'm sure other mechanics that produce the same effects are more efficient execution wise than messing around with gravity . <p> Sure , you could use actual gravity manipulation mechanics but I just do n't see the benefit of doing so at this point . <p> Hmm , I do n't really see how gravity manipulation as a mechanic would work within MWM 's design philosophy for powers , especially considering the separation between mechanics and aesthetics . <p> As Tannim pointed out , above , it does n't work as its own power set . Provide the proper animations/effects and some power set could very well be gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle than it is in practice . Coming up with an idea for a power set , or powers for a power set , is easy enough . Creating a power set that is sufficiently versatile/generic that one can slap a dozen different animation sets on it , that 's tricky . <p> My point about using Your Body as a missile , is that your body impacts the target and , unless your body is made of something very durable , then the ' destructible environment ' is YOU . Squishy human goes Squish ! Lin 's suggestion of a ' personal kinetic dampening field ' would be a good solution . Such a field would also be a powerful defense against physical attacks . Red seems to be so enamored with the Effects he 's envisioning , that he 's willing to ignore the sense of ' Gravity does not Work that way ! ' Still , if we postulate some form of ' encapsulation ' , which allows us to manipulate Local gravity without affecting the Ambient gravity field of the planet , then that might allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . And we could just as easily call it ' Telekinesis ' . <p> Indeed . In a lot of ways , Gravity Manipulation ought to look a lot like Telekinesis . It is essentially " spooky action at a distance " except when it 's done at melee ranges , much like Telekinesis . The tricky part is that gravity , out in the Real WorldG is something you do n't " see " directly , but can only observe its effects on stuff that you can see ( or detect ) . Stuff " falls " but you do n't " see " ( visually ) something pulling the object(s) towards " down " ... making gravity an " invisible force " as far as visuals go . <p> As far as the " what are you pulling on ? " question goes , that 's WAY overthinking things for a game that wo n't even bother with the curvature of the Earth . I know what you 're getting at , Fireheart , but those concerns simply are n't relevant ( or helpful ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game mechanics " work " under the hood . At best , that 's something to put into Fluff TextG in your Bio , but beyond that it 's just not meaningful as far as the game design aspect of it goes . <p> Why can the Earth Controller make stalagmites shoot up out of the ground ? It 's not natural ! Because they 're an Earth Controller . <p> Why can the Gravity Controller make stuff " go flying " the way they do ? It 's not natural ! Because they 're a Gravity Controller . <p> Yes , you 're absolutely right , that out in the REAL WORLDG Gravity Manipulation would be an incredibly dangerous thing and highly likely to " squish Mere Mortals . <p> But in City of Titans , Gravity Manipulation would be a set of superpowers . At that point , a lot of the Real WorldG objections stop applying quite so forcefully . <p> I mean , if we get too hung up on " what 's real " in a superheroics game we run into problems with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deciding whether " rocks " need to breathe air at all ) , despite the fact that Stone Tankers transformed into this routinely . <p> In other words , worrying too much about how Game Reality would work in the Real World is a " this way lies madness " endeavor . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> While it 's true that we can suspend our disbelief , especially against stuff that requires knowledge for Newtonian or relativistic physics to even disbelieve in the first place , I think the main point here is that you can code up powers that look like telekinesis or gravity control or magical levitation or high tech ionic hyperdrive belts , or manipulation of the wind , or the magnetic field , etc and at the end of the day the only things that actually exist are the powers themselves , and they 'll be grouped into intentionally generic themed sets like " Ranged Burning " and " Melee Stunning " etc . How you justify all the seemingly impossible " Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon " animations they might have is entirely left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe your Fly power is some kind of antigravity thing . Or maybe you 're using Super Jump and justifying that via telekinesis for some reason , whatever . When someone else uses that same Fly power theirs is because they can control wind . Whatever . <p> So the question is not whether or not gravity manipulation could , per se , accomplish one seemingly impossible thing or another , but rather whether or not that power can be coded up and fit nicely into a set or pool or mastery or something that it makes sense in , given the context of the set . I could easily see making a " Knockdown Melee " set where you punch and kick really hard and do knockdown or whatever plus damage . Maybe you want to use gravity manipulation as the backstory for that , fine , works for me . I would also take Fly for the sake of that same theme , but you do n't have to . <p> City of Heroes ' ' Gravity Control ' had , in common with other Control powersets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four of Nine powers . But , Of Course , we 're not really worried about the bread and butter . We want to play with the Flashy stuff . <p> Lift : Toss your Target into the air and Smash it straight down ! <p> Propel : Summon a Forklift and Hurl it at your target ! - Great for Ranged characters , but in Melee this is probably a good spot for Red 's ' Gravity-assisted Body Slam ' . This could work similarly to ' Shield Charge ' . <p> Wormhole : Target a spot , then go find some enemies and teleport them through a hole in space-time into a pile at that spot . For Melee , I think it would work best if the Caster went along for the ride . <p> Singularity : The only ' flying ' Pet ... except Singy only had Hover , so he was horribly slow . <p> Last , I 'll mention Dimension Shift which might have had some usefulness in the game the Devs originally envisioned . Unfortunately , none of us ever played that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's an open power-slot , just waiting to be filled with something Brilliant . Perhaps this is for the ' Reach out and Yank your enemy Closer ' power ? <p> How might ' Gravity Control ' fit into the customizable power framework that we 've had described to us ? <p> I think the broadest possible description might be ' Crushing Fields ' . Forcefields , energy-fields , telekinetic fields ... this might even be extended to Plant , Ice , and Stone powers that encapsulate enemies and damage them Physically . This would be in contrast with ' Burning Fields ' , where the damage is done by Energy . There 's also Illusion and Mind Control , which do damage Psionically . <p> All of these ' Control ' powers have Targeted and AoE immobilize and hold powers . Where they differentiate are in the ' specials ' , the set-exclusive powers . These expand on the theme of controlling and manipulating the opponent through the special properties of the Controller 's ' element of power ' . Controller powers also include some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' touch free ' , in that one does not have to touch the opponent , in order to affect them . <p> Redlynne and I are particularly enamored of the idea of a ' Melee Controller ' , particularly in the form of the Stalwart/Tanker class , who we see as a demi-Controller anyway . Classically , Melee-fighters have some form of martial skill , with weapons or fists . However , what we 've been discussing is the idea of a character with strong defensive abilities , but whose Offensive abilities are through their ' elements ' and not dependent on brawn or physical skills . So , rather than manifesting a psionic weapon to stab their enemy , these fighters would look them in the eyes and hurl terrors directly into the minds of their opponents . <p> Or , in the case of Gravity , Hurl them into the air , Smash them down by giving them several times their normal weight , Pin them in place by making their feet too heavy to lift . One might yank them away from a friendly squishy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one might charge into an enemy group with a prodigious gravity-powered Leap , or by ' surfing ' a wave of gravitic force . Surfing a wave of gravitic force could be used to mow-down a cone of enemy , or as a short-range escape-tactic . One might leap into a crowd of enemy , throw down a broad circle of intense Gravity to capture them , then ' Vorp ' - hurl oneself and all of one 's ' new friends ' through a wormhole-portal in space and smash down at a previously placed anchor-point , where your pet Singularity and your whole team are waiting to greet the enemy with all their power . <p> All this , without risking your manicure by laying a single hand on the filthy beasts . <p> I have to sadly say , I did like Champions Online Quicksand power , where it would Attract All Nearby foes , closer . ; ) <p> Would n't PBAoE Aura powers , like that , be more appropriate to a Defensive powerset ? Dark Armor , Fire Armor , Electric Armor , Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected enemies . Stone Armor had ' Mud Pots ' for that . Alternately , Blaster ' Manipulation ' sets had something like that . Fire had ' Hot Feet ' . The ' Quicksand ' we had in CoH was , indeed , a Controller power , a ground-targeted AoE trap . Still , I do appreciate how useful such a power would be to a Melee character . Be Well ! Fireheart <p> yep Yep . <p> Would have been awesome if CoH/V had something akin to a power , in say the Kinetic Melee powerset that instead of repelling like the Repel power in Kinetics ( for squishies ) , it instead was an aura that Attracted enemies like a singularity ( black hole ) . This way i activate it , ehhh .. maybe should n't be a toggle , and instead of having to use Taunt , just Attracts any strays trying to run off after the blasters . ; ) <p> I think it bears note that a lot of the controller sets in CoX were very similar in effect and differed more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would hold , immobilize , slow to the point of stoping , sleep , fear , or stun targets individually and in groups . You had a single pet summon power that had a long recharge time , and you had one or two pretty mediocre attacks ( mediocre in terms of DPS I mean , Propel LOOKED awesome , but was outclassed for a long time by other stuff too numerous to mention ) . <p> So the challenge then is to find not different skins for the same powers , but in fact different controller sets that actually behave differently enough to make the distinct from each other while also being coherently themed in and of themselves AND being definitively " control " sets in their hearts and souls . <p> I suppose it ; s easy enough to make similar hold powers etc but make them do minor DoT or whatever of different types . So like one set immobilizes the target and does " Burning " damage while the other immobilizes the target and does " Slowing " or " Endo draining " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with a single target immobilize attack that is basically the same among controller sets , then all you have to do is pick animations for it , with the choices being block of what looks like ice or stone depending on choice of colors , or some kind of " trapped in a force field " type deal , which could be gravity , telekinesis , magnetic field , or whatever else you want to call it . <p> Hmm .. i recall that at one point Force Fields ( i think* ) powerset had a power that repelled all Foes Away from a Targeted Ally . If CoT added such a power , add a way to Toggle between Repel and Attract . ; D <p> The main problem with Propel was the slow animation time , particularly in comparison to other powers that became available near the same time . Issue 24 saw somw changes for Propel including reducing the animation time and making it into a cone area effect . <p> Animations being applicable to a broad rNge of sets is what really sets this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from first hand experience , it makes designing sets , and even naming sets , particularly with people whom have n't fully grasped the entire conceptual system , gery difficult . A power set that say , can be used with many knock effects in a variety of vectors , along with some more typical holds and a few other powers that does relies on more kinetic effects ( as oppossed to say something like burning ) can be ised to look like gravity , telekinesis , wind , vines grabbing and throwing / holding the target , stones blasting them away , thrusting up from the ground , raining down to crush them , and more . <p> I always interpreted City of Heroes ' Smashing Damage as being bludgeoning/blunt force applications , while Lethal Damage was done by slashing/piercing applications . That 's why Martial Arts and Staff Melee and Super Strength do Smashing Damage while Broadsword and Katana and Dual Blades do Lethal Damage . <p> Levitate from Mind Control did Smashing Damage and loads of KnockUP.Gale from Storm Summoning did ( token amounts ) of Smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smashing Damage with TONS of Knockback.Repulsion Bomb in Force Fields did Smashing Damage plus Knockdown . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> Tannim , if you 're looking for the broadest possible descriptor covering all of these myriad possibilities ... Gravity , Telekinesis , Wind , " Force " Fields ( with or without John Williams soundtrack ) , etc. ... you 're essentially looking at Kinetic Forces as the unifying field theory for how all of them work under the hood in game mechanical terms . The lowest common denominator is that all of these power types involve " shoving things around " ... regardless of HOW they go about doing it . Those things getting shoved around can be anything from people to bits of the environment that can be used as opportunity weapons for missile attacks ( i.e. throwing cars , manhole covers , boulders , library books ( helves ( loaded with books ) ) , etc . ) . The key thing that unifies all of these disparate power types is either MOVING THINGS ... or IMPAIRING their movement capacity ... which in Physics 301 terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce movement and momentum ( as opposed to just disintegration ) . <p> You can then further differentiate things into Attacks , Controls and Protections ... and divide even those categories into subgroups of Melee or Ranged , with the addtional qualifier of being either Single Target or Volume of Effect ( of which there is more than one variety ) . <p> What say you , Tannim ? <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> Hmm .. i recall that at one point Force Fields ( i think* ) powerset had a power that repelled all Foes Away from a Targeted Ally .

Sounds like a love-hate power . It might save your butt , or drive you crazy . Probably drives Scrappers nuts , even if it Does save their butts . *grin* Be Well ! Fireheart <p> Repulsion Boms started out as a " Target ally , AoE repel effect happens on ally " power , with two problems . Firstly , it had a dreadfully slow animation , which is just not compatible with a " GO AWAY ! " power . You need that to come out immediately , like Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't expect is kind of confusing . <p> It later got turned into a simple AoE attack with knockback . I had it on my character since then . <p> Repulsion FIELD on the other hand ... I never found any use for . Is it supposed to keep me safe ? Force Bolt does that better . Is it supposed to be used to herd enemies ? It just draws aggro to the squishiest member of the team . I mean , Hurricane did something similar but had a huge ToHit debuff , which made it awesome . <p> Force Bubble had its moments , it was the king of the BAF trial , only the repel-immune enemies could get through , the rest got blocked . So , the AoE people had a clump of juicy targets , and the single target people could easily see the priority targets as they 'd run straight through . <p> I kind of want a Force Bolt and Force Bubble expy in the powers . Although , I would love it if Force Bubble became Force Wall , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <p> Did n't see anyone mention it we are talking gravity based powers why not increase the foes personal gravity ?

Therefore , if you can crank up someones gravity it would be like standing in the center of the black hole with everything near by being attracted to you . This could also work for electrical powers as they could turn there foes into electromagnets like Static douse . <p> This is an example of something that could be done in a game just fine , but is actually not a physically accurate description of what would happen . ( see suspension of disbelief above , and fo rthe record I 'm not saying " so we ca n't do it because it 's not accurate " I 'm saying " we could do this , but it 's a bit of a hand-wavy excuse for the power ) Newton 's Third Law stipulates that the force of one object on another ( any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal and opposite tot he force of the second object back on the first . <p> For example , the Earth exerts exactly as much gravitational force on the moon as the moon does on the Earth . YOU exert exactly as much gravitation force on the Earth as the Earth does on you . The force of my fist hitting a brick wall is exactly the same as the force of the brick wall back on my fist , etc . <p> Anyway , the power set would likely not be called " Gravity " or anything like it , it would probably be called something more generic like " shoving stuff around using invisible forces " or as some have suggested , " Kinetics " or something like that . How you justify the actual power itself is completely open to interpretation . The only real question is how do you want the power set to work and does the power fit into that framework or not ?

It both demonstrates that their goal is to prevent the rising of the Phoenix from the ashes and also references the well known ' ashes to ashes ' phrase used when someone dies , to show just how dedicated to death and destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beer watching everyone chat up a storm* Yeah , yeah guess I 'm in too . Of course we could make Alts just for the Phoenix Rising group or Villain group . That is if we are n't going to use our mains in the order . <p> " 106451 @qwx726451 <p> Writing them up in a spreadsheet ( to make an easier visual representation ) as we speak ..... I 'll give you a general rundown though : <p> This concept will have a scaleing effect : <p> 1 . At the top we will have : The Phoenix Rising Initiative ( original concept/coalition/grand meeting hall ) : Here is where it all started . I would VERY much like for this one to tie HEAVILY in the CoT Lore ( Atlas Hall : named after the great Hurrican Atlas , or even Atlas Towers : where if we manage to get 2 towers , there can be a corresponding one for Red Side:D ) , so until more of the lore is released , I do n't want to step on any creative toes as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consist of The Phoenix Rising Initiatives founding members ( that 's all of us : D ) &amp; their SG 's ( if they want to keep the original SG 's that they had in CoX ) , which leads to the next tier ... <p> 2 . Five ( 5 ) Phoenix Based ( main ) SG 's : That 's right ... FIVE ! One for each corresponding Origin ( if they have them ) : Natural , Mutant , Technology , Magic , Science ... The names of these SG 's should correspond with that particular origin . Example : was thinkin the Magic origin could be something like .... oh ... I du n no ... Order of the Phoenix , or *cough cough* Circle of the Phoenix XD ... Something along those lines , but SOMETHING Phoenixy . On the same level of this tier , will also be the SG 's that everyone wanted to keep from the old game , but are still part of the Phoenix Rising Initiative . For example I know that LIttle Mystery wanted to keep her ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because SHE is an official founder of the Phoenix Rising Initiative , that ENTIRE SG will be part of the Coalition ! <p> With me so far ? K ! <p> 3 . Once we have established an universal promotion/ranking system for Tier 2 ( I 'm thinking once the kickstarter has ended , that way we can get as many coalition members possible , making it just THAT much more diverse and enjoyable ) , then we can start looking outside of the original founding members SG 's in order to further the coalition ! <p> A quick suggestion for Villain 's Group name . If a Phoenix rises to new life by flames and fire , why not use a term that defines death and destruction by flames and fire for a Villian 's Group that is the " flip side " of Phoenix Rising ? <p> I give you : IMMOLATION <p> ( ' t is also the name of a death-metal band , which is rather appropriate , I think . *grins* ) <p> " <p> We grow not old , so long as we continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villain 's Group name . If a Phoenix rises to new life by flames and fire , why not use a term that defines death and destruction by flames and fire for a Villian 's Group that is the " flip side " of Phoenix Rising ? I give you : IMMOLATION ( ' t is also the name of a death-metal band , which is rather appropriate , I think . *grins* ) <p> That sounds like a FANTASTIC idea ! ! ! Kinda like the heroes look forward and upward , focusing on rebirth and prosparity , while the villains dwell on the fallen , focusing on revenge and anger ! I like it ! ! <p> Ok , Immolation takes the kudo award for best villain group so far ... at least IMO <p> As far as origins are concerned . They 've told us Origins are story flavor only . No in game mechanic for it ... that being said , how about an SG for each classification ? There will be diversity there , and if we are all part of a coalition , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coalition . <p> Ok , Immolation takes the kudo award for best villain group so far ... at least IMO As far as origins are concerned .

We could have the Stalwart Defenders , Rolling Rangers , Lights Guardians ... you know things like this ... I do n't know . Up to ya 'll really what you think . <p> I did n't realize there were n't going to be origins .. oh well ... lol ... as far as basing SG 's on classifications , I do n't really think that would work out so well ... sure Melee Damage now has the option of healing and whatnot , but I really do n't see how that could ever match the healing potential of someone that has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really sure at this point , til more details are released , BUT if there IS a balance there , that would be kinda cool ... And concidering that we 'll have a HUGE pool of folks to pull from in the Coalition , I can see someone from a Bulwark Class SG EASILY being to team with someone from another Class SG : D ... still kinda on the drawing board , for now , though lol <p> Now all we need is a " Fiery Phoenix " costume change emote , so a casual group of " bystanders " at the scene of a disaster can suddenly all burst into a tower of flame and emerge in SG colors and costumes . Do it coordinated via SG chat channel , and the results would be epic ! <p> Would also be real nice for making an " entry " at the podium when the leader addresses the hall of SG folks at the start of the annual pot luck and ice cream social ! *grins* <p> " <p> We grow not old , so long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , Immolation , released a free-to-the-public song set a while back . Among those songs was one that sounds especially relevant for a Villainous Super Group , especially one associated with flaming destruction , ashes , and Phoenix . The song is called " Providence " , and you can hear the track here : <p> Hi everyone ! I 'm liking this idea ! Here 's my thought on it . In one of the updates it was mentioned that many of the buildings would have skywalks between them . Would n't it be great if the hero tower and the villain tower were connected by a skywalk ? The skywalk ( or bridge ) would act as ' neutral ground ' for meetings and such . Also be a great place for dance parties ! <p> Hi everyone ! I 'm liking this idea ! Here 's my thought on it .

The only problem I see is how close to the other one it is ... but if we provide that as a base to begin with I 'm sure the artists could come up with something . <p> With all this talk of it being a tower , I 'm beginning to wonder if it might not be cool to have an asymmetrical tower that looked like a flame reaching into heaven . You know , where the base is a lot bigger than the top and you could have a couple of subsidiary towers lower down that break up the outline , lending it almost a modern art feel while still being a building ? <p> They 've already got their ' tallest building ' picked out , but that 's fine . This tower would just need to be taller than the buildings around it ... <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in keeping with the dev 's design aesthetic ... but what if our tower was in the middle of the industrial district they mentioned . You know , all that air pollution , read smoke , around the building ? Plus , that puts our base ' in the middle of the action ' as it were . We could have our base in the middle of the clean center of the city , but we 're heroes . We bring this beacon of hope to the place where it 's needed . <p> That , and if it looks even a little like a flame , in a modern art sort of way , having it rise out of the smoke would just be frikken awesome . <p> That 's a cool start to the logo , Kiyori . In the color version , it 's a bit hard to make out the bird against the flames , though . What does it look like to use a solid color ( black , for instance ) for the bird ? <p> I 'm more likely to be red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in joining or at least keeping tabs on the villain side SG based around this . And if we 're going to be forming a sort of symmetry with these groups , then why not Phoenix Falling/Fallen Phoenix ? Phoenix Rising and Phoenix Falling . Life and death . An eternal struggle of creation and destruction . Anyway , that 's just my opinion . 
@@79253454 @753454/ <h> A plea for blasters <p> So recently as I was working through the forums and old updates on the Kickstarter page I came across this realization . <p> Blasters are not in the launch plans for City of Titans . <p> This was confirmed in a post a short while back by Dr Tyche ( I can not find that post now , likely it was removed because it contained the chart which is old information now that the glossary has been released ) . At the time , disappointment and sadness swept over me , but no more . Today I initiate my plan to return blasters to the forefront of the game 's launch and hopefully provide compelling reasoning for including them over the current selection despite their issues . At the very least , this will provide a place for other blasters to vent about the news . <p> Given the situation the game faces , the reasoning behind this decision is completely understandable . Blasters were always a tough and difficult archetype for the devs in our predecessor game , and I can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a class they were problematic for the 9 years of life that the game had , going through more iterations then any other class in an attempt to repair glaring deficiencies . Note that blasters were the only class data-mined to be performing significantly below the average of every other class . This was the impetus for the first Defiance . Later , they were altered again when data-mining proved that blasters were still under-performing , giving us the second form of defiance that lasted until the game 's end . But even that was not enough , as major changes to the way the class functioned and it 's secondary power sets worked was slated for the final issue I24 . These changes never made it out of Beta . I got to test out many of those changes near the end on the Beta server and even then , i was not convinced that all the alterations the CoH devs had made would go far enough to help the class . <p> So blasters are problematic , no one doubts that . They were poorly defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass cannon got thrown around a lot , but if there 's one thing that MMO 's keep proving again and again , it 's that glass cannons are not that fun to play ( see Wildstar 's Spellslinger for the latest example ) . A lot of this poor definition came from the nature of the class 's secondary power sets . These were so poorly defined in what they did , they complicated the issue in a very extreme way . This is an issue that no doubt must plague the developers here in this game as well . Most of the blaster secondaries were a bad mix of melee attacks , self buffs , and soft controls and debuffs that were ridiculously difficult to balance for and contributed to most of the performance issues the class suffered . Despite all of these issues , and all of the challenge surrounding making a blaster class in this game that will perform as well as the others , it must be taken on . The game can not launch with Corruptors as the primary ranged damage archetype for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will define what powers will mean going forward into the game . In a smart move , the devs have decided to go for the most part with the original 5 . Tankers , controllers , defenders , and scrappers ( along with a few others ) will all be there at the start and will all be available to play . Each of these 4 types strongly identifies with the primary powersets of each class . The problem when you get to ranged is that all of the initial problems that were present with the Corruptor class you get mixed into the initial launch of the game . The accusations that they 're just reverse defenders . The accusations that they do n't do enough damage to be " real " damage dealers and they do n't offer enough support to be " real " support archetypes . Why take a Striker when you can take a Gladiator or Guardian who will do the job better ? <p> And the Striker will HAVE to be a middle of the road class . Otherwise the mix of support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to balance . These are the exact same issues that the Guardian will have as well . Successfully balancing the class will require either a reduction of it 's ranged capabilities or a reduction of it 's support capabilities at least in part , pushing the two closer together . And do we really want the game to launch with two classes that are mistaken for each other ? I think the damage that could cause to the game would be problematic and could easily lead us to the scenario where ranged damage is avoided altogether . Another potential problem is that if they do become the baseline for ranged damage , does melee damage get nerfed in such a way as to bring them to parity ? Because people will ask why melee damage is so good and ranged damage is so bad . <p> Masteries will not be able to mitigate this issue significantly . A strong ranged damage class is required at launch . If the challenge of taking on the offensive mitigation/manipulation secondary is too much , then consideration should be made to allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least allow for a strong ranged damage class with less confusion between it and the Guardian . But strong ranged damage is a requirement that I do not think the Striker can provide and you 're setting the table without a butter knife if you move forward with it . <p> Another question this decision begs for an answer is if not at launch , when ? The work wo n't be any less after launch . And given that the chart that floats around has no original archetype under the offensive mitigation column besides blasters , does not bode well . How tempting will it be to put off the class for other lower hanging fruit ? Why work on blasters , when they could pump out new archetypes for class/specs that are better defined and easier to make ? If not now , when ? After Taskmasters are done ? <p> Nevermind the legion of fans who will wonder why they ca n't make a blaster at launch of the game , of which I number among . Given the legacy that this game is trying to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . At launch , I 'll be able to make Superman , The Invisible Woman , Batman , Captain America , Wolverine , Wonder Woman and a host of others . But I wo n't be able to make Cyclops , or Johnny Storm , or the Punisher , or Iron Man . That is a problem . <p> As to the work itself , there are things that can be done . From a design standpoint I get the issues with the blaster secondaries and I plan to tackle them VERY soon . But given the issues listed above , there is much cause for alarm at this decision . I hope I 've provided some of the reasons for why it should be reconsidered . Thanks for listening . <p> You know , I never got the feeling playing one that blasters were ever poor performers in CoH . I guess I was too busy blasting away my enemies to notice the data said I had problems ; ) <p> As I understand it , the problem with getting the blaster analog up and running is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a very difficult set to make useful without over/under powering it . Since it will probably end up being pieced together out of powers taken from other sets it would be a good idea to take those core powers and run them through the ringer of live game play first . As much as I want blasters at launch , this really is the best decision in the long run . <p> If it is any consolation , with the ability to respect your secondary power you can role a Striker at launch and respect them into a Hunter ( or whatever name they settle on ) when it becomes available . <p> " <p> **41;390;TOOLONG I never set anything on fire accidentally ! <p> We want to make Manipulation really shine .

I ca n't say my blaster ever felt underpowered as compared to my Defenders , or my Corrupter . EVERYTHING felt underpowered compared to my Mastermind though . <p> When the gunner sets to live ( ranged w/ def secondary ) I 'll finally be able to roll my Sunspot toon I 've wanted since coh , I pulled the iceman off there but with no armor the sunspot was a bit trouble some . <p> Look Lockon , I like blasters as much as next guy but you have to understand that the classes that they picked to start off have a reason to be there . First of all it saves resources , and I 'm not just talking about money here , we 're talking about time . The people who are working on this thing are all volunteers . Every last one them . Do n't get me wrong most of them are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't change the fact that they are n't getting paid for it . This is n't technically their job , they still have lives to live , children to feed and jobs to go to meaning that they have less time than other game company , and that is a factor that is equal if not more than money . These classes where picked because they have similar powersets , not despite it . This is a good reason to start with these because instead of working on all of the different powersets before launch they can concentrate all that energy into 4 types of powersets that have lots of examples of being done right . Meaning they have time to put other things in the game , like being able to choose your secondary and inherit in the first place , The path system and many other things that CoX did n't .

These things take time .

I agree with that , but with the right load out or powers you could solo . ( Best defense being a good offense and all that . ) But I ever had a group of 4x or more blasters in CoH nobody ever said " Oh man we are so outclassed were gon na get boned . " It was more like we were the evil arch villain rubbing our hands together while plotting the destruction of anything who stood in our way .

Do I want it to look , feel , and play exactly like Blasters did ? ... Sort of .

And let 's face it , at launch , we can expect there to be holes , and problems , glitches that will need to be addressed and fixed . So I 'm less then worried about having a powerful assault class at first .

It 's an exaggeration to say melees will be the only DPS . It does n't sound like we 'll have to wait years to get the Hunter either . <p> While we wo n't have Blasters , we will have Corruptors and Defenders . I 'm perfectly fine with that for now . It 's ranged damage . So those that want to play Ranged can still play ranged . It 's better than not having any at all . Would you rather MWM did n't even make CoT ?

Because people play what they like to play . It 's not always about Min/Max'ers . Also we have no idea how effective the Buffs and Debuffs are going to be , which could make Strikers very effective as DPS'ers . Also with the expectation being that the initial game that is coming out will not be a complete game , people will look forward to having Blasters released to play . I think you are very passionate about Blasters , and I commend that , but I also think you are overreacting just a bit . It 's not going to kill the game if we wait and let them build it the right way . Like I said , there are A LOT of things people would love to see at launch but are going to have to patiently wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that strikers wo n't be able to deal out the same levels of DPS that a melee DPS class will be able to by virtue of how they will have to be balanced to be functional in the game . To attempt to be more clear , I believe that while Strikers will be capable of dealing DPS , they wo n't be the " best " DPS'ers by a wide enough margin , that players may avoid them as DPS characters . And if that happens , and I believe there 's a strong enough chance for it to , what are the chances that it hurts the game overall when the only " real " DPS is melee dps ? <p> Once again , what are you basing this on ? Let 's look at what melee types we are getting at launch , the Gladiator and the Bulwark . For the bulwark melee is his secondary skill , just like tanks in CoH were . They will most likely out of the box not be the best DPS in the game . So that leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume there is equality between range and melee damage sets outside of what class they are on . It is reasonable to guess the gladiator could out damage the striker based solely on their primaries , but I would not think it would be by a the larg margin you think it would be . And then , what about their secondaries ? The Gladiator has protection , so he 's going to be able to take hits , but that 's not going to help him increase his damage . The striker will have support , that means buffs/debuffs which can quickly rack up the DPS they actually deal . Just look back at what a vanilla SOed fire/dark corrupter could do in CoH . The fact that their damage was scaled lower than a scrapper or blaster did nothing to slow down their DPS . <p> " <p> **41;476;TOOLONG I never set anything on fire accidentally ! <p> Arguably , the melee DPS SHOULD be better than the ranged DPS . The melee DPS class has to get up close with the badguys and attack them from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safer distance and mitigate damage by being out of range of the enemy 's attacks , to some extent . If you add to that the fect that Ranged tends to be more AoE , or larger AoE anyway , then you probably need to make the Fireball attack less damage than the bread-and-butter melee DPS " good punch " attack . I mean , we don ; t want the Blasters to be TOO good do we ? <p> Again , I think the bigger problem is trying to make Masterminds that are playable and fun without being obvious leaps and bouds above everything else and thus totally OP . <p> Now let 's assume there is equality between range and melee damage sets outside of what class they are on . <p> This is not an assumption you can make given the information we have available . In CoH , damage was a function of your class . All power sets had their own values for damage but the archetype modifiers for those classes set the actual range of damage that a power set could do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Titans intend to create close analogs to classes as they existed in City of Heroes . To go too far away from that , means making a different game . While we surely want to dump the old bad stuff from City of Heroes that we do n't need any more , I 'm not willing to assume that there is going to be equity between power sets based on anything else that they 've said so far . <p> Given what we DO know about classes so far does not give us the ability to conclude that Strikers will be particularly effective DPS'ers . Given that the **28;519;TOOLONG chart floating around specifically calls Strikers the Corruptor analog from CoH , I 'm going to assume until I hear differently , that they will perform as Corruptors did in City of Heroes . And unfortunately , despite whatever DPS numbers they could produce , they were not considered a high DPS class . Middle of the road for sure but definitely not high . They lagged behind all of the epic archetypes , blasters , scrappers , dominators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without capes . A SUPERHERO game launched WITHOUT CAPES . Why ? Because they were not ready for launch and they wanted to do them right . <p> The reason we are getting those certain Class and Spec combinations at launch is an important one . I know the devs will work hard to get the last Classification and the rest of the Specifications in the game as soon as possible , but we will just have to wait until they have the resources and time to tackle them . <p> I think you misunderstood me. when I said " assume there is equality between range and melee damage sets " I meant let 's not assume melee is inherently better than range or vice versa . Of course the class is going to effect the final amount of omph a class has in damage , buff , healing , etc . <p> If you are going to conclude that strikers will preform as they did in CoH , then you will have to assume they will be good at DPS . That chart you linked does not take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on combat and the scourge ability . Hell , when CoV launched they were out preforming Blasters in DPS and blasters got a round of buffs because of it . I know we wo n't have scourge , but we will have our masteries , and I 'm sure one of them will also further to increase the overall DPS of the class . I am quite convinced the DPS of a striker will be at a " good " level . and will not force people to play a gladiator if they want DPS . <p> " <p> **41;549;TOOLONG I never set anything on fire accidentally ! <p> I think you misunderstood me. when I said " assume there is equality between range and melee damage sets " I meant let 's not assume melee is inherently better than range or vice versa .

If you are going to conclude that strikers will preform as they did in CoH , then you will have to assume they will be good at DPS .

Why would I want gladiators on my pug when I could get a Striker that not only has " good " DPS like a gladiator , but will also be able to heal me ? You ca n't say more damage . We 're assuming that melee damage is n't better than ranged damage anymore . What will gladiators offer on a team that will make them worth as much as a striker when their DPS is comparable ? <p> Okay , first of all , even if all the gladiators had the same stats the still would be qual . The bodyguard and the Melee/maniplulation still do n't have as many self mitigation powers as melee/defense . Sure one can heal his team mates and one has control powers bit does n't change the fact that when they are hit they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all trades off equally and it all depends on how the player wants to play their toon . They may all be able to deal damage equally but " taking care of himself " is another issue entirely . It 's the same thing with the ranger , a striker may be able to heal his allies but a hunter has more offensive powers to use and still has some control power to keep the enemies at bay while he attacks them and while the gunner may not have the ability to heal his team or have as many offensive powers or control power as the hunter he will last longer health wise . That 's the trade off , not what they can do with their primary but what they can do with their secondary . My enforcer is still as much of a value to the team as the bodyguard because he can last longer than that bodyguard and I might be the one that takes the attention away from him so he can do his job as a DPS/Support character in case we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all no one here is assuming that melee damage will be equal to ranged damage other than you . There is no reason why the devs wo n't give a damage bonus to melee powers like the devs of CoX did to blanance out the fact that ranged can do damage from farther away . <p> I 'm sorry , but we unfortunately wo n't be getting " Blasters " at launch . You 'll just have to come to terms with this fact and try to make peace with it . The Devs only have limited amount of resources to contribute towards developing this game . This is one of the sacrifices they had to make in order to make this game . I 'm sure it pains them as much as it pains you to have to do this . I do not believe that any amount of begging or debating will alter this . I 'm sure that their next priority after getting the game released is to try to focus on making this character available as soon as possible . <p> Think about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch either . More than likely just the basics . How many people do you think would LOVE to have some kind of exotic damage type or animation that CoH did not have available ? I can think of a few right off of the bat that have posted in other threads about what they 'd love to see implemented at the beginning as well . Again , Time and Resources are going to play a big part of that . I also repeat that I 'd like to see them do " Blasters " right instead of throwing something out there to try to appease the masses that is broken . I 've never played a " Blaster " all the way to 50 . I was looking forward to the " Blaster " issue before they closed CoH down . I thought MAYBE I can finally be interested enough in a " Blaster " to get it to 50 . So , for me , I 'd rather play a " Blaster " done right to make sure I enjoy it to get it to 50 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they are reading these threads and are taking everybody 's concerns under consideration . It 's just that they have to do what is best for them in the time they are allotted with the money they have available . This does n't mean we will never see " Blasters " , it just means it will be a little bit before we do . <p> But let 's go the other way for just a second . Let 's say that you 're right and the devs are right . Striker DPS does end up being set at a " good " level . Nobody is forced to play a gladiator if they want good DPS . Now let me pose the following question to you . Why would you ever be a gladiator at all ? Seriously . <p> Because I want to be a gladiator ? because my character concept is a melee character ? Because both are viable choices ? <p> Everyone wants blasters in this game all right , we all agree on that . They wo n't be in at launch for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people will be driven away from the game because the only good DPS will be in melee is flat out ridiculous . <p> " <p> **41;592;TOOLONG I never set anything on fire accidentally ! <p> Is n't Iron Man more of a melee/resistance character ? The armor gets hit -- he takes little or no damage ... <p> Ehhh ... You have to compare his resistance to say taking a hit from Hulk or Thor . So in a way , not much in resistance . : / <p> Ranged Damage + 5% Resistnace and 10% Defense ... Not very good for a Scrapper . : P Maybe after reaching the Ancillary powersets he could soft cap defense , or come close to it . He s very close to a Blaster . : ) <p> Now Black Panther has Vibranium ... and it rises up to 25 to 30% in Defense . : D But he 's a Melee character .. sooo .. ehhh . : ) He s a Real Scrapper . <p> Because I want to be a gladiator ? because my character concept is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants blasters in this game all right , we all agree on that . They wo n't be in at launch for good reasons laid out by the devs . Your entire theory that people will be driven away from the game because the only good DPS will be in melee is flat out ridiculous . <p> Now I think you are confusing what I said . As a class choice there are tons of reasons why choosing a gladiator is viable . I would never argue that . My contention is that under the rules you 've defined , gladiators would not be a viable choice as a teammate . Why take a mono-tasker when you could instead get a multi-tasker ? <p> My blasters got out dpsed many times by a corruptor plus they have higher survivability . <p> This statement is provably false . Unless your blaster was lying on the ground dead ( which granted , was entirely possible ) or simply not shooting , there 's no sane combination of attack chain or power usage where a Corruptor out-dps'es a Blaster . <p> I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using level 50 example characters with SO enhancements and specifically calculate a simple attack chain for each character for a level 50 mob including scourge and defiance effects to show this . <p> Or you could go download the last version of Mids from the Titan Network and simply take a look at their power set comparison tool with Blasters and Corruptors as the choices . There is no power set comparison , whether it 's Blaster archery and Corruptor fire blast , or any other selection , that will put Corruptor DPS above a Blaster 's . <p> I do not believe that any amount of begging or debating will alter this . <p> Given that the very thread we are in right now is a suggestion thread from the devs asking us for suggestions on how the game should be made , I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement and likely always will . <p> And I believe that the decision to launch the game with a strong melee class , and a strong defense class , and a strong support class , and a strong control class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could negatively impact the game at a fundamental level . Regardless of how much time the devs actually have to make the game , an argument I find more and more specious the more I hear it , a bad design decision is a bad design decision . And it 's one they should make the time to correct . <p> Maybe blasters are n't the answer , but neither is their current choice . And until they do something to correct it , I 'm going to do my best to try and help them not make a bad decision . Like you , I am invested in this game and hope for it 's success . <p> And I believe that the decision to launch the game with a strong melee class , and a strong defense class , and a strong support class , and a strong control class , and a weak ranged class , is a terrible decision that could negatively impact the game at a fundamental level <p> Wait wait wait - how the heck do you know how the classes will play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class/spec combinations are like when the devs have barely begin development ? This is n't CoH dude - dump that old info . Your numbers do n't apply here . This is a new game that is still in pre-alpha development . <p> Quote : <p> And until they do something to correct it , I 'm going to do my best to try and help them not make a bad decision . <p> I 'm pretty sure you 're too late dude - the decision has been made ( even pre-kickstarter ? ) and it was made for maximum efficiency and maximum effect . And it was a good decision , despite your personal misgivings and desires . To quote Mr. Spock - it was most logical . <p> Quote : <p> Like you , I am invested in this game and hope for it 's success . <p> That 's good , but you have to realize that trying to shoehorn the Manipulation sets in at launch could compromise their schedules and the game as a whole . Same goes for the Assault Secondaries and the Pet Primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see these powers in at launch as well - but that 's just not going to happen ( to say nothing of the new Class/Spec combos that have no direct CoX-analogue ) . No amount of pleading or begging is going to change the fact that these sets will take more work to see the light of day , so the most efficient use of time and resources is to work on the sets currently slated for launch . *shrugs* that 's the way it is . <p> oOStaticOo wrote : I do not believe that any amount of begging or debating will alter this . <p> Given that the very thread we are in right now is a suggestion thread from the devs asking us for suggestions on how the game should be made , I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement and likely always will . <p> Actually , this thread is a request thread from a player ( LockOn , aka ' you ' ) hoping to influence the developers on how the game should be made . Making yourself out to be a dev , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I did n't see LockOn trying to pretend he was a Dev . His understanding of the purpose of the section is slightly skewed , but he never said he was a Dev . <p> This is a ' Suggestion Box ' where Devs might find useful ideas . This thread has been a ' plea for blasters ' , which assumes that ' blaster ' is the only way to make Ranged DPS . <p> A more effective argument might be made for Partisans , with their Ranged/Defense arrangement . That would be a more unique AT , using existing ' Primary Ranged ' and ' Secondary Defense ' powersets , that was n't simply a mirror-image of another AT . <p> Insisting on ' blasters ' means persuading the Devs to bring out another Secondary specification , which means more work for the Devs . Meaning that , as has been suggested here , the ' plea ' is likely to be avoided , rather than accepted . The energy in this thread might be better spent in the Ranger Discussion thread , looking at ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me put it this way then . No matter what , the Developers have the say in what is brought out in this game . All we can do is offer suggestions and ideas . They have already said that " Blasters " will not be released at launch and have given their reasons why . There are a lot of people that have made posts on this forum about what they 'd like to see the Developers do to the game . Many times I have seen them come on here and say that they have a clear and present course that they are following in order to get this game out to us in a proposed amount of time . And now you are asking them to change that plan , which would mean an even further release date than what is proposed now . <p> We on this forum also represent a minority . Yes we can come up with some great ideas and people can debate on the validity of those ideas , but we are not representative of the majority . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't thought of , that they will write down and store for later . Right now their goal is to get this game released according to the plan they outlined in the Kickstarter . And I 'm sure they 've already experienced some glitches and hiccups in that plan . They have very limited resources to devote to this , so I 'm sure they carefully thought out how best to maximize those resources to produce the game in a timely fashion . <p> I would ask that you instead focus on suggestions in the Ranger forum to help make " Blasters " better once they get around to making them instead . I do n't see them changing their plan on how they are going to make this game and what we will see at launch . If that plan is changed , it 's not going to be to include more stuff . Rather it will be to let us know that there were unforeseen circumstances that needed to be taken care of and unfortunately something they promised at launch will not be released at launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working very hard to make this game happen . <p> Izzy , i agree that the movie-character Iron Man is very close to a blaster -- I mis-wrote . Although lots of blasters in COH had powerful melee attacks ( I miss my Fire/Fire character named Charcoal Blaster ) , they tended to " get dead " very quickly in melee . Iron Man is not really in too much trouble , even in extended melee , it seems to me . <p> However , I still do n't quite understand what defense ( in COH terms ) that the movie-character Iron Man has ? It seems like he is being ( ineffectively ) hosed with machine gun fire in Movie one quite frequently ... I if I think on the Avengers film where Loki taps his chest with the " Spear of Destiny " or whatever it was called -- it had no effect . Seems like resistance to me , rather than defense . : ) <p> He 's being hit -- it just does n't hurt him . Except for flying and dodging , does he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man a ranged/resistance character ? <p> And while I agree that being punched by Thor or Hulk is clearly bad for Iron Man , even resistance has limits ... <p> I disagree with the premise that " Blasters " are some kind of imperative and that the game will suck without them . For one thing , the game they 're making is City of Titans , not City of Heroes . A lot , if not everything , will be different . The fact is there definitely wo n't be any " Blasters " ever , but perhaps in time there might be something that closely resembles them , when the devs can figure out how to make them fun and not broken . I 'm all for that . If your idea is to say " Hold it ! Stop the presses , we ca n't not have blasters , we 're making a huge mistake here . " I just disagree . Who is right ? Only time will tell . <p> Izzy , i agree that the movie-character Iron Man is very close to a blaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had powerful melee attacks ( I miss my Fire/Fire character named Charcoal Blaster ) , they tended to " get dead " very quickly in melee .

The Iron Man suit is like a car , with you as the passenger . So , any time Iron Man is n't in need of Health restoration , its Defense . <p> Hulk , Wolverine , etc ... is pure resistance and Heal Back ( regen ) . With the Hulk though , the more he flexes his muscles , the tougher his skin .. or rather muscles become . Like when you squeeze a piece of coal and it turns to a Diamond . So the Meaner the Hulk gets ... his muscles tighten/compact even more . Well , i like to think if his abilities in that way ... even though you can say in fact the mini nuclear reactor inside of him just went into a higher gear as he gets pissed off more . : ) <p> This is all mute to be sure .

( scales with distance ) - etc ... ( Rage from Super Strength , would lower your Defense by 20% , when it dropped ) <p> Your probably thinking ... Rocket Launcher .

And while I agree that being punched by Thor or Hulk is clearly bad for Iron Man , even resistance has limits ... <p> Everybody facepalm . Looks like we have to explain English . <p> Your problem seems to be a conceptual lockdown on terminology that must function the same as it did in CoH . The problem is that CoH had this same setup where a single word ( defense ) was used with two very specific and different meanings with only one of them being prominent in the mechanics of the game , where it meant ' evasiveness ' or ' ability to dodge . ' <p> The problem is that resistance is still defense in the BROADER definition used in CoH archetype construction . All Scrappers were Melee Attack/Defense All Brutes were Melee Attack/Defense All Stalkers were Melee Attack/Defense All Tankers were Defense/Melee Attack <p> The same word used with two different meanings is causing your confusion . Fire Armor was still a Defense Set even though the type of defense it offered was resistance and not defense . <p> When people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , they are talking Defense CATEGORY rather than defense STATISTIC . Note big D versus little d . <p> Now , on to the truly silly portion of your post . Getting hit and taking no tangible damage versus dodging versus taking damage but not as much . <p> What is the difference between a person who dodges a bullet and a person who does n't dodge it because they wear armor that makes the bullet completely ineffective ? Neither of them take any damage from the projectile . <p> There is no difference . This is Super Reflexes versus Stone Armor ( with the stone being replaced by Power Armor ) in effect . Neither character is actually hit even though one of them was hit but in a way that did no damage . Spider-Man dodges , Iron Man does n't . Spidey has no armor and the bullet would hurt so he MUST dodge . Iron Man has armor and the bullet will most likely ricochet off harmlessly , so he takes no evasive action because the bullet can not hurt him . They are mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of Defense and Resistance , so that does n't work ! " ANY armor is effectively a mix of Defense ( deflection ) and Resistance ( padding ) . Stone armor as a SET had only one power that was both defense and resistance STATISTICS at the same time : Granite Armor . Rock Armor was Smash/Lethal defense ( With DefenseDebuffResist ) , Brimstone Armor was purely Fire/Cold resist ( the only toggle power before granite that was resist ) , Crystal Armor was Energy/Negative defense ( With DDR ) , and Minerals was Psi Defense and Confusion resist . <p> The problem is that most old CoH players see defense as ONLY dodging when it could mean so many other things depending on the powerset at hand . Any Dungeons and Dragons player will tell you that this mirrors the way MOST DM 's handle Armor Class . Personally I liked to break it down so that I could tel people if an attack missed , was dodged , glanced harmlessly off of their armor , or came so close to hurting them that the impact area goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of detail in a game ? Hell no , but I do expect people to have a brain and think before they open their word hole and say rather stupid things like " that looks like resistance so it ca n't be defense . " when resistance is a form of defense against something . <p> Izzy , I see your points , and agree , especially about Wolverine and Hulk . Hulk 's skin is clearly armored based on the last Avenger 's movie . It deflects bullets . as we know , wolverine 's skin does not . <p> However , in COH terms regen is not resistance , and both are different than defense . They are all cool powers , to be sure . : ) To illustrate this point , what happens if you toss Wolverine into the center of a large volcano filled with super hot lava ? I submit that in all likelihood his flesh burns faster than it can regenerate and an adamantium-clad skeleton sinks to the bottom of the volcano bowl . This is because , in COH terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather modest resistance ( he still gets burned , or shot or whatever , like you or I ) and no defense . <p> Iron Man , on the other hand has a chance of surviving an encounter with some lava ( resistance ) but has no regen if the suit fails . <p> And I also agree that resistance is something that heals back ... but for the movie character Iron Man this is accomplished with the mechanic of changing suits in a jiffy . : ) <p> In fact one could argue ( again from the end of the last Avenger 's movie ) that the movie character Iron Man was a blaster who just figured out how to get pets ( the other suits that fight for him ) , becoming a blaster/MM hybrid . <p> In fact one could argue ( again from the end of the last Avenger 's movie ) that the movie character Iron Man was a blaster who just figured out how to get pets ( the other suits that fight for him ) , becoming a blaster/MM hybrid . <p> hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only a few suits .. not as many as shown by the end of the 3rd one . In CoH terms , is n't that like getting pets from Incarnate powers ? : ) <p> Iron Man is a yet to be named Class/Spec of Assault ( Ranged + Melee DPS ) with Protection . As Voldine pointed out Defence is not always Defence , hence why I used Protection . <p> Survivability can use the following : - Resistance ( takes hits , ignores most of the damage but still gets hurt ) - Avoidance ( dodges attacks , but when one does land it hits hard ) - Ablative ( takes hits for no damage but what is protecting you wears away and once that happens you take the damage . Your protection would regen over time after taking no damage - think forcefields " Shields at 90% , no 70% Capt'n. 40% ! ) - Regen ( Wolverine - ' nuff said ) - Then we have the problem of Iron Man . He gets hit and never takes any real amounts of damage personally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sounds like Ablative . BUT his armour never really gets hit that much that it wears away . This type of Protection was discussed on the MWM forum and was getting fairly involved by smart people using formula that I just said " OK " to . Iron Man can basically ignore 10 bad guys with normal guns . That 's not Resistance . Its not Avoidance . Its not Regen . Its not Ablative . Even when he gets shot by a Tank in movie 1 ( and that Tank gunner surely took a Large Yellow Insp or 4 for that shot ! ) he did n't get damaged himself , and his suit was barely dinged ( it whined a bit when it moved but not much more than that ) . <p> In game terms Iron Man should be converted into Ablative or Resistance . All Ablative sets should likely contain a " Self Restore " power to heal the armour/shield/bubble-gum barrier/whatever on a long recharge . <p> Consultant wrote : Izzy , i agree that the movie-character Iron Man is very close to a blaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had powerful melee attacks ( I miss my Fire/Fire character named Charcoal Blaster ) , they tended to " get dead " very quickly in melee .

I think it going to be a blaster with protection instead of manipulation . If the ranger has a lot less health than the enforcer than it 's still balanced because while the gunner is still resisting damage that still does n't change the fact that he has a lot less health than the melee/protection and said trade off for said self mitigation is that he does n't have as many offensive powers as the hunter or as many team support powers as the striker , still making it balanced without having to add anything else . In other words the gunner may be able to last longer than the other ranger specializations but not as long as the melee/defense enforcer .

As Voldine pointed out Defence is not always Defence , hence why I used Protection . Survivability can use the following : - Resistance ( takes hits , ignores most of the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when one does land it hits hard ) - Ablative ( takes hits for no damage but what is protecting you wears away and once that happens you take the damage . Your protection would regen over time after taking no damage - think forcefields " Shields at 90% , no 70% Capt'n. 40% ! ) - Regen ( Wolverine - ' nuff said ) - Then we have the problem of Iron Man . He gets hit and never takes any real amounts of damage personally . His suit gets hit but he takes no damage so that sounds like Ablative . BUT his armour never really gets hit that much that it wears away . This type of Protection was discussed on the MWM forum and was getting fairly involved by smart people using formula that I just said " OK " to . Iron Man can basically ignore 10 bad guys with normal guns . That 's not Resistance . Its not Avoidance . Its not Regen . Its not Ablative . Even when he gets shot by a Tank in movie 1 ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 for that shot ! ) he did n't get damaged himself , and his suit was barely dinged ( it whined a bit when it moved but not much more than that ) . In game terms Iron Man should be converted into Ablative or Resistance . All Ablative sets should likely contain a " Self Restore " power to heal the armour/shield/bubble-gum barrier/whatever on a long recharge . <p> We always listed him as Protection/Assault who did not take everything in his primary and instead took a lot of tertiaries . <p> " 106465 @qwx726465 106462 @qwx726462 <p> based on admitted assumption that it will be very similar to a CoH Controller which , most would agree including the CoH devs when the game went F2P , that Controllers were not solo-based and had great difficulty in solo content as you did almost no damage by yourself . <p> Some controllers were difficult to solo , others were very good , there was a massive difference between a fire/kin and an ice/FF . <p> Illusion Control was a harsh ride , until level 18 and Phantom Army ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say overall Controller solo-survival often depended on the Secondary .

Making it be an option like the power pools in CoX would solve that and you could still make it so that I can pick one at level one by saying ha I can have only a limited amount of tertiary power sets making waiting to get one later a valid option to play . Maybe by making it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making waiting for one instead of loading up on them as soon as you start the game an even more valid option .

Once you took all the AoE abilities and then thanks to the OI set bonuses for all of the +%damage bonuses it felt monumental .. god knows what it was like on the ' more powerful ' blast types : p <p> I was not aware that they where going to be missing from the launch roster of arch types and I am a little disappointed ; but I understand why this needs to be done if there are difficulties , especially if the ' feel ' for them can be partially taken from the other ranged types available .

But as Cinnder has pointed out the various parties have remained remarkably friendly and generally supportive of each other 's efforts . I only hope that when the time comes when these various groups start to have playable products that might potentially " compete " with each other that the general air of friendliness will continue . <p> As far as CoT alpha testing goes it 'll be up to how MWM decides to scope that out .

Alpha testing ( almost by definition ) involves limited CLOSED testing - I would n't automatically assume they 'll invite just anyone to that .

Closed beta wave access was conferred by donating ten or more to the KS campaign . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be be considered a beta invite as well ? <p> while i 'm at it and before I check the forums ( apologies ) cuz of a time constraint , will the additional funding round also confer eligibility for the mogul secret lair , or was that purely a kickstarter benefit ? <p> I like VO , but something about it ... ca n't put my finger on it ... just do n't have faith in them anymore . <p> It is indeed pre-alpha , but it feels eerily similar to how it did last year ...... really not seeing the progress . <p> Imo , VO may go down the Bounty Hounds Online route , which was in beta for like .. years it seemed .. i see VO being in pre-alpha the same time next year , despite the team aiming for Steam access . Hopefully I am wrong . <p> I understand that building an MMO is a process , imo , they should just shutdown the player testing and work on the game until it is a respectable product . First impressions are everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a lame game . <p> Pains me to say this , but perhaps the DCUO people were right , they do appear too be far behind , as a respectable product . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> There were comments on VO FB and Wordpress by players saying how some " DCUO people " were on twitter stating VO was too far behind to keep up or something to that extent . Could it have been fans ? Idk , devs ? idk . <p> I would not be surprised if this were staff , would not be the first time a dev or DCUO person jumped into the fray . One in particular will occasionally lash back at players ( Not gon na say any names ) , players would also get banned out of dev arnger at times , so it does not shock me . <p> VO does seem pretty far behind though , not gon na lie , considering what it was a year ago , feels the same . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Me three . Did n't know that DCUO had weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense almost all of the updates has been to the back end tech , and almost nothing that utilizes it to such a degree that one notices it . <p> Yea , this is true . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Hello , I 'm new to the forum and I just heard about City of Titans last week . I got to tell you guys I 'm looking forward to this . I 'm picky with MMO 's and only play a select few . I either play MMOs with Movie franchises ( like Lord of The Rings Online , Star Trek Online etc. ) or Superhero MMOs . I 'm currently on Champions Online but am a bit upset at the lack of character customization and limited amount of powers that are free . I 'm excited for this game . Keep up the good work . Now My question has probably been asked before , but What is the basic story synopsis of City of Titans ? <p> To be honest that 's actually a fairly interesting question given what you said about preferring things like movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly specific settings . While much has been developed over the last couple of years to flesh out the general backstory of the CoT game ( you can find this material spread around this forum and the Kickstarter pages ) I think one of CoT 's biggest strengths will be that it actually does n't have an incredibly strict " story synopsis " or worldview that will force you to roleplay in any particular way . <p> One of the biggest problems I have with games like DCUO or Marvel Online is that they force you into playing existing classic characters ( or at least incredibly close clones to existing characters ) . I have no problem with Batman or the Incredible Hulk as characters - I think they 're awesome . But when I play MMOs I 'd much rather play my OWN characters that I created . To me there 's no comparison between creating my own superheroes and being forced into playing characters some old comic book guy created 50+ years ago . <p> One of the greatest strengths of City of Heroes ( the game that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor " of ) was its generalized setting which allowed players a huge amount of freedom to play and develop the stories and characters they wanted to have . Sure CoH had its own backstory and cast of NPCs but those things were only there to enhance your own creativity . In simple terms CoH did n't force you to have to accept any of its lore if you did n't want to . Hopefully CoT will follow in that model . <p> CoT is also expected to have a very strong character/costume creator and an alignment system which will be flexible in terms of hero versus villain styles of play . If it follows in CoH 's footsteps these things should allow an unprecedented degree of freedom to essentially " do your own thing " storywise . <p> CaptainSabalan wrote : What is the basic story synopsis of City of Titans ? <p> I think one of CoT 's biggest strengths will be that it actually does n't have an incredibly strict " story synopsis " or worldview that will force you to roleplay in any particular way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCUO or Marvel Online is that they force you into playing existing classic characters ( or at least incredibly close clones to existing characters ) .

Having a strict storyline is fine to me in like Lord Of The Rings Online or Star Trek Online , but I guess having more freedom storywise in a Superhero MMO is actually a good idea . That way I could at least in a way make my own Superhero AND his own story . Very good point . I 'd still like to learn a bit more about the lore in City of Titans .

Thanks for the reply <p> Well in the past two years or so the Devs of CoT have released a large amount of " lore/story " content on both this website and on the CoT Kickstarter page . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted and discussed and information on many of the " notable NPCs " have been covered . <p> Many people use bits and pieces of this lore to provide background for their own characters . Obviously some people like to model their characters very closely to this material while others choose their own path . Either way good luck and welcome to the game . : ) <p> Many people use bits and pieces of this lore to provide background for their own characters . Obviously some people like to model their characters very closely to this material while others choose their own path . Either way good luck and welcome to the game . : ) <p> They waited till they had something players could actually see and test , even if it is just pre-alpha , before asking for money , aka kickstarter . Unfortunately , by then , most everyone had already gave their money to CoT ... $678,189 to be exact . Nearly two years later , there is still nothing for players to test . It is what it is ... I just really feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as I figured after looking at the production screens , the art style is VERY DCUO and features overly shiny costume pieces and cool-ish areas that suffer because of extreme shininess and color intensity . IMO , I rarely like anything with more color intensity than WoW ( very few exceptions ) . So .. yeah , was going to pass at first . Now just going to avoid unless it 's the only option . <p> Decided to try the alpha .

CoH had a good limit to how shiny its metal could be and Champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that share its weird light source ) . <p> This is a simple example that highlights having more choices is pretty much always better . Depending on the situation ( or particular character I 'm playing ) I sometimes prefer glossy color options and other times more matte colors . I could see where if a game heavily favored one over the other it would become annoyingly noticeable . <p> One case I recall from CoH was especially irksome : It had basic matte versions of " tights " for every major body area ( top , pants bottom , bikini bottom , gloves and boots ) . It also had a " shiny " version of tights , but only for the top and pants bottom . This meant you could never use the shiny items with matching gloves , boots or bikini bottoms ( to make complete shiny leotard-type outfits ) . For some reason the CoH Devs never bothered to finish giving us the rest of the " shiny " parts for that even after 8.5 years . *sigh* <p> I 'm optimistic that the texturing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have full " shiny " or " not shiny " options as we choose . <p> I am no developer , but not sure they are ready . Has anyone played the pre-alpha ? It is far from a resemblance of a game , it feels 19% complete imo . Not sure what they can do in a few months to justify moving to Steam , as I mentioned before , the game feels pretty much the same from the 2014 version , with a few minor model changes . <p> The worst thing they can do is to put the product on Steam ; first impressions matter , knowing what I do about their developmental process and their definition of " progress " this game will be shot down after the Steam release . <p> There just is n't enough in that game , nor am I convinced they can change that in the coming months , cause the game feels the same from a year ago . Hopefully I am wrong . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> An alpha test is normally understood to be " feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , since the purpose is to test these very game play mechanics . If you 're looking for assets , i.e. completed zones and missions , etc. , then you 'll have to wait for their beta . An alpha really does n't require more than one or two test zones . <p> Someone posted this on Steam Greenlight VO discussion LONG ... Huuuuge difference from VO pre-alpha , and this pre-alpha . DCUO pre-alpha resembled a incomplete game . VO 's pre-alpha resembles something too far off to even be an incomplete game . Their progress is extremely slow , not convinced they will suddenly put a foot on the gas and implement A1 features . Tons of steam games are in the Early stages but feels like a game nonetheless , VO does not feel like anything , its awful atm . <p> Kind of agree with this . Besides the occasional Facebook posts that do show graphical improvements , as far a complete game the only thing that strangely keeps me a little positive is that they do not give any hard timelines . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on for another year ( and may need to ) before we get something resembling a complete game . Once they get their new website up ( which was supposed to be up a while ago ) , it will be interesting if the dev/player interaction increases . As far my experience , it appeared more active when they had their own forums on the old site . I just hope their pre-planning and current planning has laid out a path they can follow to completion because from what I 've seen , though woefully incomplete , I want this game to make it to a live state . With the move to Unity 5 , getting the senior animator on board and working out design with other former Paragon devs , there is too much positive I do n't want to see disappear into limbo . <p> Supposedly , there is a " Big Announcement " coming up . This is laughable to me , because the game is indeed too far behind to announce anything worthwhile . I pretty much gave up on Valiance . Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Crowdfunding option is not a huge surprise if you have been following them long enough . You could donate on the old site and some of us ( myself included ) asked about continuing funding and also making sure we still get the credit for our previous funding . If they stick to the previous offering , your donated funds can be used , via a point system , in a special backer store . Now if the crowdfunding is referencing a possible second Kickstarter ( hopefully successful this time ) then that is more of a big announcement imo . They better have some excellent gameplay to show if they want to have a successful KS campaign this time around . <p> This is a simple example that highlights having more choices is pretty much always better . Depending on the situation ( or particular character I 'm playing ) I sometimes prefer glossy color options and other times more matte colors . I could see where if a game heavily favored one over the other it would become annoyingly noticeable .

For some reason the CoH Devs never bothered to finish giving us the rest of the " shiny " parts for that even after 8.5 years . *sigh* I 'm optimistic that the texturing that 's been shown for CoT will allow us the ability to have full " shiny " or " not shiny " options as we choose . <p> One would hope so , given that even under " old style " ( pre-UE4 , non-PBR ) stuff " shiny " basically meant having a relatively high peak specular reflection aligned to the viewing axis , with a fairly sharp drop-off as the angle increased , and that is the sort of thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as UE3 did ) . <p> UE4 , their page on PBR gives a very good set of examples on " what is shiny and why " when dealing with physical based rendering -- but it means that in theory so long as the material is defined similarly , you can make any costume piece out of it and it should Just Look Right(tm) . <p> While theory and reality do n't always cross paths , the things that drive " shiny " ( or lack thereof ) are all pretty fundamental-level optics , so you kind of have to support them well to get anything more complex working at all . <p> I actually do n't  care for an exact release date . I 'm the kind of guy that gets happy when i see Any Real progress .. does n't matter which department either . But i 'll admit I find 3D more intriguing to work with , and learn much more about . <p> I myself am playing with Unity 3D and trying to optimize the tools that allows others to make UI 's .. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to only perform a single Draw/Pass call . And I finally have it doing that now , but it took me months more that I predicted . : P <p> So I understand that many of the Devs think that its gon na be a heck of allot easier to roll back and redo things right now , then trying to do it once the game is up and running for all . I 'm on the Devs side as far as that goes . But , I 'll like to draw the line at a certain set of features , so feature creep is n't always looming . But , if one of the features postponed for a later version might directly affect one of the features in the current release version(s) , it 's a good idea to go back and reCode the Base Feature to allow for the future Feature to work when its added in the next release .. instead of leaving it all for the next version . That 's not how business works though , when deadlines loom . : / But the Devs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that work in their favor , since most of the deadlines are Soft . : ) Caveat is , Not All backers will agree to this POV of always having Soft Deadlines . Only 60% or so ? ! ? : P <p> And yes , Right Now , I ONLY care what the backers impressions are . Since they will be the ones that will fund the next KS or the like . To please the majority of us , MWM does n't HAVE to release the AB right now , but just SHOW Progress ! Us KS backers just need the Good FEELz of Real Progress ! ; ) <p> VO has been quiet for quite some time . Apparently , they are working on getting a new server . Comments have been removed from the " Official site . " Those on the FB page are worried , no response or peep out of the devs . Nobody has been able to contact anyone , nor are they replying . The fans are saying " Its over " while the devs stay quiet . <p> Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? Albeit it may be what we want to hear , but nonetheless , keeping us posted . VO players have been left out to dry on numerous occasions , this does not appear to be the first time . There is nothing wrong with being mum , but they want players to be part of the developmental process , hence i suppose they could tell them a little something ? I do n't know . <p> I think the demise of VO is exaggerated , but would not surprise me . Their progress has been nonexistent . They post notes of a huge update , but every time I play it , there is a " meh " feel . VO does not have a professional feel to it , ya know ? <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> This is why we make so few promises . Except very broad ones , which are sorta the minimum requirement . No , we do n't tell you what you want to hear , we tell you what we can be honest about . Trying to make too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this stage , we could only undermine faith for the future . <p> That said , Valiance 's pre-alpha was , even officially , more like pre-pre-alpha . <p> Guess we should be happy the CoT devs are actually communicating with us ? Albeit it may be what we want to hear , but nonetheless , keeping us posted . VO players have been left out to dry on numerous occasions , this does not appear to be the first time . <p> This is something of a yes-and-no . Of course we should be happy to have members of MWM willing to engage with us so frequently ( and to such an extent ) . However , going silent for three or more weeks - holiday season or not - is some seriously bad mojo . Surely someone could scrape together half a minute to post something like , " Sorry , we 're going to have to put our noses to the grind stone so you may not hear much for a few weeks . " After all , Twitter was practically made for stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something a business can ill afford to do , in this day and age . Especially if it comes on the heels of a " major announcement " . <p> Someone stated that they are in the midst of a " HUGE " announcement soon . Lol ...... well .... let 's see , judging from their track record , expect the same state of the game from this time last year . I am in " Believe it when I see it mode " with these guys . Unless they did a complete re-haul , VO is not a promising project . They keep putting their foot in their mouth with these false promises . i do n't mean " Releasing on X date " but rather , they really feel like progress is being made , promising huge updates only to deliver a similar pre-pre-alpha feel . <p> Also , that " Soon " crap the VO devs keep throwing out there as a joke was was never funny . VO 's progress is funny , a joke . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Agreed . They have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha in my opinion . At first it was one map that looked almost like a clone of Atlas Park . Then it became a ... big , larger map with ugly buildings that was just a total mess . The lack of communication to me is like the game has died before it was born . I still have faith for this project due to the blunt honesty and communication . Rushing to show something in the way I 've seen VO do is just .. an utter mistake . <p> I like VO . I think my biggest issue is/was with their engine ( I do not like the Unity engine especially not the last gen ) the way i do Unreal . Even DCUO is in Unreal engine and I like the way it mixes realism with comic-ism . <p> Now .. if they want to fall in line ( no more cooks in the kitchen ) and combine the Project Z projects once again behind the vision of CoT .. I would not be mad about it . I 'd rather have one really GREAT game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the collaborative effort of VO and CoT will continue to be appreciated . I do n't know personally what 's going on there but IF they reached a point where they could n't continue development I think they 'd let their community know . <p> I like VO .

I do n't know personally what 's going on there but IF they reached a point where they could n't continue development I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , I am curious how much better Valiance Online will be .. with the very latest version of Unity3D , which has some impressive upgrades . Granted , some of the older shaders VO was using will have to be thrown out and each and every 3D object will have to use the latest shaders , which look amazing from some of the samples i 've seen . All this Just translates to more effort and patience needed to make VO look a little closer to say ... Unreal Engine <p> example : same architecture rendered in each engine . ( this was for the previous version of Unity3D btw ) <p> ... <p> Actually , in the current Unity3D version , you might see more scenes like this : <p> It 's funny . When I see Unity vs Unreal , I always have the same reaction . They both look awesome , but when I see the Unity I think " wow , that looks amazing ! " , and when I see the Unreal ( ironically enough ) , I tend to think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiance all the luck in the world . It 's not a zero sum game . One great game would be good . Two great games would be even better . But I do think , being out front from the beginning , Valiance has taken the chances and inadvertently demonstrated a good bit of what NOT to do . <p> And I get the sense MWM has been paying close attention , and learning . <p> Hmm .. Perhaps it still has hope but I 'm very reserved on that . I had high hopes for it at first but I just do n't know .. Just seemed to get messy ever since they left their original map , not that it was even close to being perfect . Time will tell . They have a great concept in itself and I could care less what engine they are running , I just have n't seen much on the lines of development in anything really . Like they keep trying to remake their entire game for no real reason and are n't sure what they want . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or maybe even year then I might change my opinion since at first it really did seem like it was following the spiritual idea of CoH in gameplay mechanics at the very least . <p> When I discovered these ( VO , CoT and H&amp;V ) little over a year ago it looked like VO was the one that had progressed the most because I erroneously mistook having a playable version out with progress . Over time though it certainly looks like CoT is the most progressed one , especially after VO shut down most communication . Have n't really kept tabs on H&amp;V but a quick look over does n't put it ahead of CoT . <p> I think the biggest mistake VO has done was to put out a publicly accessible client before settling on the underlying technology . Redoing many of the underlying technologies ( animation system , character creator and so on ) and not having all of them properly done ( no proper travel , activatable passives , no CC or proper debuffs/buffs , dodgeable heals and many more ) while having a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add to that how long they have dragged out Soontm for their big announcement ( what , 5-6 months ? ) and that they " removed " their existing site before having a proper replacement and it certainly have n't gained them any bonus points . <p> When I discovered these ( VO , CoT and H&amp;V ) little over a year ago it looked like VO was the one that had progressed the most because I erroneously mistook having a playable version out with progress .

They are in alpha testing stages from what can be seen on their site . Will you folks be offering Alpha testing ? As well as beta that everyone asks about . Also are you folks working with them at all or have you considered it ? <p> We are well aware of them and actually posted their latest update on our social media . They 're going in a different direction to us , reskinning a fantasy game they were already making . I 'm not sure they claim to be THE spiritual successor , but we both claim to be A spiritual successor . <p> They are doing good work over there , but it 's definitely a different direction than CoT is going . And they seem very clear that they are " a " spiritual successor , not " the " . I 'm here on these forums because I personally like the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spiritual successors ( there is at least one other ) coming together and working together is tantalizing , but at this point it seems highly unlikely to say the least , so hopefully the friendly competition will make them all better . <p> Are you aware that there is another company or group of folks claiming to be the successor to CoH/CoV ? http : //valiance.shogn.net/ aka Valiance Online .

Also are you folks working with them at all or have you considered it ? <p> After we got the news back in 2012 that NCsoft was shutting CoH down there were groups of players/fans who did what they could to either try to get NCsoft to reconsider their decision or even attempt to buy/license the property from NCsoft to keep it going . When it became clear none of that was going to happen people started coming to terms with the idea of creating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know all the details over the following months , but it did n't take too long for the various groups involved to split into at least three different efforts ; MWM being one of the three groups , the Valiance Online folks being another . On one hand it 's kind of unfortunate that the collective creative post-CoH community has become split into these various factions - obviously it would have been more useful if everyone could have become united behind one single project . But as Cinnder has pointed out the various parties have remained remarkably friendly and generally supportive of each other 's efforts . I only hope that when the time comes when these various groups start to have playable products that might potentially " compete " with each other that the general air of friendliness will continue . <p> As far as CoT alpha testing goes it 'll be up to how MWM decides to scope that out . There 's no hard or fixed rules about how any software developers must test their products so it 'll be up to MWM to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open they 'll be for it . It 's likely they 'll do plenty of what they 'll call " alpha testing " but only invite a few key people in for closed sessions . It means that " average " potential players like you and me might only get to be involved once beta testing begins . Alpha testing ( almost by definition ) involves limited CLOSED testing - I would n't automatically assume they 'll invite just anyone to that . I doubt even being a Kickstart supporter will be enough to grant access for most of us . Again it 'll mostly depend on what MWM wants to do and what kind of testing they want to label as " alpha " , " beta " or anything in-between . <p> valiance seems to be a mere digital unpgrade of the orginal coh game . but i would prefer by a vast margin the option to have more realistic graphics . it has been like 4 generations of tech since coh went live . they seem to be going almost the exact route for powers too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions online tried for the cartoony look , and it flopped , along with star trek online . <p> wildstar is still to early to tell if the cartoony look will fail . world of warcraft pulled it off for all those people using poo computers . but even a bad modern computer is far more powerful now . <p> i want advanced dungeons and dragons . not basic set . <p> " <p> What a man thinks of himself , that is what determines , or rather indicates , his fate . - Henry David Thoreau <p> Ill be in my new home at that stage and with a 50/20 or 100/40 Mbps Internet plan ( depending on when the Closed Betas will be ) .

He pointed out ( as has Shadow Elusive ) that the main sticking point , at present , is the rig ( i.e. the skeleton , I believe ) . <p> Personally , I will most likely stick with whichever one refuses to sell out to free to play models that penny pinch for every little item in game . I am an old school 15 a month guy , I tend to stick with what I am comfortable with , you know ? <p> Sorry to bump this old thread , but just wanted to say that the Valiance kickstarter really impressed me - they have already made considerable progress ! I hope that if the kickstarter fails then there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mixture of CoT 's lore and Valiance 's gameplay/worldbuilding teams would speed up development considerably . I understand they 're different projects but I am really impressed with how good Valiance is looking even in pre-alpha . <p> Valiance had a head start when they chose to build a Superhero MMO . They were already an active studio have an inhouse Engine that they could modifie . As well as all the physical equipment needed . So that 's one reason they got an active Alpha running and being great people they opened the door for us . <p> There was talk at the start to see if the two projects could become one . It did n't work some of the things MWM wants to do there engine could n't handle . Then there the whole mass Volunteer membership of the CoT and they being an established business . <p> " 106451 @qwx726451 <p> I 'm not super confident that the Valiance kickstarter will be successful , but I chipped in as much as I could to help . I hope that the two projects can work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll more than likely play both but Valiance seems like it 's going to be very RP-friendly . <p> Just to be fair , Valiance essentially licensed the engine . They are n't the same team that 's working on the other MMO . They are however part of a network partnership . Either way , they 're working hard to make a great game . <p> Are they using Unity3D still ? Rapid Application/Prototype development seems to go allot faster in it . Plus , if you do n't  have allot of time to devote on developing a new feature yourself , there 's always the Assets Store . ; ) <p> But Unity3D had some issues with Morph Targets , which might still be present . ( have not check as of late ) , but I hope to see Unity3D version 5 ( after a few minor releases ) really start making more waves . <p> If I could get into even a buggy as all get-out low rez playtest prototype just to give feedback on a few features , I would be happy at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't really set up for a computer KB+mouse , and is n't very good IMO on story and creative input , as it is set in the DC Universe , so ... And Champions Online never was anything like the P&amp;P game , it gave little customization options , and , did n't " port over " the P&amp;P character setup . Content was also really limited ... IMO , this world ( IRL ) desperately needs the hero morality emphasis that CoX had being an alternative to the current PvP " Neutral Evil ( AD&amp;D alignment ) " mentality that seems to dominate the gaming world . We need a better set of morals being encouraged for the minds of the future ... That is what made the CoX game so much fun for me as I got to interact with others at least acting out the morality of a comic book hero .

We really do need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if Trekkies can make the tablet , PDA , and flip phone possible , what could a future inventor make real ? <p> I remember pretty clearly , when CoH announced the closure . Several groups - the gal with the overuse of emoticons , whose handle escapes me , she was pretty good at making comics with her avatar , the folks from the Titan Network were essentially one group that divided into two groups - and then maybe a week or so after , the Valiance Online guys made their pitch , explaining that they were a year or so into development and hoping for support . Some welcomed them , others like myself found it a bit too opportunistic , but that 's me being old and grumpy . <p> I did ultimately download their beta , and have tried it once - only a few npc 's about .

We 've been given the chance to play the game long before it would normally be available for people to play . A lot of the things you have problems with can , and will , change long before it even makes it into an alpha state , much less a beta state . <p> For instance , the interface will be getting an overhaul soon . They 've been previewing pieces of that for over a month now . And that 's likely to not be the only overhaul it gets before launch as they gather feedback from the players that choose to give it . It also wo n't have all the options for scaling and customization that it 's likely to have to launch . I 'd be very surprised to see those go in before they 've settled on something close to their final look . <p> For costume options , there 's very few available , and for good reason . They 've been through 3 different character models since I started playing it alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The female model had some serious issues , and only just made it back in their most recent build . They 're not going to give more than a couple of sample options while the model is still undergoing such heavy revision . That said , they have said that they 're going to start adding more customization in the next few builds , so I 'd start looking at that . <p> As far as the account thing goes , sometimes they have to wipe accounts due to changes in the character creation process , or changes in the account backend . It sucks , but again ... this is a pre-alpha , play at your own risk game . And , if you 're watching their Twitter , they usually warn when they 're going to wipe accounts . <p> At the moment , the server is only up when they need feedback . They 're making some pretty hefty changes in that downtime . This , again , to be expected of a pre-alpha game . Also , if you do n't give -them- feedback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you have ! VO 's still got a long way to go , but it 's getting somewhere . <p> This , again , to be expected of a pre-alpha game .

VO 's still got a long way to go , but it 's getting somewhere . <p> ... and we 'll eventually be going through this process over here and it will be just as fraught with these same typical development problems . So we might as well be mentally prepared . <p> In both games we 're seeing how the sausage is made--which is only for those with the stomach for it : P. <p> I understand that but I do feel like they 've made some bad decisions . The tiny interface is more than an annoyance it 's a serious problem The complex costumes should wait till later . K.I.S.S . I do believe that they contribute to lag . As for letting us know through Twitter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least now I know that 's not a mistake . So I 'm cool with it . The biggest mistake is the incredibly long down time gaps . It 's not just that I 'm eager to play , or that I 'm gung ho to overwhelm you with constant feedback , but how are you going to build a community if we ca n't even log on ? ( Weird comment coming from me but I know it matters to a lot of other people ) It 's very frustrating . Seriously , there have been several times when I thought the game had folded . One last thing : the buildings in the game look weird in a way that makes it seem like I 'm not on earth , or not in the present day anyway .

Fully expect to make that deadline . <p> Now , to answer the one part of the OP that our magnificent community has not already addressed : no , we wo n't be doing open alpha testing .

One in particular will occasionally lash back at players ( Not gon na say any names ) , players would also get banned out of dev arnger at times , so it does not shock me . <p> VO does seem pretty far behind though , not gon na lie , considering what it was a year ago , feels the same . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Me three .

I got to tell you guys I 'm looking forward to this . I 'm picky with MMO 's and only play a select few . I either play MMOs with Movie franchises ( like Lord of The Rings Online , Star Trek Online etc. ) or Superhero MMOs . I 'm currently on Champions Online but am a bit upset at the lack of character customization and limited amount of powers that are free . I 'm excited for this game . Keep up the good work . Now My question has probably been asked before , but What is the basic story synopsis of City of Titans ? <p> To be honest that 's actually a fairly interesting question given what you said about preferring things like movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly specific settings . While much has been developed over the last couple of years to flesh out the general backstory of the CoT game ( you can find this material spread around this forum and the Kickstarter pages ) I think one of CoT 's biggest strengths will be that it actually does n't have an incredibly strict " story synopsis " or worldview that will force you to roleplay in any particular way . <p> One of the biggest problems I have with games like DCUO or Marvel Online is that they force you into playing existing classic characters ( or at least incredibly close clones to existing characters ) . I have no problem with Batman or the Incredible Hulk as characters - I think they 're awesome . But when I play MMOs I 'd much rather play my OWN characters that I created . To me there 's no comparison between creating my own superheroes and being forced into playing characters some old comic book guy created 50+ years ago . <p> One of the greatest strengths of City of Heroes ( the game that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor " of ) was its generalized setting which allowed players a huge amount of freedom to play and develop the stories and characters they wanted to have . Sure CoH had its own backstory and cast of NPCs but those things were only there to enhance your own creativity . In simple terms CoH did n't force you to have to accept any of its lore if you did n't want to . Hopefully CoT will follow in that model . <p> CoT is also expected to have a very strong character/costume creator and an alignment system which will be flexible in terms of hero versus villain styles of play . If it follows in CoH 's footsteps these things should allow an unprecedented degree of freedom to essentially " do your own thing " storywise . <p> CaptainSabalan wrote : What is the basic story synopsis of City of Titans ? <p> I think one of CoT 's biggest strengths will be that it actually does n't have an incredibly strict " story synopsis " or worldview that will force you to roleplay in any particular way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCUO or Marvel Online is that they force you into playing existing classic characters ( or at least incredibly close clones to existing characters ) .

Having a strict storyline is fine to me in like Lord Of The Rings Online or Star Trek Online , but I guess having more freedom storywise in a Superhero MMO is actually a good idea . That way I could at least in a way make my own Superhero AND his own story . Very good point . I 'd still like to learn a bit more about the lore in City of Titans .

I just really feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as I figured after looking at the production screens , the art style is VERY DCUO and features overly shiny costume pieces and cool-ish areas that suffer because of extreme shininess and color intensity .

Depending on the situation ( or particular character I 'm playing ) I sometimes prefer glossy color options and other times more matte colors . I could see where if a game heavily favored one over the other it would become annoyingly noticeable . <p> One case I recall from CoH was especially irksome : It had basic matte versions of " tights " for every major body area ( top , pants bottom , bikini bottom , gloves and boots ) . It also had a " shiny " version of tights , but only for the top and pants bottom . This meant you could never use the shiny items with matching gloves , boots or bikini bottoms ( to make complete shiny leotard-type outfits ) . For some reason the CoH Devs never bothered to finish giving us the rest of the " shiny " parts for that even after 8.5 years . *sigh* <p> I 'm optimistic that the texturing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have full " shiny " or " not shiny " options as we choose . <p> I am no developer , but not sure they are ready . Has anyone played the pre-alpha ? It is far from a resemblance of a game , it feels 19% complete imo . Not sure what they can do in a few months to justify moving to Steam , as I mentioned before , the game feels pretty much the same from the 2014 version , with a few minor model changes . <p> The worst thing they can do is to put the product on Steam ; first impressions matter , knowing what I do about their developmental process and their definition of " progress " this game will be shot down after the Steam release . <p> There just is n't enough in that game , nor am I convinced they can change that in the coming months , cause the game feels the same from a year ago . Hopefully I am wrong . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> An alpha test is normally understood to be " feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , since the purpose is to test these very game play mechanics . If you 're looking for assets , i.e. completed zones and missions , etc. , then you 'll have to wait for their beta . An alpha really does n't require more than one or two test zones . <p> Someone posted this on Steam Greenlight VO discussion LONG ... Huuuuge difference from VO pre-alpha , and this pre-alpha . DCUO pre-alpha resembled a incomplete game . VO 's pre-alpha resembles something too far off to even be an incomplete game . Their progress is extremely slow , not convinced they will suddenly put a foot on the gas and implement A1 features . Tons of steam games are in the Early stages but feels like a game nonetheless , VO does not feel like anything , its awful atm . <p> Kind of agree with this . Besides the occasional Facebook posts that do show graphical improvements , as far a complete game the only thing that strangely keeps me a little positive is that they do not give any hard timelines . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on for another year ( and may need to ) before we get something resembling a complete game . Once they get their new website up ( which was supposed to be up a while ago ) , it will be interesting if the dev/player interaction increases . As far my experience , it appeared more active when they had their own forums on the old site . I just hope their pre-planning and current planning has laid out a path they can follow to completion because from what I 've seen , though woefully incomplete , I want this game to make it to a live state . With the move to Unity 5 , getting the senior animator on board and working out design with other former Paragon devs , there is too much positive I do n't want to see disappear into limbo . <p> Supposedly , there is a " Big Announcement " coming up . This is laughable to me , because the game is indeed too far behind to announce anything worthwhile . I pretty much gave up on Valiance . Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Crowdfunding option is not a huge surprise if you have been following them long enough . You could donate on the old site and some of us ( myself included ) asked about continuing funding and also making sure we still get the credit for our previous funding . If they stick to the previous offering , your donated funds can be used , via a point system , in a special backer store . Now if the crowdfunding is referencing a possible second Kickstarter ( hopefully successful this time ) then that is more of a big announcement imo . They better have some excellent gameplay to show if they want to have a successful KS campaign this time around . <p> This is a simple example that highlights having more choices is pretty much always better . Depending on the situation ( or particular character I 'm playing ) I sometimes prefer glossy color options and other times more matte colors . I could see where if a game heavily favored one over the other it would become annoyingly noticeable . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had basic matte versions of " tights " for every major body area ( top , pants bottom , bikini bottom , gloves and boots ) . It also had a " shiny " version of tights , but only for the top and pants bottom . This meant you could never use the shiny items with matching gloves , boots or bikini bottoms ( to make complete shiny leotard-type outfits ) . For some reason the CoH Devs never bothered to finish giving us the rest of the " shiny " parts for that even after 8.5 years . *sigh* I 'm optimistic that the texturing that 's been shown for CoT will allow us the ability to have full " shiny " or " not shiny " options as we choose . <p> One would hope so , given that even under " old style " ( pre-UE4 , non-PBR ) stuff " shiny " basically meant having a relatively high peak specular reflection aligned to the viewing axis , with a fairly sharp drop-off as the angle increased , and that is the sort of thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as UE3 did ) . <p> UE4 , their page on PBR gives a very good set of examples on " what is shiny and why " when dealing with physical based rendering -- but it means that in theory so long as the material is defined similarly , you can make any costume piece out of it and it should Just Look Right(tm) . <p> While theory and reality do n't always cross paths , the things that drive " shiny " ( or lack thereof ) are all pretty fundamental-level optics , so you kind of have to support them well to get anything more complex working at all . <p> I actually do n't  care for an exact release date . I 'm the kind of guy that gets happy when i see Any Real progress .. does n't matter which department either . But i 'll admit I find 3D more intriguing to work with , and learn much more about . <p> I myself am playing with Unity 3D and trying to optimize the tools that allows others to make UI 's .. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to only perform a single Draw/Pass call . And I finally have it doing that now , but it took me months more that I predicted . : P <p> So I understand that many of the Devs think that its gon na be a heck of allot easier to roll back and redo things right now , then trying to do it once the game is up and running for all . I 'm on the Devs side as far as that goes . But , I 'll like to draw the line at a certain set of features , so feature creep is n't always looming . But , if one of the features postponed for a later version might directly affect one of the features in the current release version(s) , it 's a good idea to go back and reCode the Base Feature to allow for the future Feature to work when its added in the next release .. instead of leaving it all for the next version . That 's not how business works though , when deadlines loom . : / But the Devs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that work in their favor , since most of the deadlines are Soft . : ) Caveat is , Not All backers will agree to this POV of always having Soft Deadlines . Only 60% or so ? ! ? : P <p> And yes , Right Now , I ONLY care what the backers impressions are . Since they will be the ones that will fund the next KS or the like . To please the majority of us , MWM does n't HAVE to release the AB right now , but just SHOW Progress ! Us KS backers just need the Good FEELz of Real Progress ! ; ) <p> VO has been quiet for quite some time . Apparently , they are working on getting a new server . Comments have been removed from the " Official site . " Those on the FB page are worried , no response or peep out of the devs . Nobody has been able to contact anyone , nor are they replying . The fans are saying " Its over " while the devs stay quiet . <p> Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? Albeit it may be what we want to hear , but nonetheless , keeping us posted . VO players have been left out to dry on numerous occasions , this does not appear to be the first time . There is nothing wrong with being mum , but they want players to be part of the developmental process , hence i suppose they could tell them a little something ? I do n't know . <p> I think the demise of VO is exaggerated , but would not surprise me . Their progress has been nonexistent . They post notes of a huge update , but every time I play it , there is a " meh " feel . VO does not have a professional feel to it , ya know ? <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> This is why we make so few promises . Except very broad ones , which are sorta the minimum requirement . No , we do n't tell you what you want to hear , we tell you what we can be honest about . Trying to make too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this stage , we could only undermine faith for the future . <p> That said , Valiance 's pre-alpha was , even officially , more like pre-pre-alpha . <p> Guess we should be happy the CoT devs are actually communicating with us ? Albeit it may be what we want to hear , but nonetheless , keeping us posted . VO players have been left out to dry on numerous occasions , this does not appear to be the first time . <p> This is something of a yes-and-no . Of course we should be happy to have members of MWM willing to engage with us so frequently ( and to such an extent ) . However , going silent for three or more weeks - holiday season or not - is some seriously bad mojo . Surely someone could scrape together half a minute to post something like , " Sorry , we 're going to have to put our noses to the grind stone so you may not hear much for a few weeks . " After all , Twitter was practically made for stuff like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something a business can ill afford to do , in this day and age . Especially if it comes on the heels of a " major announcement " . <p> Someone stated that they are in the midst of a " HUGE " announcement soon . Lol ...... well .... let 's see , judging from their track record , expect the same state of the game from this time last year . I am in " Believe it when I see it mode " with these guys . Unless they did a complete re-haul , VO is not a promising project . They keep putting their foot in their mouth with these false promises . i do n't mean " Releasing on X date " but rather , they really feel like progress is being made , promising huge updates only to deliver a similar pre-pre-alpha feel . <p> Also , that " Soon " crap the VO devs keep throwing out there as a joke was was never funny . VO 's progress is funny , a joke . <p> " 106453 @qwx726453 <p> Agreed . They have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha in my opinion . At first it was one map that looked almost like a clone of Atlas Park . Then it became a ... big , larger map with ugly buildings that was just a total mess . The lack of communication to me is like the game has died before it was born . I still have faith for this project due to the blunt honesty and communication . Rushing to show something in the way I 've seen VO do is just .. an utter mistake . <p> I like VO . I think my biggest issue is/was with their engine ( I do not like the Unity engine especially not the last gen ) the way i do Unreal . Even DCUO is in Unreal engine and I like the way it mixes realism with comic-ism . <p> Now .. if they want to fall in line ( no more cooks in the kitchen ) and combine the Project Z projects once again behind the vision of CoT .. I would not be mad about it . I 'd rather have one really GREAT game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the collaborative effort of VO and CoT will continue to be appreciated . I do n't know personally what 's going on there but IF they reached a point where they could n't continue development I think they 'd let their community know . <p> I like VO .

I do n't know personally what 's going on there but IF they reached a point where they could n't continue development I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , I am curious how much better Valiance Online will be .. with the very latest version of Unity3D , which has some impressive upgrades . Granted , some of the older shaders VO was using will have to be thrown out and each and every 3D object will have to use the latest shaders , which look amazing from some of the samples i 've seen . All this Just translates to more effort and patience needed to make VO look a little closer to say ... Unreal Engine <p> example : same architecture rendered in each engine . ( this was for the previous version of Unity3D btw ) <p> ... <p> Actually , in the current Unity3D version , you might see more scenes like this : <p> It 's funny . When I see Unity vs Unreal , I always have the same reaction . They both look awesome , but when I see the Unity I think " wow , that looks amazing ! " , and when I see the Unreal ( ironically enough ) , I tend to think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valiance all the luck in the world . It 's not a zero sum game . One great game would be good . Two great games would be even better . But I do think , being out front from the beginning , Valiance has taken the chances and inadvertently demonstrated a good bit of what NOT to do . <p> And I get the sense MWM has been paying close attention , and learning . <p> Hmm .. Perhaps it still has hope but I 'm very reserved on that . I had high hopes for it at first but I just do n't know .. Just seemed to get messy ever since they left their original map , not that it was even close to being perfect . Time will tell . They have a great concept in itself and I could care less what engine they are running , I just have n't seen much on the lines of development in anything really . Like they keep trying to remake their entire game for no real reason and are n't sure what they want . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or maybe even year then I might change my opinion since at first it really did seem like it was following the spiritual idea of CoH in gameplay mechanics at the very least . <p> When I discovered these ( VO , CoT and H&amp;V ) little over a year ago it looked like VO was the one that had progressed the most because I erroneously mistook having a playable version out with progress . Over time though it certainly looks like CoT is the most progressed one , especially after VO shut down most communication . Have n't really kept tabs on H&amp;V but a quick look over does n't put it ahead of CoT . <p> I think the biggest mistake VO has done was to put out a publicly accessible client before settling on the underlying technology . Redoing many of the underlying technologies ( animation system , character creator and so on ) and not having all of them properly done ( no proper travel , activatable passives , no CC or proper debuffs/buffs , dodgeable heals and many more ) while having a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Add to that how long they have dragged out Soontm for their big announcement ( what , 5-6 months ? ) and that they " removed " their existing site before having a proper replacement and it certainly have n't gained them any bonus points . <p> When I discovered these ( VO , CoT and H&amp;V ) little over a year ago it looked like VO was the one that had progressed the most because I erroneously mistook having a playable version out with progress .

@@79253462 @753462/ <h> uses for a base <p> Some thoughts on things we 'd do with an SG base or personal lair , most of which are not new , but feel free to add any of your own thoughts . <p> 1 . Travel faster : you use the base as a way to get form point A to point B faster than walking . COX had teleporters , you could do that , or have super vehicles that accomplish something similar in various ways , with the vehicle being static furniture and doing cutscenes , like the choppers in CoX , etc . <p> 2 . Inventory space : you can store more stuff in the long term because you have inventory slots that the base gives you , but you can only access them from the base . <p> 3 . Crafting : making stuff requires tools , you 'd keep them in the base . <p> 4 . Missions : the base might have a Trouble Alert Monitor that you can get missions off of . <p> 5 . Communications : maybe you get map , inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and shows the current state of the world map , like where Babbage is , whether or not the Hamidon is up , etc. plus you might have a SG chat channel that the base unlocks for you in some way , like you have to build a SG radio antenna or launch a satellite to make that work . <p> 6 . Medical care : You can respawn at the base instead of the hospital , assuming there 's a reason you 'd want to . Maybe the base has travel options that get you back to the mission you 're in faster . <p> 7 . PvP arena : maybe you can spar with other SG members in a Danger Room type deal that allows you to fight other heroes in " simulated " combat . Maybe you can even just programm it for one person to try to measure your combat effectiveness , like DPS , etc . <p> 8 . MIDs build analyzer : maybe the you can look at your build using the base 's diagnostic computer system and use that to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Add in a Danger Room , from which members of the guild can access certain player made missions - virtual combat sims , guild member created missions tailored for the SG , and RP missions designed for the SG . <p> In GW2 the Ranger class has a mechanic where you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions . I do n't really care about that , but it got me thinking , what if you could convince different NPCs to work with you in such a way that you eventually see them walking around your SG base giving you missions and stuff ? <p> Like if you do enough of Doctor Science 's missions , you eventually unlock him/her as an NPC that would appears in your SG base or personal lair from time to time , at upon beign summoned , and they might have a mission for you every so often . <p> You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions .

Like if you do enough of Doctor Science 's missions , you eventually unlock him/her as an NPC that would appears in your SG base or personal lair from time to time , at upon beign summoned , and they might have a mission for you every so often . You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . <p> Personally I would base that off of reputation since you have to work up some form of trust for this to happen . Sure you wo n't be able to " collect ' em all " but it does n't really make sense that NPC from a faction that has you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your base to give you missions . <p> In regards to 8 . If that is to just pre-load a progression path that you have selected manually that just says " do/take " at each level then it 's perfectly fine . If it actually generates builds in accordance to some input then I 'm not so sure . <p> As for adding more ideas . I would add mannequins not only for being able to have my costumes on display but also as a form of secondary storage for them , as in I would be able to exchange/load what is on the mannequin with what I have in one of my " costume slots " on the character . Maybe having a cheap one for display only and a more expensive one ( cash store only ? ) that also includes the exchange option . <p> Dynamic testing/training area so one can test a build and see how it performs under certain circumstances . Ideally you would be able to select from a number of different scenarios , including if it 's offensive or defensive in nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions .

You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . As Laston , the player behind Doctor Science on Freedom server passed away recently , this post actually hit me a bit hard . <p> Condolences . I was referring to Steven Sheridan in Brix , the NPC also known as Dr. Science in the game lore . I meant no disrespect . <p> The Batcave used to have lots of stuff that was like trophies of the various capers Batman would get involved in . It would be cool if we could do content to unlock personal lair decor items like that . Including the giant penny . CoX had a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , not the penny . <p> Maybe it would be good if the personal lair had storage and the SG base did not . I mean , you 're storing YOUR stuff . The SG base , if anything , could have a communal " sharing " inventory space that everyone could give and take from , maybe , with an automatic purge every so often where the SG get 's the proceeds . So like if you have an item you do n't want , and cant get a lot of IGC for , then you drop it in there and other people can take it for free until it eventually get 's liquidated and the SG get 's the proceeds . <p> Also , maybe the missions you can get from the personal lair are all intended for soloing/small teams , whereas the SG ones all require a larger team/squad/league or whatever . <p> One question that comes to mind , will SGs be groups that include all alignments of toons in them , in theory , or will there be separate Hero and Villain ones ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set their SG alignment profile and then change it if they want to ? Or will there be no alignment of the SG at all except that the players themselves can kick or invite people based on alignment and then have to police that over time on an ongoing basis manually ? <p> The number 3 reason for any kind of SG Base is ... Social . It 's a " hub " where members can congregate for purely social reasons , including Roleplay and other activities that do not rely on game mechanics to enjoy . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> I 'm not crazy about the social part . I think its more social if people hang out in public areas instead of in their own SG bases while just hanging out . <p> Those are not mutually exclusive things , you know . Members of my SG back in the day did both . Sometimes we hung out in public , interacted with people at large , or other SGs we were close to . Sometimes we ran private events ( frequently roleplay ) that just made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We put a lot of pride into how it was decorated , and we liked to keep inter-SG drama private . It was very much a social hub for us , but hardly the only one . There are certain things that are just more appropriate in private , and it was the perfect space for that . <p> I 'm not crazy about the social part . I think its more social if people hang out in public areas instead of in their own SG bases while just hanging out . <p> I think it 's kind of wierd trying to classify certain things as being " more " social than other things . It only takes two people to have a social situation - being in a public place does n't make things " more " or " better " social . <p> If you 're worried ( for some reason ) that practically EVERYONE will be hiding out in their cool SG bases making the public zones a virtual ghostown that 's one thing . But inferring that SOME people spending time in relatively small groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Do n't want to hang out in a base with a few friends ? Do n't do it . But do n't try to imply that a person would be playing the game " wrong " if that 's what they wanted to do . <p> I admit , the ghost town thing is what I was referring to . I have no beef with people just chilling in their SG bases . <p> Sure no one wants this game to APPEAR like a ghost town even if there 's a million players hiding in their SG bases . But the same could be said of having too many instanced door missions or anything else that players could do that would n't involve running around in the open public zones . I 'm just not really sure that " promoting " SG bases as social meeting places is going to drastically affect things along those lines one way or the other . CoH survived pretty well under those conditions for years - or at least you could say that CoH did n't die directly because everyone was spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want to have to ' Listen ' to a lot of the RP I see in public locations . It interferes with conversations I 'm having , and I only have so many windows . ( Actually , that 's one of the things I liked about CoH , I could have a chat-window that only held SG-channel stuff . ) If people are ' chilling ' in their SG bases , then I do n't have to tell them to get a room . <p> So , the main thing I used my SG base for was Funzies while decorating ( I was a rather prolific base modder ) . <p> Admittedly I was the only person in my SG so the social aspects were largely moot . ( I inherited the group after everyone else quit , it had never been a particularly big SG . I never bothered to recruit new members , cause I 'm not all that social , I mostly just ran solo , with a duo partner or with people from my Global channels ) . <p> I really hope CoT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier to entry . The only reason I could do half as much as I was able to do with the base I had is cause of all the prestige I inherited along with the group . <p> The one thing that would have made the Base Editor something used more universally is ... enough with the Global Y/N Permissions already ! <p> There was never a chance to tell someone " here , you can mod up THIS ROOM however you want " without giving them the keys to trashing literally EVERYTHING IN THE BASE if they so chose . Because of the risk that represented , only an incredibly tiny minority of people ever became Base Builders , because the risk of handing out Global Permission like that was too high and you could n't just " babysit " someone while they did their work under your watchful eye ( the volume of work to do was just too immense ) . <p> I want to be able to assign Edit permissions to Specific People for Specific Parts of the Base .

The level of trust required for SGs to give up control to that person meant that it was only ever restricted to the most dedicated and proven trustworthy of individuals ( newer members of the guild , or those who played less frequently or were n't well know by ( or friends of ) the SG leader could probably never hope for such permissions themselves ) . <p> I want to be able to assign Edit permissions to Specific People for Specific Parts of the Base .

I always thought that was a little sad in some weird way . <p> So yes I 'd favor some scheme to allow for leaders to establish " player X is assigned edit control over room Y " settings in CoT . Obviously it would not be completely trivial to implement that but likewise I ca n't see it being hyper-impossible either . <p> The way that *I* would do it would be that when you create a " room " feature it will adopt whatever the Global Edit Permissions are for the entire Base ( so as to save effort modding up each room individually ) .

The menu for it would have a Y/N radio button choice for every single member of the SG , so as to be able to give Permission on an individual basis . It will also offer a Y/N radio button choice for each of the ranks available in the SG , so as to override the Global Permission setting .

@@79253467 @753467/ <h> uses for a base <p> Some thoughts on things we 'd do with an SG base or personal lair , most of which are not new , but feel free to add any of your own thoughts . <p> 1 . Travel faster : you use the base as a way to get form point A to point B faster than walking . COX had teleporters , you could do that , or have super vehicles that accomplish something similar in various ways , with the vehicle being static furniture and doing cutscenes , like the choppers in CoX , etc . <p> 2 . Inventory space : you can store more stuff in the long term because you have inventory slots that the base gives you , but you can only access them from the base . <p> 3 . Crafting : making stuff requires tools , you 'd keep them in the base . <p> 4 . Missions : the base might have a Trouble Alert Monitor that you can get missions off of . <p> 5 . Communications : maybe you get map , inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and shows the current state of the world map , like where Babbage is , whether or not the Hamidon is up , etc. plus you might have a SG chat channel that the base unlocks for you in some way , like you have to build a SG radio antenna or launch a satellite to make that work . <p> 6 . Medical care : You can respawn at the base instead of the hospital , assuming there 's a reason you 'd want to . Maybe the base has travel options that get you back to the mission you 're in faster . <p> 7 . PvP arena : maybe you can spar with other SG members in a Danger Room type deal that allows you to fight other heroes in " simulated " combat . Maybe you can even just programm it for one person to try to measure your combat effectiveness , like DPS , etc . <p> 8 . MIDs build analyzer : maybe the you can look at your build using the base 's diagnostic computer system and use that to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Add in a Danger Room , from which members of the guild can access certain player made missions - virtual combat sims , guild member created missions tailored for the SG , and RP missions designed for the SG . <p> In GW2 the Ranger class has a mechanic where you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions . I do n't really care about that , but it got me thinking , what if you could convince different NPCs to work with you in such a way that you eventually see them walking around your SG base giving you missions and stuff ? <p> Like if you do enough of Doctor Science 's missions , you eventually unlock him/her as an NPC that would appears in your SG base or personal lair from time to time , at upon beign summoned , and they might have a mission for you every so often . <p> You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions .

You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . <p> Personally I would base that off of reputation since you have to work up some form of trust for this to happen . Sure you wo n't be able to " collect ' em all " but it does n't really make sense that NPC from a faction that has you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your base to give you missions . <p> In regards to 8 . If that is to just pre-load a progression path that you have selected manually that just says " do/take " at each level then it 's perfectly fine . If it actually generates builds in accordance to some input then I 'm not so sure . <p> As for adding more ideas . I would add mannequins not only for being able to have my costumes on display but also as a form of secondary storage for them , as in I would be able to exchange/load what is on the mannequin with what I have in one of my " costume slots " on the character . Maybe having a cheap one for display only and a more expensive one ( cash store only ? ) that also includes the exchange option . <p> Dynamic testing/training area so one can test a build and see how it performs under certain circumstances . Ideally you would be able to select from a number of different scenarios , including if it 's offensive or defensive in nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go out and find Juvenile versions of thing slike Tigers and Wolves to capture and train as animal companions .

You could have a " Got ta collect em all " sort of thing with the NPCs that way . As Laston , the player behind Doctor Science on Freedom server passed away recently , this post actually hit me a bit hard . <p> Condolences . I was referring to Steven Sheridan in Brix , the NPC also known as Dr. Science in the game lore . I meant no disrespect . <p> The Batcave used to have lots of stuff that was like trophies of the various capers Batman would get involved in . It would be cool if we could do content to unlock personal lair decor items like that . Including the giant penny . CoX had a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , not the penny . <p> Maybe it would be good if the personal lair had storage and the SG base did not . I mean , you 're storing YOUR stuff . The SG base , if anything , could have a communal " sharing " inventory space that everyone could give and take from , maybe , with an automatic purge every so often where the SG get 's the proceeds . So like if you have an item you do n't want , and cant get a lot of IGC for , then you drop it in there and other people can take it for free until it eventually get 's liquidated and the SG get 's the proceeds . <p> Also , maybe the missions you can get from the personal lair are all intended for soloing/small teams , whereas the SG ones all require a larger team/squad/league or whatever . <p> One question that comes to mind , will SGs be groups that include all alignments of toons in them , in theory , or will there be separate Hero and Villain ones ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set their SG alignment profile and then change it if they want to ? Or will there be no alignment of the SG at all except that the players themselves can kick or invite people based on alignment and then have to police that over time on an ongoing basis manually ? <p> The number 3 reason for any kind of SG Base is ... Social . It 's a " hub " where members can congregate for purely social reasons , including Roleplay and other activities that do not rely on game mechanics to enjoy . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> I 'm not crazy about the social part . I think its more social if people hang out in public areas instead of in their own SG bases while just hanging out . <p> Those are not mutually exclusive things , you know . Members of my SG back in the day did both . Sometimes we hung out in public , interacted with people at large , or other SGs we were close to . Sometimes we ran private events ( frequently roleplay ) that just made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We put a lot of pride into how it was decorated , and we liked to keep inter-SG drama private . It was very much a social hub for us , but hardly the only one . There are certain things that are just more appropriate in private , and it was the perfect space for that . <p> I 'm not crazy about the social part . I think its more social if people hang out in public areas instead of in their own SG bases while just hanging out . <p> I think it 's kind of wierd trying to classify certain things as being " more " social than other things . It only takes two people to have a social situation - being in a public place does n't make things " more " or " better " social . <p> If you 're worried ( for some reason ) that practically EVERYONE will be hiding out in their cool SG bases making the public zones a virtual ghostown that 's one thing . But inferring that SOME people spending time in relatively small groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Do n't want to hang out in a base with a few friends ? Do n't do it . But do n't try to imply that a person would be playing the game " wrong " if that 's what they wanted to do . <p> I admit , the ghost town thing is what I was referring to . I have no beef with people just chilling in their SG bases . <p> Sure no one wants this game to APPEAR like a ghost town even if there 's a million players hiding in their SG bases . But the same could be said of having too many instanced door missions or anything else that players could do that would n't involve running around in the open public zones . I 'm just not really sure that " promoting " SG bases as social meeting places is going to drastically affect things along those lines one way or the other . CoH survived pretty well under those conditions for years - or at least you could say that CoH did n't die directly because everyone was spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want to have to ' Listen ' to a lot of the RP I see in public locations . It interferes with conversations I 'm having , and I only have so many windows . ( Actually , that 's one of the things I liked about CoH , I could have a chat-window that only held SG-channel stuff . ) If people are ' chilling ' in their SG bases , then I do n't have to tell them to get a room . <p> So , the main thing I used my SG base for was Funzies while decorating ( I was a rather prolific base modder ) . <p> Admittedly I was the only person in my SG so the social aspects were largely moot . ( I inherited the group after everyone else quit , it had never been a particularly big SG . I never bothered to recruit new members , cause I 'm not all that social , I mostly just ran solo , with a duo partner or with people from my Global channels ) . <p> I really hope CoT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier to entry . The only reason I could do half as much as I was able to do with the base I had is cause of all the prestige I inherited along with the group . <p> The one thing that would have made the Base Editor something used more universally is ... enough with the Global Y/N Permissions already ! <p> There was never a chance to tell someone " here , you can mod up THIS ROOM however you want " without giving them the keys to trashing literally EVERYTHING IN THE BASE if they so chose . Because of the risk that represented , only an incredibly tiny minority of people ever became Base Builders , because the risk of handing out Global Permission like that was too high and you could n't just " babysit " someone while they did their work under your watchful eye ( the volume of work to do was just too immense ) . <p> I want to be able to assign Edit permissions to Specific People for Specific Parts of the Base . That way , everyone can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tutorial spaces " for new people to test their skills on without risking the entirety of everything else in your Base on their honor and whims . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> The one thing that would have made the Base Editor something used more universally is ... enough with the Global Y/N Permissions already !

The level of trust required for SGs to give up control to that person meant that it was only ever restricted to the most dedicated and proven trustworthy of individuals ( newer members of the guild , or those who played less frequently or were n't well know by ( or friends of ) the SG leader could probably never hope for such permissions themselves ) . <p> I want to be able to assign Edit permissions to Specific People for Specific Parts of the Base .

Click on LONG ... for more pictures or inspiration . If you do make an effort to paint her back to life , thanks ! <p> " Rosey , get down from there ! " <p> The familiar call echoed around the mountain village during Rosemary 's brief childhood . Many of the townsfolk were certain the free-spirited child would fall to her death for the girl was always climbing the steepest rock faces and perching on top of the most perilous cliffs . She never followed the words of warning for the compulsion to climb the mountain she loved was too strong to deny . The mountain seemed to return Rosey 's love as handholds appeared right where she lunged and crevices formed where the scampering child needed to wedge a probing foot . <p> The mountain erupted with little warning . A plume of ash rose up like a beast of smoke and shadow , blotting out the sun . While the rest of the villagers tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Rosey darted boldly up the steep slope for she could n't ignore the shrill cries of the livestock . Though she had only precious seconds , she made it to the stables in time to fling the pen doors open , freeing the bewildered beasts . <p> Now time had run out for Rosey . Choking on ash , she fell to her hands and knees as her beloved mountain 's anger turned molten . But as lava flowed towards the little girl , the mountain itself cobbled stone around Rosey 's limbs to shield her . <p> Soaring high overhead , Raven saw all of this . <p> For many days crows brought grubs and berries to feed the stonechild . And then the days turned to seasons and the seasons to years . Though her cobbled arms and legs were fused with the mountain and she felt no hope of ever being free , she ate what the crows brought her to thank them for their kindness . <p> Then one evening Raven returned with a small , flat stone . It was black but tinged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expectant , Rosey swallowed the pebble and fell asleep . <p> Thunder startled her awake and she felt the muscles in her cobbled arms and legs tense . That was new . She felt the rain pool around her stone fingers . That was new as well . And she felt ... wings ! <p> As the gale howled around her , Rosey found a moment of clarity and embraced the new powers that Raven 's gift had bestowed . She arched her back , flexed her arms and legs and beat her wings . <p> The cobbled crow burst from her mountain prison and shot skyward into the eye of the storm . <p> Mariner wrote : Quite happy to see so many familiar faces once again .

It 's great for taking screenshots if you did n't get what you wanted before the game shut down or lost your files to an upgrade . Cheers ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do have another character I hope someone will draw up , at some point ...... <p> Her name is Lynx , and is basically a blending up of details and qualities of Catwoman and Hawk Girl ( JLA/JLU ) ... she 's an Alien scout sent to earth , but her powerful sense of right and wrong ( and general distractedness ) has seen her slipping around Titan City at night , being a sort of Robin Hood figure ( stealing from criminal organizations like the Roses , and giving it to the needy .. as well as helping the weak against retaliation by those same groups ) <p> Lynx , ( Real name* Leah Mao ) is a short woman , perhaps 5 ' 2 " with a long torso and powerful upper legs . She is small chested and very pale , though not blanched-white ( more brown than pink or yellow in her skin tone , though ) . Beneath her helmet , her auburn hair is chin length but clipped close on sides and back and her eyes are an amber-yellow color . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawed gauntlets , greaves , and possibly a belt ( ? ) The jumpsuit is a two part catsuit designed to protect the wearer from temporal travel and battlefield hazards . the bottom layer , a dark redish-brown , is for safe travel , the pale grey over-suit is a different material and more armored ... though , when worn , they fit seamlessly together . It is lightweight and flexible with a high neck and a zipper-like device from the middle of the throat to the middle of the chest ( the Medallion at it 's termination is a form of identification badge , like a police officer 's shield ) <p> The helmet bares more than a passing resemblance to a Caracal ( African " lynx " ) with its ears back and is the source of her superhero name . It is metal ... but I do n't know what color it should be , or how it should look ( though i drew up a really rough estimation , below . ) <p> Leah 's gauntlets run the length of her forearm and are made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The metal is a brassy gold color with retractable claws on each finger . <p> her Greaves are made of the same medal and of a similar design . She does n't wear shoes . <p> She may or may not wear a belt in a similar yellow color to her gloves , greaves and I 'd shield ( as a means of holding her gauntlets " sheathed " when not in use ) but I 'm not sure .... so if someone does take up the challenge , feel free to play with the idea . <p> Once again , I 'm not an artist , but for the most part , I think I 've figured out the costume ( the helmet is mostly wrong , but I do n't  know how to make it right , with my limited skills ) SO ... here is some reference material : <p> Lynx 's jumpsuit ( with one gauntlet and greaves ) : <p> ( she should probably have more boobage than my drawing has , at least enough for some cleavage ; P but still far less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : <p> ... well , I was using Hawkgirl 's Helmet as a model ... but it 's not really working out . The " face " part seems right .. or at least close ... but the ears need to be more like : <p> with the ears " back " ( in " hunting/attack mode " rather than " alert and interested " ) <p> and the helmet DEFINITELY needs the signature lynx " ear tufts " on the tips of each ear . <p> Lynx 's gauntlets : basically just as shown above , but the claws should be more thin and curvy , rather than like little spikes . Rather than " retracting " magically , they actually fold back , like switch-blades , popping out when needed with a flex of the fingertips <p> so they should really look like thin talons on the end of the gauntlets ... <p> and , just in case anyone wants to draw her holding or sans helmet , this is about what I picture her hair being like , only dark reddish-orange , rather than blonde <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus the raccoon makeup ; P ) which is probably more useful to anyone trying to draw her .... <p> Well .... uh ... anyway , that 's Lynx , if anyone has any questions , or want 's to take a shot at her , lemme know ? <p> " <p> .... Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars ... <p> This is pretty rough , and mostly for the sake of reference rather than a characterful art piece , but- <p> Two things : Going by the costume sample , no shoes means barefoot , not tights covering her feet , right ? Also , my idea for the belt is that it 's only partial and directly attaches to the seams then loops around the back where it has a simple fastening mechanism , like a seat-belt , that is easy to handle without looking . Of course it would still take a few moments without distraction to do so , so it wo n't be something villains can easily detach in a brawl . <p> yep , bare foot as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think i forgot to mention that above ) .... I definitely see where you 're going with the " belt " and I say roll with it .... it actually might not even be a true " belt " just sort of a SCIENCE ! attachment ( as shown ) for SCIENCING her gauntlets to her sides .... <p> other than that , looks good so far , though the idea of the circular thing in the middle of her chest is like a sci-fi " zipper " .... so it 's like her suit is " unzipped " down to where the medalion is resting at the middle of her chest , but if she were wearing it properly , the medalion would be at the middle of her throat ( like a Pet Collar ... get it ; ) ) .... which means she 's got a little bit of femme fatale chest/cleavage showing for the sexiness . ; P <p> " <p> .... Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars ... <p> Well , now . This is an interesting thread ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main character from CO , seeing that I missed my chance of playing CoX back in the day . : ( <p> If you want to draw her in a full body , let me know . Otherwise you can go from the picture alone , I honestly do n't mind . The same pose would be nice and if you wish to share it with others / upload it elsewhere ( like deviantART , etc ) - you have my full permission . : ) <p> Her name is Fantomask and I have n't leveled as she 's still at level 6 . : ) And yeah , haha , that 's one of the trivia I plan to bring up once I upload her biography : Her costume design is deeply inspired by Kato , as I do love the old Green Hornet series with Bruce Lee ( though I have n't watched much of it , hint hint ) ! <p> I think it was me . I edited a post or two because some images were too big to fit the forum ... Earlier I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update , due to a bug . That was fixed a while back , so I finally took the time to change some linkies . <p> It 's not bad that this thread popped up though ! People can still add a request if they wish <p> Very confused over the design of the staff , I understood 2 end caps ? But umm what shape , just some kind of flat bottle cap ? 8 rings ? Dispersed but now seeing it on the staff ... can you explain further . <p> I was thinking of the caps and the rings being around 6 cm ( just over two and a third inches ) wide , with the caps also covering the ends . With an overall length of 170 cm ( 67inches ) , that would leave spaces of about 12.2 cm ( 4.8 inches ) . The proportions would be about like this : <p> Right , not like those . The metal is mostly there to protect the wood , and would only stick out from the wood a little bit . The symbols , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the metal . <p> From the mists of Niflheim and dark queen Hel , came battle-maid Signe , or New Victory ' . Steeped in dark magic , she turned away from Helheim 's path to serve the light of Asgard as a Valkyrie . But that light came from the harvest of Heroes , those the Valkyries chose . <p> Signe rebelled . Instead of choosing heroes to die , she used her magic to choose the living ' , to heal them , so that they might continue to gain glory . This revolt against Asgard 's way was discovered and Signe was cast down , denied the apples of youth , and banished , doomed to wander Midgard ( Earth ) , undying , powerless and alone . <p> Millennia have passed and Valhalla 's glory is a dim , grey memory , but Odin wants to take advantage of this new Age of Heroes . Seeking an envoy , he hoped for Thor , or Uller , or Heimdall , one of the bright heroes of old , but all he found was dark Signe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-empowered , the Black Valkyrie has returned to choosing the living , that heroes might gain glory , for the greater good of both worlds . <p> I 'm offering a folder-full of screenshots , hoping to inspire , because her final outfit really is n't settled . Every game calls for re-interpretation . In the spirit of reinterpretation , I could easily envision this becoming a multi-artist collaboration , if you wanted to do it that way . <p> Signe is a study in contrasts , hard and soft , dark and light , destroyer and creator . She is a servant of order and a rebel against it . She is a fearsome warrior , a staunch defender , and a compassionate healer . <p> She is a tall , powerful , beautiful woman , with deep blue eyes and long , night-black hair , contrasting with fair skin . She smiles often , laughs warmly , and genuinely likes people , yet she can be as cold and hard as midnight on a glacier , particularly when choosing ' . Some of these pictures emphasize that severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chainmail bikini , here , Signe is a working girl . She remembers a time when there was no toilet-paper and cooking over an open fire was common , if you had a fire . She also remembers practically everything that she 's seen and experienced since then and approves of indoor plumbing , soap that does n't burn your skin , nice clothes , and other useful developments . So , a relatively Practical outfit , not some fantasy wish-fulfillment . <p> Her costume consists of a long coat , or robe , over light armor or sturdy clothes , she often wears a sash , skirt or wrap around her hips , and armored boots and gauntlets . A headband , filet , or tiara , often with wings , helps keep her hair out of her eyes . Black and blue are the main colors , with accents in gold , silver , or white . She will wear other colors , but those are traditional with her , when she has a choice . <p> Heh , alright , I 'll adjust that . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , from development notes to the final ' 1023 ' that fit in the CoH Biography . That makes it easy to copy/paste the character 's ' Biography Block ' . <p> A problem I had with her costume was how CoH would n't let you combine certain parts . The fancy coat came with ' fur ' and you could n't put your own shoulder-pads on it . The Trenchcoat would n't let you use any gloves with ' bulk ' or extra plates . Both of them would allow certain chest-pieces and block others . <p> The Champions costume creator allowed a lot of freedom to combine elements , but the individual parts were limited . Star Wars does n't allow any sort of layering and has very narrow concepts of proper dress for Jedi . Age of Conan has gorgeously rendered bits and a ' Vanity ' costume-layer that allows you to build a visible costume separate from the functional gear , but it 's all rather primitive looking , especially at the lower levels . <p> My apologies , while normally I would jump all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair ... my problem is two fold . <p> 1 ) She 's too similar in look to my own original 20+ year old D&amp;D character , whom I still play every weekend , although virtually on Google+ . I mean I have used all those same models in COH , Champions , Star Wars AND AoC ... literally ... although my character is much more classically fantasy , she has worn the bikini . <p> 2 ) If I do art of your character , I should be doing art of my character . It would be like having invented Superman , and only drawing other people 's variations . <p> However ... I am not opposed to giving it a try , on a one time basis . My questions for you are these ... <p> 1 ) Is this character Modern ? Apocalyptic ? Futuristic ? 2 ) Why would someone where a coat over armor ? You mean a robe the way Jedi do in SW ? So a Cape with sleeves basically , and pockets . 3 ) What kind of armor are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , not her arms and legs . Is this a Cuircass ? Or breastplate mostly ? 4 ) Does she have weapons ? What are her powers if any ... <p> I can draw any of those screenshots , but they 're just as vague as your request . If you narrow this down for me , I think we can work towards a final look you would prefer were possible ... <p> I 've seen your Valkyrie , Bobby and she 's fantastic . You 've also already done art for me , so I do n't want to be greedy ! That said , if you felt compelled to draw my Valkyrie , I hope you would be able to focus on how she is Different from yours . That would allow you to explore other aspects of the legend . Signe partakes of that legend , but has rebelled against it . <p> Frankly , she 's rebelled against a lot of things . She 's a dark mage from a land of dark magic , but she turns away from that , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark magic into a positive , healing force . As a mage , she joins a team of warriors and proves that she can hold her own . Finally , she realizes a philosophical difference with the system she 's supporting , rebels again , and is cast out . <p> I 'd love to discuss all of the various elements that went into crafting this character , but we 'd end up a long way from the art , so I 'll try to condense things . <p> Ancient Norse were largely metal-poor , metal armor in cold climates leads to frozen warriors . Art and legend suggests that Thor and the other Asgardians wore a basic ' armor ' of a heavy , quilted coat . It may have been brigandine , ie having plates of horn or metal sewn between layers . Over this , the more wealthy might add a few pieces of what we 'd recognize as armor - arm and wrist guards , shin and leg-guards , shoulder-plates , and a helmet . All of which were most likely to be Leather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valkyrie 's first costume similarly . Top left , in my earlier display , a mid-thigh coat and a skirt , armored boots and gauntlets , shoulders , and thigh-pads . Protects from basic trauma and abrasion , but not expected to stop a high-powered strike . Later , with improved costume options , I worked on a re-design and came up with a half-dozen variations on the theme . <p> In response to your numbered questions : <p> 1 ) She is ' modern ' in materials and basic science , but ancient retro-Norse in form . Her ' style ' tends to slide all through the time-stream , but she always appears elegant and subtle . She 's a lady with thousands of years of Fashion to draw on , but who chooses to be unique . <p> 2 ) So , I have a long coat , for dramatic purposes , but also to break up the silhouette and disguise what she 's wearing under it . Yes , as you suggested , a cape with pockets . Great description ! *grin* Essentially , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it - warriors wear a coat into battle . This one may have runes and other protections woven into it . It 's her outermost layer of protection . <p> 3 ) ' Armor ' in this case is fairly modern . She wears basic ballistic and impact-resistant armoring to protect her core . The intention is not to make her bullet-proof , but to limit random damage , so that her Healing abilities have time to work . In the latest costume that resembles a shirt and leggings of fine scales , with plates over the vitals and points of contact in the rough-and-tumble , like thighs , arms , and shoulders . <p> She wears hard armored boots , protecting her feet/ankles/shins/knees , gauntlets to protect forearms and elbows , and often shoulder-pads . In some versions , I have her wearing some form of cuirasse or breastplate , in others it 's more of a belly-protector , or just a decorative cloth covering . She 's not a knight , but she is a trained warrior and getting up-close-and-personal with her is not going to be fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for head-protection ... I 've been a bit torn about that . From a Practical point of view , if she was at all smart , she 'd be wearing a combat helmet and face-shield . She should , at least , have her hair braided and put out of the way . And ... I just like long , unbound hair . I personally hate wearing hats . I think Signe would see her hair as a badge of rank/class/status and defy anyone to call her on it . <p> One version of her costume has the coverage going right up to her chin and ears , with a bit of jaw-shield and a metal headband . That would give her a little protection around her face , but it leaves her hair uncovered . I think , if she were in a situation where a helmet was strongly recommended , like riding a motorcycle , or suchlike , she would do up her hair and wear it without a qualm , but not in her daily work . <p> 4 ) As a Dark/Dark/Dark Defender in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power was in her magic , to blind and bind , to drain life and to give life . I think , in a more free-form milieu , she could certainly use a sword as well as anyone , but what I envision her with is a rod . Four feet of dense hardwood , or a cane , or perhaps one of those telescoping batons , called an ' Asp ' . Not for any D&amp;D ' healers only use blunt weapons ' foolishness , but ... hmm , more of a druidic magic-wandish , offense/defense/tool of magic type thing . A rod is a tool , but a sword is a significant object ? I 'm not exactly sure of my thinking , there . <p> It occurs to me that a Dark/Dark/Dark Defender , or D4 , might not mean much to some readers , so I should explain . A ' Defender ' is the healing and buffing/de-buffing class in CoH , and thus , Signe uses ' Dark Miasma ' for healing and defense , ' Dark Blast ' for offense , and ' Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feed her team . She uses fear and sleep and slow to debilitate , and all of her powers reduce enemy Accuracy until they ca n't hurt anything . And then they die . <p> Bobby , if you were to draw this character , I would prefer that you not just draw one of these screenshots , but take inspiration from all of them and draw your imagination . Unlike the previous character you drew for me , I ca n't pick an actress that has the right combination of austerity and beauty . I see a bit of Anjelica Huston , maybe Catherine Zeta Jones , or Sharon Stone , or a more recent Jennifer Connelly . Signe 's face is one where the bone structure rules . <p> That would be my preference , regardless of which artist draws her . That way , the next time I create her , I can draw inspiration from You ! <p> I attempted to draw a portrait of Signe , the black Valkyrie . Hope you like it Fireheart ! Click the link to get the original file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Collab Central thread , see if anyone feels like coloring . <p> Oh , I left the chinpiece out on purpose , could n't quite get it right , so I figured she was halfway getting dressed ( or undressed ) <p> Started working on a portrait of Cobblecrow , not sure where it 's going yet , but just letting it know . <p> The details of Signe 's costume are completely subject to variation , so drawing her face uncovered is perfectly valid . <p> As I was discussing , every game I play her in forces me to re-interpret her outfit . Age of Conan forced me to play several levels while dressed in nothing but a sheer , white bathing-suit that left almost nothing to the imagination . I was stuck on the beach , bashing pirates with a stick , and hoping that one of them would drop some Boots that I could wear ! <p> Actually ... yeah , everything in this outfit came from scavenging pirates and headhunters between the beach and the nearest town . <p> I have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this one too ! <p> Okay ... still working out some of the pencils ( needs maybe the staff in her right hand du n no just yet ) ...

And you 're welcome ! I knew about this thread on the City of Heroes boards , it was then started by my irl good friend Ghost aka Gapy ( I forgot what is boardname was atm ) , though it was bled to death long before the game did . But I thought it was a great thing that it was there and wanted to make sure it was here too . . I 'm very glad to see it 's actually being used . <p> Hah !

Mike , you 're an artist in my book aswell ! Get used to the title , it 's yours ! . <p> Well , since it seems that it 's sort-of kosher to be requesting artwork of our old CoH characters here , I guess I 'll toss a few up since I could use some art of them for my story . <p> Let 's start with a favorite of mine , as should be obvious from my signature : <p> And a reference for just how much of her is purely cybernetic : Her entire body has been replaced over time except for her brain , most of her digestive system , lungs , heart , and supporting muscles and ligaments in the upper torso for the organic components . Even then there 's been heavy cybernetic augmentation to allow for various implants to operate . There is no actual skin left , and it has been years since she 's had a proper sense of touch beyond system diagnostics notifying her of extensive damage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleas . She jumped at the chance to leave the Rogue Isles and to repent the deeds she had done on orders of higher powers . The only problem is that her twin sister was n't coming with her , was begging her to stay . Kelly was a low-potential psychic that had been fully-indoctrinated into the Night Widows . She knew that if Stacy left , they would end up fighting each other , and one of them would either end up dead or crippled if that happened . Stacy had always been rebellious , not liking that she and Kelly had been conscripted into service and even going do far as to ' deface ' her crab-pack weapons by having names engraved on the blade of each leg . Vigilance , Duty , Penance and Honor . <p> Alas , poor Kelly ended up being tortured after Stacy deserted the cause . Brainwashing is a horrible thing when it is used to twist your love for your only sibling into blind hatred and a thirst for revenge so intense that even mentioning her name is enough to incite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close as possible to each other as a show of their sisterly bond , Kelly chose to make hers more visibly malevolent after her ' second indoctrination ' both to distance herself from the deserter 's image and to help strike a bit more fear . She also changed her operative name to an old curse she remembered from a fantasy novel ; Kolsen'shea Orbb - Pull the legs off a spider . Something she intended to do the next time they two of them met . <p> And yes , the two of them are HEAVILY influenced by Beast Wars-era Blackarachnia . <p> Hey , I took a shot at Lynx but not sure if I 'm getting the ears/head piece right . <p> The more I tried working with the Caracal ( the Cat image posted ) I could n't get it to look right . So ... did a bit of google and went with something a bit more like a real Lynx . I was going for a bit more feral - sort of a cross between Hawkgirl 's helmet and Wolverine 's look ... which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than my previous five attempts . ( Trust me ... this is better than the last couple tries . ) <p> Here 's a little something I was working on and finally finished . Cobblecrow . Afterglow , I hope I got it right , because the refs were a bit unclear as the images were small and barely had details . Figured I 'd go with a portrait again , leaving the suit to imagination . Click on the image to go to my DA page where you can download the original file . <p> P.S. I left a copy ( with link to drawing without background ) in the Collab Thread . <p> I always feel strange going in on threads like these because i feel bad requesting art with no compensation for the artist : -x But if anyone would like to do one of my characters i would appreciate it , Let 's see if i can do this IMG tag thing right .... <p> These are of my default hero Titan , your basic super strength and invulnerable flying brick . Personality wise he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who would n't be when they can just shrug off tank guns and cannon fire ? : -p ) and on a bad day maybe even come off as a bit smug , but is a true hero and tries his best to make the world a better place and protect those who ca n't protect themselves . <p> First a picture of him standing neutrally , masked and unmasked ( if it helps ) , Then one of him in his standard pose ( his silver tights are supposed to be somewhat metallic , like a dull mylar ) Both were done in heromachine 3 , great program for the artistically impaired like me ! <p> Also here is his Emblem i designed , and a shot from how he looked in CoX for reference ( did n't  have any good medium length slicked back hair in C0X : -/ ) <p> Great refs Zanje ! That 's a neat trick , working with Heromachine . Great for creating a global idea of your character . <p> Thanks ! it really is , i use it a lot for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character i can visualize , just not put to paper myself . I totally recommend to anyone who wants to get their creative juices flowing : - ) also editted my post to add some personality info . <p> Hello , I 'd like to request art of my main from CoV , " GS Necro " , Galrithius Songtum Necrobis , a Necro/Dark Mastermind . He occupied two costumes , an old armour and skulls one , and a high tech Star Lords ( the SG my dad and I founded ) outfit . <p> It 's unfortunate my old tower 's HDD had to have a corruption of sort , so not all screenshots were preserved , here are the best I could come up with . <p> The costume is tights , with , as seen in the screen , grey bands on the wrists and calves , stars from the waist and shoulder , and a large star logo on the chest . The chest logo would ideally be more glossy , with the middle of the star more glass-like , like the texture of Obsidian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head had a cowl that covers up to his nose , and a facepiece that covers the rest of his face , from nose to hairline ( The vanguard facepeice was used ) , and the hair itself was fairly spiked , but i prefer the hair as shown in my avatar , from the Hero Machine . he had a black cape that covered his shoulders ( above the tech pads , covering the medial half ) . The costume is very dark overall , with facepeices , hair , and cowl being pitch black . <p> The Rocket boots were added to this costume in a later addition , and his dark blasts and eye aura were coloured dark purple , to mimic the warshade aura . <p> Here is an early version of the skulls and armour costume <p> Unfortunately , this was then SG colours were on , the yellow parts are usually a dark red . As seen , the hair is the same , though later I had greyish strands were the yellow was . I 'd 've liked the eyebrows to be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyes blank , with no vessels , iris , or pupil . The chest normally had a large skull , but again , SG mode : p. the boots were very much like the gloves , skulls . Rather than the " insectoid armour " in CoH , I 'd 've liked something more like the daedric armour ( minus kilt and shoulders ) , like below . <p> The dark blasts were much like the Legacy version , with a slight tint of red . <p> I 've done drawings on descriptions before . The outcome really depends on how specific your description is , how much of a perfectionist you are about the outcome , and if your artist and you are able/willing to work together on it . <p> Her body is fit and defined , incredibly so for her age and her muscle , while not distracting is visible to the naked eye even underneath her unzipped black leather jacket , scarlet lace top , black skinny jeans , and midnight shaded ugs . <p> Her skin is pale , not unusually so but noticeable enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally curly strands of auburn near scarlet hair held within a fashionable French bun . Her most striking feature however are her eyes , a piercing and rather hypnotizing hazel , once you catch her gaze it 's very difficult to pull away . Lastly , the effect worthy of note on her person is a pristine golden necklace draped carefully upon her neck , it 's centerpiece a milky scarlet opal that appears to shift inside it 's form as it catches the beams from the skylight above . <p> " <p> " Never argue with stupid people ; they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience . " <p> Alright , to clarify , she is a teenager , of Eastern European descent , age 16 . Her height is 5 ' 7 , her weight is a healthy 125 pounds , and her race is a Vampire , hence her paleness ! Her power aside from the standard vampiric abilities is persuasion and coercion via locking eyesight , so her eyes are visually hypnotizing and slightly chromatic . And lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I hope this does help clarify things ! <p> " <p> " Never argue with stupid people ; they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience . " <p> This is a fashion design trick , but for me , I make an empty folder with the character 's name , and I fill it full of : <p> 2 ) Images of the actor the client suggested 3 ) If they wear a specific kind of clothing or armor , more images of these things , both for texture , design , color and detail , whether ornate or simple 4 ) color palettes of other paintings I like that give me a mood I want to use for this character 5 ) weapon or item references , in your case it would be jewelry related <p> When my folder is full to the point of the imagery is making me dying to draw . I start sketching . <p> Some clients already have ideas of these kinds of details . So I ask them to send me things that inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images similar to what I placed in my folder , but if they had a specific idea , I want to know that , so I do n't have to guess . <p> Guessing sucks , guessing is time consuming . Guessing is time not spent drawing . <p> If the client does n't know their character , it 's like pulling teeth from a non-visual person to THINK visually . And that 's usually what I end up doing . <p> However if the client really knows their vision , they 've already done a lot of this kind of thinking for years . My job is to filter that info into something agreed upon OR aethetically pleasing enough in my style to make them happy . <p> So while you have narrowed somethings down , Foo had to do the dental work ... <p> In the end this is like a cheesy lawyer commercial , " Help us , help you ... " : D

She never followed the words of warning for the compulsion to climb the mountain she loved was too strong to deny . The mountain seemed to return Rosey 's love as handholds appeared right where she lunged and crevices formed where the scampering child needed to wedge a probing foot . <p> The mountain erupted with little warning .

Choking on ash , she fell to her hands and knees as her beloved mountain 's anger turned molten .

Cheers ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do have another character I hope someone will draw up , at some point ...... <p> Her name is Lynx , and is basically a blending up of details and qualities of Catwoman and Hawk Girl ( JLA/JLU ) ... she 's an Alien scout sent to earth , but her powerful sense of right and wrong ( and general distractedness ) has seen her slipping around Titan City at night , being a sort of Robin Hood figure ( stealing from criminal organizations like the Roses , and giving it to the needy .. as well as helping the weak against retaliation by those same groups ) <p> Lynx , ( Real name* Leah Mao ) is a short woman , perhaps 5 ' 2 " with a long torso and powerful upper legs . She is small chested and very pale , though not blanched-white ( more brown than pink or yellow in her skin tone , though ) . Beneath her helmet , her auburn hair is chin length but clipped close on sides and back and her eyes are an amber-yellow color . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawed gauntlets , greaves , and possibly a belt ( ? ) The jumpsuit is a two part catsuit designed to protect the wearer from temporal travel and battlefield hazards . the bottom layer , a dark redish-brown , is for safe travel , the pale grey over-suit is a different material and more armored ... though , when worn , they fit seamlessly together . It is lightweight and flexible with a high neck and a zipper-like device from the middle of the throat to the middle of the chest ( the Medallion at it 's termination is a form of identification badge , like a police officer 's shield ) <p> The helmet bares more than a passing resemblance to a Caracal ( African " lynx " ) with its ears back and is the source of her superhero name . It is metal ... but I do n't know what color it should be , or how it should look ( though i drew up a really rough estimation , below . ) <p> Leah 's gauntlets run the length of her forearm and are made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The metal is a brassy gold color with retractable claws on each finger . <p> her Greaves are made of the same medal and of a similar design . She does n't wear shoes . <p> She may or may not wear a belt in a similar yellow color to her gloves , greaves and I 'd shield ( as a means of holding her gauntlets " sheathed " when not in use ) but I 'm not sure .... so if someone does take up the challenge , feel free to play with the idea . <p> Once again , I 'm not an artist , but for the most part , I think I 've figured out the costume ( the helmet is mostly wrong , but I do n't  know how to make it right , with my limited skills ) SO ... here is some reference material : <p> Lynx 's jumpsuit ( with one gauntlet and greaves ) : <p> ( she should probably have more boobage than my drawing has , at least enough for some cleavage ; P but still far less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : <p> ... well , I was using Hawkgirl 's Helmet as a model ... but it 's not really working out . The " face " part seems right .. or at least close ... but the ears need to be more like : <p> with the ears " back " ( in " hunting/attack mode " rather than " alert and interested " ) <p> and the helmet DEFINITELY needs the signature lynx " ear tufts " on the tips of each ear . <p> Lynx 's gauntlets : basically just as shown above , but the claws should be more thin and curvy , rather than like little spikes . Rather than " retracting " magically , they actually fold back , like switch-blades , popping out when needed with a flex of the fingertips <p> so they should really look like thin talons on the end of the gauntlets ... <p> and , just in case anyone wants to draw her holding or sans helmet , this is about what I picture her hair being like , only dark reddish-orange , rather than blonde <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus the raccoon makeup ; P ) which is probably more useful to anyone trying to draw her .... <p> Well .... uh ... anyway , that 's Lynx , if anyone has any questions , or want 's to take a shot at her , lemme know ? <p> " <p> .... Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars ... <p> This is pretty rough , and mostly for the sake of reference rather than a characterful art piece , but- <p> Two things : Going by the costume sample , no shoes means barefoot , not tights covering her feet , right ? Also , my idea for the belt is that it 's only partial and directly attaches to the seams then loops around the back where it has a simple fastening mechanism , like a seat-belt , that is easy to handle without looking . Of course it would still take a few moments without distraction to do so , so it wo n't be something villains can easily detach in a brawl . <p> yep , bare foot as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think i forgot to mention that above ) .... I definitely see where you 're going with the " belt " and I say roll with it .... it actually might not even be a true " belt " just sort of a SCIENCE ! attachment ( as shown ) for SCIENCING her gauntlets to her sides .... <p> other than that , looks good so far , though the idea of the circular thing in the middle of her chest is like a sci-fi " zipper " .... so it 's like her suit is " unzipped " down to where the medalion is resting at the middle of her chest , but if she were wearing it properly , the medalion would be at the middle of her throat ( like a Pet Collar ... get it ; ) ) .... which means she 's got a little bit of femme fatale chest/cleavage showing for the sexiness . ; P <p> " <p> ....

People can still add a request if they wish <p> Very confused over the design of the staff , I understood 2 end caps ? But umm what shape , just some kind of flat bottle cap ? 8 rings ? Dispersed but now seeing it on the staff ... can you explain further . <p> I was thinking of the caps and the rings being around 6 cm ( just over two and a third inches ) wide , with the caps also covering the ends . With an overall length of 170 cm ( 67inches ) , that would leave spaces of about 12.2 cm ( 4.8 inches ) . The proportions would be about like this : <p> Right , not like those . The metal is mostly there to protect the wood , and would only stick out from the wood a little bit . The symbols , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the metal . <p> From the mists of Niflheim and dark queen Hel , came battle-maid Signe , or New Victory ' . Steeped in dark magic , she turned away from Helheim 's path to serve the light of Asgard as a Valkyrie . But that light came from the harvest of Heroes , those the Valkyries chose . <p> Signe rebelled . Instead of choosing heroes to die , she used her magic to choose the living ' , to heal them , so that they might continue to gain glory . This revolt against Asgard 's way was discovered and Signe was cast down , denied the apples of youth , and banished , doomed to wander Midgard ( Earth ) , undying , powerless and alone . <p> Millennia have passed and Valhalla 's glory is a dim , grey memory , but Odin wants to take advantage of this new Age of Heroes . Seeking an envoy , he hoped for Thor , or Uller , or Heimdall , one of the bright heroes of old , but all he found was dark Signe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-empowered , the Black Valkyrie has returned to choosing the living , that heroes might gain glory , for the greater good of both worlds . <p> I 'm offering a folder-full of screenshots , hoping to inspire , because her final outfit really is n't settled . Every game calls for re-interpretation . In the spirit of reinterpretation , I could easily envision this becoming a multi-artist collaboration , if you wanted to do it that way . <p> Signe is a study in contrasts , hard and soft , dark and light , destroyer and creator . She is a servant of order and a rebel against it . She is a fearsome warrior , a staunch defender , and a compassionate healer . <p> She is a tall , powerful , beautiful woman , with deep blue eyes and long , night-black hair , contrasting with fair skin . She smiles often , laughs warmly , and genuinely likes people , yet she can be as cold and hard as midnight on a glacier , particularly when choosing ' . Some of these pictures emphasize that severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chainmail bikini , here , Signe is a working girl . She remembers a time when there was no toilet-paper and cooking over an open fire was common , if you had a fire . She also remembers practically everything that she 's seen and experienced since then and approves of indoor plumbing , soap that does n't burn your skin , nice clothes , and other useful developments . So , a relatively Practical outfit , not some fantasy wish-fulfillment . <p> Her costume consists of a long coat , or robe , over light armor or sturdy clothes , she often wears a sash , skirt or wrap around her hips , and armored boots and gauntlets . A headband , filet , or tiara , often with wings , helps keep her hair out of her eyes . Black and blue are the main colors , with accents in gold , silver , or white . She will wear other colors , but those are traditional with her , when she has a choice . <p> Heh , alright , I 'll adjust that . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , from development notes to the final ' 1023 ' that fit in the CoH Biography . That makes it easy to copy/paste the character 's ' Biography Block ' . <p> A problem I had with her costume was how CoH would n't let you combine certain parts . The fancy coat came with ' fur ' and you could n't put your own shoulder-pads on it . The Trenchcoat would n't let you use any gloves with ' bulk ' or extra plates . Both of them would allow certain chest-pieces and block others . <p> The Champions costume creator allowed a lot of freedom to combine elements , but the individual parts were limited . Star Wars does n't allow any sort of layering and has very narrow concepts of proper dress for Jedi . Age of Conan has gorgeously rendered bits and a ' Vanity ' costume-layer that allows you to build a visible costume separate from the functional gear , but it 's all rather primitive looking , especially at the lower levels . <p> My apologies , while normally I would jump all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair ... my problem is two fold . <p> 1 ) She 's too similar in look to my own original 20+ year old D&amp;D character , whom I still play every weekend , although virtually on Google+ . I mean I have used all those same models in COH , Champions , Star Wars AND AoC ... literally ... although my character is much more classically fantasy , she has worn the bikini . <p> 2 ) If I do art of your character , I should be doing art of my character . It would be like having invented Superman , and only drawing other people 's variations . <p> However ... I am not opposed to giving it a try , on a one time basis . My questions for you are these ... <p> 1 ) Is this character Modern ? Apocalyptic ? Futuristic ? 2 ) Why would someone where a coat over armor ? You mean a robe the way Jedi do in SW ? So a Cape with sleeves basically , and pockets . 3 ) What kind of armor are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , not her arms and legs . Is this a Cuircass ? Or breastplate mostly ? 4 ) Does she have weapons ? What are her powers if any ... <p> I can draw any of those screenshots , but they 're just as vague as your request . If you narrow this down for me , I think we can work towards a final look you would prefer were possible ... <p> I 've seen your Valkyrie , Bobby and she 's fantastic . You 've also already done art for me , so I do n't want to be greedy ! That said , if you felt compelled to draw my Valkyrie , I hope you would be able to focus on how she is Different from yours . That would allow you to explore other aspects of the legend . Signe partakes of that legend , but has rebelled against it . <p> Frankly , she 's rebelled against a lot of things . She 's a dark mage from a land of dark magic , but she turns away from that , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dark magic into a positive , healing force . As a mage , she joins a team of warriors and proves that she can hold her own . Finally , she realizes a philosophical difference with the system she 's supporting , rebels again , and is cast out . <p> I 'd love to discuss all of the various elements that went into crafting this character , but we 'd end up a long way from the art , so I 'll try to condense things . <p> Ancient Norse were largely metal-poor , metal armor in cold climates leads to frozen warriors . Art and legend suggests that Thor and the other Asgardians wore a basic ' armor ' of a heavy , quilted coat . It may have been brigandine , ie having plates of horn or metal sewn between layers . Over this , the more wealthy might add a few pieces of what we 'd recognize as armor - arm and wrist guards , shin and leg-guards , shoulder-plates , and a helmet . All of which were most likely to be Leather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valkyrie 's first costume similarly . Top left , in my earlier display , a mid-thigh coat and a skirt , armored boots and gauntlets , shoulders , and thigh-pads . Protects from basic trauma and abrasion , but not expected to stop a high-powered strike . Later , with improved costume options , I worked on a re-design and came up with a half-dozen variations on the theme . <p> In response to your numbered questions : <p> 1 ) She is ' modern ' in materials and basic science , but ancient retro-Norse in form . Her ' style ' tends to slide all through the time-stream , but she always appears elegant and subtle . She 's a lady with thousands of years of Fashion to draw on , but who chooses to be unique . <p> 2 ) So , I have a long coat , for dramatic purposes , but also to break up the silhouette and disguise what she 's wearing under it . Yes , as you suggested , a cape with pockets . Great description ! *grin* Essentially , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it - warriors wear a coat into battle . This one may have runes and other protections woven into it . It 's her outermost layer of protection . <p> 3 ) ' Armor ' in this case is fairly modern . She wears basic ballistic and impact-resistant armoring to protect her core . The intention is not to make her bullet-proof , but to limit random damage , so that her Healing abilities have time to work . In the latest costume that resembles a shirt and leggings of fine scales , with plates over the vitals and points of contact in the rough-and-tumble , like thighs , arms , and shoulders . <p> She wears hard armored boots , protecting her feet/ankles/shins/knees , gauntlets to protect forearms and elbows , and often shoulder-pads . In some versions , I have her wearing some form of cuirasse or breastplate , in others it 's more of a belly-protector , or just a decorative cloth covering . She 's not a knight , but she is a trained warrior and getting up-close-and-personal with her is not going to be fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for head-protection ... I 've been a bit torn about that . From a Practical point of view , if she was at all smart , she 'd be wearing a combat helmet and face-shield . She should , at least , have her hair braided and put out of the way . And ... I just like long , unbound hair . I personally hate wearing hats . I think Signe would see her hair as a badge of rank/class/status and defy anyone to call her on it . <p> One version of her costume has the coverage going right up to her chin and ears , with a bit of jaw-shield and a metal headband . That would give her a little protection around her face , but it leaves her hair uncovered . I think , if she were in a situation where a helmet was strongly recommended , like riding a motorcycle , or suchlike , she would do up her hair and wear it without a qualm , but not in her daily work . <p> 4 ) As a Dark/Dark/Dark Defender in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power was in her magic , to blind and bind , to drain life and to give life . I think , in a more free-form milieu , she could certainly use a sword as well as anyone , but what I envision her with is a rod . Four feet of dense hardwood , or a cane , or perhaps one of those telescoping batons , called an ' Asp ' . Not for any D&amp;D ' healers only use blunt weapons ' foolishness , but ... hmm , more of a druidic magic-wandish , offense/defense/tool of magic type thing . A rod is a tool , but a sword is a significant object ? I 'm not exactly sure of my thinking , there . <p> It occurs to me that a Dark/Dark/Dark Defender , or D4 , might not mean much to some readers , so I should explain . A ' Defender ' is the healing and buffing/de-buffing class in CoH , and thus , Signe uses ' Dark Miasma ' for healing and defense , ' Dark Blast ' for offense , and ' Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feed her team . She uses fear and sleep and slow to debilitate , and all of her powers reduce enemy Accuracy until they ca n't hurt anything . And then they die . <p> Bobby , if you were to draw this character , I would prefer that you not just draw one of these screenshots , but take inspiration from all of them and draw your imagination . Unlike the previous character you drew for me , I ca n't pick an actress that has the right combination of austerity and beauty . I see a bit of Anjelica Huston , maybe Catherine Zeta Jones , or Sharon Stone , or a more recent Jennifer Connelly . Signe 's face is one where the bone structure rules . <p> That would be my preference , regardless of which artist draws her . That way , the next time I create her , I can draw inspiration from You ! <p> I attempted to draw a portrait of Signe , the black Valkyrie . Hope you like it Fireheart ! Click the link to get the original file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Collab Central thread , see if anyone feels like coloring . <p> Oh , I left the chinpiece out on purpose , could n't quite get it right , so I figured she was halfway getting dressed ( or undressed ) <p> Started working on a portrait of Cobblecrow , not sure where it 's going yet , but just letting it know . <p> The details of Signe 's costume are completely subject to variation , so drawing her face uncovered is perfectly valid . <p> As I was discussing , every game I play her in forces me to re-interpret her outfit . Age of Conan forced me to play several levels while dressed in nothing but a sheer , white bathing-suit that left almost nothing to the imagination . I was stuck on the beach , bashing pirates with a stick , and hoping that one of them would drop some Boots that I could wear ! <p> Actually ... yeah , everything in this outfit came from scavenging pirates and headhunters between the beach and the nearest town . <p> I have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this one too ! <p> Okay ... still working out some of the pencils ( needs maybe the staff in her right hand du n no just yet ) ... And getting inks down - I get impatient - but here 's a direction I 'm going . I 'll drop the lines later soon as I 'm done.blackvalkyrie by rjakobson , on Flickr Love the stuff Dee-Dee 's doing . Would have started in on that if I 'd seen it before I 'd started this : ( <p> Here is my finished effort ... which if anyone wants to jump in on and fix up ... please do . My skills have limits and I openly encourage anyone to fix anything I drop down . It 's not mine - it 's ' ours ' : ) <p> Right ? You would think after that piece with Sapphic Neko , DD would be ... then again that was something of a surprise . ; - ) <p> mikenovember wrote : <p> .....................

And you 're welcome ! I knew about this thread on the City of Heroes boards , it was then started by my irl good friend Ghost aka Gapy ( I forgot what is boardname was atm ) , though it was bled to death long before the game did . But I thought it was a great thing that it was there and wanted to make sure it was here too . . I 'm very glad to see it 's actually being used . <p> Hah ! Yeah well , DD has been put in quite a few ' situations ' but she still had her cloths on ( as far as I know that is .... ) . Thanks anyway for the consideration , Foo *giggles* <p> It took a while before I saw myself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because everybody else started to call me one . Mike , you 're an artist in my book aswell ! Get used to the title , it 's yours ! . <p> Well , since it seems that it 's sort-of kosher to be requesting artwork of our old CoH characters here , I guess I 'll toss a few up since I could use some art of them for my story . <p> Let 's start with a favorite of mine , as should be obvious from my signature : <p> And a reference for just how much of her is purely cybernetic : Her entire body has been replaced over time except for her brain , most of her digestive system , lungs , heart , and supporting muscles and ligaments in the upper torso for the organic components . Even then there 's been heavy cybernetic augmentation to allow for various implants to operate . There is no actual skin left , and it has been years since she 's had a proper sense of touch beyond system diagnostics notifying her of extensive damage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleas . She jumped at the chance to leave the Rogue Isles and to repent the deeds she had done on orders of higher powers . The only problem is that her twin sister was n't coming with her , was begging her to stay . Kelly was a low-potential psychic that had been fully-indoctrinated into the Night Widows . She knew that if Stacy left , they would end up fighting each other , and one of them would either end up dead or crippled if that happened . Stacy had always been rebellious , not liking that she and Kelly had been conscripted into service and even going do far as to ' deface ' her crab-pack weapons by having names engraved on the blade of each leg . Vigilance , Duty , Penance and Honor . <p> Alas , poor Kelly ended up being tortured after Stacy deserted the cause . Brainwashing is a horrible thing when it is used to twist your love for your only sibling into blind hatred and a thirst for revenge so intense that even mentioning her name is enough to incite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close as possible to each other as a show of their sisterly bond , Kelly chose to make hers more visibly malevolent after her ' second indoctrination ' both to distance herself from the deserter 's image and to help strike a bit more fear . She also changed her operative name to an old curse she remembered from a fantasy novel ; Kolsen'shea Orbb - Pull the legs off a spider . Something she intended to do the next time they two of them met . <p> And yes , the two of them are HEAVILY influenced by Beast Wars-era Blackarachnia . <p> Hey , I took a shot at Lynx but not sure if I 'm getting the ears/head piece right . <p> The more I tried working with the Caracal ( the Cat image posted ) I could n't get it to look right . So ... did a bit of google and went with something a bit more like a real Lynx . I was going for a bit more feral - sort of a cross between Hawkgirl 's helmet and Wolverine 's look ... which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than my previous five attempts . ( Trust me ... this is better than the last couple tries . ) <p> Here 's a little something I was working on and finally finished . Cobblecrow . Afterglow , I hope I got it right , because the refs were a bit unclear as the images were small and barely had details . Figured I 'd go with a portrait again , leaving the suit to imagination . Click on the image to go to my DA page where you can download the original file . <p> P.S. I left a copy ( with link to drawing without background ) in the Collab Thread . <p> I always feel strange going in on threads like these because i feel bad requesting art with no compensation for the artist : -x But if anyone would like to do one of my characters i would appreciate it , Let 's see if i can do this IMG tag thing right .... <p> These are of my default hero Titan , your basic super strength and invulnerable flying brick . Personality wise he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who would n't be when they can just shrug off tank guns and cannon fire ? : -p ) and on a bad day maybe even come off as a bit smug , but is a true hero and tries his best to make the world a better place and protect those who ca n't protect themselves . <p> First a picture of him standing neutrally , masked and unmasked ( if it helps ) , Then one of him in his standard pose ( his silver tights are supposed to be somewhat metallic , like a dull mylar ) Both were done in heromachine 3 , great program for the artistically impaired like me ! <p> Also here is his Emblem i designed , and a shot from how he looked in CoX for reference ( did n't  have any good medium length slicked back hair in C0X : -/ ) <p> Great refs Zanje ! That 's a neat trick , working with Heromachine . Great for creating a global idea of your character . <p> Thanks ! it really is , i use it a lot for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character i can visualize , just not put to paper myself . I totally recommend to anyone who wants to get their creative juices flowing : - ) also editted my post to add some personality info . <p> Hello , I 'd like to request art of my main from CoV , " GS Necro " , Galrithius Songtum Necrobis , a Necro/Dark Mastermind . He occupied two costumes , an old armour and skulls one , and a high tech Star Lords ( the SG my dad and I founded ) outfit . <p> It 's unfortunate my old tower 's HDD had to have a corruption of sort , so not all screenshots were preserved , here are the best I could come up with . <p> The costume is tights , with , as seen in the screen , grey bands on the wrists and calves , stars from the waist and shoulder , and a large star logo on the chest . The chest logo would ideally be more glossy , with the middle of the star more glass-like , like the texture of Obsidian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head had a cowl that covers up to his nose , and a facepiece that covers the rest of his face , from nose to hairline ( The vanguard facepeice was used ) , and the hair itself was fairly spiked , but i prefer the hair as shown in my avatar , from the Hero Machine . he had a black cape that covered his shoulders ( above the tech pads , covering the medial half ) . The costume is very dark overall , with facepeices , hair , and cowl being pitch black . <p> The Rocket boots were added to this costume in a later addition , and his dark blasts and eye aura were coloured dark purple , to mimic the warshade aura . <p> Here is an early version of the skulls and armour costume <p> Unfortunately , this was then SG colours were on , the yellow parts are usually a dark red . As seen , the hair is the same , though later I had greyish strands were the yellow was . I 'd 've liked the eyebrows to be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyes blank , with no vessels , iris , or pupil . The chest normally had a large skull , but again , SG mode : p. the boots were very much like the gloves , skulls . Rather than the " insectoid armour " in CoH , I 'd 've liked something more like the daedric armour ( minus kilt and shoulders ) , like below . <p> The dark blasts were much like the Legacy version , with a slight tint of red . <p> I 've done drawings on descriptions before . The outcome really depends on how specific your description is , how much of a perfectionist you are about the outcome , and if your artist and you are able/willing to work together on it . <p> Her body is fit and defined , incredibly so for her age and her muscle , while not distracting is visible to the naked eye even underneath her unzipped black leather jacket , scarlet lace top , black skinny jeans , and midnight shaded ugs . <p> Her skin is pale , not unusually so but noticeable enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally curly strands of auburn near scarlet hair held within a fashionable French bun . Her most striking feature however are her eyes , a piercing and rather hypnotizing hazel , once you catch her gaze it 's very difficult to pull away . Lastly , the effect worthy of note on her person is a pristine golden necklace draped carefully upon her neck , it 's centerpiece a milky scarlet opal that appears to shift inside it 's form as it catches the beams from the skylight above . <p> " <p> " Never argue with stupid people ; they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience . " <p> Alright , to clarify , she is a teenager , of Eastern European descent , age 16 . Her height is 5 ' 7 , her weight is a healthy 125 pounds , and her race is a Vampire , hence her paleness ! Her power aside from the standard vampiric abilities is persuasion and coercion via locking eyesight , so her eyes are visually hypnotizing and slightly chromatic . And lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I hope this does help clarify things ! <p> " <p> " Never argue with stupid people ; they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience . " <p> This is a fashion design trick , but for me , I make an empty folder with the character 's name , and I fill it full of : <p> 2 ) Images of the actor the client suggested 3 ) If they wear a specific kind of clothing or armor , more images of these things , both for texture , design , color and detail , whether ornate or simple 4 ) color palettes of other paintings I like that give me a mood I want to use for this character 5 ) weapon or item references , in your case it would be jewelry related <p> When my folder is full to the point of the imagery is making me dying to draw . I start sketching . <p> Some clients already have ideas of these kinds of details . So I ask them to send me things that inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images similar to what I placed in my folder , but if they had a specific idea , I want to know that , so I do n't have to guess . <p> Guessing sucks , guessing is time consuming . Guessing is time not spent drawing . <p> If the client does n't know their character , it 's like pulling teeth from a non-visual person to THINK visually . And that 's usually what I end up doing . <p> However if the client really knows their vision , they 've already done a lot of this kind of thinking for years . My job is to filter that info into something agreed upon OR aethetically pleasing enough in my style to make them happy . <p> So while you have narrowed somethings down , Foo had to do the dental work ... <p> In the end this is like a cheesy lawyer commercial , " Help us , help you ... " : D 
@@79253476 @753476/ <h> What do you want to do ... AS A VILLAIN <p> COH added robbing a single solitary bank . I want to rob every store .

I so wanted to go there order a meal and then rob the joint . <p> ***and I want to somehow enrich myself through robberies . I want a tangible reward . I want to see a rising dollar figure . maybe even ( date I say it ? ) in game credits ? <p> I want NPC super heroes that show up in my solo adventures . Cops are nice but i want recurring supers in the standard offered adventures . This is NOT a nemesis , but a small cast of heroes made just for NPCs in MWM official story lines. , , give the bosses a cape . <p> I want to beat a gang into submission . they are MY gang now . and I get 10% of the take . Later I want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme to build a super weapon ... where I have to get the parts by robbing science land and industrial parks . I want a mad scheme to turn the cops into mindless apes by poisoning their donuts . <p> I want to steal cars and wreck them . I want the price on my head to increase ... in fact , I want my notoriety determined by how much I am worth . <p> It occurred to me a while back that the reason it 's always been hard to allow for " true villainy " in a game like CoH ( and now CoT ) is that villains tend to be the group that " causes " all the problems in the first place . What I mean by that is that they are the ones who have to dream up brand new nefariously creative plans to make something happen in a superhero world - all the heroes have to do is reactively stop whatever the villains try to start . <p> Since heroes are mostly reactionary it 's relatively easy to make a MMO game revolve around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot at like a big grandiose version of whack-a-mole . But the real trick is to provide roleplay opportunities ( many of which are n't even strictly combat oriented ) for the villain players to do which give them the illusion of being free to be bad FIRST before heroes ( either NPC or PC ) react to them . <p> Having more places to rob and having local gangs to dominate/subjugate are good ideas . The simplistic Mayhem missions CoH did provide were a good start for pure anarchy . For higher level villains having quests to get pieces to build doomsday devices or find evidence to blackmail high ranking public officials would be cool . Maybe the game could have a whole unique set of permanent NPC civilian contacts who can be " manipulated " to certain degrees by doing various repeatable daily missions ( like kidnapping family members or other forms of intimidation/coercion ) that hurt them in some way . These contacts would be available to everyone and your interaction with them would be completely relative to how each of your characters have worked either for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be used by heroes ( assuming your character chooses to do missions that actually help these contacts instead of hurt them ) . <p> The problem is with the crazy ones . The ones that want to blow up the world . By definition you can not let them ' win ' otherwise game over . Similarly if they set out on a quest to destroy Anthem and her bunch of henchmen you ca n't let them win because that would ruin the story line for everyone who has not yet reached that spot in the mission chain . It 's fine to do that in a single player game where your success means you 've won the game and you alone are done . Even heroes have a similar problem they ca n't ever truly defeat a prominent villain because then they would destroy that story line . <p> This is why I almost never play an evil character . I 'm usually smarter than the story ... and more ruthless .

You probably wont ever be in a total position of power within a given gang . You wont be able to oust the head of the Triad , but you might make it to the top circle or a place of special status outside the standard power structure . So in that regard I expect COT to be better than COH . Time will tell . <p> As far as rewards go , you 'll be rewarded for successfully breaking into a bank but you get a similar cut to the heroes that stopped the robbery at the bank across the street .

Being an " evil " character is far more viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keeping the world 's " status quo " intact like you are in a MMORPG . <p> This kind of " being stuck inside the box " limitation has always been the fundamental weakness of MMORPGs . As time goes on the technology will allow for more and more sandbox-style freedoms and hopefully like you say CoT will push the boundaries even further . <p> Hey , it 's hard as a Hero , too , because the Villain always gets away ! ( So they can pester the next hero . ) Be Well ! Fireheart <p> For what it 's worth there could be more events/activities provided in a game like CoT that could give heroes alternative things to do as well . For instance one of the few special things CoH offered were the semi-random building fires .

I suppose you could just blame all those silly parents out there who do n't want 8 year old Johnny/Jane seeing hyper-naughty things ... <p> Really is Johnny/Jane that are the evilest villains . Keeping me from my " hyper-naughty things " <p> It really is a challenge being a villain in a teen rated setting . Certainly any teen would know about the evilest and most vile things that would make a villain villainous , but to actually do those things or simulate them is beyond the boundaries of the game . You look at a classic show like Batman TAS and certainly the Joker is a Villain , but you rarely see him in the act . COT is bound the same way . If they faded to black or panned away every time a villain did something rightfully villainous , a player would spend most of the time starring at a black screen . <p> Well I think we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few posts that are probably acceptable for a MMORPG . The real key is to realize there plenty of types of " crime " ( implied or otherwise ) that could still be carried out despite living under the dictates of a Teen rating . <p> The main things the Teen rating would probably prevent ( crime-wise ) are things like the graphical depiction of drug use and nastiness like overt sadism or torture . Standard gun-fights are fine but being able to pull a victim 's fingernails off as a " fun " little mini-game probably would n't be kosher . It 's really the same kind of " common sense " stuff we 've come to know from what they can and ca n't get away with on standard network television . Sadly the harsher stuff you can see on HBO might be a bit too much for CoT . <p> That still leaves plenty of " bad stuff " on the table . For instance there might be a mission where a villainous character could " poison the water supply " of a neighborhood . Succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villainous faction and get you hated by the normal civilians but there 's no real need to graphically show a bunch of dead bodies or people puking up their guts or whatever . The " nastiness " happens without having to have it be overt or gratuitous . <p> HornetsNest wrote : Villainy is always riskier the heroism .

I 'm flattered that you took my little piece of prose as seriously as you did though <p> I only took it " seriously " enough to point out the practicality that villains would need to rise through the ranks before they 'd get to do the types of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious carnage until your inevitable fall " and " boot-heeling fallen heroes " were flowery enough dramatic images but no matter how well CoT feeds your villain 's lust/ego it 's still ( sadly perhaps ) going to have to conform to its default Teen rating . Save the well written yet vaguely imprecise RP prose for the game . <p> P.S. Do n't worry , I did n't take you " literally " on any of this ... *shrugs* <p> I want to beat a gang into submission . they are MY gang now . and I get 10% of the take . Later I want to take over a real mob . <p> There is the obvious problem with a system that serves up free loot to players , but I can see potential for such " gangs " ( perhaps several individuals a hero is mentoring , or some civilian group ( akin to CAP ) that the hero supports ) to deliver clues . Thus , every so often , they essentially deliver a mission that 's something too tough for the " mooks " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful and serve some purpose , even if it 's just to be noticed and provide some color , between those big ' delivery ' moments . <p> Lothic wrote : <p> It occurred to me a while back that the reason it 's always been hard to allow for " true villainy " in a game like CoH ( and now CoT ) is that villains tend to be the group that " causes " all the problems in the first place . What I mean by that is that they are the ones who have to dream up brand new nefariously creative plans to make something happen in a superhero world - all the heroes have to do is reactively stop whatever the villains try to start . <p> That is the problem in a nutshell . Players play - i.e. react to - the game . In single player games it is easier to provide the illusion that the player is in charge and that the game is reacting to the player , but that 's much more difficult , if not impossible , in a MMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes are about maintaining the status quo ( or at the least working within the system to change it ) while villains are about breaking the status quo . MMOs can not change* , so it 's easy to see which group is going to have a better time of it . <p> You know what I think would make villain mission interesting ? Inter villain politics ... can my Head scientist in charge of making my army of robots be trusted ? Or is he going to take control of the whole shebang and try to kill me ... can I trust Lady Poison to keep her end of the bargain ? Or should I try to kill her early just incase ... building a ray gun is all well and good , but we are going to need more than heroes trying to stop us to keep interested , lucky there 's no honour among thieves : <p> That is an interesting idea and raises the point of leveraging whatever mission architect CoT will have . The best source of new content for players are other players . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the longest in a MMO : they are able to create and provide their own new content . <p> If MWM ever picks up on the whole Control Points thing I 've been going on about for a couple of years , you 'd have the opportunity for Turf Battles to " control the soul of the city " ... <p> The idea actually existed in the first game design docs put together by the first team . So going back to over 3 years ago . Things changed over time with company splits , teams changing , and the iterative process of design . <p> If anything like this were to exist it would most likely be on the pvp side , as the guideline is that all forms of pvp even pvevp must be entirely optional . Which is another way of saying , the idea is not within the current scope of the game for launch or even quite some time post launch . I do like the idea as it could lead to some interesting gameplay elements , but It will have to be reintroduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot of implementation . <p> Now as to villains gaining control of organizations , this would be , in a sense , a type of RTS game play . Where the player now has to manage resources ( which includes their npcs ) to maintain and even attempt to grow their organization . It would also require a possible diplomacy system for negotiating with other underworld organizations ( be it with other PCs or even NPCs ) . This is a much larger impact on the game world over the Path system . Unfortunately , this level of design also does n't fit within the current scope of the game . And would be more difficult to implement after the game is live . <p> However , starting , and maintaining a super group even as a villain does offer a few similar elements . This , of course , would rely heavily on interaction with other players , and could afford said group of players plenty of role-play opportunities . And there is a possibility we could implement a tag to super groups hooking into the faction rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying your colors " within the game world . <p> Also , we do have plans to introduce a system for " crafting missions " called Schemes and Investigations . Where villains hatch plans and heroes investigate crimes . They are separate so player heroes wo n't be investigating a player villain 's scheme ( but that is n't to say that npcs wo n't show up to attempt at foiling the scheme ) . <p> I would like to see a bank robbery where the heroes could respond and there would be some PvP . <p> One could have a sewer access into the good town , and the villain then zips into the bank or store right there , which may or may not already have people in it . Then they rob it , alarm is set off , can they get out the door and down the sewer before intercept ? Heroes in zone or nearby would get radio calls or whatever . <p> These would n't be missions on either side . Just optional activities always available . Trying to pull it away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to stop invasion . But that rarely happens in practice in places like Stormwind on WoW on the PvP servers . <p> " <p> <p> The very existence of the taunting tank irritates , for it requires idiotic AI that obeys the taunt . <p> What i would like is the option to choose if my Villain is lethal or non lethal . If they are recognized as a Professional or Maniac , Monster or Man . <p> Getting slightly different options/reactions from people is the most I 'd expect though . If I 'm recognized as a Maniac who murders people for fun and profit ( Sometimes not the profit ) I 'd expect a reaction along the lines of Cops running away ( Beat cops that is ) or at best trying to get Civilians to safety and confronting me if I 'm attacking them/the Civvies . They would call in the Bigger guns to deal with the situation . If i on the other hand have a reputation for not causing casualties and leaving once I 've done the task ... then the Cop might rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't Kill them , in an effort to push me into leaving sooner , rather then risking violence that is unneeded . <p> I 'd Also love to be able to Play a crook who never has a " Presence " that is a mystery with their crimes .

And if a low level villian has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a group of player heroes has taken it upon themselves to keep their portion of the city safe , then the low level villian will either have to snatch purses in another part of town or obtain the help of higher level villians .

I wan na create my own lair in a variety of cool environments , basically anything that has ever been done in James Bond and then some . I wan na invade goody-two-shoes bases and lay waste to them ! <p> Maybe you could come up with a sort of guild versus guild PvP where a guild 's base is the battleground . You could use this to attempt to free/take prisoners , steal/reclaim secret technology , etc . Maybe make a kind of KotH meta out of it where there are a number of artifacts or individuals scattered around the world that give boons to the guilds currently holding them in their possession , and make people fight for them . Kind of like how you have to fight for legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be on the other spectrum here . I had a few villains who were willing and able and inclined to do super nasty things for the lulz . <p> But I also had mercenaries who were perfectly willing to rob a bank or beat up a hero for money , but would draw the line at murder or maiming innocents .

What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is not something that has been disclosed to my knowledge . <p> What I would suggest is that both for heros/villains is hiding of the identity and being defeated can lead to your identity being revealed and thus you not being able to walk to streets incognito , being able to blend in with the common crowd to ambush your super hero enemy etc . <p> But my primary aim if i was to play as a villain would be to be an anti-villain , one with some sort of moral compass , I may not dispatch my enemies , I may turn of my " allies " depending on the actions they perform tec . <p> Ok , I 'm going to be annoying and cross-post from a similar thread , just because it is something I feel strongly about : <p> No telling exactly how all this will actually play out . While it 's cool that under certain circumstances heroes and villains will be able to work together as they did at times in comics and in CoH , I do hope that the classic comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so blurred that it becomes inconsequential to gameplay . <p> The hero/villain dichotomy is a fundamental aspect of the genre--though so is occasionally blurring it . Just not so often that it becomes effectively meaningless . <p> I agree with Emp . I liked the **28;850;TOOLONG thing they had in CoX . I think the hard part of that is the fact that reproducing it that way necessitates having a divided player base vis a vis the hero zones and villain zones . I think it would be best to avoid that for a number of reasons . As the CoX devs used to complain , they had to write content for basically two separate games , but they could only call it one game and were not paid double and did n't get double staffing to help do it all . Also , the players at largest played WAY more blueside than redside . I myself never got a villain to level 50 , but had like 6 heroes at 50 and a few others that I either deleted or had n't gotten fully leveled yet by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development between heroes &amp; villains in CoX is part of why I did n't get invested in playing on the villain side . If villains were playable from the beginning it might have been different . I liked the concept of how villains in CoV navigated their first dozen or so levels . I appreciated the tone of the missions and the feel of the villain side of the world . <p> There were three big problems with CoV for me though ( for reference , I stopped playing CoX somewhere around 2007 ) . Mentally I identified CoH as a hero game , and by the time CoV got bolted on I could n't fully commit to the villain side . Second , the mesh of the two CoH/CoV worlds had limited permeability . I did n't necessarily want to go stomping around on heroes , but it felt like they were two separate games . Third , I did n't feel a sense of agency while playing my villains . It felt like I was playing a reskinned hero . I would have wanted an option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minions and only get his hands dirty when success is absolutely necessary . But then I feel that would have played more like a spy RPG than a punch ' em up . <p> As a villain , I want the capability to operate like a shadowrunner in the sense that I go about committing my crimes under a false identity ( either to shield myself or to implicate someone else ) . If I feel the heat , I shed the identity ( or move to a new location ) . Maybe if my character shifts enough blame to a villain group it can open up an opportunity ( steal something from the group or hit a target while the heroes are preoccupied ) . <p> In CoH , defeated heroes respawned at the hospital . The XP debt encouraged you not to get defeated often . I want to make respawning as a villain an interesting experience . What if a villain that gets defeated in a ' hero ' neighborhood has a solid false identity and they get an option to respawn in a nearby hospital ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The benefit of having a good cover is that you do n't have to muck around with breaking out of jail or the sanitarium . Maybe if you build up a good reputation with a criminal group they stage a rescue from police custody before you get locked up ( full XP debt , i.e. you ' owe ' your guys ) and you get patched up by their doctor/voodoo priest/med bay . What if when you get defeated in ' villain ' areas you get patched up by the local underground/discredited doctor ( full XP debt ) . <p> In a general sense , heroes stop villains from completing some nefarious plan . Flipping that around , I do n't have a good idea of how to enable villains to set your nefarious plan in motion ( outside of user created content ) . Brain will revisit this later . 
@@79253478 @753478/ <h> Server software in the box ? <p> I was down at my favorite watering hole the other day and ran across a fellow gamer . We talked games for awhile and it turned out his favorite game was Grand Theft Auto . I 've never played GTA , but according to him , GTA IV included in the PC box a copy of the server . Apparently the idea was that players could set up their own private server , open it to the public , and people could join them there . Kind of a mini-MMORPG version of GTA IV . <p> And then Cyclops came along with his ambivalent request for " super villains at level one " . <p> Free association as that thread unfolded brought to mind The Mighty Paladin wanting a game with no levels and nothing but endless street crime to fight . <p> Pieces began falling into place and I could not help but wonder . <p> Would it be possible , or even advisable , for Missing Worlds Media to include server software in their boxed product ? <p> Assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for things like a world with no level progression but full access to power sets . It should also have the ability to use the character creator to create a custom cast of signature NPCs , both heroic and villainous . If possible , it should include map creation software allowing the private server to feature a completely unique map using the same building models with , of course , interior options where appropriate . Door assignment for instanced missions , and so on . <p> I know . It 's crazy . How could MWM hope to profit from this strategy ? Well , there are a couple of possibilities . They could sell advertising space for private servers in the main server version of the game . They could forge a link between the private servers and the ingame store at the main server so that people using the private servers would buy consumables and bonus products from the MWM store . They could charge a monthly fee for setting up a private server that would be a percentage of the normal subscription fee . Perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private server versions that charged a fee . ( Probably too difficult to implement , but it is an idea . ) <p> One thing is certain , if the box included server software and the download did not , then it would provide an extra incentive to buy the box . It would also be the perfect solution to one of their stated goals : preserving access to the game even if MWM itself disappeared . <p> As far as I know it was already planned to give players access to an empty version of the game which then could be modded and filled with NPCs and missions . And used as a private server . I am not sure though . <p> I second that , Lutan . I do n't have a source handy at the moment , but I believe MWM 's intention is to give players the ability to run private servers so that CoT does n't suffer the same fate as CoX in the event of MWM 's demise . I ca n't say whether or not tthe ability to host a private server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game 's launch though . It 'd be great to have a dev deliver a verdict on it if they have n't done so already . <p> assuming there were private servers running at the same time as the game proper , it could prove to be interesting . depending on how much players can modify the existing game I honestly believe there could be private " public " servers out there that could eventually rival MWM 's own in terms of player population . I could easily see myself checking a few out if it happened . <p> the biggest down side for allowing this to happen is the fracturing of the player base . <p> I am also curious that if this were to happen , how do they handle the store items ... do the private servers get access to that information ? or will it just be the basics and nothing extra ? if it is just the basics ... and the idea is that they are going this route ( giving out the the server info ) to ensure that CoT can stay alive after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to look extremely hard at how they plan to implement a cash store . with a general subscription model ... easy peasy to implement as the players already have access to everything ... but with a cash store .... suddenly things got a lot harder .... <p> I think you will like our solution . Now that I am not on a phone I can go further into details . If you 'd recall in our update on the server technology , we said we were using Unreal 's inherent server as our foundation . Those who think about it would realize that the server for Unreal is the client , running in a special headless mode . All we have to do is not remove this feature from the client , and give instructions on how to launch your own client as a server . I am never one to engage in extra work , so we simply do not plan to remove this feature of the client . Now , running in this mode you will have to load up maps , missions , NPC 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own private adventures will reflect in our global statistics , but for those who wish to , yes , the plan is to allow just this . <p> If you 'd recall in our update on the server technology , we said we were using Unreal 's inherent server as our foundation .

And typically you do not have 100 different features all running on server instances . <p> However , if someone has a powerful enough system out there , enough to keep their pool of friends playing the game , even when the game is running ? Yeah , I can see myself go " screw paying MWM the funds , I would rather pay LESS to my friend to keep his server up " . <p> And then there are the client side mods/hacks and what not . Remember , if you give the server out to the players , so that it is enough for them to play the game , then they WILL have a tool in their hands enabling them to introduce hacks/checks into the main game . <p> It is also yet ( another ) product that they have to maintain . <p> They already have several costume creators to maintain ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMO side as well . That is a LOT of work ahead of them ... <p> " <p> Quote : <p> 1 ) I reject your reality .... and substitute my own 2 ) Not to be used when upset ... will void warranty 3 ) Stoke me a clipper i will be back for dinner 4 ) I have seen more intelligence from an NPC AI in TR beta , than from most MMO players . <p> There is a downside to including server software with the game : You are giving people a reason to NOT pay their subscription fee and to play on their own server .

That is a LOT of work ahead of them ... <p> If I understood what Doctor Tyche was saying about the Unreal engine there 's going to be a fairly thin line drawn between what 's considered a " client " for this game and a " server " . Basically it sounds like with relatively few modifications a knowledgeable person can switch the operation of the application from being one or the other fairly easily with Unreal . <p> Now I would agree with you that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own private CoT servers that some subset of the playerbase would likely " branch off " to play on their own and stop bothering to pay MWM for anything . I do n't really know how hard it would be to prevent people from enabling their own servers outside of MWM 's control , but if there was a way to stop people from doing it until MWM officially allowed it I 'd be fine with that . This would mean the only way to play CoT would be via a traditional connection to MWM 's official servers until such time as MWM had to permanently close its operations . Only then would it " let the cat out of the bag " for private servers to allow people to play AFTER MWM was gone . <p> As far as mods/hacks go MWM will have to worry about preventing people from doing that against the official servers regardless if they let people have their own private servers or not . I have to assume that the only way they 'll let you connect and play on one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game so being able to easily hack the official servers should remain relatively difficult for most people to do . <p> Again if they decide to reserve the " nuclear option " ( of letting players have access to setting up their own servers only until after MWM is shutdown ) then there would n't really be a question of " maintaining multiple products " because that scenario would only happen if for some reason MWM was going out of business . <p> On the other hand , people who play on a private server do not cost Missing Worlds Media anything . If thy play locally or host their own servers , that does not put strain on MWM servers . And they would have to buy the game first . <p> And how many people will really do that ? If there was a fully developed game world out there I could play in , with an engaging story and many other people to team up with , I think I would prefer that over having an empty world I have to fill with missions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who play on a private server do not cost Missing Worlds Media anything . If thy play locally or host their own servers , that does not put strain on MWM servers . And they would have to buy the game first . And how many people will really do that ? If there was a fully developed game world out there I could play in , with an engaging story and many other people to team up with , I think I would prefer that over having an empty world I have to fill with missions and contend myself . <p> I 'll be playing this game regardless if MWM let 's us have private servers while the " official " game is still running or not . I might even dabble with a private server for myself if it 's allowed , but I fully intend to financially support MWM regardless of whose server I 'm playing on . I 'm just considering the possible scenario where there 's a breaking point of having too many people playing on their private servers ( and not paying MWM anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating . <p> Now if there are enough people who would want to play on their private servers but are ALSO willing to occasionally pay MWM for periodic " official " updates then more power to them . I 'm just weighing the pros and cons of allowing private servers to operate freely while an official game is also being maintained by MWM . It 's a serious question that needs to be addressed . <p> Depends on how " controlling " you want to be of the game itself . Allowing people to set up their own servers is a hedge against a " going out of business " condition similar to what happened to Paragon Studios . It also creates opportunities for applicants to join the Development team to DEMONSTRATE their ideas in ways that can be peer reviewed , without having to fall back on the " Trust me , I know what I 'm doing " line of reasoning . That then makes it " easier " for MWM to appeal to a wider range of potential Developers and improve the pool of talent that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more of a " sideways " expansion rather than a " vertical " one of creating competitors that will push MWM out of business . It 's a move that makes the game Mod Friendly , rather than keeping it a hermetically sealed " walled garden " type of affair . At that point , you 're dealing with the difference between open source and closed source when it comes to potential future developments , talents and recruiting for staff . <p> " 106467 @qwx726467 <p> Another thing to keep in mind is that the built-in UE4 " server " ( headless client ) is really just a LAN-party kind of implementation ; it may or may not scale to high ( Atlas 33 ) player counts . Also , I 'm guessing that at least part of the rules resolution part of the game ( especially the parts that the UE4 client does n't handle itself at all ) might be only implemented on their servers , so a private server would have to replace this or do without somehow . <p> But this makes me happy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MWM shuts down at some point , the game can survive , fragmented as may be . This is a much better outcome than CoH got . So long as CoT launches , its worst case outcome will still be far better than CoH 's . <p> But this makes me happy on one level at least : should worst come to worst and MWM shuts down at some point , the game can survive , fragmented as may be . This is a much better outcome than CoH got . So long as CoT launches , its worst case outcome will still be far better than CoH 's . <p> And might have Tony host a script on the Titan Network as the main listing of private servers .
