In the United States there are a few options for Forex Trader . First of all , the explosion of the retail forex market has caused the IRS to fall behind the curve in many ways , so the current rules that are in place concerning forex tax reporting could change any time . Regulations are continually being instituted in the forex market , so always make sure you confer with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are essentially two sections defined by the IRS that apply to forex traders - section 988 and section 1256 . Section 1256 is the standard 60/40 capital gains tax treatment . This is the most common way that forex traders file forex profits . Under this tax treatment , 60% of total capital gains are taxed at 15% and the remaining 40% of total capital gains are taxed at your current income tax bracket , which could currently be as high as 35% . Profitable traders prefer to report forex trading profits under section 1256 because it offers a greater tax break than section 988 . <p> Losing trader tend to prefer section 988 because there is no capital-loss limitation , which allows for full standard loss treatment against any income . This will help a trader take full advantage of trading losses in order to decrease taxable income . <p> In order to take advantage of section 1256 , a trader must opt-out of section 988 , but currently the IRS does not require a trader to file anything to report that he is opting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose more than $2 million in any single tax year , you may qualify to file a Form 886 . <p> If your broker is based in the United States , you will receive a 1099 at the end of the year reporting your total gains/losses . This number should be used to file taxes under either section 1256 or section 988 . <h> U.K. <p> Forex trading tax laws in the U.K. are much more trader-friendly than the United States . Currently , spread betting profits are not taxed in the U.K. , and many U.K. brokers offer retail forex demo and regular accounts in a spread betting structure . This means a trader can trade the forex market and be free from paying taxes ; thus , forex trading is tax-free ! This is incredibly positive for profitable forex traders in the U.K. <p> The drawback to spread betting is that a trader can not claim trading losses against his other personal income .

There are different pieces of legislation in process that could change forex tax laws very soon .

There are many types of forex software that can help you learn to trade the forex market . This type of business formation is very risky because you must make sure you are abiding 100% by tax laws and not slipping into illegal activities . This type of operation should be carried out only with the help of a tax professional , and it may be best to confirm with at least 2 tax professionals to make sure you are making the right decisions .

@@109297239 @4697239/ <h> Israel : F.A.Q. <p> 1 . Service Provider - Recording a post-dated check.Question : I am a service provider ( engineer , bookkeeper and the like ) and I use a " tax invoice/receipt " form . How should I act when I receive a post-dated check ? Can I wait till the date of payment and then issue a " tax invoice/receipt " ? Answer : In no circumstances . Failure to issue a receipt immediately on receipt constitutes grounds for disqualification of books . Nevertheless , it is best to differentiate between 2 possibilities : Possibility 1 : Let us assume that on 1.1.2000 , you received a check postdated to 29.1.2000 . Here it is worth issuing a tax invoice/receipt immediately 1.1.2000 In any case , the basis for the payment of VAT and prepayment of taxes is until 31.1.2000 regardless of whether the payment was made on the first or the last of the month .

Renting an apartment - obligation to issue a tax invoice.Question : I am an employee and rent out an apartment that I own . Am I obliged to issue a tax invoice ? Answer : Renting out an apartment for residential purposes in not liable for VAT . Therefore , you do not have to issue a tax invoice . Nevertheless , if the apartment is rented for business purposes ( such as for a law office ) you are liable for VAT . It is worth pointing out that renting for key money , even for business purposes , is exempt from VAT . <p> 3 .

It is recommended to collect in advance only that part of the income that is attributable until the month of December and then you will be liable for tax only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 . Profits from Securities.Question : Is income from a securities transaction on the Stock Exchange liable for tax ? Answer : As a general rule if you are not a trader in securities and the securities are not recorded in the books of the business ( that is , you bought them privately ) , the income from the securities is tax exempt ( from 1.1.2003 - 15% ) . However , there are a number of tests that the Tax Authorities will apply to decide whether you are a trader in securities and if so , you will be liable for tax on your profits . These are the tests . The Frequency Test - If the frequency of the transactions you carry out is high ( for instance , if you carry out a buying and selling transaction every day ) this would seemingly testify to the commercial character of the operations . The Risk Test - If the stock that you buy has a speculative character , this points in a commercial direction , if on the other hand , the main securities portfolio that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , bank shares , solid companies , bonds ) these transactions have no commercial character . The Extent test - If the extent of your profits from securities represents a comparatively high percentage of your normal income ( as an employed or as a self employed person ) this testifies to seemingly commercial transactions . For instance , if your normal monthly income is NIS 500 and your monthly income from transactions on the Stock Exchange is NIS 4000 , you are a serious candidate for " treatment " from the Tax Authorities . The subject is sensitive and complicated but the lines drawn above have " contributed " to determining the type of your transactions . The aforementioned may be applied as well in all that is connected with coins and medallions , forward transactions ( currency futures ) and more . <p> 6 .

Can I offset the loss against other income I have as an employed person.Answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against income for that year from any source whatsoever , including a salary , another business or a capital gain . Say , for example , that in the year 2000 , you opened a business ( an automobile repair garage ) and in addition you have income from employment ( a lecturer ) and another business as a self-employed person ( a restaurant ) . If the operations of the garage finish the year 2000 with a loss , you can offset the loss against your income as an employed person ( lecturer ) and against your income as a self-employed person as a restaurateur . Similarly , if you had a capital gain ( let us assume from selling tables from the restaurant ) you can offset the loss from the garage against the capital gain . In the following tax year , 2001 , the situation is different .

However , you can not set the loss from 2000 against income as an employed person in the year 2001 . <p> 7 . Medications for Tax Purposes.Question : Does the purchase of medications constitute a recognized expenditure for tax purposes ? Answer : If this concerns first aid equipment that is to be found in a first aid kit on the business premises , this is a recognized expense for tax purposes . Thus , for example , Band-Aids , bandages , hydrogen peroxide , a first aid box and the like will be considered a recognized expense for tax purposes . On the other hand , medication for repeated personal use that is prescribed for you by a physician is not considered a business expense . It is reasonable to assume that medications such as aspirin or medicines for the relief of cold symptoms and the like that are prescribed as well for employees will be considered a recognized expense by the Tax Authorities .

Changes in the Chinese market have a considerable effect on the world economy .

The economic revolution in China began in 1978 when the Government contributed to turning a Communist-style centralized economy to one that operates on the principles of a market economy . The steps towards modernization led to a tremendous increase in foreign investments in China and to the abolition or replacement of factories that were controlled centrally by the Government and turning them into separate entities that could be controlled by local managers .

However , during the period of depreciation , the company may not alter the method of depreciation . Similarly , should the ownership of the asset change during the period of depreciation , the new purchaser may not alter the method of depreciation that was selected by the original owner .

In Dubai , the authorities have deliberately sought to create an environment which is well ordered without being unduly restrictive . As a result , Dubai offers businessmen operating conditions that are among the most liberal and attractive in the region . <p> There are many options open to international companies seeking to establish a business relationship with Dubai . Apart from forming a trading relationship , for many companies there are distinct advantages in being on-the-spot to research market prospects , make contacts , liaise with customers , and see through the details of any transactions and orders secured . <p> Having a presence can provide considerable business advantages in the Middle East . Businessmen in the region prefer to deal with someone they know and trust and personal relationships are much more important in doing business in the Arab world than they are in western Europe or America . Also , the buying patterns of some countries served by Dubai tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and information . <h> To know more about doing business in Dubai <h> Dubai Licensing <p> The basic requirement for all business activity in Dubai is one of the following three categories of licences : <p> These licences are all issued by the Dubai Economic Department . However , licences for some categories of business require approval from certain ministries and other authorities : for example , banks and financial institutions from the Central Bank of the UAE ; insurance companies and related agencies from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce ; manufacturing from the Ministry of Finance and Industry ; and pharmaceutical and medical products from the Ministry of Health . More detailed procedures apply to businesses engaged in oil or gas production and related industries . Practising some trade activities ( e.g. jewellery and insurance ) requires the submission of a financial guarantee issued by a bank operating in Dubai . In general , all commercial and industral businesses in Dubai should be registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry . <h> Dubai Ownership Requirements <p> Fifty-one per cent participation by UAE nationals is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In respect of foreign companies registering branches or a representative office in Dubai . <p> In professional or artisan companies where 100% foreign ownership is permitted . <h> Dubai Legal Structures for Business <p> In the past , each emirate followed its own procedures governing the operations of foreign business interests . In practice , however , Dubai and the other emirates followed the same general system , whereby foreign companies operated in one of three ways : with a local sponsor , through a partnership with a UAE national or company , or through a private limited company or public shareholding company incorporated by Ruler 's decree . <p> Since 1984 , steps have been taken to introduce a codified companies law applicable throughout the UAE . Federal Law No. 8 of 1984 , as amended by Federal Law No. 13 of 1988 - the " Commercial Companies Law " - and its by-laws have been issued . In broad terms the provisions of the Law are as follows : <p> The Federal Law stipulates a total local equity of not less than 51% in any commercial company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UAE . It sets out the requirements in terms of shareholders , directors , minimum capital levels and incorporation procedures . It further lays down provisions governing conversion , merger and dissolution of companies . <p> The seven categories of business organisation defined by the law are : <p> General partnership company <p> Partnership-en-commendam <p> Joint venture company <p> Public shareholding company <p> Private shareholding company <p> Limited liability company <p> Share partnership company <h> Dubai Partnerships <p> Partnership companies are limited to UAE nationals only . The Dubai government does not presently encourage the establishment of partnership-en-commendam and share partnership companies . <h> Dubai Joint Venture Companies <p> A joint venture is a contractual agreement between a foreign party and a local party licensed to engage in the desired activity . The local equity participation in the joint venture must be at least 51% , but the profit and loss distribution can be prescribed . There is no need to license the joint venture or publish the agreement . The foreign partner deals with third parties under the name of the local partner who - unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joint ventures are seen as offering a suitable structure for companies working together on specific projects . <h> Dubai Public and Private Shareholding Companies <p> The Law stipulates that companies engaging in banking , insurance , or financial activities should be run as public shareholding companies . Foreign banks , insurance and financial companies , however , can establish a presence in Dubai by opening a branch or representative office . Shareholding companies are suitable primarily for large projects or operations , since the minimum capital required is Dh . 10 million ( US$ 2.725 million ) for a public company , and Dh . 2 million ( US$ 0.545 million ) for a private shareholding company . The chairman and a majority of directors must be UAE nationals and there is less flexibility of profit distribution than is permissible in the case of limited liability companies . <h> Dubai Limited Liability Companies <p> A limited liability company can be formed by a minimum of two and a maximum of 50 persons whose liability is limited to their shares in the company 's capital . Such companies are recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long term relationship in the local market . In Dubai , the minimum capital is currently Dh . 300,000 ( US$ 82,000 ) , contributed in cash or in kind . While foreign equity in the company may not exceed 49% , profit and loss distribution can be prescribed . Responsibility for the management of a limited liability company can be vested in the foreign or national partners or a third party . The following steps are required in establishing a limited liability company in Dubai . <p> Select a commercial name for the company and have it approved by the Licensing Department of the Economic Department ; <p> Draw up the company 's Memorandum of Association and have it notarised by a Notary Public in the Dubai Courts ; <p> Seek approval from the Economic Department and apply for entry in the Commercial Register ; <p> Once approval is granted , the company will be entered in the Commercial Register and have its Memorandum of Association published in the Ministry of Economy and Commerce 's Bulletin . The licence will then be issued by the Economic Department ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber of Commerce and Industry . <p> &lt; /ul&gt; <h> Branches and Representative Offices of Foreign Commercial Companies in Dubai <p> The Commercial Companies Law also covers the formation and regulation of branches and representative offices of foreign companies in the UAE and stipulates that they may be 100% foreign owned , provided a local agent is appointed . <p> Only UAE nationals or companies 100% owned by UAE nationals may be appointed as local agents ( which should not be confused with the term " commercial agent " ) . Local agents -- also sometimes referred to as sponsors -- are not involved in the operations of the company but assist in obtaining visas , labour cards , etc and are paid a lump sum and/or a percentage of profits or turnover . In general , branches and offices of foreign commercial companies are not licensed to engage in importing activity except for re-export or in the case of products of a highly technical nature . <p> To establish a branch or representative office in Dubai , a foreign commercial company should proceed as follows : <p> Apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitting an agency agreement with a UAE national or 100% UAE owned company . Before issuing the licence , the Ministry will : <p> forward the application to the Economic Department to obtain the approval of the Dubai government ; <p> forward the application specifying the activity that the office or branch will be authorised to undertake in the UAE , to the Federal Foreign Companies Committee for approval ; <p> Once this has been done , the Ministry of Economy and Commerce will issue the required Ministerial licence specifying the activity to be practised by the foreign company ; <p> The branch or office should be entered in the Economic Department 's Commercial Register , and the required licence will be issued ; <p> The branch or office should also be entered in the Foreign Companies Register of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce ; <p> Finally the branch or office should be registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry . <h> Branches and Representative Offices of Foreign Professional Companies in Dubai <p> Branches and representative offices of foreign professional firms may be 100% foreign owned provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local agents . Such agents are not involved in the operations of the firm but assist in obtaining visas , labour cards etc and are paid a lump sum as remuneration . The Economic Department is the authority in charge of licensing such branches or representational offices . <h> Dubai Professional Firms <p> In setting up a professional firm , 100% foreign ownership , sole proprietorships or civil companies are permitted . Such firms may engage in professional or artisan activities but the number of staff members that may be employed is limited . A UAE national must be appointed as local service agent , but he has no direct involvement in the business and is paid a lump sum and/or percentage of profits or turnover . The role of the local service agent is to assist in obtaining licences , visas , labour cards , etc . <p> Can a sole **26;27;TOOLONG company be converted into a L.L.C. ?

For many years the British naval dockyards were the backbone of the Maltese economy . After their closure in 1958 , the docks were nationalized ( in 1973 ) and converted to be used as a commercial shipyard for shipbuilding and shipping-repairs . These branches hold their own despite the recession in merchant shipping .

@@109297606 @4697606/ <h> U.S. Company formation and Registration <p> Registering a Corporation in the U.S. <p> Business Structure - What Is Right for You When considering starting a business , the business entrepreneur will need to decide whether to set up a separate entity for the business . Once the business entrepreneur has decided to set up a separate entity , he or she will need to figure out which type of entity makes the most sense . The most common forms of entities are : corporation , limited liability company , and limited partnership . Each type varies in terms of its ease in creation and maintenance and the tax consequences to the owners . <p> Corporation : The corporation has , until recently , been the most traditional form of business entity . A corporation is owned by one or more stockholders who are issued shares of stock in return for their investment . Although the stockholders may have a role in running the business , their role as stockholders is strictly economic . A stockholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or obligations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Directors , which is elected annually by the stockholders . The Board appoints the corporation 's officers , including a President , Treasurer and Secretary , who are responsible for the day-to-day business affairs of the corporation . A corporation is taxed as a separate entity , without regard to the tax status of the individual shareholders . A shareholder is subject to taxation on a dividend distribution , when the dividends are received . Corporations must comply with many formalities , including annual meetings of the stockholders , election of directors , keeping of minutes and a stock transfer ledger . <p> Limited Liability Company : limited liability company ( " LLC " ) has become a popular alternative to the corporation . An LLC is an unincorporated business organization with at least one member . Members may be individuals , corporations , partnerships , or other LLCs . LLCs offer the limited liability of a corporation , but with fewer formalities or record keeping requirements . An LLC can consist of only one or multiple members . Members should enter into an " Operating Agreement " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding contributions , distributions , allocations of profits and management of the business . LLC is not taxed separately but rather passes through its income , deductions , credits , as well as other items , to its members . <p> Limited Partnership : A limited partnership is a partnership that includes one or more general partners , who are responsible for the management of the business , and limited partners , who have an economic interest in the partnership , but take no part in the management of the business . Limited partnerships are most commonly used in real estate ventures ( although , in recent years , LLC 's are becoming favored alternative entities ) . General partners are personally liable for the obligations of the partnership . Limited partners , like corporate shareholders , are not liable for partnership obligations beyond their financial contributions . Limited partners may not participate in the management of the partnership 's business . <p> When forming a new company , one should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each of the ownership structures . Selecting the right structure can help maximize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered in the decision making process : <p> Does the entrepreneur want to protect personal assets ? <p> Will the business have employees ? <p> Does the business plan to raise capital by selling stock to investors ? <p> Will your business sell products or provide services ? <p> Will family members or friends help operate the business ? <p> Will the business have investors or partners ? <p> The advantages and disadvantages of each will be addressed separately .
