@@110590831 @5990831/ <p> New Year , New You ! Many of us have or are putting together lists of how well improve ourselves this coming year . Its a time of great expectations , but its important to keep your goals simple and constructive . After all , real change happens over time . Do n't  be like all the women who show up at my gym in early January and are long gone by March . <p> Its a simple goal to make , but I 've found that journaling on a daily basis improves my overall well-being immensely . It would be worthwhile for you to invest in a funky notebook or classy leather-bound journal to write down your thoughts this upcoming year . Here are some of the reasons why : <p> ITS CHEAPER THAN THERAPY <p> Did you know that you are your own greatest therapist ? Licensed counselors and psychotherapists guide you into finding the answers you seek within yourself , but you are the one in charge of your own self-help . By no means should journaling be used as a substitute for therapy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to problems in ways that speaking and thinking will never be able to do . Write down your deepest fears , happiest moments , and big dreams . Sometimes these things are too intimate to tell anyone . Writing it down will help you understand yourself better so you will be more aware of when and if you do need help . <p> IT PUTS DIFFICULT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE <p> Writing things down requires you to put into precise words the convoluted thoughts bouncing around in your brain . Breaking down your thoughts and feelings into manageable chunks is sometimes the only way you can think clearly about a problem and come up with a good solution . Sometimes that solution is letting go . Trust me , its a lot harder to end up in a dead-end relationship if you 're admitting that he once again did n't  call you back or once again flirted with another woman . You ca n't help but call yourself and others out , because the truth is there in black and white . <p> IT IMPROVES OVERALL GRATITUDE <p> Most of us get blogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily events allows you to see when good things happen and remember them . The brain generally remembers positive events more clearly , and going over the day often triggers these memories . You can also intentionally write about things you 're excited/happy/grateful about , and dwelling on these releases serotonin ( the happy hormone ) . For this reason , journaling is especially recommended to those who suffer from depression and anxiety disorders . <p> IT HELPS YOU REMEMBER THINGS <p> How many times have you felt dried up for conversation topics ? There 's something about putting pen to paper that helps you keep better track of the goings-on of your day . Thinking about today is one thing , but writing about today is thinking about it twice . For example , have you ever made a grocery list on paper and found you suddenly remembered everything you needed to get without having to consult the list again ?

Journaling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power because you need to be fully engaged in the activity . Studies have shown that reading and writing can improve focus , expand your vocabulary , improve your memory , and much more . Like any muscle , your brain needs exercise in order to function well .

Theyre perfect for those chilly days when you want to warm up from the inside out . Enjoy ! <p> 1 . Crock-Pot Cheeseburger Soup <p> Who says we cant make our favourite thing into a soup ? This recipe is hands-down the best of the bunch , because it tastes just like a cheeseburger ! The potatoes , carrots , and celery ensure you will get enough veggies as well . Even if you are n't  a soup fan , you 'll love this . <p> Tip : I made it with cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta processed kind . It was still delicious and way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe , because it only makes 6 small servings . This soup disappears fast ! <p> Cabbage rolls are my familys go-to at holiday potlucks and family dinners . If you want a hearty soup that 's perfect for dinner , throw the ingredients in a slow cooker in the morning . If you want a low-carb option , skip the rice . <p> Tip : You will want to make this with double the amount of liquid the recipe calls for , as it ends up being really chunky otherwise . You 'll want medium or short grain rice , because long-grain tends to cook faster and fall apart . You wont regret adding more garlic , either . <p> Many of the potato soup recipes Ive tried have been too thick and starchy . This one is just right , and it has cheddar cheese and bacon in it . You cant go wrong with that . If you cant get the kids to eat soup , serve them this . It reminds me of a baked potato . Yum ! <p> Tip : I added extra chicken broth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness , but that 's up to your preference . I recommend adding lots of bacon bits ( more than the recipe calls for ) . Once you try this soup , you 'll want to eat it every day . <p> Just because autumn is over , it does n't  mean we have to stop using squash in our recipes . Have you ever thought of putting butternut squash , sweet potatoes , and coconut milk together ? Its delicious ! <p> Tip : Once again , do n't  be afraid to add more liquid . I added an extra portion of chicken broth because it would have been thick otherwise . I recommend using coconut milk instead of half and half , as it really brings out more coconut flavour . Its also much healthier ! <p> For such a simple soup , there are a lot of steps involved . Cut down on the time and effort and whip up French Onion soup with a slow cooker . You can make this soup less messy and easier to eat by slicing the onions a bit smaller . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to eat a meal without a little meat to it . This chunky chicken soup is almost , but not quite , a stew . Did I mention that its one of the best soups I 've had ? Serve with some crusty bread on the side . <p> Tip : You may want to add a 7th cup of chicken broth to water it down a bit and include an extra 1-2 cloves of garlic for extra flavour . Also , do n't  cut corners with the rice . I tried the recipe with white rice and it disintegrated in the slow cooker . Lesson learned ! <p> On blustery days when you just want to hibernate , a rich soup packs a powerful punch . It wo n't take long for you to make a classic broccoli cheddar soup , and this recipe is extra-special . Its made with evaporated milk , thyme , and parmesan cheese ! <p> Tip : I made this with vegetable instead of chicken broth , and it was delicious . Also , if you do n't  have two cans of evaporated milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you prefer a smoother soup , puree it in the blender to eliminate the chunky texture . <p> I tried a different tortellini soup recipe recently and it did n't  work out so well , so I 'm ready to try something that actually tastes good ! Based on the ingredients list for this recipe , its not possible to go wrong . Garlic , cream , and 3-cheese tortellini ? Count me in . <p> I had low expectations while making this recipe . It did n't  seem to be anything special . Boy , was I wrong ! Its a definite winter warm-up due to the spicy sausage . Note that you should not make this if you do n't  like spicy foods . <p> Tip : Oops , my bad ! This recipe is n't a slow-cooker one . Its worth making , though . Its similar to the recipe above , except that its made with spicy sausage , roasted red peppers , and spinach . Pick the one you prefer and modify it until you have a recipe that perfectly suits you . Add some bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , adding more cream , and dumping the Parmesan into the soup instead of waiting until it was served . You might also want to add a bit a kale and bacon ! <p> The winter is the best time to eat spicy food because itll keep you extra warm . If you 're looking for an ethnic-style soup , this is the one . The Thai-inspired recipe incorporates unusual ingredients like peanut butter , ginger , lime juice , coconut milk , and red curry paste . <p> One of the soups I tried out in my slow cooker was Chicken Tortilla , but I found it to be too heavy on the cream . This is a great alternative if your tummy gets upset from dairy . You 'll need enchilada sauce , fire-roasted tomatoes , corn , and green chiles . <p> Tip : I made the mistake of adding a little extra spice and chiles . Do n't  do that ! One thing is for sure : this is a great winter warm-up option , especially if you 've got a cold you need to clear out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner .

@@110590989 @5990989/ <p> Shopping intentionally is the best way to save money and get the items you need . What does " shopping intentionally " mean for me ? Well <p> 1 . Put Items on Hold and Come Back with a Clear Head <p> I 'm a very indecisive person , especially if I 'm not sure if I want to spend THAT much money on one pair of shoes . You may never have thought of this , but most stores allow customers to put items on hold without buying them . Go for a little walk to clear your head , shop around for a bit , and you might find a similar item for better value . Or , you might discover you do n't  want the item , or are not willing to spend the asking price . If you do decide to get it , return to the store and purchase the item on hold . Ta-da ! <p> 2 . Skip Cheap Stores and Go for Good Quality <p> This may seem counter-intuitive , but start buying more clothes from stores with a high standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will last you longer . Although it costs more up-front , your item wont be stretched , full of holes , and ready for the rubbish within the year . Skip the fast fashion stores with inexpensive but poorly-made pieces you know which ones I 'm talking about . <p> 3 . Take an Inventory of Your Wardrobe &amp; Make a List of Items You Need <p> I approach libraries , supermarkets , and shopping centres in the same way : I get so overwhelmed and distracted that I forget what I came there for in the first place . Before even setting foot in House of Fraser , John Lewis , or M&amp;S , you need to go through your closets , find out what you 're missing , and write a specific shopping list . Maybe you do n't  have a button-up shirt to go with that pretty skirt you got a while back , or maybe you 're sorely lacking some stylish jumpers . <p> A great way to save and keep yourself excited for an upcoming shopping trip is to browse the brands online store before visiting them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , " but you will always find their signature collection and new arrivals . Check out the prices , pick out a few items you might be interested in trying on , and write the product number down so you can find the item in-store . If you do n't  find anything you like online , you could save a lot of time by skipping that particular store . <p> 5 . Avoid Clothes that are Hand-Wash or Dry Clean Only <p> About half my clothes are delicate or hand wash only , and after years of making multiple trips to the laundry room , enough is enough . Beautiful and classy outfits do n't  have to include a silk blouse or wool skirt . Check the tags of every garment before you buy it to find out the washing instructions .

Do n't  Be Afraid of Vintage <p> Sifting through multiple wracks of clothing can be time-consuming , but if you 're committed to saving money , vintage is the way to go . Charity shops and vintage stores can hold a surprising amount of hidden gems . Find a store in a good area of town , and you could find items donated by the rich-and-famous . Many of these clothes are never or barely worn , and they 're a fraction of the price you 'd pay if you bought them brand new !
