Customers can also find information about " winterizing " their homes and preparing their families for the winter heating season . BGE offers customers a variety of low-to-no-cost ways to make their homes more energy efficient , saving energy and money . <p> " During the colder months , heating systems typically account for more than 40 percent of customers ' energy bills because extreme weather generally triggers significant increases in energy use at home , " said Carol Dodson , vice president and chief customer officer for BGE . " Even when the thermostat is kept at the same temperature , heating units must work harder to maintain the set temperature . Without taking steps to save energy during these times , energy bills will reflect additional usage and will likely be higher than in months when temperatures are more moderate . We encourage all customers to think about simple steps they can take in their home to save energy each day , no matter the temperature outside . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially vulnerable to sharp increases in usage when auxiliary heating is activated during cold weather . Customers are encouraged to set the thermostat to 68 degrees or lower . For every degree below 73 during the colder months , customers may save two to four percent on heating costs . Customers who heat with natural gas should consider setting the thermostat to 68 degrees during the day and 65 degrees at night . <p> " Although colder temperatures are the primary driver for increased energy use during the heating season , there are many other contributing factors , some of which may not be as obvious , " said Dodson . " When it 's bitter cold outside , many families spend more time at home , cooking , watching television , and using computers and other electronics . While we ca n't control the weather , customers can control how they use energy , even during periods of extreme temperatures . " <p> The WinterReady section on bge.com is specifically designed to help customers weather the cold temperatures that affect central Maryland each year . The following are steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower heating bills : <p> Manage your thermostat . Consider a programmable thermostat , which can save 10-25 percent in energy costs all year when programmed to lower temperatures when no one is home in the winter . When used properly , a programmable thermostat with its four temperature settings can save approximately $180 a year in energy costs ( Source : ENERGY STAR ) . <p> During the winter , for systems other than heat pumps , set thermostats at 68 degrees F , if health allows . This can help customers see a 3-4 percent decrease in energy use . <p> Customers who heat their homes with a heat pump should follow manufacturer 's instructions for optimal energy efficiency . <p> Natural gas customers should consider setting the thermostat to 68 degrees during the day and 65 degrees at night . <p> Inspect your Furnace . Have the furnace checked by a licensed professional to be sure it is operating efficiently and seal any leaks in furnace ducts . BGE offers rebates for these and other home efficiency improvements through the BGE Smart Energy Savers Program- . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home more efficient with Home Performance with ENERGY STAR . <p> Change the furnace filter regularly . A dirty filter forces the furnace to work harder . <p> Insulate your water heater . Install an approved insulation blanket around the water heater and insulate the first three feet of water pipe ( keep insulation at least 6 inches from the flue on gas water heaters ) . <p> Lower the temperature on your water heater to 120 degrees F and conserve hot water when you can . Heating water is the second largest energy user in your home in the winter months . <p> Caulk and weather strip windows and doors to keep cold air out . <p> Check/add attic insulation to reach a level of R-38 or 12 inches . <p> Wash clothes in cold or warm water and rinse in cold water to reduce water heater usage . <p> Look for energy-efficient appliances : When shopping for appliances such as refrigerators , freezers and air conditioners , look for the ENERGY STAR label . Newer , more energy-efficient models lower monthly operating costs . <p> Replace inefficient lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent light bulbs ( CFL ) or light-emitting diode ( LED ) bulbs .

The consequent peak load contributions will be calculated as an average over these five hours . Each account ? s PLC will be updated on a yearly basis in accordance with PJM rules and procedures . <h> Network Transmission Service Peak Load Contribution <p> Each local distribution company within PJM has a network transmission service peak load contribution requirement . To allocate fairly the LDC ? s daily requirement to electricity suppliers , network transmission service peak load contributions ( transmission PLCs ) are determined . In accordance with the Open Access Transmission Tariff ( OATT ) and PJM rules and procedures , BGE will calculate a transmission PLC ? ticket ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given year , an account ? s daily network transmission service PLC requirement is based on its load at the time of the actual unrestricted peak hours that occurred during the twelve months ending October 31 of the prior calendar year . ( See PLC Peak Hours &amp; Defaults ) At the end of this 12-month period , PJM and BGE will identify the five highest unrestricted load hours that occurred on different days during this 12-month period . The LDC will reconcile these five different hours back to the highest unrestricted peak load hour that PJM has determined to be BGE ? s zonal peak load obligation . The consequent peak load contributions will be calculated as an average over these five hours . The account ? s transmission PLC will be updated in accordance with PJM rules and procedures . <h> Daily Reporting of Peak Load Contributions <p> On a daily basis , BGE calculates and reports to PJM the sum of the PLCs for each account served by the electricity supplier , known as the ? Supplier PLC. ? BGE computes the electricity supplier PLCs after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using PJM ? s eRPM system and published submission guidelines . The following sections describe the methods and calculations used to derive electric accounts ? and electricity suppliers ? capacity and network transmission PLCs . <p> Interval metered accounts - Accounts that have meter usage data available on the hourly level , including meter data collected in 15-minute intervals during the billing cycle . Data collected in 15 minute intervals will be aggregated into hourly quantities . <p> Monthly kW demand metered accounts - Accounts that have meter usage data including the account ? s highest demand level ( monthly kW peak ) for the billing cycle and the on-peak time-of-use ( TOU ) period . In addition to metered demands , kWh energy usage is metered for each time-of-use period defined in BGE ? s retail tariff . <p> Monthly kWh metered accounts - Accounts that have metered kWh usage for the billing cycle . Accounts that are time-of-use ( TOU ) accounts have kWh recorded separately for each TOU period defined in BGE ? s retail tariff . <p> The derivation of the peak load contributions consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reconcile the peak loads . <p> Calculate the profiled segment weight and obligation factor for each profiled segment . <p> A description of each procedure follows . The procedures are further illustrated below by a simplified hypothetical distribution system serving eight accounts : three monthly kWh metered accounts , three monthly kW demand metered accounts , and two interval metered accounts . An example for each type of account is given showing calculations for one of the five hours averaged in deriving the capacity and transmission PLCs . <h> Step 1 : Determine Unreconciled Peak Loads <p> For each profiled segment and interval metered account , an initial peak load estimate is obtained based on data metered at the customer ? s premise . Premise level loads are adjusted for the electrical losses that occur in BGE ? s transmission and distribution system . Loss factors vary by voltage class and may be found under BGE Loss Factors . The loss-adjusted load estimates are termed unreconciled peak loads since in total they may not exactly equal the system load for that hour , and are therefore reconciled or scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to calculate PLCs the unreconciled peak is obtained as follows : <p> Interval metered accounts : the load for each interval metered electric account is extracted and measured for any load curtailment impacts due to BGE 's direct load control programs . . Each load is then adjusted for losses . <p> Non interval metered accounts : the average peak load for each profiled segment is obtained from BGE ? s statistical sample of each profiled segment . ( See Load Profiles ) This aggregate peak load is allocated to each account in the segment by applying an account-specific ? usage factor ? . The usage factor represents the ratio of the metered usage for the account to the average usage of the profiled segment over the same period . The total unreconciled peak load for the segment is the product of the peak load for the segment , the loss factor for the segment , and the sum of the usage factors for the segment . <h> Step 2 : Reconcile Peak Loads <p> Unreconciled peak loads are then scaled to BGE ? s total zonal load for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transmission PLC calculation .

Nationwide , every six minutes someone damages an underground utility line because of digging without first calling 811 , according to the Common Ground Alliance , the national association that promotes the 811 phone number and safe digging practices . To emphasize 811 Day , BGE arranges its downtown Baltimore headquarter window lights in an 811 pattern . <p> Striking an underground electric or natural gas line can cause serious injury , damages and service interruptions . Every digging project , no matter how large or small , warrants a call to 811 . Installing a mailbox , building a deck , planting a tree and laying a patio are all examples of digging projects where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . Approximately 16,000 circuit miles of BGE 's power lines are located underground " more than 60 percent the electric distribution system . There are also nearly 14,000 miles of BGE underground gas pipes throughout central Maryland . In addition to BGE 's lines , there are underground communications cables , water and sewer lines , and other utilities . <p> Even properties that are not served by a particular service may still have utility lines running below ground . When calling 811 , homeowners and contractors are connected to Miss Utility , the local one-call center , which notifies BGE and other utilities of the intent to dig at a location . The utilities ' professional locators are then sent to the requested digging site to mark the approximate locations of underground lines with flags , spray paint or both . Once lines are located , excavators also must understand the markings and look for evidence of unmarked lines , such as water and sewer lines on private property . Sewer clean-outs and water valve covers are examples of equipment that can indicate the presence of underground lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully . The best bet is to redesign a project to avoid digging anywhere near marked underground utilities . Hand dig with extreme caution and never use mechanized excavation equipment within 18 inches of marked utilities . Even hand tools like shovels , picks and digging bars can easily damage underground lines . <p> BGE joins its Exelon sister utilities , ComEd in Chicago and PECO in Philadelphia , in marking National Call Before You Dig Day . BGE , ComEd and PECO are members of the Common Ground Alliance and share best practices to promote safe excavation and lower instances of damage to underground lines . <p> Visit www.bge.com/811 for more information about 811 and safe digging practices . <p> # # # 68336 @qwx928336

Approximately 200 acres of BGE 's electric rights-of-way ( ROW ) located in Maryland state parks that are currently maintained by routine mowing will be allowed to transition to meadow or prairie ecosystems which are natural pollinator habitats . <p> " This partnership benefits the state , our customers and , most importantly , the pollinators that are vital for a healthy environment , " said Derrick Dickens , vice president of Technical Services for BGE . " Changing the way we manage these electric rights of way will encourage the return of pollinators and native ecosystems , while still ensuring that power lines are safely maintained . The best part is our customers get the environmental benefits as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy corridors . " <p> This effort , which includes electric ROWs in Carroll , Howard , and Baltimore counties , will provide habitat for native pollinators including bees and monarch butterflies . Increasing pollinator habitat is important from both a natural resource and economic perspective , since pollinator species are required for the reproduction of numerous crops that are grown for food . <p> " The new protocol for managing these lands is a significant opportunity for the department to expand upon our ongoing campaign to reduce mowed areas on state-managed land and property , " said Nita Settina , superintendent of the Maryland Park Service . " By working with BGE , rights-of-way within five state parks will replace mowed areas with natural meadows that benefit both plant and wildlife species , including birds , bees and butterflies . " <p> BGE will maintain its electric ROWs located in state parks through integrated vegetation management ( IVM ) . IVM selectively removes invasive species that could interfere with power lines through the use of environmentally-safe herbicides rather than clear-cut mowing . This allows low-growing , native vegetation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , IVM eliminates the need for repeated mowing saving money on ROW maintenance . <p> Pollinator populations have significantly declined during the last decade due to loss of habitat , increases in invasive species and the expanded use of certain pesticides .

Even small patches of wildflowers , hedgerows and meadows cultivated in gardens , parks and farms can provide vital sources of food for migrating monarchs . <p> Currently , BGE is maintaining six rights-of-way segments with IVM and each are National Wildlife Federation Certified Wildlife Habitats- and three are Wildlife Habitat Council certified areas . Research conducted at one BGE IVM site showed that it supported a greater diversity of bee species compared to ROWs managed by mowing . In addition , butterfly species such as monarchs , tiger swallowtail , and common buckeye have been observed in the IVM areas and are actively using the new habitat . <p> The new sites proposed for IVM are located in Morgan Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patapsco Valley State Park , Gunpowder Falls State Park and along the Torrey C.

@@96497635 @697635/ <h> BGE Blog <p> Yesterday we had another day of good progress making repairs and restoring electric service to customers , enabling us to estimate that the vast majority of the remaining customers without power will be restored by tomorrow night . Some restorations will extend into the weekend for smaller pockets of customers or where there has been more significant system damage . We 're continuing to work aggressively to get power back to all customers and put this storm behind us . <p> As we make repairs to our existing grid , we are seeing a glimpse of what is ahead for the future of power grids . This storm has provided an opportunity to see how the smart meters BGE is currently installing will function in storm restoration efforts . About 10 percent of customers now have smart meters , and installations continue across our service territory . With the advanced meters in place , we have been able to test some new capabilities and procedures , including using smart meters to tell us when power restoration efforts were successful . <p> When we repair damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have to confirm whether individual customers served by that feeder actually have their power back . Even with a feeder line operational , there may be more storm damage that needs to be repaired closer to a particular customer 's property . Normally , and in areas without smart meters , this means contacting customers by phone . As you can imagine , in the wake of a major storm many of our calls go unanswered for various reasons . Historically , two-thirds of customers are not able to be reached by calls . If we are unable to determine that power has been restored , we dispatch crews to investigate the status and determine if further repairs are needed . <p> During Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts , as we restored power to feeders that serve customers with smart meters , we have been testing the ability to remotely contact the smart meters to determine if they came back online . What we 've seen is that the smart meters are functioning as expected " we receive a signal to let us know that power has been restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Of course , we have a much higher rate of success getting through to smart meters than we do reaching customers by phone . This enables us to dispatch crews more efficiently , allowing them to focus on areas of possible damage instead of going out to locations where power has already been restored . <p> As it 's still early in our process , more analysis is needed to determine the full impact of smart meters on storm restoration . However , this process improvement , brought to us by a smarter grid , should make our future restoration and customer outreach efforts more efficient as more and more customers are equipped with smart meters . <p> We look forward to the near future , when smart grid enhancements will provide us with more data on when and where outages are occurring along the grid . Hearing directly from our customers will continue to be valuable to us however , and there are details only you can provide , such as the locations of downed trees and downed wires . We still ask that customers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are experiencing an outage . <p> Today we are intently focused on restoring power to all of our customers , but as we do with any storm , we 'll soon be looking ahead to how we can improve our future restoration efforts . The smart meter testing under way during this storm has been encouraging . While we do not look forward to future storms , we do look forward to continuing to enhance the restoration process for our customers . <h> Links to this post <h> Comments <p> April 01 , 2016Robert wunderlick says : <p> Bge has shown up to restore power but needs cooperation from verizon , xfinity , etc to slacken lines so a tree can be cut .

Unfortunately , Westminster in Carroll County sustained a lot of damage in yesterday 's storm , which did n't help the situation . We have currently completed 431 jobs in just Carroll County and have restored power to 25,421 . There are 120 more jobs in Carroll County to complete . Throughout our restoration efforts , some customers may have received differing estimated restoration times due to unforeseen and challenging operating conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A customer relations representative will be in contact with you shortly . <p> April 01 , 2016Tmarsh says : <p> I do n't  understand why the power in my condo neighborhood remained out till almost Wednesday , and went out at 8 SAt . Not to mention how steep the rates are that we already pay BGE . <p> There is a person who lives here on oxygen . I have a 6 year old . It was frightening and scary for my young child that BGE couldnt restore electric . I do n't  know what my neighbor with the oxygen must have gone through for all those days . WE live right near a hospital . The lights in the condos across the street were back on before ours and are always the first to go back on when there is an outage . And we are the last to go back on all the time even though we are right across the street . Someone indicated it might be because the condos across the street are on a grid with the traffic light . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why cant you just come to our BGE box and turn ours back on since you are already out here , right here . Instead of making us wait days , as always . I would appreciate an answer and like to know how to find out what grid we are on and why the next time we have a storm , cant they come and work on our electric while in the area .... instead of coming back days later . It always only takes the BGE guys a few minutes when they are here . You would save that in driving time . It seems like there must be a more efficient way for you to restore electric whether its widespread or not to bge customers . Especially in light of the steep rate we pay these days and that bge workers were seen just standing around during the crisis ... while our power was still out . <p> April 01 , 2016Jeff says : <p> I am one of the Carroll County people you 've seen fit to ignore . Eight days without power now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was a lie . <p> We were then told repairs would be completed by Friday , but that was a lie . <p> We were then told repairs would be completed by Saturday , but that was a lie . <p> We have now been told repairs will be completed by Sunday , but that 's obviously yet another lie since there has yet to even be a crew in our area ( the neighbors and I drove around to check ) . <p> How many times do you think you can you lie to a person before they ... react ? <p> Is there anyone at BGE who is n't a lying waste of life ?

A massive effort was placed on repairing or replacing the electric system 's large feeders , which is the backbone of our system . We had crews simultaneously in very jurisdiction where BGE has customers . In following industry standards , we first put focus on public safety and critical infrastructure issues , followed by work that will restore the largest number of customers at once . <p> Often times , a crew may arrive in your neighborhood and realize that the damage is more extensive and are required to make a repair elsewhere before restoring power to individual homes and businesses . We do know it is frustrating when nearby homes have power and you do not .

As part of the process , there may be times when crews and trucks are receiving safety briefings , writing reports about completed jobs , receiving instructions from dispatch or enabling additional crews to arrive or to complete work . As an example , crews may travel in pods comprised of tree and overhead line crews , where a line crew waits in queue for the tree crew to complete its work . This is part of normal operations , which ensures that customer restoration work is done safely , efficiently and to standard . <p> Thank you for your comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> We completely understand your frustration .

As part of the process , there may be times when crews and trucks are receiving safety briefings , writing reports about completed jobs , receiving instructions from dispatch or enabling additional crews to arrive or to complete work . " is such a joke . You write it over and over , but we had two men sitting in a truck , most of the time SLEEPING from Sunday afternoon until Wed late evening . They were just waiting for someone to come help . The tree was removed on Tues morning and the line was no where near the ground and still the two men SLEPT .

I hope BGE has takes all these comments to heart and MANAGEMENT gets their act together and takes responsibility instead of treating the public like they are stupid . Even when we talked to the men , they were so frustrated with BGE 's management .

When this happens , it impacts what contact center representatives are able to accurately relay to customers . " That 's evident but unacceptable . And forget about accuracy , BGE reps pretty much lied to me the whole week since they obviously did n't know what was going on . What you fail to address is why accurate detailed information ca n't get from the field to your reps or online and therefore to the customers who can then make informed decisions and alternate arrangments ?

This works well for routine thunderstorms , and we have successfully done this to provide good information to customers in the past . <p> During restoration for Irene , we provided daily ETRs for work we expected crews to complete for the customers impacted for an area . Unfortunately , two separate issues caused problems that hampered our communication to customers . First , the amount of trouble found and time to make repairs was longer in duration than anticipated . This was due to the large trees , from off the ROW , that fell , and the resulting damage including poles , crossarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored service , we did not restore service to all of the customers in an area as expected . Secondly , for customers near the end of the electrical network , there were multiple cases of trouble that needed repair to restore their service . As a result , when we made the initial repair , we needed to then locate the second , third , and sometimes fourth issue in order to restore service to all customers on a portion of the network . In each of these cases , the ETR 's provided were accurate for the large majority of customers contacted , but not for all . <p> We understand that some of our customers were frustrated by receiving multiple estimated times of restoration . BGE continually evaluates and assesses its storm response procedures to ensure we are prepared in the event of outages . In addition , BGE continues to upgrade its technology , enhance its training and preparedness programs , and make every effort possible to lessen the impact of storms and improve our communication with customers .

Keep contact information for qualified plumbers available . The equipment must be inspected and serviced by a qualified plumbing contractor before we can restore your gas service .

After flooding , repairs are subject to water receding and the time it takes to pump all water and debris from gas pipes . Additionally , the restoration timeframe is influenced by how long it takes to access all affected customer properties and disconnect service to gas meters . <p> Once all meters have been disconnected and the gas mains are repaired and purged , BGE can begin the process of introducing gas back to the mains and restoring gas service to individual customers . This again requires a gas mechanic to access the meter to restore service and relight gas appliances . However , gas service can not be restored if water has entered a customer 's piping and appliances . BGE may require that any customer-owned equipment such as piping and gas-fed appliances located after the gas meter must be inspected and repaired by the customer 's licensed plumber before BGE can fully restore service .

@@96497775 @697775/ <h> Load Profiles <h> Introduction <p> The electric energy market is an hourly market with associated bids and hourly spot market prices . Each utility member of PJM is required to post hourly electric loads for every Load Serving Entity ( LSE ) serving retail load in the utility ? s zone . To accomplish this , the utility must estimate hourly loads for customers who do not have hourly meters . <p> Some retail customers do not have meters capable of registering energy usage on an hourly basis . Load profiling is the process of allocating a customer ? s accumulated kWh over a billing cycle to the individual hours in that cycle . Through load profiling , customers without hourly meters are able to participate in the electric retail market . <p> The allocation of total billed energy to specific hours may be based on historical load usage patterns ( static load profiling ) or real-time sample metering ( dynamic load profiling ) . In the initial estimation for the settlement of energy among LSEs , BGE will use the static profiling method . In the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period to be settled have been collected , BGE will use the dynamic profiling method . Both of these methods are documented on this web site . <p> BGE ? s load profiles are based on average Historical Hourly Load Data in kWh collected from a statistical sample of the segment to be profiled . From the sample data an average profile for each segment is created for each hour in the year . The sample data used to compute these averages are also utilized to calculate the hourly weather sensitive load profiles used for the day-after energy settlement with PJM . <h> Hourly Weather Sensitive Load Profile Methodology <p> Annually , a weather-adjusted , average hourly profiled load will be determined for each profiled segment on a daily basis in accordance with BGE ? s load profiling methodology . This methodology is implemented in BGE ? s settlement system , which computes profiled loads using the ? Hourly Weather Sensitive ? technique . This technique uses a defined season and day-type structure to run a linear regression of historical weather data on account load for each account segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations expressing the relationship between weather and load for the pre-selected season and day-type combinations . The data for these regressions originate from the 1999 calendar year through the latest updated calendar year hourly weather and electric loads from the load research sample for each profiled segment . <p> Based on the season/day-type combination selected , the settlement system generates a weather response function for each hour represented by the season/day-type combination . The equation relates the historical loads to values in a weather range . The linear relationship is a piece-wise linear regression equation whose regression parameters are estimated using a search algorithm . The search algorithm identifies the optimal breakpoints for the regression lines such that the resulting regression model has the best possible statistical fit to the historical load data . The algorithm also ensures that boundary points between adjacent regression line segments of the weather response function coincide , thereby maintaining a continuous functional form . <p> These regression equations are used to compute estimated load values for the observed temperature points , such that each hour of the season/day-type combination will have a reported load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a specification , a representative load for a ? typical ? electric account within the profiled segment can be produced . The primary output of this profiling process is the load profile : a set of 24 hourly loads for a day-type and season combination . <p> BGE has also developed a tool called ? BGE Profiler ? . Users can input hourly weather data and a date , and BGE Profiler will calculate static weather sensitive hourly loads for that date . The tool has been set up in Microsoft Excel and must be downloaded to use . It may be found under the BGE Profiler link on this web site .
