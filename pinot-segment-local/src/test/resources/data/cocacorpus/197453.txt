In a lease option you will have the choice to buy the home without the fear of legal recourse from the seller if you decide not to purchase . <h> Option fees and down payments <p> Option fees can vary from lease to lease . A typical option fee is anywhere from 1 to 5 percent of the purchase of the home .

The good news is that almost all of the contract items are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee amount , rent , rent premium , purchase price . So make sure you negotiate the best contract possible to position yourself to buy the home at the end of the lease . <p> Option fees and rent premiums are the most important areas to negotiate if you to pay less money towards a down payment . Sellers view the option fee as a safety net in case the home does n't sell after the lease period . As the buyer , you would view the option fee as equity towards a lower down payment . Balancing the option fee during negotiations is very important to ensure that both parties are happy with the amount and it 's the best way to ensure the home will sell . <p> In addition , the option fee can be used as a bargaining tool for the purchase price , since the option fee is based on the purchase price .

Before you actually buy the home you 'll get to move in and pay rent for a lease period . During the lease period you are afforded the time you need to build up your credit score . There are several steps to take to increase your credit rating , which we 'll discuss in this article . Really , there 's no downside to improving your credit . Not only does a better credit rating qualify you for lower interest rates it can mean you have more leeway when negotiating deals with lenders . <h> Ensure the accuracy of your credit reports <p> To start , you should check with each of the three major credit reporting agencies and go over your credit reports . Those agencies are Experian , Equifax , and Trans Union and all of them offer you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything that does n't look correct . Once you 've identified any discrepancies on the reports you should report those discrepancies to the corresponding credit reporting agency and ask them to remove the item from the report . If the item is removed , it can give your credit a significant boost . <h> Creating and managing a budget <p> The next step you will want to take is to setup a budget . A significant portion of people with poor credit are in that situation because of poor budgeting . Take some time to sit down and go over your income vs your expenses . When you apply for a loan later on to purchase the home you are renting , the lender will want to look at your debt to income ratio , otherwise known as a DTI . This is the portion of your income that goes to recurring debts . Ideally your DTI should not exceed 30% . <p> Keep in mind that a lot of your regular expenses are not counted as debts . For instance , your groceries and your gasoline are things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered debts and as such do not count towards your DTI . Things that do count as debts include ; utility bills , rent , car payments , college loans , etc .. Be sure cancel or downgrade services that you do n't really need or often enough to justify the expense . <h> Get a credit card and use it responsibly <p> There are lot of different credit cards out there that offer different rewards , with different fees . You should take some time and do some research before choosing which card is best for you . Nerdwallet is a great site to use for credit card research and reviews . In our opinion , you should pick a card that best aligns with your lifestyle . If you find yourself purchasing gasoline quite often , then you might want to get a card that gives free gasoline as a kickback or gives you cash back when you purchase gas . There are also cards that work much the same way for groceries and there even more which work for a combination of purchases . <p> A credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build your credit . If used responsibly it is not uncommon to see a credit score jump up from a poor to an excellent rating is just a year . Using the card responsibly means that you only use the card to purchase the things that you would purchase anyway , then you pay off the card before you incur interest . The key is to look at the credit card as a tool for building credit and not as a loan or as a source of emergency money . <p> These are the steps you can take to build your credit and qualify for a loan while you 're leasing a rent-to-own home .

In addition , Farmington Hills is the site of the Holocaust Memorial Center , which aims to educate the public about the Holocaust and is the only such memorial in the state of Michigan . <p> NeighborhoodsThere 's no such thing as a bad neighborhood anywhere in Farmington Hills . However , some of the most popular communities within the city include Farmington Acres , Wood Creek Farms , Tanglewood Dr. at 14 Mile , and Stableview Dr. at Surrey Ln . As each neighborhood is relatively small , no matter where you live you 'll be within walking distance ( weather permitting ! ) of all the city has to offer . For example , you could head from your place on Northwestern all the way to Marvin 's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on Orchard Lake Road , and still be a 5 minute walk from 14 Mile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Email <p> Phone 19526 @qwx219526 19524 @qwx219524
