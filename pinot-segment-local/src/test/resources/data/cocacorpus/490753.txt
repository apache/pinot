@@79768529 @1268529/ <h> 83(b) Election <p> A section 83(b) election is a tax election to include in your income the fair market value of property you have received in connection with the performance of services which you may not get to keep . <p> Generally , under the tax code , if you receive property in connection with the performance of services that you may not get to keep , and which you ca n't transfer , you do n't  have to take the fair market value of that property into income until it is determined that you will either ( i ) get to keep it , or ( ii ) the property becomes transferable . <p> Section 83(b) provides an opportunity for you to elect to be taxed at the time of the receipt of the property instead of waiting for the property to become transferable or no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture . <h> Why Would You Want To Do This ? <p> Why would you want to include in your taxable income the fair market value of property in excess of what you paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There are a few different reasons : <p> Because the fair market value of the property at the time of receipt might be nominalmeaning , the tax might be insignificant , and an election will avoid a potentially much higher tax bill later . <p> Because the taxpayer might be paying the fair market value of the property so that electing to be taxed on its fair market value over what was paid for it means no tax is owed . <p> Because the value of the property might increase substantially and when it vests the tax on the fair market value of the property at that time might be more than the taxpayer will be able to afford . <p> Because the taxpayer might want his or her capital gains holding period start . <p> Example : Suppose a startup company founder is issued founders ' stock that is subject to a company repurchase at the stock 's cost , - but the- repurchase right lapses over a service based lapsing period . - This founder has received stock , but because the stock is subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the service based vesting period ) , the founder does not have to pay tax on his receipt of the stock until it vests . - However , the founder may prefer to make a Section 83(b) election to pay tax on the value of the stock today because its value is lower than it is expected to be when it vests " or because the founder paid full value for it today , so the Section 83(b) election costs him no additional tax today . - The making of the Section 83(b) election also starts the founder 's capital gains holding period.You Do Not Have To File an 83(b) Election If Your Shares Are Fully Vested You do not have to file a Section 83(b) election in connection your receipt of shares if those shares are not subject to vesting . If your shares are fully vested , no Section 83(b) election is required of you . <h> What Is The Character Of The Income ? <p> Under Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code , a taxpayer who receives property in connection with the performance of services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the property and the amount paid in exchange therefor- at the first time the property is either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture . Section 83(b) allows a taxpayer who receives property in connection with the performance of services that is subject to such restrictions ( e.g. , nonvested property ) to elect to recognize this income at the time of transfer. - The principal benefit of a Section 83(b) election is that the taxpayer can lock in appreciation which is generally taxable at capital gains rates upon later disposition . <h> You Ca n't Make An 83(b) Election With Respect To A Stock Option <p> It is a common misconception , - but a Section 83(b) election generally can not be made with respect to the receipt of a private company stock option . - You- must exercise the option first and acquire the stock before you can make a Section 83(b) election , and you would only make a Section 83(b) election in that instance if you exercised the option and acquired- unvested stock ( if the stock acquired on exercise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a Section 83(b) election ) . <p> Another common misconception is that Section 83 does not apply to restricted stock that is purchased at fair market value. - This is not true. - Section 83 applies even to stock that has been purchased at fair market value , if the stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and received in connection with the performance of services. - See this case , - Alves v. Commissioner . <p> An 83(b) election has to be filed with the IRS- within 30 days of receipt of the property , a copy has to be filed with the tax return of the person making the election , and a copy must be provided to the company . 116432 @qwx736432 <h> 131 Responses to " 83(b) Election " <h> By Stephen Jacob August 5 , 2011 - 2:32 pm <p> I have some fully vested ISO options that I 'm planning to- exercise .

They purchased our shares out right , no conversions , with all vested stocks paid just weeks after the acquisition . My employer provided an 83b form and advised signing it , so I did and promptly submitted . I have no vested stock until April 2nd , 2013 . I am wondering how signing the 83b will effect me . I am also wondering if my gain is recognized in my W2 already . Thanks ! <h> By StephenJacob March 21 , 2013 - 10:11 pm <p> I did precisely this in 2011 . I exercised options ( ISOs ) in my ( still privately held ) company . I paid $0.01/share . The valuation ( " 409A valuation " , I believe ) of the stock when I exercised was $0.05/share . So I made a gain of $0.04/share for AMT purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested , an 83(b) was not required ( actually , see below where I asked about this ) . Indeed , it would n't even make sense . <p> The point of an 83(b) election is to recognize your AMT gain at time of exercise instead of the default ( if you do not file an 83(b) election ) of as the shares vest . In *theory* I suppose you might want to opt not to make an 83(b) election if you did not want to have a large AMT gain this year but you risk a larger overall AMT gain ( later ) if the valuation of the shares is higher when they later vest . *If* your options are already fully vested , there would be no difference between the default ( time of exercise ) and an 83(b) election ( time of exercise ) . <p> Either way , though , your gain on shares you have exercised but have not sold ( or is that " can not yet sell " ? ) is an AMT gain only , not a regular capital gain . <h> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a grant of stock earlier this year valued at $20k , and filed an 83(b) .

In addition to the paperwork to sign for receiving the shares , they included a pre-filled 83(b) form that lists the fair market value as $0.00 ( not an example value ! ) and the amount I paid for it at $0 ( which is correct ) . <p> Is that okay for them to say that the fair market value is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startup , and I know the $0.90 value was used recently with regards to ( successfully ) obtaining new funding . That $0.90 value is not included anywhere in restricted stock agreement itself . <h> By StephenJacob January 14 , 2014 - 11:52 pm <p> Unlike Joe , I am not a lawyer , so take what I say with a pinch of salt , but that sounds very fishy indeed to me . <p> Unless the company sold all its assets and then bet the resultant cash on red ( and lost ) , I do n't  think stock can be valued at $0.00 . As long as the company is worth anything , the stock must ( consequently ) be worth something . <p> A pre-filled 83(b) sounds odd , and I fear for other employees who may have believed it and purchased stock and filed taxes based on the assumption . : / <p> I will say , I do n't  think the value of the stock has to match the price the most recent investor paid for it . If I understand correctly , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to buy in to a company which needed motivation to accept the funding . But if investors paid $0.90 I would guess your stock must have a value of at least a decent fraction of that . <h> By Scott February 26 , 2014 - 12:37 pm <p> My issue is that I have already ( and mistakenly ) filed an 83(b) election for vested shares .

Now tax time is here and I do n't  know what to do . I filed the 83b properly , and the IRS acknowledged receipt , but I was never actually paid . It is also my understanding that upon making the 83b selection , this should have been processed through the companys payroll dept . I have yet to receive a W-2 which leads me to believe this did n't  occur either . What should I do regarding taxes ? Is the IRS going to expect a w-2 from them to be listed ?

In our Operating Agreement , we also state that a decreasing percentage of that ownership is subject to a Repurchase Option at Fair Market Price in the event that a member leaves or dies .

My lawyer mentioned that the requirement to file an 83(B) Election only applies if the shares were initially issued subject to a right of forfeiture and in my case , the shares were issues in march and at that time , were not subject to forfeiture and therefore no form was required to be filed .

@@79768532 @1268532/ <h> Discounted Stock Options and Tax Code Section 409A : A Cautionary Tale <p> In the startup ecosphere , stock options are commonplace . They 're one way young companies can compensate for sweat equity and lower-than-market salaries or consulting fees , and generally provide recipients with a performance or retention incentive in the form of a stake in the company 's future . <p> The tax rules for most options are relatively straightforward . But when options are intentionally or unintentionally offered at a discount " meaning with an exercise price less than fair market value on the date the options are granted " it 's another story . And one that companies should consider carefully to avoid adverse tax consequences . <h> The Impact of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A <p> According to the IRS , discounted stock options fall under Section 409A of the federal tax code governing nonqualified deferred compensation plans " i.e. , those nonqualified plans that provide for a deferral of compensation . Stock options with an exercise price that is equal to or above fair market value when granted are exempt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that recipients of discounted options and other forms of deferred compensation comply with strict guidelines regarding the timing of their deferrals . Otherwise , they must recognize the income when they have a legally binding right to receive it , even if they do n't actually receive it until sometime in the future . The fine print includes an exception for short-term deferrals where the compensation is actually received within two and a half months of the end of the year in which there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture . Such short-term deferrals are not subject to 409A . <p> For stock options that are subject to 409A , option recipients have limited flexibility in when they can exercise their options without violating the rules . The rules allow recipients to exercise options based on a limited number of triggering events , including retirement or other separation of service , a change in control of the business , disability , death , an unforeseen emergency or at a previously specified date or year . <p> For those who run afoul of 409A 's rules , the penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation that has been deferred for the current and all previous tax years becomes taxable . That compensation is also subject to a 20 percent penalty , plus interest . <p> Many of the uncertainties in applying 409A have stemmed from the fact that the law does n't specifically define deferral of compensation . The IRS 's rules and pronouncements have consistently interpreted the phrase to include discounted stock options . However , those rules were not tested in the courts " until this year , when the U.S. Court of Federal Claims granted a partial summary judgment in Sutardja v United States . This ruling addresses various legal arguments with regard to the application of 409A , leaving the factual issue of whether the options were actually discounted to be determined at trial . <h> Consequences of the Sutardja Ruling <p> Sutardja is particularly significant because it is the first court ruling on the application of 409A to discounted stock options . As a result of Sutardja , we now have judicial affirmation of the following IRS positions : <p> The date an option is granted determines when compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option vests , not the date it is exercised , determines when the recipient has a legally binding right to the compensation . The date it vests also establishes the time at which the option is no longer considered to have a substantial risk of forfeiture . <p> The relevant period for applying the short-term deferral exclusion is not based on the date the options are actually exercised , but rather based on the period of time the options can be exercised under the terms of the plan . <h> The Cautionary Part of the Tale <p> 409A occupies some 80 pages of the federal tax regulations , which gives an indication of just how complicated it can be to either avoid it altogether or comply with its requirements . A few strategies can help . <p> To Discount or Not to Discount : Fair Market Value <p> 409A hinges on whether or not a stock option is discounted . If an option 's exercise price is equal to the fair market value at the date the option is granted , the option is not discounted and 409A does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of its stock options , properly valuing them is central to avoiding the negative tax consequences of 409A . In the Sutardja case , the company intended to grant its stock options at fair market value . A combination of lack of oversight and poor execution led the company to grant those options at less than fair market value , which may cost the recipients of those options many millions of dollars.Establishing fair market value can be problematical for startups and other privately held companies . Perhaps the safest way " and generally the most expensive way " to determine fair market value is to hire a qualified independent appraiser to perform the valuation . The appraisal must be performed within 12 months of the option transaction to satisfy the first of three valuation safe harbor rules under 409A . Under the second safe harbor rule , startup companies can use someone other than an independent appraiser to perform the valuation , as long as the person has the requisite knowledge and experience and the valuation satisfies other criteria under 409A . The third safe harbor involves the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Section 83 of the federal tax code.Separate from the safe harbor approaches , companies are allowed to use a reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method based on specific factors identified in 409A . Unlike properly implemented safe harbor approaches , this valuation method is subject to challenge by the IRS , so it 's critical to develop and save detailed documentation of the method used in determining the valuation . <p> Properly Establishing the Grant Date <p> In the Sutardja case , the company 's compensation committee approved the option grant and established the options ' fair market value at on same date . But the committee did not formally ratify that grant until nearly a month later , when the fair market value was higher.The court determined that the date of ratification was the grant date , so the options were actually granted at a discounted price . By the time the company and recipient attempted to fix the error , it was too late as the options had been exercised.Because of the impact that the grant date " and other elements of the process " can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 409A rules , companies must develop and follow well-thought-out procedures governing the issuance of stock options . <p> Remedial Actions <p> It 's always better to prevent compliance problems than to try and correct them later . But for those companies that find themselves out of compliance with 409A , the IRS has published guidance ( in Notices 2008-113 , 2010-6 and 2010-80 ) on certain allowed corrective actions . <p> Ultimately , whether the problem can be corrected " and , if so , how much relief is available " is as complex as the rest of 409A . It depends on a number of factors , including the nature of problem and the timing of the correction . <p> For stock options that were erroneously granted at less than fair market value , it may be possible to amend the option agreement to eliminate the discount . Generally , the exercise price can be increased to the fair market value ( as of the grant date ) in the year the options were granted . For option recipients who are not considered company insiders , that period is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may also be possible to amend the option agreement prior to the year the options vest . Regardless , no corrective action is permitted for options that have been exercised . <p> 409A is a particularly complex area of the federal tax code and , as Sutardja clearly demonstrates , the cost of noncompliance can be onerous .

@@79768540 @1268540/ <h> Convertible Notes : Is Conversion Into Stock Taxable ? <p> Convertible notes are frequently used by startups to raise capital . One of the reasons companies use convertible notes to raise capital ( rather than sell stock directly ) is it is possible to raise money through the issuance of a convertible note without setting a valuation on the company . Instead , that valuation question is suspended or avoided until a later date ( typically , when more money is invested ; this subsequent fund raise is usually defined in the convertible note as a " qualifying financing " ) . On a qualifying financing , when the subsequent money is raised and the valuation is set , the convertible notes then convert into stock at the valuation set in the qualifying financing or at a discount to that valuation . <p> What happens for tax purposes when the notes convert into stock ? <p> When convertible debt converts into stock , one of the key questions an investor will have isis the conversion taxable ? <p> Revenue Ruling 72-265 , quoted below , is helpful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full .

@@79768548 @1268548/ <h> How Many Shares To Authorize ? <p> I am frequently asked this question : How many shares should my startup authorize in its charter ( its Articles or Certificate of Incorporation ) ? <p> The trite , short answer is " authorize enough. - The longer answer is more nuanced , and basically boils down to " authorize enough to cover founder stock issuances ( obviously ) , the equity or stock plan pool , reasonably foreseeable preferred stock issuances , and some headroom to cover the reasonably foreseeable growth of the Company . <p> Like other legal framework questions in starting a company , one of the tricks is to build a legal structure which is ready to accommodate growth. - As your company grows , if you have the right legal structure in place , you will have less legal work that you have to do along the way to keep up with the growth . ( For example , authorize enough shares so that you do n't have to amend your charter later on to authorize more . Authorize blank check preferred so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first preferred stock financing , etc . ) <p> Authorized shares are the - shares a company is authorized to issue , not the number of shares the company will necessarily issue . For example , you might authorize 10- million shares , but only issue 2- million . <p> " Authorized but unissued shares " are shares that are authorized but not issued . In the example just given , a company with 10 million shares authorized , but only 2 million shares issued , the " authorized but unissued shares " would be 8 million . <p> Why would you authorize more than you might issue ? Because you want head room . You want the shares available in case you need to issue them . <p> In the above example , you might need that remaining 8- million authorized , but unissued , shares for things like : <p> common shares that might be issued on the conversion of preferred shares that are issued later ( if you sell 2M shares of preferred stock , you will need at least 2M shares of common stock available and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> shares that will be issued on the exercise of stock options or warrants issued later ; <p> shares that will be issued pursuant to other forms of compensatory equity awards ( perhaps outside the plan options ) ; <p> shares which might be issued in future financing transactions ; or <p> shares which might be issued in forward stock splits ( especially if you grow spectacularly fast ) . <p> Sometimes founders get nervous and want to make sure that they are forever going to control the entity- " and thus if 10- million shares are authorized , they want 6- million issued to them as founder shares- " to make sure that no one in the future can obtain a majority of the shares without their consent . <p> This does n't make sense and can be problematic for a couple of reasons . First , if you authorized 10- million shares , you probably included in that authorized share figure some number of authorized preferred shares , such as 2- million . So , if you authorized 10- million shares overall , and you split that between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the common should be thought of as set aside for the potential conversion of the preferred , thus leaving only 6- million common theoretically available- " all of which you would have issued in the above example- to the founders " leaving no room for an option pool . <p> Do n't  be afraid to have headroom for future growth . 116432 @qwx736432 116430 @qwx736430 116436 @qwx736436 <h> 10 Responses to " How Many Shares To Authorize ? " <p> I 'm always amazed when I see companies issue every share that they authorize in the initial articles or certificate of incorporation to the founders , without leaving any authorized shares to play with . <p> I think another driver of how many shares to authorize is based upon the anticipated pre-money valuation that a company wants to receive in a seed or angel financing . Many investors like to structure the first round of financing at , or roughly at , $1.00 per share . Because the share price is determined by dividing the negotiated pre-money value by the number of shares outstanding ( inclusive of the companys Equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how many shares to initially issue ( inclusive of the Equity Incentive Plan ) and therefore how many to authorize . <p> Example , If a company wants to raise first capital at a $3,000,000 valuation , the company has 3,000,000 shares to allocate to the founders and the Equity Incentive Plan in anticipation of pricing its first financing round at $1.00 per share . Given your guidance in the article , the company needs additional authorized to cover the equity financing or whatever else may come its way . I think the minimum the company would want to authorize in this scenario would be 6,000,000 , but I would probably advice going to 10,000,000 . <p> That 's exactly right Bo . I give the exact same advice . When trying to figure out how many shares to issue , make a guess as to your likely pre-money value on your first raise and issue that number that would put your price per share in that round at about $1.00 a share .

Can par value when setting up the company be much lower than the hoped for $1.00 you 're looking to get for investment capital . I am thinking 10,000,000 shares 8M common , 2M preferred , 2M x 3 founders , I want par value to be $0.025 so that 4M shares equals $100K ( 50K x 3 founders ) but look for capital of 2M and issue 2M shares at $1/share for the investors .

They are going to have to provide service for some period of time first , thus delaying their ability to exercise to start their capital gains holding period . <p> Finally , - upon exercise , if the value of the shares received exceeds the purchase price , they are going to have to pay taxes in addition to the exercise price . If an option is an " incentive stock option , " the spread is an alternative minimum tax adjustment , which frequently gives rise to a tax owing on an optionees individual tax return ( and not infrequently an unusually uncomfortable amount of tax ) . If an option is nonqualified stock option ( meaning , not an ISO ) , then the spread is subject to income and wage withholding . <p> This leaves many optionees in the position of not being able to afford to exercise prior to a liquidity event because the combined economic burden of the exercise price and the taxes owing on exercise is too great . Exercises in connection with a liquidity event will not entitle the optionee to capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . <p> What about ISOs , you might ask . Isnt is true that if I receive an ISO , and I meet the holding period requirements , that my gain on the ultimate sale of the stock is capital gain ? The answer is yesbut again with the following caveats . First , you are going to have to exercise the option , pay AMT ( probably ) , and hold the stock for at least 1 year after exercise and for at least 2 years after the option grant . The AMT hit might surprise you . You may not be able to afford to exercise because of the size of the AMT hit unless you exercise in connection with a liquidity transaction in which case you wo n't meet the holding period requirements required to achieve the purported ISO tax benefit of paying only capital gains on the disposition of the stock . <p> What can employees who desire better tax treatment for their options do ? Not be tritebut pester lawmakers to make it easier and less burdensome from a tax perspective for employers to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMT exemption amount was increased substantially , this would make ISOs substantially more attractive and potentially substantially alleviate the problems Ive described here at least with respect to employees . In general though , I think that the tax law of stock options needs to revisited and revised .

What Congress did in enacting 409A was hamper the ability of companies to share equity with employeesputting another hurdle on the road of the innovation economy . 116432 @qwx736432 116430 @qwx736430 116436 @qwx736436 116433 @qwx736433 116435 @qwx736435 116434 @qwx736434 <h> Archives <p> Archives 116431 @qwx736431 <h> Copyright 116437 @qwx736437 116438 @qwx736438

@@79768580 @1268580/ <h> Intellectual Property and Crowdfunding : Practice Safe Crowdfunding- <p> Crowdfunding , despite its popularity , is still misunderstood . Many people are familiar with rewards crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo based on widely publicized campaigns such as the Pebble Watch and the Veronica Mars movie . However , the intricacies of the Jumpstart our Business Startups ( JOBS ) Act , the federal equity crowdfunding legislation , continue to be a mystery to entrepreneurs and potential investors alike . Further , any link between all types of crowdfunding and intellectual property ( IP ) is less well known . <p> The JOBS Act was passed into law in April 2012 but the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has not released the long overdue final rules . Comment letters were requested late in fall 2013 and , like many involved in advocating for non-accredited investors to be able to invest in startups , we filed Traklight 's comments in January 2014 . In general , our position is that we recognize the difficulties associated with balancing investor protection and deal flow with startup access to capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs to companies seeking funding while still balancing investors ' needs for protection . <p> In short , the JOBS Act will allow federally what some states are already doing within their borders . The average American will no longer have to be accredited ( i.e. , required to meet minimum net worth of a million dollars or income of several hundred thousand dollars per annum ) in order to invest in private companies . Unlike Indiegogo , where money is contributed for a perk or reward , equity crowdfunding will allow you to actually buy shares or equity in a company using an online platform or portal . <p> For reference , equity crowdfunding is practiced in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom . Other platforms , such as AngelList , offer equity-based investments but for accredited investors only . <h> IP and the JOBS Act <p> When we wrote our comment letter to the SEC , we quoted our company mission as educating and empowering entrepreneurs and businesses on intellectual property and innovation for their success . Therefore we expressed grave concerns about any public disclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected all intellectual property : trademarks , copyrights , trade secrets , and patents . We recommended that warnings be provided to issuers and , in addition to the education provided in the JOBS Act for investors , we advocated for entrepreneur education . We would like to see information on IP identification , protection , innovation capture , and disclosure of the same plus a non-exhaustive list of potential public disclosures that both educate the entrepreneur and improve the quality of deal flow for investors . <h> Steps to Successful Crowdfunding : <h> Identify and protect IP . <p> It is extremely critical to protect IP before launching your rewards-based crowdfunding campaign since launching requires that you completely disclose how your invention or product works . For example , Kickstarter will not allow a drawing or prototype but instead asks for details on how your product works , enough in most cases to be an enabling public disclosure . Under equity-based crowdfunding , the rules propose similar disclosure in the business plan . <p> Also , setting out how your product works in a public forum is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patent lawyer George Rondeau had this to say : <p> In the U.S. a public disclosure will start a one year period running within which you must file a patent application to avoid loss of patent rights , which may force you into filing before your invention is ready . It also presents the possibility that another person may copy your idea and even fraudulently file a patent application on it before you do , which is a real problem now that the U.S. uses a first-to-file patent system . At least filing a well written provisional patent application is suggested before making a public disclosure if you can not file a full nonprovisional application using a patent attorney . The public disclosure will result in immediate loss of patent rights in most foreign countries if you have not previously filed a patent application . It will also destroy any trade secrets , leaving patents your only option to protect your invention . <p> Your brand should be protected with necessary trademarks or copyright before you launch your campaign . There are horror stories of names and designs being copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep in mind that before you can protect your IP , you must first identify all your potential IP . <h> Choose the right platform . <p> You can either opt for an all-or-nothing or earn-what-you-raise system . It is important to determine how much of the funds raised will be used for fulfillment of your rewards so you do not fail to provide the rewards offered . <p> You should choose a platform where you will reach your crowd . When we are using the equity rules , I recommend choosing a platform that will educate you on the rules and process . <h> Build social capital ( not just social media followers ) . <p> It is important to create value and market presence before launching your campaign . Simply put , you must prime the pump or presell . Have friends , family , and networks ready before the product launches so that you reach 20 " 30% of the goal on the first day of launch . Crowdfunding has its origins in charitable donations and those campaigns are always pre-loaded before announcement . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the meantime ( since federal equity crowdfunding is still unfortunately illegal ) , you can look to intrastate equity crowdfunding , which is allowed in at least 10 states that have passed requisite acts . For example , if you are a Georgia company and want to raise funds solely from Georgia investors , then you can do so by selling portions of your company under Georgia intrastate equity crowdfunding laws on an intrastate funding platform . <p> Please join me on Twitter @maryjuetten and @traklight to help spread the word that the SEC should #releasetherules . <p> Mary Juetten is the Founder and CEO of Traklight , the only self-guided software platform that creates your custom intellectual property ( IP ) strategy .

@@79768618 @1268618/ <p> At its most basic level , a Section 83(b) election is an election to be taxed on property received in connection with the performance of services even though the taxpayer may not get to keep or may have to forfeit that property . For example , suppose you receive nontransferable shares of stock from your employer but they do not vest until you have provided 1 year of service . You could , if you wanted , wait to be taxed on those shares until 1 year passes . The problem with this approach ? The shares might increase in value substantially over the course of that year and when the shares vest you may not be able to afford the taxes that become due on vesting . An alternative is available under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code . Under Section 83(b) , even though you might not get the keep the property you received , or may have to forfeit it , you can elect to be taxed on your receipt of the property at the time you receive it , instead of waiting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the performance of services must generally recognize as ordinary income the difference between the value of the property and the amount paid in exchange therefor at the first time the property is either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture . <p> Section 83- allows a taxpayer who receives property in connection with the performance of services that is subject to such restrictions ( e.g. , nonvested property ) to elect to recognize this income at the time of transfer.There are a couple of benefits of a Section 83(b) election : <p> ( i ) the taxpayer avoids having ordinary income on vesting ; and <p> ( ii ) the taxpayer starts the capital gains holding period . <p> For example , suppose a startup company founder is issued founders stock that is subject to a company repurchase at the stocks cost , - but the- repurchase right lapses over a service based lapsing period . - This founder has received stock , but because the stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture ( the at-cost repurchase right lapsing over the service based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay tax on his receipt of the stock until it vests . - However , the founder may prefer to make a Section 83(b) election to pay tax on the value of the stock today because its value is lower than it is expected to be when it vestsor because the founder paid full value for it today , so the Section 83(b) election costs him no additional tax today . - The making of the Section 83(b) election also starts the founders capital gains holding period . <h> Frequently Misunderstood Points <p> If a founder receives shares that are fully vestedthat is , not subject to an at-cost repurchase right that is lapsing over a service based vesting periodno Section 83(b) election is required . <p> It is a common misconception , but a Section 83(b) election generally can not be made with respect to the receipt of a private company stock option . - You- must exercise the option first and acquire the stock before you can make a Section 83(b) election , and you would only make a Section 83(b) election in that instance if you exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired on exercise of the stock option was vested , there would be no reason to make a Section 83(b) election ) . <p> Another common misconception is that Section 83 does not apply to restricted stock that is purchased at fair market value. - This is not true. - Section 83 applies even to stock that has been purchased at fair market value , if the stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and received in connection with the performance of services. - See this case , Alves v. Commissioner . <p> An 83(b) election has to be filed with the IRS- within 30 days of receipt of the property , a copy has to be filed with the tax return of the person making the election , and a copy must be provided to the company . <p> The alternative minimum tax ( the AMT ) , is an alternative tax regime Congress- originally enacted to prevent high income taxpayers from not paying any income tax at all. - The AMT is calculated by first calculating regular , ordinary taxable income , and then adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine alternative minimum taxable income ( AMTI ) . - Then , after an exemption amount is applied , AMTI- is subject to a flat taxwhichever tax is higher , the ordinary income tax , or the AMT , the taxpayer owes . <p> Most importantly to early stage startup companies is thisthat the spread on the exercise of an incentive stock option is an AMT- adjustment. - Meaning , that even if the option was granted at FMV , so that there is no income on grant , nor ordinary income on exercisethere is potentially a dramatic AMT impact on exercise. - Beware ! <h> About Our Practice <p> Startup and emerging companies need to move quickly .

@@79768700 @1268700/ <h> The Troubles With The New Crowdfunding Law <p> Everyone is very excited about the new **27;114;TOOLONG law . Crowdfunding is a great ideain concept . And now we have a new law which is about to make crowdfunding for securities a reality , at least in some sense . The trouble ? The law is onerous . It is going to be difficult and expensive to comply with . The burdens of the new law are plenty , but the benefits of the new law are capped . In short , the crowdfunding law as currently written is , in my opinion , needs to be fixed. I do n't mean to be just negative here . Crowdfunding enthusiasts should take their enthusiasm back to Congress to try to get the law fixed . Here are a few of my complaints about the law as it currently stands and recommendations for improvements . <h> 1 ) The Law Is Too Limiting , Too Constrictive <p> Under the law , companies ca n't raise more than $1M during a 12-month period . <p> Contrast this with Reg D Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount companies can raise . <p> A $1M cap during any 12-month period is not per se wrong or inappropriatebut weighed against the costs of raising this $1M ( see paragraph immediately below ) , $1M is too little . For the amount of money it is going to cost companies to raise $1M under the law , the $1M cap does n't make sense . The law 's burdens are disproportionate to its capped benefits . <h> 2 ) Compliance With The Law Is Too Expensive For The Amounts Allowed To be Raised <p> To raise up to $1M , companies are going to have to incur substantial expense . For example , if you plan to raise more than $500,000 , you will have to have audited financial statements . The cost of obtaining audited financial statements is likely to be a significant percentage of your total fundraising proceeds . <p> Contrast this with Reg D Rule 506 applicable to accredited investor-only- offeringsyou can raise an unlimited amount of money from accredited investors and no audited financial statements are required . <p> Companies will have to file not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the results of operations and financial statements of the issuer , as the SEC- by rule determines appropriate . Preparing and filing annual reports with the SEC are likely to be expensive and , over the years ( reporting will be an ongoing obligation , presumably for years into the future ) , could amount to a significant percentage of the funds raised . <p> To raise money , a company will have to prepare comprehensive offering materials to protect not only the company but also its directors and certain of its officers from liability . This will be expensive . Expect to incur multiples of thousands of dollars of expenses in preparing private placement-style offering documents . <p> Contrast this with Reg D Rule 506 applicable to- accredited investor-only offeringsas long as you are selling securities only to accredited investors , no PPM is required . <p> Because of personal liability risks to directors and officers , companies will want to obtain D&amp;O insurance . Tack on several more thousand dollars of D&amp;O premium expense per year . <h> 3 ) The Law Forces Companies To Use Intermediaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds . This is- fundamentally different from what typically happens with startups . Most startups raise funds without the help of intermediaries . In fact , this is the prevailing norm for startup companies . The typical advice to a startup isdo n't use an intermediary ! Founders , do it yourself ! But here the law forces companies into the arms of either registered broker-dealers or registered funding portals . These entities are subject to numerous requirements , and their compliance with those requirements will make the process much more difficult and costly for companies . <h> Conclusion <p> Crowdfunding enthusiasts should go back to Congress and get the law fixed . Recommended law fixes : <p> Allow companies to raise more than $1M . Again , right now the law 's burdens are disproportionate to the law 's allowed benefits . <p> Do n't force companies to use intermediaries . Allow startups to continue to raise money like startups have traditionally raised moneyby themselves . <p> If Congress really wants to unleash the creative genius of startups throughout America , allow investors to gamble with small amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 without any recourse if they lose their money except in cases of clear and demonstrable fraud . <p> Crowdfunding is a great idea , but we need a better law than the one we 've gotten . 116432 @qwx736432 116430 @qwx736430 116436 @qwx736436 116433 @qwx736433 116435 @qwx736435 116434 @qwx736434 <h> Archives <p> Archives 116431 @qwx736431 <h> Copyright 116437 @qwx736437 116438 @qwx736438

I set out to build a suite of tools that I most wanted in my own practice . The heart of these tools would be a technology to allow computers to identify the various provisions of legal agreements " from this core capability , numerous applications would follow . <p> The first application , and for me the most obvious , was to streamline due diligence . The inefficiency of the legal diligence process is the initial hunt-and-seek stage , where attorneys read through the contracts of a company and paste the relevant provisions into a spreadsheet . The critical component of diligence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later when the lawyer carefully reviews the relevant provisions that he or she spent hours extracting . So why not automate this first step ? <p> Click to enlarge <p> That 's precisely what our technology can do " you select a body of agreements to analyze and GreenLine can extract selected provisions from each agreement into a spreadsheet . Its simply a much more efficient and cost effective way of conducting legal due diligence . <p> The second major application is to compare multiple agreements . Imagine a client sends his counsel a new agreement to review . The attorney likely has several precedents from that client or in-house models to compare it against , but blacklining is useless unless these documents are already very similar . Thus most attorneys simply resort to eyeballing the differences . What GreenLine does instead is line up the matching provisions from each agreement before it compares the text , creating a much more meaningful comparison . This solves one of the big daily headaches of corporate practice . <p> Click to enlarge <p> GreenLine 's technology has applications in knowledge management as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , a critical advantage in commercial negotiations . You simply select all the agreements you want to create a precedent table from " the software produces the spreadsheet in seconds displaying whichever provisions youd like side-by-side for rapid analysis . <p> A fourth use is for creating and analyzing example forms . GreenLine makes it easy to track the evolution of form language in actual deals , allowing firms to get much better visibility of how their language is being changed in actual negotiations . This information can also be used to update the models themselves and better craft them to the needs of the clients . <p> GreenLine Legal is looking for partners that are as excited about this new technology as we are . The software can be easily customized to suit particular types of agreements or to search for and identify specific provisions . We think GreenLine will soon become as ubiquitous and useful a technology as blacklining " something that youd now find very hard to live without .

@@79768774 @1268774/ <h> Raising Money The Law Side <p> A friend peppered me with questions about startup fundraising and recorded it. - I thought you might find it informative and enjoy listening in . The transcript is below . Feel free to keep the dialogue going in the comments section . <h> What Do You Do ? <p> My name is Joe Wallin and I 'm a startup lawyer in Seattle , Washington. - I work at the law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine and I work with a lot of startup and emerging companies . <h> How Do Startups Raise Money by Selling Securities ? <p> The best and easiest way for a startup to raise money is : <p> to rely upon federal securities Rule- 506 ; <p> not generally solicit or generally advertise your offering ; <p> work from contact to contact , with people you know ; and <p> only take money from accredited investors . <h> What Is An Accredited Investor ? <p> An accredited investor is an investor with over a $1- million net worth , excluding their primary residence or more than $200,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of the same in the current year , or , with their spouse , $300,000 of income each year over the last two years with the expectation of the same in the current year . <h> What Do The Securities Laws Require ? <p> First off , what you should know is , before you can sell any security , you have to either register the security with the SEC and with state securities departments in states in which you wish the sell the securities , or you have to find an exemption from registration. - Registration is a very expensive process , so finding an exemption is a critical step in a fundraising . <p> Most startup and early-stage companies rely on the federal exemption known as Rule- 506. - That is an exemption that allows you to raise an unlimited amount of money as long as you raise it from accredited investors. - The requirements for using Rule- 506 are not that burdensome. - So , for example , you have to ensure that your investors are accredited. - You have to file forms with the SEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are no specific information requirements. - You do not have to have multiple years of audited financials or any sort of detailed or lengthy prospectus , as long as you 're taking money solely from accredited investors . <h> What About Raising Money from Non-Accredited Investors ? <p> Raising money from non-accredited investors involves a lot more complexity and expense. - This is why most startup companies will limit their rounds to solely accredited investors . <h> Can you Generally Solicit Your Securities Offering ? <p> Rule- 506 was recently amended , so now , under Rule- 506 , you have what could be referred to as a non-generally solicited Rule- 506 offering , and then you also have what could be referred to as a generally solicited Rule- 506 offering . <p> I think right now , and probably for the foreseeable future , most companies are going to stick to the non-generally solicited Rule- 506 offering . <p> So , if you 're going to go with what we 're referring to as the non-generally solicited offering , you can not advertise your offering. - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet. - You ca n't use Twitter or Facebook to promote the offering. - You 've got to work from one contact who you know to another contact who you know , with whom you have a preexisting , substantive relationship . <p> I think , for the most part , companies are going to continue to use the old Rule- 506 , which is the non-generally solicited Rule- 506 and not generally solicit their offerings. - And the reason for this is because if you generally solicit your offering , you have to ask your investors for proof that they 're accredited investors , proof of their income , proof of their net worth , and there is a potential reluctance on the part of investors to share that information with companies in which they are considering making an investment . <p> So , there are third-party services. - Suppose you 're a company raising money in a Rule- 506 offering and you 've chosen to solicit your offering , advertise your offering , and so now you have to ask your investors for their financial statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose your investors say they do n't want to give that information to you , the company. - What are your alternatives ?

Some interesting points , but still the more I read the more I like the sound of the new 506c offering . The fact that investors will have to provide reasonable proof that they are in fact accredited only protects the entrepreneur in case things do go wrong , and the investor raises a claim . I think that this forces investors to be more qualified . In years past , I 've invested in several deals I should n't have , and would have stayed out of if I had to prove I was accredited . Even though I had the money , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did n't  qualify . The competition to find truly accredited investors may be higher than before , but at least now it levels the playing field because creative marketers can at least get the word out to more potential people , and that weighs bigger in my mind and is an advantage in our case . 116433 @qwx736433 116435 @qwx736435 116434 @qwx736434 <h> Archives <p> Archives 116431 @qwx736431 <h> Copyright 116437 @qwx736437 116438 @qwx736438

@@79768815 @1268815/ <p> The use of a prepaid mobile telephone by the Times Square bomber has again raised the question of whether the identity of prepaid phone buyers should be verified and kept on file . Currently , there is no requirement in the United States , either at the federal or state level , to register end users of prepaid mobile wireless devices or subscriber identification module ( SIM ) cards . <p> Recently , however , Senators Charles Schumer and John Cornyn introduced a bill that would require retailers of prepaid mobile wireless communications devices or SIM cards to verify consumers ' identities and forward certain identification information to the underlying wireless carrier . The bill comes as foreign governments are considering the introduction of similar requirements . <p> Senate bill 3427 requirements <p> Senate bill 3427 proposes to require sellers of prepaid wireless mobile devices and SIM cards to verify a purchaser 's full name , home address , and date of birth .

The information to be retained includes the identification information , date of the sale , manufacturer name , wireless carrier , telephone/account number , and other technical information to identify the mobile device or SIM card , such as the international mobile subscriber identifier ( IMSI ) . <p> Anyone selling mobile devices or SIM cards who is not an " authorized reseller " - for a wireless carrier would face a fine and up to a year in jail . <p> In prior years , bills have been introduced in several U.S. states but none have been passed into law .

This is troubling when one considers the fact that prepaid wireless telephone services provide crucial communications ability to the poor and the homeless . Low-income consumers are particularly vulnerable to these potential cost increases , given that this segment of the population is much more dependent on prepaid wireless services . According to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , adults living in poverty are nearly twice as likely to live in households with only wireless telephones . Moreover , they more often choose prepaid arrangements , thus avoiding credit-check requirements and establishing a simple means of cost control . <p> A- requirement to register technical information on each mobile device or SIM card could prove disruptive if it results in the turning off ( intentionally or otherwise ) of previously sold , unregistered devices and SIM cards already in use . <p> Minority populations adopt prepaid wireless services in higher numbers than other segments of the population , thus the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide . <p> How would registration stop the use of anonymous prepaid SIM cards purchased outside the U.S. or the use of old prepaid phones by someone other than the original buyer ? The registration system depends on record-keeping by U.S. resellers at the point of sale . <p> Identification requirements overseas <p> Beyond the United States , several countries have implemented identification requirements of some sort . For example , registration requirements of varying complexity have been mandated in China , Japan , France , Germany , and Spain . <p> In China , consumers must show their national identity cards or passports in order to purchase prepaid SIM cards . <p> In Japan , user registration requirements do not apply to data-only services . <p> Under French law , carriers must collect identifying information of users and subscribers of prepaid communications services . <p> In Germany , retailers must collect the name , address , date of birth , and other information from purchasers and forward it to the carrier . <p> Spanish law requires carriers to collect the name and nationality of prepaid SIM card purchases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a passport or voter registration card . <p> As part of its review of the EU Data Retention Directive , the European Commission is considering requiring all European Union countries to implement prepaid phone registration requirements .

Under this method , first the income or loss for the entire year is determined ( for both the short S corporation part of the year and the short C corporation part of the year ) and then an equal portion of such amount is assigned to each day of the S termination year ( to both the S and C corporation short years ) . - Because this default allocation method disregards the actual time at which items of income or loss are recognized , it can have unexpected results . <p> For example , suppose an institutional investor or other non-eligible S corporation shareholder invests $2M in an S corporation startup ( with two existing shareholders who are both individuals , A and B ) on July 1 , and it is expected that the $2M will be substantially utilized before the end of the calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment the startup 's S corporation status will terminate because S corporations can not generally have non-individual shareholders . - Assuming the startup uses a calendar year , the corporations taxable year will be bifurcated into a short S year ( running form January 1 though June 30 ) and a short C year ( running from July 1 through December 31 ) . <p> You might think that the $2M expended from July 1 to December 31 would be allocated to the short C- year in which it was realized , generating a net operating loss of approximately $2Massuming the startup has no revenue . - However , under the default allocation method , half of the $2M loss is allocated to the short S year and passed through to A and B who may not be able to fully utilize this loss due to the limitations on the deductible of loss that apply to individuals . <p> The startup can elect out of the default allocation method- " and follow a " closing of the books " method ( which the Internal Revenue Code refers to as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close its books on the date its status as an S corporation terminates " but only if all- shareholders consent . - In the above example , if all of the shareholders consent to a closing of the books election , the $2M net operating loss generated by the corporation in the C short year would be allocated to the C short year and carried forward to future table years and used to offset taxable income recognized in those future taxable years . 116432 @qwx736432 116430 @qwx736430 116436 @qwx736436 116433 @qwx736433 116435 @qwx736435 116434 @qwx736434 <h> Archives <p> Archives 116431 @qwx736431 <h> Copyright 116437 @qwx736437 116438 @qwx736438
