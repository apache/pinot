@@72061491 @761491/ <h> Clinical Massage Therapist <h> What is Clinical/Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork ? <p> Simply stated , clinical/therapeutic massage and bodywork is the application of massage techniques with more specific intent and purpose , emphasizing the treatment of myofascial injury and chronic pain , structural and postural distortions , and biomechanical soft tissue dysfunction . It is a fascinating , incredible experience as the advancements continue in the area of clinical massage and bodywork . Clinical massage therapists are becoming a vital part of the health practitioners ' team with an invaluable talent to share . As the massage and bodywork profession continues to advance the training levels to include assessment and treatment of most soft tissue injuries , clinical massage therapists are becoming a crucial link to the team of medical practitioners including physicians , physical therapists , chiropractors , athletic trainers , etc. , who are accepting them as an asset to their work rather than a threat . <p> Clinical massage and bodywork is not limited in its techniques and application . It incorporates and utilizes an array of styles , methods and modalities to facilitate healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of massage techniques that adhere to specific anatomical and physiological considerations . These applied considerations , along with knowledge of basic musculoskeletal evaluation , assessment and client education will produce positive results in musculoskeletal healthcare . Clinical massage and bodywork is a combination of massage , and a shared responsibility between the clinical therapist and the client . As clinical therapists , we must understand that we are not healers ; we are facilitators of healing the body , mind and spirit . Even if we learn every modality of massage and do every technique correctly , the client must be the one to choose and claim the final result from our work . We can facilitate awareness , and a client 's ability to release his/her own tension patterns so that he/she may live more physiologically , structurally , and biomechanically balanced . <p> While the clinical massage therapist recognizes that allopathic health care is , at times , necessary we realize that sometimes it may not be the best method of treatment ( or possibly even ineffective at promoting health ) . In addition , conventional belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one and the same , so that when the symptom has been eliminated it is presumed that the problem is healed . The clinical therapist sees a symptom as a signal that something is wrong . When a symptom alone is eliminated , it is most likely being suppressed . Unless the original cause has also been eliminated , the symptom may return later in a chronic form . Rather than looking at symptoms as entities in and of themselves which must be " fixed " the clinical massage therapist looks for the cause of dysfunction rather than just treating symptoms . <p> Clinical/therapeutic massage and bodywork is a multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain based on sound physiological principles and neurological laws . It is a form of bodywork that identifies and treats muscular imbalances , creating balance ( homeostasis ) in the **32;408;TOOLONG systems . Most pain and injury is linked to imbalances in these systems . <p> In summary , clinical/therapeutic massage and bodywork has effectively integrated education from the profession 's pioneers of massage and bodywork , the current leading structural body workers , exercise trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated pain conditions . It focuses on the entire body with emphasis on restoring pain free range of motion throughout the body and complete structural balance .
