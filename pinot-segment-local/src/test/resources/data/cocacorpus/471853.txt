According to Dr. Lang , the team 's definition of value investing is buying good businesses with strong management teams at a discount to the long-term intrinsic value . Dr. Lang strives to identify investments where the opportunity for value creation is underappreciated or mispriced . There are two key drivers of value creation that Dr. Lang looks for : increasing returns on invested capital in excess of the cost of capital and reinvesting cash into new assets at high rates of return . Specific to health care investing , Dr. Lang thinks it is important to view companies according to three criteria : how they will improve clinical outcomes , how they will improve access to care and how they will reduce costs .
