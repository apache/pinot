That means the fabric 's warp ( lengthwise ) yarns are perpendicular to weft ( crosswise ) yarns . During the manufacturing and finishing processes , textiles can be pulled off-grain . If you do n't remedy this before cutting , your garment also will be off-grain , and it will twist , hang unevenly , bunch , or ripple . See how to straighten a fabric 's grain in this video , so you can prep your fabrics correctly for great sewing results . <p> CFields writes : If you do n't have someone to help pull the short ends , you can stand on one short end and pull the other as far as you can .

I 'm going to do the extra knots like you do in the future . Since I do tatting I know that the reason the thread " twirls " or twists is that you are doing the same blanket stitch across the work . Like Phoebebird says : Do a half hitch knot across and your problem is solved . This means first put your needle under the thread and the next time put it over the thread , or to put it another way : first from the top then from the bottom . If my words do n't help , look up " half hitch knot " elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( not " shuttle tatting " ) should show you how . If you are a lefty just start on the side that is most natural for you . Tying off neatly seems difficult but a quilter 's knot at the end works well and snip it close . Or lay my favorite tool ( a blue tooth-flossing plastic thread shaped like a large eyed needle , available at drug stores ) down on the bar threads , with the eye end facing the end ( not the beginning ) of the work .

To stop the threads from twisting I find that by going first from right-to-left then left-to-right under the thread loops , in essence mimicking a macrame knot of sorts , I can eliminate any twisting and it makes for a neat thread bar . Sorry if my explanation is fuzzy . I also use a thimble and will push the eye-end of the needle through so as to avoid an accidental stitch .

@@22148552 @2148552/ <h> Q&amp;A : Where to Place Bust-Dart Points <p> Q : How far from the bust point should a bust dart end ? -Jackie Perreault , via email <p> A:Fitting expert and teacher Sarah Veblen explains : <p> Think of a dart as a teepee , which creates three-dimensionality for the mound of the bust . You never want the dart to extend beyond the fullest part of the mound ( the bust apex ) , because then the peak of the teepee ( the dart point ) will be empty . We can generalize that the dart point should be just shy of the fullest part of the bust . The general rule is that the larger the bust , the farther the dart point should be from the apex . A common suggestion is 1 inch for a smaller bust , up to 2-1/2 inches or more for a larger cup size . Essential variables to be considered are the bust size and shape . <p> Some women have conical breasts , and others have rounded breasts . Some women have curvature along the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First assess the fullness or flatness along the side of the bust . Try visualizing the bust from above , as though you were looking down at your body . The dart point should be placed near where the flatness changes into a curved shape . For a round-sided bust , you have more leeway with the dart-point placement . <p> You 'll have the most success by making a muslin and assessing the fit on your body . You 'll be able to tell if the dart point is too close to the apex ( empty space at the tip of the dart ) or too far away ( straining over the apex ) . Adjust the dart length in the muslin and reassess . <p> One of the most difficult shapes to fit , in my experience , is a larger , round-sided bust that becomes more conical at the apex . When the dart point is placed logically-where the roundness breaks away toward the bust apex-there often is excess fabric between the dart point and the apex . It may help to move the dart point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darts also can improve the fit . In general , a concave dart helps to fit a round-sided bust , and a convex dart helps to fit a flat-sided bust . <p> Pressing can work like magic . Press your dart with the point on a curved part of a ham that is similar to the shape of the breast . Move the iron in a circular motion over the dart point , and you can mold the shape of the garment to fit the bust smoothly . <p> This post was originally featured in the Q&amp;A department of Threads #181 ( October/November 2015 ) . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 1 ) <p> EmilyBint writes : Thank you , I was just searching for the answer of this question myself .

@@22148554 @2148554/ <h> How To Properly Remove Clothing Labels <p> Are you the kind of person who finds clothing labels itchy or irritating ? Do you hate it when they hang out of the back of your shirt , effectively telling the whole world what size you wear ? Are you sick of being a walking advertisement for whatever brand you choose to buy ? The easiest solution for all of these issues is to remove the labels from your clothing . It is important to do this slowly and correctly , however , to ensure that you do n't put any holes in the garment or otherwise damage it . <p> Step 1 : Examine the clothing labels that you would like to remove . Have they been sewed into the garment separately ? Is the same seam holding the garment together ( meaning that if you remove it , will the stitching on the item start to unravel ) ? Is the label made of fabric or is the material more papery ? The answers to these questions will help you to determine how the tags should be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags off your clothing using scissors . You should never yank or pull on these labels , as this can stretch out or even tear the garment . The most common occurrence is the development of a hole , which is known to grow larger with time . You should also carefully inspect the clothing for stickers , pins , stiffeners , and other packaging that you do not need " carefully remove each of these things . <p> Step 3:Consider cutting the tag out . If your issue with the label is that it hangs out the back of the clothing on show , simply cut it out with scissors . You will have to be very careful that you do n't also accidentally break any loops of thread , as this will result in stringy bits . This is also the approach that should be taken if you wish to remove the tag but it shares a seam with the garment itself , as the whole item could end up unraveling.The downside to using this method is that you are often left with small corners of the label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the material that has been used ) . Occasionally , you will be able to cut the tag right up to the seam and then pull the other end out from under the stitching . If you can do this , just be very careful that you do n't cut anything you need . <p> Step 4:Use a seam ripper to remove the tag . If the clothing label has been sewn into the garment separately to the seam , you may be able to use a seam ripper to carefully cut each of the threads holding the tag to the garment . Try to avoid damaging the surrounding fabric and seams , as this will be obvious when you wear the item . You can use a pair of tweezers to remove any remaining threads once the tag has been removed . <p> Tips <p> - - - Make sure that you have at least taken a mental note of the fabric care and laundering instructions for each particular garment before removing the tag ; you could even keep them for future reference . <p> - - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irritating , try to look for clothing that instead uses a light silkscreen in the collar or hem to display manufacturing information . <p> By following the instructions that are appropriate for your clothing labels , you should be able to effectively remove them from your entire wardrobe . This will ensure that there is no more uncomfortable itching , that the tags do n't hang out at the most inconvenient of times , and that you are no longer a walking billboard for your brand of choice . Just remember to also follow the tips that we have provided to ensure that nothing goes wrong with your chosen method and that your clothing is well cared for .

A bias welt in a patterned fabric obviates the need to match the pattern , while providing a pretty design detail . <p> If you do choose to cut the welts on the bias , you do n't have to stretch and press . Instead , rely on a good , stable fusible interfacing to support the welt fabric and to eliminate stretching and gaping on a bias-cut welt . You could stretch and press the welts before pocket construction , in order to reduce the amount of stretching or distortion that may occur during wear . However , if you do so , you 'll change the size and shape of the welt ( they 'll be longer and narrower ) , so you will need to experiment with cutting them wider than desired , stretch-pressing , and then recutting to size . <p> Carol Fresia <p> Posted : 1:09 pm on March 10th <p> user-4500868 writes : You never did answer the smocke ladies question Posted : 5:25 pm on March 2nd <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In most examples , the double-welt pocket has a vertical dart above it , which ends at the top welt . The pocket opening extends from the jacket front to the jacket side panel . I can not find any tutorial that covers this . <p> -Marysia Paling via Facebook <p> A:Jeffery Diduch is vice president of Technical Design and Quality at Hickey Freeman Tailored Clothing Co. , one of the world 's top producers of fine tailored clothing . He 's designed and sewn countless pockets on men 's jackets , and here 's his input : <p> Before you can make the pocket , you 'll need to join the front and side-front panels . The front panel 's side seam poses a bit of a challenge to those who have never encountered it . The jog that appears midway down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sew that dart before you can attach the side panel . To sew the dart , you must also slash part of the pocket opening . Many pattern instructions tell you to apply the pocket welts before slashing the cloth for the opening , so you may be hesitant to cut into the jacket front so soon . However , this is an essential step , and with proper stabilizing , you have nothing to worry about . <p> - <p> - <p> If you are unsure of the total dart take-up , measure the jog at the side seam : Its width equals the dart take-up . I advise that you slash the dart 's center line before sewing , as this facilitates sewing and pressing the dart . There is often a horizontal wedge of cloth cut out at the pocket opening , too ; this is the equivalent of a very small dart for the stomach area ( A ) . <p> Once the dart is sewn , abut the pocket opening edges and either sew them together with a feather stitch or baseball stitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the edges in place while you join the side panel ( B ) . <p> Join the side panel to the front , then construct the welt pocket as usual , using the slash line as the center of the pocket opening ( C ) . <p> This- article was originally featured in the Q&amp;A department of Threads #187 ( October/November 2016 ) . 4378 @qwx204378 4375 @qwx204375 <p> Threads thank you SO MUCH for approaching the wonderful Jeffrey Diduch to answer my technical query .

As someone who teaches draping I am concerned with a few of your methods : <p> 1 . Where is the wearing ease at the waist and hip ? Your method only works if you will be standing still and not sitting. ( or using a knit . ) Otherwise the skirt will ride up your waist to accomodate the body spread . 2 . Center front lines should be anchored with two pins going in opposite directions at each point so you avoid shifting of the fabric when draping . 3 . How about a " balance line " at the hip so you can make sure you are perpendicular to the center front ? That will ensure your grain line 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruler , you ca n't trust a straight line with your eyes only . If not , there 's too much room for seams looking crooked .

@@22148605 @2148605/ <p> Bags made from garment-weight leather require the same tools and supplies as garments . However , when working with heavier skins , it helps to have a few additional items . Specialized cutting tools , hole-piercing gadgets , rivets , and glues are the mainstay of handbag-making ; using them makes the difference between an average bag and a professional-looking one . Scissors and rotary cutters can go only so far in cutting heavy skins and hides . You will not always be able to machine-sew every seam . However , with the proper tools and techniques , you always can come up with a way around the challenges . - To your usual sewing tools , consider adding the following . You do n't have to purchase everything at once , but you can acquire tools and supplies as you need them . <p> Cutting aids- Awl . The awl 's point is handy for marking leather in preparation for cutting , as well as for piercing holes.- Clear grid ruler with metal cutting edge . The clear plastic enables you to see under the ruler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents the knife from damaging the ruler.- Cloth weight ( sometimes called a pattern weight ) . This tool , used in the tailoring industry , is indispensable . It is the perfect size and weight to hold patterns in place without pins while cutting , and it prevents the work from shifting or falling off the table . I also like to use it as a safety measure on top of a ruler while I am cutting with a knife . It is an extra barrier between my fingers and the blade . <p> Adhesives- Double-face tape . This tacky , repositionable tape secures layers so you can stitch accurately . The seam remains flexible.- Leathercraft cement . This water-based glue has no odor and gives you time to work with it before it sets . - Glue dots . Tiny scrapbooking dots are good for when you need a small amount of glue . <p> Pressing tools- Rubber mallet . Use this to flatten areas instead of pressing them with an iron . I keep a couple in different weights and sizes.- Miniature anvil . Lay the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small rocks to get into tight areas where the anvil does n't fit.- Hard pressing surface . A 12-inch square tile , at least 1-1/4 inches thick , works well ; back it with felt so it does not damage your table . <p> Finishing touches- Leather paints and gum tragacanth . Finish raw edges with one of these sealants.- Stainless-steel edge paddle . This is the perfect little tool for applying paints to an edge . One end is square while the other is rounded . The tip shapes enable you to apply precisely without any waste . <p> Build your confidence in working with leather by practicing : Make a seam sampler to test how your sewing machine handles the materials . Try different needles and threads to sew and topstitch seams . I always begin with a Microtex needle ; if that does not work , I experiment with other needle types-not necessarily leather needles .

First , you have to measure the space , and then divide it into equally long pieces . But there 's a better way . <p> Linda Boston of Woodbury , Connecticut , tells us how to position a series of buttons , buttonholes , snaps , or any sewing detail . She says to place evenly spaced marks on a piece of elastic .

There are better , more stable and reliable ways to accurately measure and mark buttonholes , even if you want to avoid the simple arithmetic required . Most women do n't want to start measuring at the top button , either , since there are usually other areas of the garment that are more critical to make sure they stay closed , like over the bust or across a wide waist or hips . <p> Using elastic as a measuring tool is unstable and stretching it to transfer spacing is likely to result in uneven results . Elastic does n't stretch evenly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial , spaced " guides " . You should always use a stable instrument when making accurate measurements and placement . And , as others noted , using this elastic method to actually mark the garment requires at least 3 hands to accomplish , whether it is accurate or not , and , certainly , that makes this method worse , not better or easier . <p> If you are uncomfortable doing the calculations and do n't wish to purchase one of the spacing guide tools available , here is a simpler , more stable method to get even spacing for 3 , 5 , or 9 buttons that wo n't require extra hands to accomplish : Cut a 1 " wide strip of stable paper the length of the space from the top button to the bottom button on the garment . For 3 buttons , fold the strip in half once . For 5 buttons , fold the strip in half again . For 9 buttons , fold in half one more time . Open the strip and mark the folds . Carefully press the strip flat ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the positions for the top and bottom button and the marked folds as positions for the others , you will have a stable guide for transferring your placement positions . This can be pinned to the garment and it will stay in place while you work . You can position the strip using one of the marks for critical button placement , like at the bust line , and mark the positions of all the buttons in relation to this . <p> Keep in mind , the best , most accurate way is to do the math and make minor adjustments for specific problems or needs .

I 've been working with elastics for years and have never known it to stretch evenly it always stretches more at the ends and less toward the middle .

She shopped with us for new school clothes in September which she paid for , but if we wanted additional clothing during the school year , we had to buy our own . There was a twist , however . If we were willing to SEW something to expand our wardrobe , she offered to pay for the fabric , pattern and necessary notions and , of course , help us through the process . I hated to spend my hard-earned baby-sitting money , so I jumped at the chance to make new clothes without having to pay for them . I made many of my clothes at that time .

Fashionistas and seamsters have embraced the comfort , ease , and wearability that knits afford . But for the beginning ( and even not-so-beginning ) seamster , there are some techniques that make sewing with knits easier and more enjoyable . Here are a few to get you started . <p> Use the right needle - The needle you use in a project with knits can make or break the results . Generally speaking , you need a specialized needle to sew knits . There are two types that I use for knits : Ballpoint ( also called Jersey ) and Stretch . Ballpoint needles are best used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that penetrates the fabric without catching or cutting through the yarns . Stretch needles are perfect for sewing through tightly knitted jersey fabrics with high Lycra content . I use them on all my wool , polyester and rayon jersey garments . For more on choosing the right needle for your project , check out Machine-Needle Know-How , an article from Threads magazine . <p> Stitch type and length - If you have a straight-stitch-only machine , set your stitch length to a medium ( 2.5mm-3mm ) setting . When sewing knits with a straight stitch , you need to stretch the fabric very slightly ( and very gently ) as it goes under the presser foot . To do this , apply equal pressure on both sides of the needle by slightly pulling the fabric as shown . <p> Do not pull the fabric as it goes through the feed dogs : you may risk breaking your needle and damaging your machine if you do . <p> If you have a zigzag machine , set your stitch length to the narrowest zigzag setting ( .5mm on many machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3mm . If you have a very thick knit , you may need a longer stitch length . You do not need to stretch the fabric as you sew . The slight zigzag will give you the stretch needed . <p> Seam finishes - Knit fabrics , especially jerseys , do n't generally ravel , so you can get away without finishing the seams in many cases . If you are fortunate enough to have a serger or overlock machine , you can use that to stitch and finish your seams in one fell swoop . You can also use your serger to finish the raw edges of hems before sewing them in place . I like to do this when working with sweater knits , terrycloth , or any knit that might have a tendency to " she 'd " slightly at the edges . <p> About face - Many patterns for knits call for using a facing for necklines and other exposed edges . With many knits , especially very stretchy jerseys , you can often skip the facing entirely . Simply fold under the seam allowance and stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facings on most necklines this way . If you have a very curved edge ( like an armhole ) , you should test on a scrap of fabric cut to about the same curvature to see how you like the results . <p> Shouldering the burden - When making a knit top or dress , I stabilize the shoulder seams to prevent stretching . To do this , I fuse a piece of interfacing to the back shoulder piece or pieces . I prefer to use a 3/4-inch-wide piece of fusible tricot , which is made even with the cut edge of the fabric , but extends slightly beyond the seamline . This adds stability , but is light enough and has enough give to work with most knits . For heavier knits or sweater knits , I sometimes center a selvage of silk organza in the seamline and stitch through all layers . The organza provides a lot of strength to the seam , but adds no bulk . <p> Hemming - If you examine knit ready-to-wear , you 'll notice that most hems are sewn with a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized machine , called a coverstitch , to achieve this finish . If you do n't have a coverstitch , you can still achieve this look . Most zigzag sewing machines can accommodate a double needle . This needle sews a perfectly spaced double row of stitches on the needle side of the fabric , with a zigzag on the bottom . <p> This stitch has more stretch than a regular straight stitch , and is perfect for giving you a professional-looking finish . Before stitching your garment , make a test on a scrap of fabric . Double needles may require some adjustments to your needle and bobbin tension to achieve a smooth , flat hem . Mark your hem on the right side of your garment . I like to use tailor 's chalk that can easily brush or wash away . Then sew along this marking so your double row of stitches is on the right side . <p> I hope these hints will help you get started with sewing knits . With a little practice , I think you will find sewing with knits addicting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn a lot more calories doing your normal activities .

Stretch needles are perfect for sewing through tightly knitted jersey fabrics with high Lycra content . I use them on all my wool , polyester and rayon jersey garments . For more on choosing the right needle for your project , check out Machine-Needle Know-How , an article from Threads magazine . <p> Stitch type and length - If you have a straight-stitch-only machine , set your stitch length to a medium ( 2.5mm-3mm ) setting . When sewing knits with a straight stitch , you need to stretch the fabric very slightly ( and very gently ) as it goes under the presser foot . To do this , apply equal pressure on both sides of the needle by slightly pulling the fabric as shown . <p> Do not pull the fabric as it goes through the feed dogs : you may risk breaking your needle and damaging your machine if you do . <p> If you have a zigzag machine , set your stitch length to the narrowest zigzag setting ( .5mm on many machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3mm . If you have a very thick knit , you may need a longer stitch length . You do not need to stretch the fabric as you sew . The slight zigzag will give you the stretch needed . <p> Seam finishes - Knit fabrics , especially jerseys , do n't generally ravel , so you can get away without finishing the seams in many cases . If you are fortunate enough to have a serger or overlock machine , you can use that to stitch and finish your seams in one fell swoop . You can also use your serger to finish the raw edges of hems before sewing them in place . I like to do this when working with sweater knits , terrycloth , or any knit that might have a tendency to " she 'd " slightly at the edges . <p> About face - Many patterns for knits call for using a facing for necklines and other exposed edges . With many knits , especially very stretchy jerseys , you can often skip the facing entirely . Simply fold under the seam allowance and stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facings on most necklines this way . If you have a very curved edge ( like an armhole ) , you should test on a scrap of fabric cut to about the same curvature to see how you like the results . <p> Shouldering the burden - When making a knit top or dress , I stabilize the shoulder seams to prevent stretching . To do this , I fuse a piece of interfacing to the back shoulder piece or pieces . I prefer to use a 3/4-inch-wide piece of fusible tricot , which is made even with the cut edge of the fabric , but extends slightly beyond the seamline . This adds stability , but is light enough and has enough give to work with most knits . For heavier knits or sweater knits , I sometimes center a selvage of silk organza in the seamline and stitch through all layers . The organza provides a lot of strength to the seam , but adds no bulk . <p> Hemming - If you examine knit ready-to-wear , you 'll notice that most hems are sewn with a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized machine , called a coverstitch , to achieve this finish . If you do n't have a coverstitch , you can still achieve this look . Most zigzag sewing machines can accommodate a double needle . This needle sews a perfectly spaced double row of stitches on the needle side of the fabric , with a zigzag on the bottom . <p> This stitch has more stretch than a regular straight stitch , and is perfect for giving you a professional-looking finish . Before stitching your garment , make a test on a scrap of fabric . Double needles may require some adjustments to your needle and bobbin tension to achieve a smooth , flat hem . Mark your hem on the right side of your garment . I like to use tailor 's chalk that can easily brush or wash away . Then sew along this marking so your double row of stitches is on the right side . <p> I hope these hints will help you get started with sewing knits . With a little practice , I think you will find sewing with knits addicting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn a lot more calories doing your normal activities .

I do it similarly , with some variation : <p> When I was teaching the Stretch and Sew method back in the early 80s--and when I first learned it back in about 1970--we applied ribbing much the same way . The differences : If applying ribbing , did n't try to figure out the trim measurement like Sarah does ; instead we used a 2 to 3 ratio ( rib measurement was 2/3 the neck or sleeve opening measurement ) plus 1/2 " for seam allowances ; if using self-fabric ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used a 3 to 4 ( 3/4 ) ratio , plus 1/2 " for seam allowances . You measure the neckline by " walking " your tape measure on its edge around the folded T , from CF to CB , then double it ( I just fold the tape measure over , but you can also do this mathematically ) . That 's the full neckline measurement , then I fold the tape measure in thirds ( or fourths ) to get the 2/3 or 3/4 ratio , and add 1/2 " . <p> When I first learned this method , we did n't even know what a serger was ( smile ! ) , so we used two rows of slightly lengthened ( 3.0 ) stitches , one on the seam line and one halfway between the seam and the raw edges . As always , we stretched as we sewed--stretched the ribbing to match the opening and then a little bit more .

Posted : 7:38 am on April 27th <p> Basiunka writes : To answer merri1 's original questions , a facing is the section fabric which provides a finish to the edge of a garment . Just to be ( slightly ) confusing , this is generally referred to as a " hem " when it 's the lowest section of a garment i.e. a skirt , dress or trousers . Most commonly it is made in the same fabric as the original . In a skirt or trousers the fabric is usually folded at the bottom and turned up to create the finished edge . However , the facing or hem can be made in a contrast fabric to save on material - maybe of an expensive fabric " , to extend the length of a garment seamlessly , or to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics to highlight the techniques they are depicting . When finishing a hem , I like to cover the upper ( internal ) edge with bias tape . If I have enough lining left , I cut some bias strips from this , otherwise I use pre-made satin bias for a professional looking finish . This also makes it easier to hide the stitches , which attach the hem to the main body of the garment . <p> Posted : 4:20 am on April 27th <p> lauraflo writes : As PeggyKemp says , the pictures do not explain when you are looking at the right side or the wrong side of the skirt . Any good sewing book ( I love Simplicity 's Simply the Best Sewing Book ) will show how to do a false hem . <p> Basically you have let down and pressed out the original hem . Then- Right Sides together-- you attach the false hem at the very bottom of the skirt , sewing just a 1/4 inch seam .

Thus you have used only 1/4 inch of the original hem length , and have attached the false hem to finish it off as well as give it weight to hang properly . So now the skirt is extended lengthwise by as much as the original depth of the hem , minus 1/4 inch for the seam . It is sort of a similar idea in construction as a facing at neck or armhole , tho serves a different purpose . Posted : 10:02 pm on April 26th <p> fotofashion writes : The turn of the hem will look much better if the seam is pressed open first then turned and pressed into place .

Which bra style works best , and how do I adapt it ? <p> Tracy Shaw , Mesa , Ariz . <p> Cindy Elam replies : Your question is a good one that affects many women . The process of adapting a bra to accommodate a prosthesis is not difficult nor time-consuming . It requires only basic-to-intermediate sewing skills and a little attention to detail . <p> To create a pocket for a prosthesis , you can either use the instructions below to adapt a purchased bra , or adjust a bra pattern and make your own bras from scratch . Either way , start with a style that fits the woman 's frame and existing breast properly . Almost any style will work , provided it fits nicely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause discomfort . I find that a full-coverage bra like +lan B530 ( www.elanpatterns.com ) can be easily adapted to this purpose . <p> Use a soft , lightweight cotton knit to create the prosthesis pocket . My instructions produce a double-layer pocket that provides a bit of insulation from the initial coldness of the prosthesis and helps absorb perspiration in warm weather . <p> To make the pocket pattern , you 'll cut the shape of the cup as it lies flat on a table , with the bust point sticking up . I prefer the paper-and-pin method for making the pattern , which requires first taping two layers of paper over a piece of foamcore or cardboard ( you 'll use the two layers of paper to cut the top and bottom layer of the pocket bag ) . <p> Next tape the bra to the paper , smoothing the armhole and the cup 's upper and lower edges as much as possible . Do n't worry about the bagginess at the bust point of the cup . <p> Beginning at the strap , use a pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working across the upper cup , along the seamline where the cup joins the center front , along the curved lower edge of the cup , along the side seam where the cup joins the band , and at the armhole edge up to the strap . Remove the bra from the paper , and trace around the holes with a pencil , smoothing out the shape ( a French or dressmaker 's curve is helpful ) . Repeat for both layers . <p> On one layer , draw a line from the armhole edge , about 1 in. down from the strap , diagonally to the top edge of the upper cup , about 1 in. from the cup 's center seam . This line forms the open edge of one layer of the lining , as shown in the drawing . <p> On the other layer of paper , draw a line from the upper cup edge , about 1 in. from the strap , diagonally to the armhole edge , about 1-1/2 in. up from the side seam . This forms the open edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 'll know which is the right side , armhole edge , and so on . <p> Cut each piece from the soft cotton knit , and finish the open edges with either a narrow zigzag , a serged edge , a fold-and-zigzag hem , or with narrow stretch lace . The cut edges wo n't ravel , so your purpose is to stabilize the edge without adding bulk . <p> Baste the two layers together , leaving the finished edges open , as shown . Pin the pocket into the cup , and zigzag around the raw edges ( a three-step zigzag looks nice ) . If you 're working on an underwire bra , fold under the edge along the channeling , and carefully straight-stitch along the edge , or hand-sew it with small stitches . <p> When you wear the bra , simply slide the prosthesis into the pocket from the top . It will stay put , even when jumping , dancing , or bending over . 4378 @qwx204378 4375 @qwx204375 <p> jean22l writes : I am so glad that you mentioned the mastectomy bra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years .

Finished lengths/width chartIf a chart is n't provided on the envelope , look on the instruction sheet .

Take note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or patterns that you love and that fit well , and then look for a pattern with similar measurements ( at bust , waist , hip , and shoulder width , as well as garment length and hem width ) . Also , look for the words " loose fitting " in the pattern description on the back of the envelope if , for example , you 're going to layer heavy sweaters under a jacket . If you want a fitted , curvy jacket with little or nothing underneath , look for the words " semi-fitted " or " fitted . " <p> Know your fabricsIt 's wonderful if you can choose a pattern before you have a fabric in mind , because then you can closely follow the fabric recommendations listed on the pattern envelope . However , I often find that I 'm inspired by a gorgeous fabric , purchase a length of it , and then have to hunt down a pattern to match . <p> If you have a specific fabric in mind , try to find a pattern that recommends fabrics with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric you chose has a similar weight and drape . Heavy fabrics do n't drape the way lightweight ones do , and they add bulk in the seams . <p> Also note whether a knit or a stretch fabric is recommended for the pattern you 're considering ; if that 's the case , then the pattern will include less ease than one that 's made for nonstretch fabrics . <p> Do n't get in over your headFiguring out a pattern 's level of difficulty and comparing it with your own skills is the next important step . Decide whether you feel up to a challenge , and realistically address how much time you can devote to a project . Thinking about options ahead of time eliminates surprises later . If you 're looking for a quick-and-easy project , consider whether you can eliminate tricky construction elements on a more complicated pattern : Use snaps instead of buttonholes , omit pockets , remove the vent in the sleeve , or replace a fly-front zipper with an invisible side-seam zipper . <p> I also recommend at least scanning the instructions inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a difficulty level is indicated on the envelope . A pattern that 's noted as being within your skill level may actually have difficult construction techniques . In fact , sometimes certain steps or illustrations are left out in more advanced patterns , which can be confusing to less-skilled sewers . And it 's better to discover that before you 're knee-deep in fabric and pins . <p> Sizing considerationsRemember that not all patterns are sized the same . Sizing and fit standards can vary from pattern company to pattern company , especially among independent manufacturers . But , by reading the pattern envelope and taking initial measurements , you can confidently use patterns from any company and make the fit your own . <p> That said , the Big FourVogue , Butterick , McCall 's , Simplicitystandardized their sizing , based on a B-cup bra ( Voguepatterns.com and Butterick.com post detailed size charts ) . But picking a pattern by bust size alone is n't always enough .

For a more proportionate pattern , also refer to the high-bust measurement ( just above the bust , under the arms ) noted on the Web sites . <p> No matter how a pattern is sized , I suggest trying to pick a multi-sized pattern--because most of us fall between sizes in at least one area of our body . For skirts and pants , you can pick a size according to your hip measurement ; then adjust the waist as necessary . <p> Is the pattern easy to alter ? With all the body shapes out there , you 'll probably have to make some adjustments to any size pattern . The key is to make altering as simple as possible . Remember that patterns with many pieces , and princess seams in particular , are easier to alter . With more seams to work with , you can simply add to or subtract from the width and fold horizontally as needed to lengthen or shorten . <p> Patterns with few pieces tend to be more difficult to alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical darting in the front and back are trickier to alter than those with princess seams . Pants also tend to be difficult to alter , so I suggest finding ( and sticking with ) a basic pant pattern that closely matches your measurements and shape , and make minor style adjustments as needed . <p> Ease : all-important , oft forgottenOnce you determine a pattern will be easy to work with , turn to the amount of ease in a pattern ( the difference between your actual measurements and those of the tissue ) , which can make or break fit , regardless of size . Ease allows for movement ; the amount of ease varies with the garment style . <p> Typically , a pattern company builds 2 in. of ease into its basic sloper ( a base pattern that represents the dimensions of a specific figure , without additional design features ) and adds additional ease for the style of the garment . A fitted dress , for example , may have 3 in. to 4 in. of ease at the bust , and a loose-fitting dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some pattern companies provide all the finished measurements ( bust , waist , hip , hem width ) on the envelope and let you figure out the ease for yourself . Other companies note ease information on the envelope . In addition , on their Web sites , both Vogue and Butterick include an in-depth ease chart that lists the ease allowed in a variety of silhouettes . <p> So before you go pattern hunting , figure out how much ease you want in the bust , hip , and finished width . To determine how much ease you want , refer to the photos and caption below . Once you know how much ease you 'd like for a specific garment style , you 're ready to play with the pattern tissue itself . <p> Ease ( the difference between your body and the pattern measurements ) is a key factor in evaluating fit .

@@22148663 @2148663/ <h> Pucker up ? Not when it comes to sewing ! <p> One of the hallmarks of fine sewing is a smooth , unpuckered seam . One particular part of a garment that is prone to puckering is a set-in sleeve . Part of the reason for this is that more ease is built into the sleeve cap than the armhole allows . What that means is that if you measure the circumference of the armhole of your garment , and compare that measurement to the length of the sleeve cap , you 'll find that the sleeve cap measurement is significantly longer than the armhole measurement . You have to take up that extra length as you sew the sleeve to the body of the garment . When setting in a sleeve , it 's really easy to get big ol ' pinches and puckers in the sleeve cap . And put bluntly , that 's just not a good look . But by taking your time and doing one or two extra steps , you can eliminate those unsightly puckers and make a garment that looks smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin for a jacket that I 'm making . <p> Most pattern instructions tell you to run two rows of ease stitching along the edge of the sleeve cap between the notches . Then match up the markings on the sleeve and armhole , pull the ease-stitch threads to gather the sleeve , and stitch the sleeve and the garment together . As you can see from the picture below , the results can be disappointing . No amount of pressing will remove a pucker once it 's stitched into place . <p> Why does this happen ? Using ease stitching , you do n't have as much control over the distribution of the ease in the sleeve . But fear not ! You can easily take back control and get great results . I have two favorite methods for inserting a sleeve : pin-easing and hand-basting . Both are worth the extra time they take , and both yield smooth , lovely results . <p> Pin-bastingPin-basting is really easy . Instead of using easestitching , simply use a whole lot of pins to ease the sleeve into the armhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots , etc ) and pin . Position your pins perpendicular to the seamline . Then pin between the markings , distributing the ease as you go . To get the best results , I position my pins between 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch apart . You do n't need to space the pins that closely in the un-eased part of the seam . You can then sew your seam , being careful to remove the pins before your needle hits them . <p> Hand-bastingI often add an extra step before sewing the seam , and after pin-basting , I often hand baste my sleeve to the garment . This gives one more level of control over the ease , and I can then sew without pins in my fabric . It is also very worthwhile when sewing finicky fabrics . I always hand baste taffetas and other stiff fabrics , and it makes handling slippery fabrics ( like charmeuse ) so much easier . <p> When sewing the sleeve into your garment on your machine , take your time and use your fingers to manipulate the fabric to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I encourage you to try out these methods .

But the pristine and often fragile qualities that make white fabrics special can also cause the downfall of your project . Many of the problems associated with sewing white fabrics can be addressed through either technical know-how or creative design . <p> The most basic strategy for getting beautiful results when sewing whites is to plan ahead : prepare your sewing space and map out construction and sewing considerations such as marking methods , planning for opacity where its needed , and selecting supporting materials and notions with care , and you 'll save yourself from some potentially unpleasant surprises . Aside from these areas of concern , choose your sewing techniques on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than its color . <p> White-on-white is the rule . Whether your fabric is ivory , snow , or eggshell , mark it with white pencils , carbon , chalk , or thread , and fasten it with white notions . <p> Clean up your actOne of the most important steps in sewing white fabrics should take place before you even remove the fabric from the bag : clean your sewing area thoroughly . I take a three-step approach to preparing my sewing studio , and , whenever possible , I group several white projects to be worked on over the same time period , during which I put away any projects that use colored fabrics . <p> Several days before I plan to sew white fabrics , I thoroughly clean my sewing machine and oil it . I also clean the soleplate of my iron if necessary . Shortly before cutting out the fabric , I wipe all my cutting and sewing surfaces with a damp towel to catch all the lint that ordinary dusting leaves behind . Finally , I run a lint brush over my ironing board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands frequently ( to avoid transferring skin oils ) and staying away from hand lotions . Be careful , too , not to let any cosmetics come in contact with white fabrics . Finally , if you 're sewing a colored project in your studio at the same time , cover the white project with a garment bag or a clean sheet whenever you take an extended break to protect it from lint . <p> Anticipate show-throughWhite fabric of almost any weight will be somewhat see-through : the absence of color allows light to pass easily through the fabric . Even white denim , wool flannel , and gabardine can present show-through problems . Its up to you to decide whether you 'd prefer to design around the transparency , or build in some form of opacity . <p> The obvious choice when lining a white garment is a matching white lining , but traditional lining fabrics , whether of synthetic ( like Hang Loose ) or natural fibers ( like rayon Ambiance ) are not very effective at blocking light transmission through white fabric . Drape a layer of lining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . If you see the contour of your arm , then your garment will be somewhat transparent . To make a garment completely opaque , I recommend underlining as well as lining it . Select the underlining for opacity , and choose a lining for comfort . <p> Another approach to handling the inherent translucence of white fabric is to incorporate it deliberately into your projects design . Analyze hem depths , pocket placements , seam and edge finishes , and facings ; you may be able to use their greater opacity as a design element . Hems , plackets , tucks , darts , and other standard construction features can add interesting shadow details to an all-white project , but be sure to consider their proportions before cutting and sewing . <p> White fabrics of every description , kept clean and handled lightly , will make a pristine transition to sporty or formal attire . <p> Choose the right notionsWhite fabrics can call for some specialized notions . For invisible seams on fine sheers , I use monofilament thread ; otherwise I choose a good-quality polyester thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither are all white fabrics ( see Shades of white ) ; try to match thread to fabric just as you would for any other color . When I hand-sew whites , I avoid using beeswax or other thread conditioners ; if you wish to use these products be sure to test them to see if they discolor the thread or fabric . <p> White hooks and eyes and clear plastic snaps are readily available and are unobtrusive closures . If you 're using a zipper , consider placing it in a side seam , where it will be less noticeable . <p> As with any fabric , select interfacing with care . In some cases , the adhesive dots on fusibles may show through . I often use silk organza or cotton batiste to interface sheer , white fabrics . <p> Mark with the future in mindWhat could be easier to mark than white ? As it turns out , almost any other color . Any colored mark that will show up well on white may also cause permanent stains , so you 'll need to be careful when using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If the project is to be underlined , transfer marks from the pattern tissue to the underlining and do n't  mark the fashion fabric . For single-layer projects , the safest option is to mark with white chalk or white tracing paper . Although white-on-white marks can be difficult to see , you 'll be sure they wont spoil the finished garment . Thread-tracing and tailors tacks made with white silk thread are visible but nondamaging . I 've also used purple disappearing pens to make tiny marks , but only after carefully testing that the marks will disappear . <p> Use care when pressingThe biggest fear when pressing white fabrics is making scorch marks ; you can easily avoid them by setting your iron to the proper heat level for the fabric and testing . Its fine to use starch or spray sizing if your fabric needs added body , but again , press a sample ahead of time . To keep the project clean at the ironing board , use a press cloth ( I like batiste , silk organza , and even wool , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hams in white as well . For a large project , put a clean sheet on the floor under your ironing board . On particularly fragile fabrics , I sometimes apply a burst of steam with my iron , and then finger-press . <p> Extend the white-glove treatment to all your sewing projects white home fashions benefit from careful handling as much as garments do . <p> Keep the finished work cleanAfter you 've worked so hard to keep your project spotless during construction , its worthwhile to know how to keep it that way . Laundering by hand or machine is the gentlest way to clean whites , but avoid chlorine bleach ( except for durable cottons , and do n't  use bleach with every wash ) . For other fibers , non-chlorine bleach such as Clorox 2 is a safer choice . <p> Frequent dry-cleaning can leave white items of all kindsgarments , linens , curtains , and accessoriesgrayish and dingy . I often insert dress shields in clothes I make , so that my clients wont have to dry-clean them after each wearing . Before you pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dry-clean them ( even items that look unblemished can develop stains over time ) , cover or wrap them to protect against dust , and for long-term storage , use acid-free boxes and tissue . <p> Shades of white <p> When shopping for white fabrics , you 'll notice that there are actually many colors of white . Both fiber treatments and the fiber content itself can influence the whiteness of a fabric . <p> Silk fibers are not naturally a very pure white , although silk fabric can be treated to achieve a bluer , brighter version of white . The natural , slightly off-white color of silk is sometimes called silk white or diamond white . Extremely bright , pure whites are more readily found in the linen , cotton , and synthetic families . <p> But remember , a lining or underlining can substantially alter the whiteness of any white fabric you pair it with . Be sure to layer your fabrics together to see how the underlayers affect the tone of the fashion fabricthat will be the color of the finished garment . Keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a softer version is more flattering to some skin tones . <p> Rae Cumbie ( http : //raecumbie.com ) is a professional clothier who makes sure Baltimore brides have perfect wedding dresses . <p> egrantva writes : Could you please she 'd some light on why some white fabrics , as well as some white cotton knits have a definitive " lavender " shade to them recently ?

@@22148678 @2148678/ <h> Alter Patterns Using the Seam Method <p> An innovative technique for pattern alteration that 's simple to understand and easy to do , offering options other techniques do n't . <p> by Judith Rasbandfrom Threads #85 , pp. 48-51 <p> When I was studying pattern alteration in college , I learned that no matter what method you use to alter a pattern , when you 're done , all that 's really changed is the outline , or outer edge of the pattern . <p> As my teachers and I explored this idea , we further proved that the closer you place the alteration to the seam or stitching line , the less distortion to the pattern there will be . In other words , if you alter any pattern right at the stitching line , you can correct it without shifting the grainline , and you can keep changes to the lengths of nearby seams to an absolute minimum . We developed an alteration technique around these discoveries and called it the seam method . As we 've continued to work with the seam method , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the method allows alterations to be confined precisely to areas where they 're needed and to stay clear of those areas where no change is wanted . Let 's look first at a few basics of pattern alteration as they apply to the seam method . <p> No special tools neededClear a work surface , and gather the tools you 'd need for any alteration session : tissue or other plain paper for filling in the cut pattern , scissors , markers or pencils , transparent tape , and a straight and a curved ruler , ideally in clear plastic so you can see the pattern through them . To prepare the paper pattern , press it with a warm , dry iron to remove all creases and wrinkles . For a firmer , more durable working surface , reinforce the pattern with lightweight , fusible interfacing applied to the wrong side . Finally , carefully cut out the pattern along the cutting lines , leaving the seam allowances intact and in place . <p> Alteration basicsThe following guidelines are useful no matter what alteration technique you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point ; for example , after the length is corrected , the width may be fine , so begin working from the top of the pattern down , in the following order : <p> * First , alter for even or equal amounts of change in length ( as when both sides need to be changed the same amount ) . <p> * Second , alter for uneven or unequal amounts of change in length . <p> * Third , alter for even amounts of change in width ( as when the width needs to be changed the same amount along a full seam ) . <p> * Fourth , alter for uneven amounts of change in width . <p> When you alter just the seamline , you 'll cause the least possible distortion to the pattern and keep your alteration safely away from areas that do n't need to change . <p> Think through each alteration individually , then as it relates to adjoining pattern pieces and to other alterations , which you may be able to make at the same time . Make notes so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do n't forget to make corresponding alterations on adjoining pattern pieces so seamlines match . <p> When you 're finished , double-check these points : <p> * The amounts of change must be correct . <p> * The style of the garment must be the same as before the alteration , unless a style change was intentional . <p> * The grainline must be positioned the same as before the alteration so the fabric hangs or drapes properly . <p> * Center-front and center-back seamlines or foldlines must be straight , and seams that cross them must still cross ( and meet ) at the same angle . <p> * Adjoining stitching lines must match one another . <p> * Curved seamlines must curve smoothly . <p> * The altered pattern must lie smooth and flat . If the pattern is puckered or wrinkled , its size will be smaller in that area . <p> The seam method , step by stepPlace the pattern , printed side up , on top of your tissue paper . Locate the stitching line to be altered ( the one affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stitching line . Then draw a line across the seam allowance at each pivot point . You will need pivot points : <p> * Where the figure variation begins . <p> * Where the figure variation ends . <p> * At the point(s) between : where the figure variation is greatest , where it changes from symmetrical to asymmetrical , or begins to taper into the original stitching line ( the greater the curve , the more pivot points may be needed to maintain a smooth stitching line ) . <p> * At the base of darts affected by the alteration , on one or both sides of the dart , depending on the variation . <p> TO INCREASE LENGTH OF PANTS BACK <p> The seam-method version of this frequently described alteration for full buttocks gives increased length without changing the grain , dart orientation , or side-seam shape of the pants back . <p> Cut the affected seam allowance from the pattern , carefully cutting just inside the stitching line . On the lines drawn across the seam allowance , clip to , but not through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper hinge that allows you to move the seam allowance in or out and to make it lie flat . Tape the unaffected pattern edges to the alteration paper underneath . Then slide or pivot the free seam allowance in the required direction and amount . <p> To increase length or width , slide or pivot the freed seam allowance away from the pattern . To decrease length or width , slide or pivot the freed seam allowance onto the pattern . <p> If you 're unsure about dart ends , fold the dart , and turn it in the finished direction . Cut off the dart base according to the overlapping pattern cutting line . This will automatically restore the correct end shape . To test the altered pattern , pin-fit the pattern , or sew a trial- fitting garment in muslin or gingham . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised at the logic and accuracy of your alterations . <p> More information about Judith Rasband and her books ( Fabulous Fit and Fitting &amp; Pattern Alteration ) is available through the Web site www.conselle.com. 4378 @qwx204378 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works like a charm !

Laying out your pattern on the fabric to prepare for cutting is an important step that must be done carefully and accurately for great-looking results . Here are some tips on layout and some ideas on pinning or using weights to anchor your pattern pieces in place . <p> Pattern preliminariesBe sure you have all the necessary pattern pieces . Most instruction sheets list pieces by letter or number next to the layout diagrams . <p> Make any changes or fitting alterations to the pattern . If you significantly alter a garment 's length , you may need extra yardage to make sure you have a workable layout . Press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they 're easier to work with . <p> Preshrink your fabric if necessary , and make sure the grain is straight . Do this by tearing across the grain at the ends of your fabric piece ( if it 's firmly woven ) , pulling a thread across the width of the fabric at the ends , or cutting along a dominant line in the pattern or weave . Fold lengthwise , matching selvages , to see whether the ends now match . If they do n't and the fabric needs to be straightened , gently pull on the fabric 's length from opposite corners . <p> Spread out fabric carefullyIn preparation for cutting , fabric is usually folded . The instruction sheet gives alternatives for folding that are determined by the fabric 's width , the garment 's size , and the size of the pattern pieces . A crosswise layout is often needed for wide pieces , and sometimes a layout shows a double fold , in which both selvages are brought to the center ( see the drawings below ) . In all cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be centered or matched and when cutting pile fabrics like velvet or corduroy , because there 's less sliding . <p> Choose a layout from the appropriate instruction sheet , or invent your own . When working with a plaid fabric , lay out your pattern pieces on a single thickness for easier matching , regardless of suggested layout . When laying out soft sheers and slippery fabrics , tightly cover your cutting surface with a muslin-like fabric to help prevent sliding , and use a single-thickness layout . <p> Whether you fold or cut singly , always keep the entire length of fabric on top of the cutting surface while pinning and cutting to prevent distortion or stretching caused by the weight of the fabric hanging over the table 's edge . For large fabric pieces , fold or roll up the end that 's not being cut , and unroll as your layout progresses . Be sure that all of your pattern pieces fit on your fabric before you begin cutting . <p> Choose a cutting layoutPattern instructions provide layout diagrams for various fabric widths . Find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fabric width . <p> With-nap layout , lengthwise foldA with-nap layout has all pattern pieces placed in the same direction , so any designs or nap on the fabric will be consistently positioned on the garment . <p> Without-nap layout , crosswise foldIn a without-nap layout , the pattern pieces can be placed in opposing directions . <p> Lengthwise double foldThis layout is used when cutting two pieces that fit side by side on the fabric , but need to be placed on the fold for cutting . <p> Grainline and layoutA grainline mark on a pattern piece is the long straight line with arrows at each end that shows how to position the piece accurately on the fabric 's grain . Pin one of the arrows in place , and measure from it to the fabric 's selvage . Then measure and adjust the other arrow so that it 's the same distance from the selvage . <p> The phrase with-nap on a layout sheet indicates that all pattern pieces are placed on the fabric going in the same direction , top to bottom . Use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for satin and fabrics with a definite one-way design . A without-nap layout is used when pattern pieces can be laid in both directions . <p> When your pattern pieces are properly aligned on the fabric , ( see Anchor the pattern to the fabric ) anchor them with pins , as most sewers do , or use weights , like Weight Mates ( available from Clotilde or Joanne 's Notions ) . Then get out your scissors . You 're ready to cut . <p> Anchor the pattern to the fabric <p> Choose pins suitable to fabric ; place them perpendicular to cutting lines and pointed into corners . To keep pattern and fabric flat , catch as little of each as possible . <p> Weights are a fast , easy way to anchor a pattern . You can use weights designed for this purpose , or raid your cupboard for soup cans or something smooth and heavy enough to hold your pattern in place . <p> Jan Bones sews in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , and teaches at sewing festivals across Canada and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pattern layout for a tote-bag .

@@22148684 @2148684/ <h> Copying Complex Garments <p> In an earlier article ( Threads #88 , pp. 36-39 ) , we described making a pattern from a favorite pair of pants , and promised to return with directions for a more complicated copying project . The1940s jacket shown below is just such a project . It features many detailsgathers , shaped pockets , sleeve darts , and assorted flapsthat would appear to make copying it a challenge . Nonetheless , with care and common sense , even a complex garment can be coaxed into giving up its secrets . <p> A 1940s wool herringbone jacket , rich in detail , is a challenging garment to copy . <p> In the photos that follow , Blossom will go step-by-step through copying this jacket , which should also reveal how to tackle any similarly complicated garment , since the basic strategy will be the same . <p> In a nutshell , the copying process involves pinning garment sections flat to a paper-covered padded surface , and tracing each seam by poking through the seam and the paper beneath with a needle , or next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a row of holes in the paper . Then simply connect the holes to create the pattern outline , true things up , add seam allowances , and test with a muslin . <p> A copying recapNo unusual tools are needed for copying a garment . Besides a large , flat workspace , a folded blanket or something similar to serve as the padded surface ( its not necessary to secure the padding to the work surface ) , and a few large sheets of paper or nonwoven interfacing for the pattern itself , you will need a pencil , an embroidery needle ( or some other heavy , not too sharp needle ) , paper scissors , a straightedge , some pins , and a tape measure . We suggest a soft , nonwoven interfacing as an alternative to paper , because you 'll be folding and manipulating it to test each pattern piece as you work , so the sturdier and more flexible the pattern material is , the better . Flimsy tissues or tracing papers that are too crisp are not ideal . <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to an edge . <p> Before you start pinning down each garment section , begin by thread-tracing with a contrasting color the straight-grain line and the waistline cross-grain line on all of the garments major pieces , so you have an unequivocal reference line at all times , as shown in photo 1 at right . If you cant see the grain easily , and cant pull a thread inconspicuously to locate it , use a low-power magnifying glass to make the grain more obvious . If your garment is precious , test the tracing thread ( again , in an inconspicuous place ) to be sure it does n't  leave a mark when pulled out . Make sure you trace these grainlines on each piece . <p> Always start a copying project by thread-tracing the straight-grain and cross-grain lines at the waistline on each major garment piece . <p> 2 . Trace free edges with a pencil , after pinning the garment as flat as possible without distorting it . Push the pencil point through the pattern material every few inches to make a hole . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the seamline to make more holes . If the seam is hidden , feel for it with your fingers . <p> 5 . Use a ruler to true seam marks on seams that you know to be straight . <p> 6 . Always check traced outlines by measuring them against the garment on the straight- and cross-grains . Measure gathers when gathered and when pulled open as close to the seam as possible . <p> 7 . Always check your traced pattern pieces by pinning them together to compare them to the originals , particularly when shaping , ease , or gathers are involved . <p> 8 . Simple facings can be measured without needing to be traced . Copy their more complex sections from the outer pieces they attach to . <p> 9 . Trace flaps and other small details with the pattern material on top , not underneath . Be sure to transfer the grainline . <p> 10 . Continue to check your pattern pieces as you progress . In this shot , the upper portion of the facing is left uncut until more of the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first garment section you plan to copy , so that its grain is parallel to a nearby edge of your pattern material as a further reference point against which to check angles , and so on . The copying order is not critical , but as a rule , we start with the front , sleeves , and back , then move to the collar and other details . Arrange as much as possible of each piece so that all of its seams and edges are visible while it lies as flat as possible without distorting the grain . If you are unable to see every seam , fold the piece to reveal as much of it as possibletry to fold away the straightest and simplest seams so you can trace the more complex ones directlyand trace what you can see , including the outline of the nearest fold . Then measure the distance from the fold to the hidden seam , and add this to your tracing . That process is how Blossom will make the pattern for the wider , back piece of the sleeve that she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tracing the fully visible front piece . <p> 11 . Pin sleeves together as flat as possible before pinning them to the pattern material with the grainline parallel to an edge . <p> 12 . After tracing each half of the sleeve , measure it on straight- and cross-grains , and correct your tracing if necessary . <p> 13 . Slash across the sleeve pattern if there 's an elbow dart . Measure the dart width by feeling through the garment layers , then spread the slash by that amount , filling in with more pattern material underneath . <p> 14 . Straighten the opposite edge of a spread sleeve by filling in with more material and redrawing it with a ruler or a curve . <p> 15 . Always reposition and repin the garment to trace each section separately , even if you can see several sections at once . This ensures that the grain is straight on each section . <p> In a similar fashion , pleats and darts can be copied with a combination of tracing for position and measuring for depth , as shown in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to slash the jackets rear sleeve pattern to recreate the shape it had before its dart was closed . If you cant see the inside of a dart , just feel through the fabric to measure it . In this way you can also outline pocket bags and facings , shoulder pads , and any other hidden or interior details that youd prefer to duplicate , rather than redraft or replace . <p> 16 . Complete the shaping of the facing when all the related outer sections are finished . <p> 17 . Trace both halves of large symmetrical details if the garment is old enough to have stretched ( left ) . After tracing , fold the pattern in half and refine the outline to taste , perhaps using what you prefer from each side of the tracing ( right ) . <p> As you see in the slideshow , its important to check each pattern piece against those they will be joined to . This is especially true wherever the construction involves ease or shaping , as in the jacket front shown in photo 10 , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eased or not , you will usually find it easiest to check and to true all seams by comparing the partially cut-out pattern pieces you 're creating , both as you make each one , and when you 've finished tracing all of them . <p> Add linings , seam allowances , and test ! Of course , the pattern you create with this process is without linings , or allowances for seams and hems . For jacket linings , you can simply subtract the facings from the basic pattern pieces to make the lining pattern , adding a 1-1/2-in. pleat from neck to hem at center back for wearing ease . Tack the pleat at top , hem , and waist on the final garment . <p> As you 're copying each section of the garment , its a good idea to feel through the garment and note the existing depths of each seam and hem allowance . But whether you plan to use the same allowances or not , we recommend cutting out your test garment with generous allowances , and basting it together before attempting anything more permanent . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying any garment , because it allows you to fine-tune both the pattern and the construction steps required to get a copy you will be happy with . <p> Blossom Jenab teaches couture sewing , patternmaking , and tailoring in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .

You find the odor is stronger the less processed the silk is . The only way to get rid of it is to repeatedly have it washed or drycleaned until it is muted to an acceptable " aroma " or gone . The off-set to doing this is the loss of crispness or body in the fabric , and then you have to augment it by having it " sized " by a drycleaner or if you are washing it yourself you make up diluted starch and use it to put the body back .

But what about small-busted gals ? Most pattern companies base their fitting models on a B-cup . If you 're smaller than the norm , then you need to adjust your pattern or you 'll have unsightly folds and excess fabric on your bodice . Not a good look ! <p> Fitting the formLet 's think for a moment about the topography of the female form . Often , we think of bust fitting as a horizontal measurement issue ( 34 , 36 , 42 etc ) .

A graphic example of this is to take a standard size-10 fitting bodice and put it on 3 different bodies with the same basic measurements , but different bust cup sizes : A , B , and C.

Pinch out the length at the side front seam.For the side front , you want the amount taken out at the side front seam to match that taken from the center front ( 1/2 inch ) .

As with the center front , make a quarter inch pleat at the side front seam , tapering to nothing at the side seam .

It 's going up on one wall of my bedroom . <p> Niagara starch worked in a test run of my fabric as wallpaper project . It lightly adhered a 12-inch by 24-inch piece of fabric to the wall overnight . <p> The fabric went up nice and smooth with the starch - I just smoothed out any bubbles with my fingers and a rolling pin . <p> I loved the colors and the sheen of this silk floral .

It appealed to me when I looked at it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty boring . <p> I started to look for temporary projects that were quick , and- simple and I came across one that I think will be fun and make a big difference : Using fabric as temporary wallpaper . <p> I wanted an accent wall in the bedroom . I found a how-to article , " The Quick Fix Fabric on Walls " at RentalDecorating.com . I 'd like to know if anyone has tried this technique and if the results were successful . <p> When you need to remove the fabric , it peels off the wall - no harm done <p> The instructions are simple : Wash the wall , then use push pins to fasten fabric along the wall 's top edge . Apply fabric starch to the wall ( with a paint roller or from a spray can ) , starting at the top and smoothing the hanging fabric over it until you reach the floor . Hang another panel , matching the pattern and repeat the starch and fabric application down the wall . After the wall is covered , you trim the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , either . You can cover any portion of a wall , or just a section and " frame " it with fancy trim . <p> I picked out my fabric , a giant silk floral with a pretty sheen ( a white bed headboard and a bookcase will go against the wall , so that will cut the print 's impact ) . I pinned it up in the living room in two panels , just to get practice matching the panels . I lucked out in that the 2 2/3 yards I needed for each piece came within a few inches of the pattern repeat . <p> Test run with laundry starch <p> I tried several craft and home supply stores , but could n't find fabric starch . So I went to the grocery store and got a spray can of Niagara starch - and it worked ! <p> I washed a section of wall , then sprayed it with the Niagara starch . I used a piece of fabric left over from lining a bag - it 's about the same weight and texture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . No bubbles or peeling and even the tiny frayed threads were still splayed out on the wall . <p> When I peeled it off , it came away from the wall easily . I think that you could even wash and use fabric from this project in something else later . I am going to keep looking for a plastic-based starch before I complete this project in earnest - I am concerned that a corn-based starch could draw insects . The Niagara Starch did n't list ingredients on the label , and I have n't found it online yet either. - <p> Please share if you 've ever tried this technique .

I did plenty of research on this subject and found some interesting information . <p> THE TOMATO EVOLVESI also learned that during the Victorian Era , folklore suggests that when a family moved into a new home , a fresh tomato was placed on the mantle to- ward off evil spirits- and thus bring prosperity to the new homeowners .

If I had a stuffed tomato on my mantle , I 'm sure I 'd use that instead !

Nuns used to literally use straight pins to hold their Wimples in place around their faces , And not so long ago Nurses wore , on a day to day basis , a simple cap made in the shape of a " T " .

Emery is usually the same corundum used to sharpen and hone knives and scissors , as a grit .

Tailors all men , and dressmakers were rarely working for them at any design level , when fine millinery was acceptable women 's work from every level including supply chain , business details and the lot . <p> I 'm working on reviving and updating millinery craft/technology , which has been pretty sadly neglected . Maybe we can bring back the chatelaine too . It 's a wonderful tradition , and some of the old chatelaines are stunning works of art , as well as the most amazing toolkits for sewing !

@@22148725 @2148725/ <p> If you are among the 1 in 15 women in this country who sew and that 's at least 4.5 million plus-sized sewers you can have any garment you want : any size , style , fabric , color , and designer name with comfortable and flattering fit . In Sewing for Plus Sizes , Barbara Deckert shares her strategies for creating contemporary , comfortable , and classy garments using basic sewing skills . In this excerpt from Chapter 4 , Barbara shares tips for choosing the right fabric for your garments . <p> When you walk into a fabric store , your senses of sight , touch , and even smell are immediately stimulated by the hundreds of colors , patterns , and textures that you see in the fabrics arrayed before you . Fabric is such a sensual pleasure ! While the beauty of fabrics elicits a visceral and passionate response in most sewers , there is much more to fabric than meets the eye or fingers and nose , for that matter . Plus-sized sewers must understand that the fiber content of the fabric that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they sew . Fabric choices affect a garment 's design , durability , comfort , and care requirements . <p> There 's more to fabrics than meets the eye . From the sheerest sheer to thick and textured , from restrained pinstripes to hot pink , the options are almost limitless . <p> Fibers are the smallest units from which fabrics are made . They are twisted together to form threads that are woven or knitted into fabrics . Every fiber has a characteristic set of performance properties , which affect your garment 's success no matter what style of fabric those fibers are woven into . That 's why the name of the fiber or fibers that make up a fabric is the most important piece of information that you need to consider before you purchase it . <p> Some of these performance characteristics have to do with aesthetics , the way a fabric made from a particular fiber looks . For example , the fabric 's hand describes all its tactile qualities , that is , everything you can feel with your hand . Some qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its drape , or how softly or stiffly the fabric hangs when gathered ; its luster , or how dull or shiny it is ; and its wrinkle resistance . <p> What 's in a Name ? <p> Every bolt of fabric you look at has a name . These names can be confusing , however , because they may refer to a trade name , such as " Ultrasuede " ; a textile mill name , such as " Burlington " ; a manufacturing process , such as " acid-washed " or " sueded " ; a fabric finish , such as " Visa " ( polyester ) ; a weave , such as " satin " , or the name of a fiber or blend of fibers , such as " ramie . " <p> It 's no wonder that in my custom clothing business , when I talk to brides who want a " silk " wedding gown , I eventually learn that what they really want is a fabric that is " silky " and shiny . I have to explain that satin , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous kinds of fibers , such as silk , polyester , nylon , acetate , rayon , cotton , and even wool . Silk , on the other hand , is a particular fiber that can be woven or knitted into a wide variety of fabrics , from the most gossamer chiffon to heavy , stiff suitings . <p> Another performance characteristic that affects design is the fiber 's durability . For example , some fibers are more resistant to abrasion than others , and some are stronger than others . <p> Comfort factors are also very important when selecting fibers for plus-sized designs . Some fibers are naturally absorbent and others are moisture repellent . A ripstop nylon that works well for a lightweight raincoat would not be comfortable for a warm weather nightgown . Some fibers breathe , that is , allow air and moisture to pass from the body to the outside air , or they may be occlusive , that is , hold in body heat and moisture . Some fibers burn ; some do n't ( see Burn testing , below ) . <p> Burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the generic or trade name of the fabric , the fiber content by percentages , and the country of origin . It 's common practice , however , for stores to sell " mystery " fabrics with no labels or sometimes with labels that are incomplete or incorrect . <p> In better sewing stores , you can ask a clerk to burn-test a mystery fabric by snipping off a tiny swatch , holding it with tweezers over a metal pan or ashtray , and setting it on fire . Very generally speaking , protein fibers , such as silk and wool , smell like burned hair and leave a crushable black bead . Vegetable fibers , such as cotton , linen , or ramie , and cellulosic fibers , such as rayon or acetate , leave a fluffier ash and smell like burning paper . Most noncellulosic synthetics , on the other hand , usually leave a hard , plastic bead , which tells you what they 're really made of . <p> If you find a fabric that is not labeled and the store will not burn test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you 're paying for , and you wo n't know how the fabric will perform for your design . <p> Because each fiber differs in how it performs in terms of its aesthetics , durability , and comfort , you must determine the fiber content of every fabric you buy . This information should be written on the bolt end or on a tag attached to the roll of fabric . <p> Natural fibersGenerally , natural fibers are the best investment for plus-sized apparel . They are easier to sew because they press well , and they look and feel best on our plus-sized bodies . <p> Natural fibers are the real thing . These are all wool , but they range from sturdy and tweedy to delicate and drapey . <p> Woolens and worsteds Woolens and worsteds are usually knitted or woven from the hairs of sheep . They usually require dry cleaning , but many knits , wovens that have been treated with special resins , and tightly woven twills like gabardine can be preshrunk , then hand-laundered in cold water , and hung or laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter hairs of a fleece . They are warm , absorbent , bulky , and fuzzy . For these softer fabrics , pilling , abrasion , and felting from perspiration , body warmth , and pressure can be a problem , for example , on plus-sized pants at the upper , inner thigh . Luxury woolens are made from the hairs of other animals , including cashmere from a particular breed of goat , alpaca , camel hair , and angora from rabbit 's fur . <p> Worsteds are woven from the longer fleece hairs from a higher twist yarn , which makes for a relatively finer , firmer thread . They are generally lighter in weight and thinner than woolens , are wiry , smooth , and slightly lustrous , and have a hard surface that wears very well . Worsteds make excellent jackets , skirts , and pants for plus sizes . They look classy , skim the body , resist wrinkling , breathe well even in tropical climates , and wear like iron . <p> Filament silks are as vibrant as stained glass . Raw silks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protein fiber that is naturally spun by silkworms , just as a spider spins its web . Silk is luxurious and comfortable to wear , especially in hot and humid climates . Brightly colored silks or those used for heavily constructed garments like tailored jackets should be dry-cleaned . Silks in light colors or those used for simple garments can be hand-washed in cool water and hung to dry , as has been done for the last 3,000 years of silk production . <p> TipSome silks for closely fitted garments need to be underlined to avoid seam slippage . Seam slippage is that crosswise shredding that can occur at stressed vertical seams . To test for seam slippage , use your fingernail to scratch the fabric gently crosswise . If the threads shift easily from side to side , slippage is likely to occur . <p> Filament silk is made from very long , smooth silk fibers , so it 's slippery and lustrous . Raw or noil silk is made from shorter pieces of silk fiber . It 's much less expensive than filament silk and feels similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shorter fiber length , but it drapes , sews , and presses easily and makes beautiful , comfortable , and luxurious sportswear . For the last few years , all kinds of silk have been at their lowest prices in three decades , to the point that Chinese farmers are cutting down their mulberry trees ( silkworms eat the leaves ) to make way for more profitable crops . Take advantage of this market low , and choose silk over synthetics , which may cost no less than silk . <p> Cotton Cotton is comfortable and absorbent , drapes well , and varies widely in quality . Generally , look for a close weave and a long fiber length . Pull a thread from the cut end of the cotton , untwist it , and look for fibers over 1 in. long . <p> Some cottons are heavily sized , or starched , to make them seem crisper , heavier , and more expensive , but of course the sizing will wash out when the fabric is laundered or dry-cleaned . Oftentimes you can hold a cotton up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the warp and the weft . Most cottons launder well , but bright colors may fade , and many cottons may require ironing . Dry-clean cottons only if the construction is complicated , such as for a tailored jacket , or if the colors are bright , such as for a cerise pique evening dress . Dry-cleaning fluids are harsh on natural fibers and can leave residues ( which are actually other people 's dirt ) that cause yellowing on whites and light colors . Cottons are an excellent choice for all kinds of plus-sized apparel . <p> From gauze to suitings , crisp and cool linen is a prudent luxury . Options are almost limitless . <p> Linen Linen fibers come from the flax plant and have been around even longer than silk . Ancient Egyptian mummies were wound in strips of linen , some of which are still intact today . Linen is one of my favorite fibers for plus-sized designs . It is beautifully breathable and strong and wears very well . It 's crisp , slightly lustrous , and luxurious . Linen fabrics vary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look for a tight weave and avoid linens with heavy sizing . <p> Most linens for simpler garments and lighter colors can be hand-washed in cool water and hung to dry , while bright colors and complicated garments are best dry-cleaned . Linen softens with each washing and eventually develops an almost velvety patina . Yes , linen does wrinkle , which you can test by crushing the fabric in your hand . Often the wrinkles on heavier linen quickly fall out , and some linens have been treated with resins to resist creasing . To me , the " used handkerchief look " shouts luxury , so learn to love the wrinkles ! <p> TipNote that some fabrics and much ready-to-wear may be labeled " linen " but contain no flax fiber at all . They are simply cheaper , crisp , woven substitutes made of cotton , rayon , or polyester , or they may be blends with a small percentage of flax . <p> Other plant fibers such as hemp , ramie , and jute function similarly to linen , but their fibers may be relatively shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear as well . You can pull a fiber from the cut end of the piece to test it as you can with cotton . <p> SyntheticsMan-made fibers are identified by their fiber name , trade name , or the manufacturing process used to turn the basic fiber into a fabric . Most synthetics were developed to replace more costly or less available natural fibers . <p> Rayon One of the oldest synthetic fibers is rayon , which was first made from the cellulose in wood pulp in 1889 as a substitute for silk , linen , wool , and cotton . It was widely used during and after both WWI and WWII when sources for natural fibers were disrupted . Rayon fabrics are strong when dry but weak when wet . They are breathable , resist abrasion , and drape attractively . They also shrink when laundered , and most wrinkle very badly . <p> TipSince many fabrics labeled " rayon " do not specify what type of rayon , it 's sometimes hard to guess how they will perform . When in doubt , buy 1/4 yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp , tweedy suiting may work fine if it is underlined and dry-cleaned , but it could change to a wrinkly , soft , gauzy mess after washing . <p> Viscose rayon tends to wrinkle the most of all the rayon manufacturing processes . Cuprammonium rayon uses copper compounds to dissolve the cellulose ; it is a relatively finer fiber that is crisper and more drapable , launders more easily , and does not wrinkle as much as viscose rayon . Bemberg lining fabrics are an example of this type of rayon . Polynosic rayon is completely washable and has a hand similar to high quality cotton . Tencel is a trade name for a rayon similar to polynosic rayon , which is manufactured by a fairly new process in the United States . <p> Acetate Acetate was also developed as a silk substitute ; it is often used for bridal , evening , and lining fabrics . It is also a cellulosic fiber made by dissolving cellulose from wood pulp in acetone . That 's why acetate will dissolve in acetone nail polish remover . Acetate is usually dry-cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errant drips . However , it is lustrous and crisp , comfortable and breathable , so it is an excellent choice for plus-sized eveningwear and linings . <p> Acrylic Acrylic fiber was developed as a substitute for woolens , and it is often seen in the form of knits and fleece fabrics . Acrylics are warm , bulky , fuzzy , stretchy , and comfortable to wear and can be easily washed . Because this fiber is soft , it pills easily and also holds static . <p> Nylon Nylon , also a substitute for silk , is usually slippery and very strong and drapes well , but it is also occlusive and has a very low melt temperature , so it does n't take a press very well . Nylons range in use from bulletproof ballistic cloth to Cordura luggage fabric to the sheerest of panty hose . Because most nylons do not breathe , you may wish to avoid them for most garments . Some of the newer types of nylon , such as Taslan or Supplex , are more comfortable and make excellent lightweight , windproof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also tradenamed Lycra and Glospan , was developed as a substitute for rubber after WWII . Spandex is usually covered with other fibers such as cotton , nylon , silk , or wool to produce blends for knitted and woven fabrics . A little spandex in a fabric adds stretch for shapewear , increases movement for active sportswear , and adds comfort and body to all fabrics . Never use chlorine bleach on any fabric containing spandexit will yellow and deteriorate the fiber . <p> Polyester Polyester , a.k.a . " The Famous Twin Sisters Polly and Esther , " is really a form of plastic made from petroleum products . Polyesters are wrinkle resistant , durable , cheap , widely available , and attractive looking , but they do not breathe . They are extremely unabsorbent and uncomfortable to wear , especially for large , warm people . Wearing a polyester blouse or lining next to your skin , particularly in hot and humid climates , can make you feel as if you 're wrapped in plastic wrap , which is indeed the case . <p> Although polyester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food oils like a magnet . They may not launder out , thus the dreaded " ring around the collar " that can develop on polyester or polyester-blend shirts . Because polyester does n't press well , it is also more difficult to sew than a natural fiber . Please avoid polyester for your everyday garments . When you need to wear a garment for only a couple of hours at a time in a climate-controlled environment such as in the evening , polyesters are fine ; otherwise , they will make you look and feel miserable . <p> Blends combine both the best and worst of their components ' performance characteristics . A cotton/polyester blend , for example , may make you feel sticky and will hold oil stains , but it wo n't wrinkle as much as all cotton . Blends also pill more easily than single fiber fabrics because different fibers may not stay twisted together and may break loose to form pills . <p> During her more than 30 years of sewing experience , Barbara Deckert has personally worn every pattern size from 12 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clothiers , she has developed methods to quickly and fearlessly adjust patterns to fit the unique bodies of women of all shapes an sizes .

As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feels , and lately Ive been exploring similar pebbled effects . By stitching two or three layers of fabric together , one or more of which is not prewashed , and then washing and drying the layers several times , I 've been transforming plain , flat fabric into a dimensional surface , like a quilt without the batting , as you can see here . This new fabric has body , yet drapes , and is very travel-friendly . It can be used for garments ; accents on garments , like collars and cuffs ; accessories , such as evening bags ; and home-decorating accents , like place mats , pillows , and valances . I 'll take you through the process I use to achieve these effects , share with you some of my results , and pass along some further suggestions for ideas you may want to explore on your own . <p> The stitching pattern and fabric choice combine to produce the texture . From top , silk organdy over cotton gauze with a wavy stitched grid ; the same grid on velveteen over muslin ; parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Shrink differentThe two main variables in the creation of a shrink-textured fabric are the fabrics you choose to layer , and the stitching patterns you use to join them . First , you must choose a top , or " face , " fabric that can handle being washed in hot water and dried in a dryer on a medium to high setting . The face fabric must either be nonshrinkable , like polyester , or be prewashed several times before layering to be sure that it wont shrink any further . Actually , I recommend prewashing even nonshrinking fabrics to be certain they do n't  change shape . <p> I 've used a variety of fabrics , from silk organza to cotton velveteen , for the face fabric , as you can see above . Cotton velveteen creates a luxurious , almost fur-like fabric when textured . Linen distresses wonderfully , and light silks can produce surprising special effects . Any patterned fabric becomes more complex as the pattern gets distorted . Wools , however , are not suitable , since most will continue to shrink and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable-weight fabric to layer on the back . You want this fabric to shrink when washed with the face fabric , so use a shrinkable material that you know has not been prewashed and does not have a shrink-resistant or permanent-press finish . To back a lightweight face fabric , I usually choose all-cotton gauze , voile , or batiste . A medium-weight face fabric works well with batiste or muslin , and heavier fabrics will require at least muslin to create enough texture ; I mostly use an unbleached , all-cotton muslin ( available at quilt stores ) . Cotton batiste and voile can be ordered through most specialty fabric suppliers , if your fabric store does n't  have them . Cotton gauze , or cheesecloth , is available at paint suppliers or in hardware/houseware departments of stores like Kmart and Target ( be sure you are getting 100% cotton ! ) . <p> If you want the shrinking fabric to be the lining also , you can choose a cotton print or colored solid , but these may not shrink as much as the fabrics mentioned above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as described below . You can also sandwich the shrinking fabric between the face fabric and a lining . Either approach works well if you 're making place mats or a simple jacket , for example , and do n't  want the extra step of lining the project . <p> Stitch regularThe second variable when creating a stitched texture is the stitching . Because the nonshrinking face fabric is free to bubble up only where its not stitched , the stitches and arrangements of stitched lines you use to join the layers together will determine the pattern of the textures that are created . So , to get consistent , controlled results , I stitch in a consistent way and preplan my stitching lines , as I 'll describe in a moment . <p> I 've effectively used plain straight stitch , various zigzags and serpentines , and many other decorative patterns . Keep in mind that the more densely you pack the stitching or stitch pattern , the more you 'll stiffen the fabric . Arrangements I 've used include grids , free-motion random patterns , parallel lines , and following the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even , allover texture pattern . Parallel lines create a directional orientation , either vertical , horizontal , or diagonal , as shown in the swatches above . <p> Prep samplesPrewash the face fabric in hot water with some detergent and dry it on a medium-high dryer setting . If you 're using a fabric that may have residual shrinking , like cotton or linen , repeat the process two or three times . I generally do n't  add any more detergent after the first wash . Do not press the fabric ! Remove it from the dryer immediately to reduce wrinkles and roll it loosely on a tube until ready to use . <p> Cut pieces at least 10 in. sq . for your samples , so you can get a good look at the effect of shrinking . If you like the texture , the exact amount of shrinkage is n't very important , because when you 're making fabric to use , you 'll be adding extra seam allowance to the pattern pieces and trimming to size later ( as shown at center above ) . <p> Lay the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the bottom edge and one side line up with the lines on the mat , then lay the shrinking fabric on top with the bottom edge and one side aligned . Tape the corners to your mat to keep everything in place ; pins cause bumps under the ruler when marking the stitching lines , so do n't  use them . Tape down every 10 in. or so on larger pieces to keep them from shifting . <p> Draw guidelinesNext , draw or mark the stitching lines you plan to follow on the back of the shrinking fabric , using a wash-out marker if the backing fabric is also the lining . Marking on cotton gauze can be challengingI found a felt-tip pen and light pressure work best . For straight lines , I use a ruler and the 1-in. gridlines on the mat as guides , as shown at left . Hold the ruler down firmly and release pressure on your drawing tool every 6 in. or so to allow the fabric to relax . <p> To mark stitching lines on layered fabric , align garment centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separated and trimmed to the pattern shape after shrinking ( see a shrunken , trimmed front at right ) , Carlson keeps them together at this stage , so marking and stitching will match across the center line , later marked with clips or large notches top and bottom . The mats gridlines simplify ruler placement during marking . <p> For regular wavy lines , or anything other than a straight line that I want to repeat , I make a template out of thin cardboard , shifting it over every 1/4 in. to 1 in. , depending on how close I want the lines to be . To keep the spacing regular , I line up the template with orientation marks , such as the gridlines on the mat or ones Ive drawn in . Sometimes I 'll shift the template a little each time in order to offset the guideline . For irregular wavy lines ( my favorite variation ) , I 'll draw straight lines in even increments , as if for a grid or parallel line design , but as I 'm stitching over each line , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced waves . <p> Keep layered pieces rolled for smooth handling under the machine . Carlson usually marks every other stitching line , stitches over marked gridlines first , then goes back and stitches in between , making it easier to judge the placement of the unmarked stitching lines . <p> Stitch and shrinkAfter marking , pin or baste every 4 in. all over the pieces to hold the layers together , then remove them from the mat and machine-baste along the bottom edge only . To create the maximum texture , especially on lighter-weight fabrics , adjust the tension on both your bobbin thread ( if you can ) and the top thread as tight as you can make it , without pulling the stitch out of balance . If you 're using a decorative stitch , check to be sure it looks good on the face side . <p> Stitch all of your parallel lines in the same direction , starting at the same edge each time ; if you switch directions , the texture may appear irregular after being washed . Check the right side frequently for tucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moving smoothly through the machine . When you 've finished stitching all the lines , sew around the edge of the fabric and clip any loose threads . <p> Now you 're ready to shrink it . For samples , a bucket of hot water and a few drops of detergent will dojust swish them around , and let them soak at least 30 minutes , then rinse and dry in the dryer on high , repeating the process if you plan to do so for your finished project . <p> Making the real thingWhen you 've decided on your stitching pattern and backing fabric , you 're ready to begin . Cut your pattern pieces out of the face fabric , adding approximately 2 in. all around for shrinkage , plus an extra 1 in. on the lengthwise grain for each piece ( since most fabrics tend to shrink more in length than in width ) , and even more if your fabric frays a lot . Cut the same size pieces from the shrinking fabric . <p> Whenever possible , I like to place pattern pieces that have an on-grain seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together on a fold and stitch across both before separating them , so the stitching lines will match across the garment . Mark both the face fabric and the shrinking fabric with a clip at center , top , and bottom to help align the layered fabrics to the grid beneath , as shown at left above . Mark and stitch each piece as you did for the sample . I recommend allowing most of a day to do the stitching on a jacket-sized project . <p> When all the pieces have been stitched , baste all major symmetrical piecessuch as the two sleeves , and the fronts and the back of a jacket right sides together , stitching around the edges . This will keep the front surfaces from getting washed-in foldlines . Wash and dry everything just as you did the sample , repeating if necessary . After everything has dried , remove the bastings and give each piece a light steaming , face down on the ironing board , just enough to flatten them for cuttingdont press out the wonderful texture you have just created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they may stretch slightly . <p> Tips for textured fabricWhen sewing , handle the textured fabric as you would a velvet : Do n't  press hard , and use steam and your fingers to open seam allowances . To prevent fraying , finish seam allowances by serging or with a bound ( or Hong-Kong ) finish , even if the garment is lined . Before seaming , always staystitch each piece just inside the seam allowance with the right side down toward the feed dogs . This will evenly distribute the excess face fabric so you wo n't get tucks in the seam . <p> To add more interest to your textured fabric , try stitching over some of the bubbles to flatten them . Consider adding appliquT , embroidered designs , or couched yarn . Beads sewn onto the stitching lines or into a bubble can make wonderful additions to textured accessories and accents .

@@22148731 @2148731/ <h> Trick for Removing Buttonhole Stitching <p> Nobody likes to remove stitches , and taking out faulty buttonholes must be the worst type of stitch ripping possible , but here 's a quick and easy way to do it . Use a seam ripper to cut through all the buttonhole stitches on the back of the garment , including the bar tacks at the top and bottom . On the front of the garment , use the seam ripper to gently pull out the top thread ( it should pull off in one piece ) , taking most of the bottom stitches with it . If the top thread does n't pull off completely , make sure you 've cut through all the stitches under the buttonhole . After the top thread is removed , use tweezers or masking tape to pull any remaining stitches . 
@@22148732 @2148732/ <p> Women love to wear jeans ; in fact , the average woman has seven pairs ! Why ? Because they cinch you in and make you look slimmer . But even if you cant find a pair at the store that fits , its simple to make your own comfortable and attractive jeans , in any fabric you please , like the ones were wearing . In the following pages , I 'll show you how to customize every aspect of jeans fit , using only a few basic measurements and one of several current patterns . Let 's start off with what 's unique about the way jeans fit . <p> Jeans will fit all types of bodies if you follow pattern alteration advice from Sandra Betzina . These jeans all come from Vogue 7608 , but you can start with any jeans pattern . <p> Jeans fit differently than trousersThe current jeans style is close-fitting , with a contoured front waistband and a shaped yoke in back . The top edge of jeans these days comes right to your waistline , or about 1/2 inch below it . Jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which on an average fitted trouser is about 1/2 inch from your body , and about 1 inch away on pull-on pants . There are three typical leg styles of modern jeans : straight-leg , tapered , and boot-cut . Straight-leg jeans fit to the hip but fall almost straight down from there . Tapered and boot- cut jeans fit snugly to the knee , but boot-cuts flare out below the knee ( to allow room for boots underneath ) , while tapered legs continue to taper to the hem . <p> To get all these features , you need a good pattern . I prefer Burda 8408 , or a pattern I designed for Vogue #7608 , shown here , which ranges in size for a 34- to a 57-inch hip . <p> Since these patterns are multisized , check the sizing chart to see what size you should use for your waist and hip measurements . If you need to combine sizes , use a highlighter to outline the sizes you 'll be using , making smooth transitions between the waist and hip areas . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will give you the circumference you need over the hip , tapering in a size or two at the waist . If the waist is still too large , reduce the back yoke and front contoured waistband by folding out small wedges , as shown below , to bring in the waist . If you have short legs , taper to a smaller size from the knee to the hem for better proportions . Finally , check the patterns total crotch-length measurement by measuring the front and back curves , and include the height of the waistbands and back-yoke pieces of your total measurement . <p> Measurements you 'll needThe measurements you need are listed below . If you like your jeans tight , you should take a snug measurement of your full hips , pulling the tape measure so that it cinches your hips as described . If you prefer a more relaxed fit , take the same measurements , but be sure to maintain minimal ease around your hips . <p> Another measurement that 's very handy to have , if possible , is the length of the crotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that area . If any of your trousers are the right length from crotch to waist , regardless of how they fit ( or do n't  fit ) elsewhere , measure the front and back crotch curves as shown below , and use these as references for your new jeans . If you simply do n't  have any pants that fit well , measure your figure from center-front waistline to center-back waistline between your legs . The drawings below will walk you through the process of altering your jeans based on these measurements . Just remember that if the total crotch measurement is different from the pattern , that does n't  tell you whether you need to add or subtract in the front , back , or both , so refer to all the drawings for guidance or make a muslin to see where the problem is . Below , you 'll find advice for fitting specific body contours that are independent of measurements . Have fun wearing your new jeans ! <p> Taking measurements for jeansTake all the indicated measurements with minimal ease , unless you want tight-fitting jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the body by about 1 inch . Take the full thigh sitting down with the tape measure near the crotch . To find the crotch length , measure either a comfortable pair of pants as shown below , or the figure , from waistline to waistline between the legs . <p> To begin , adjust the pattern to match your measurements and desired leg styleYou can make the following adjustments on your pattern . To be sure the results fit as you wish , make a muslin sample and try it on . <p> To make the waist bigger or smaller : Reshape the yoke and waistbandIf blending to a different size at the waistline does n't  help , slash the front waistband and the yoke pieces vertically several times , from the top edge to the opposite seamline , leaving a paper hinge , then overlap the slashes equally until the combined upper seamline is half the needed waistline length . <p> To lengthen or shorten the legs:Adjust above and below the kneesTo find the length adjustment needed , compare your measured length to the pants length on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divide the length adjustment in half ; spread or overlap the pattern by this amount both above and below the knee level . Smooth the affected seamlines . <p> To change the style of the leg:Redraw the seamlinesYou can customize the leg style and the hem circumference on any pattern by adding or reducing one-quarter the desired difference at the hemline at each vertical seamline and drawing new seams that taper from these points to wherever you want the width to be unchanged , typically somewhere between the knee and hip levels . <p> To shorten or lengthen the crotch : Reshape the front and back separatelyCompare your crotch measurement ( taken from your figure or from a favorite pair of pants ) to the pattern measurement . If there 's a difference , alter the front and back individually , adding or subtracting at midcurve . You can also make small changes to the waist or inseam positions if those are typical problem areas for you . <p> To change the front lengthSlash the pattern as shown , leaving a paper hinge at the side seamline . Spread or overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then smooth out the center-front/fly seam . Use a longer or shorter zipper to adapt to the new fly length . To change the back length Slash the pattern as shown , leaving a paper hinge at the side seamline . Spread or overlap the pattern pieces to get the length you need , then smooth out the center-back seam . <p> Specific body shapes require individual pattern adjustmentsThe following alterations are n't  always indicated by measurement differences , but your experience with other pants , or with a jeans muslin made at this point , may tip you off to their necessity . <p> Protruding or flat seat:Move the back inseam out or in <p> Very flat seat:Use a smaller back pattern <p> Full thighs : Move the front inseam out <p> For a protruding seat , slash the pattern and spread as much as 3/4 inch ; more will create a baggy seat . For additional room , lengthen the crotch as described above.For a flat seat , overlap the pattern in the same place instead . For either case , taper to nothing below the knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the back leg pattern a size smaller , adding to the waist and high hip if needed . You can also , or alternatively , horizontally slash and overlap the back by 1/2 inch below the crotch , tapering to nothing at the side seamline . In either case , stretch the back inseam between knee and crotch when sewing it to the pants front . <p> To see how much to add , compare your full thigh measurement plus 1 inch to the thigh measurement on the pattern . If your pants are always tight across the front of the leg , slash the pattern vertically through the crotch and spread , tapering to nothing by the bottom of the leg . To increase the leg circumference overall , add equally to the inseams and side seams on both front and back . <p> Knock knees:Straighten the inseam at the knee <p> Protruding back calves : Lengthen and widen the lower back leg <p> If your knees rub together , straighten out the curve on the inseam of both the front and back legs to get the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hung up on the back calf , slash the pattern as shown , leaving a paper hinge at the vertical seamlines , then spread to create a 1/2- to 3/4-inch space in the midcalf area . 4378 @qwx204378 4376 @qwx204376 <p> user-2683982 writes : how can I solve the pull at the knees of my pants I have tried everything without success lengthening front and back crotch did not help at all Posted : 10:05 pm on August 6th <p> Jifdif writes : To shorten the crotch length of your slacks , assuming no lining , turn the pants inside out , in-seams flat and together .

If you do buy regularly from the various McCall 's brands the app will automatically add patterns you buy direct to your pattern library as soon as you open the app after you 've made your purchase . <p> It is supposed to pull previous pattern purchases from your account when you set it up the first time . I say supposed to because the app is unstable as all get out . It just up and quits with an alarming frequency , typically during adds/edits . The first was on its initial setup/import of old purchases , so I got maybe 40% , weirdly the oldest ones , and there 's no way to tell it to re-try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't difficult , except for the constant crashes . If it crashes while it 's searching for the pattern in its database the screen loses the tab for yardage info and it never comes back , so even when it pulls the photos and the rest of the info , no yardage . Your only option at that point is to take a picture of the envelop back and add it to the photos section . So , sort of a pain , but pretty well worth it to have all that info at your fingertips wherever you are . <p> The fabric database is going to save me huge headaches in tracking care instructions , but is not going to replace the big safety pin with the swatches for current projects in the purse . Not the app 's fault , computer photo reproductions are just not that accurate , color-wise , but app and swatches together are unbeatable in the shops . <p> There 's a space to save how much you paid for fabric that has never worked for me--type it in , save , and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a working seamstress would surely find this useful info to track . Having the measurements for the people I sew for in one easily accessible place is also huge .

I 've worked in high tech my entire career , and I 've never continued to use a piece of software this crash-prone and unstable . It can be fantastically frustrating to get your data in there ( crashes mainly on add/edit , not subsequent reads ) , BUT it is just so gosh darn fabulous to have all the info about every pattern you own and the fabric in your stash in your pocket all the time that I decided it was worth it .

Make sure that the swab is not soaking wet either and rub very gently , from the wrong side of the garment , then dab with a clean paper towel . Sometimes dry cleaning fluid will work as well . Many inks are alcohol based and can be removed this way . It also might work better if you try dabbing through the garment into a paper towel .

I bought some new attachments a few years ago to update it somewhat but it does n't compare with the new machine . <p> One of the best features for me on the Janome is the on/off button and automatic speed setting ( cruise control ) . I can sew without having to push on a foot pedal so it 's much easier on my back . I thought I 'd have trouble with a computerized machine but I followed the directions in the instruction booklet one step at a time page by page ( I 'm only half way through , having just bought the machine last week ) and so far so good . <p> My technically advanced 14 yr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and jump right into the embroidery and memory programs . LOL . So we monogrammed his name and now he wants to embroidery it all over everything he owns ! <p> I 'm grateful for the warning on this thread not to oil the machine . The care and maintenance section of my instruction booklet just says to clean various parts with a lint brush and soft dry cloth so I guess that 's all I have to do . <p> Do some homework before you buy a new machine . Figure out what your sewing interests are ( home dec , garment , quilting ) and what types of fabrics you like to work with or what you would like to be able to do with a new machine . Go to different dealers and check out what they have . Read reviews of machines you 're interested in . Take your time . Go with a sewing buddy if you can . It 's nice to be able to discuss things with someone other than the dealer/salesperson. <h> ( post #22501 , reply #19 of 40 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only need oil on the bobbin mechanism , where the bobbin case rests . I 've had no problems with either of them . I love Pfaff machines and I had worked briefly for a Pfaff dealer . The books that come with the Pfaff machines is thorough , but not well written . You have to flip from section to section or even from book to book to find what you need . Also , the photos in the instruction book show only German on the screen of the machine , so using the photos as a gude is difficult . I realize the company wants to save costs in printing , but why ca n't they have several language versions available and you can choose when you purchase or register the machine ? <p> The old Singer machines are a good example of a product that was made well . The machines are workhorses and much simpler to use than the ones made now . The feet for an early 1900 's model would still work for a late 1960 's model . Although they would only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric to achieve zig-zag stitching to produce buttonholes and embroidery stitches . Even now , if I have to make ruffles or do something that I do n't have the right foot for one of the Pfaffs , I will get out my Singer machine and attachments . And the books were very clearly written and have good illustrations . I collect and read a lot of the Singer books on dress-making and have learned so much from them . I 'm so glad that sewing is making a real comeback , because we are getting more and more quality books and products than has been available for the past two decades . <h> ( post #22501 , reply #20 of 40 ) <p> I suppose since the Pfaff machines are made in German , they do n't know how to express the directions clearly in English . There is a website that we use when we get orders from foreign countries .

While I was there , one of the employees had purchased a Pfaff because this store owner was also an authorized Pfaff dealer . The employee told me that she thought it was one of the finest machines made , capable of making the person using it able to do their own designing ( more so than other machines ) She said that it was a real quality machine and that the Germans are famous for making things very well . She said however , that the instructions were not " user friendly " at all and it made it so difficult for her to learn how to use the machine . I noticed that this particular sewing store is no longer an authorized Pfaff dealer , but I do n't know why . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I had an attitude that people wanted " far out , different , unusual , never-seen-before , wildly-colorful designs " ( maybe that 's because I liked hard-edge double-image , colorful designs myself ) and instead the customers constantly choose old fashioned favorites .... typical country-type designs ... many in subdued colors . Around Christmas time , it was snowmen that were just the same style of snowmen that had been out for years .... and so on . <p> Well , since I want to design patterns that people like , I changed my designing to pure simplicity with minimal sewing required , and that certainly caused my sales to increase . I know Picasso may have been brave enough to stick to what he wanted to do , but I want to earn some money so I want to design what the folks like , and guess what .... I 'm starting to like those types of designs myself .

I cut a rectangle and ran a row of Dental floss down the center so it would ruffle . It wears like iron , but I 've noticed that a lot of the veggie bags are now flimsy and weak and would not do well at all . <p> I 'm very new at being in a Gatherings Discussions so I hesitate to put in the above link , but hope it 's OK . <p> Here 's one more question . If I am in the middle of writing a thread and get interrupted , is there a way to temporarily save it and come back later and finish it or must I copy it and paste it somewhere else and repaste it into the thread area ? <h> ( post #22501 , reply #22 of 40 ) <p> I have a Janome Memory Craft 7500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new machine , but it has never given me any trouble and I have never oiled it .

I hand-sew these delightful details permanently to a garment , but I can think of few reasons why detachable embellishments are an excellent option : <p> If the embellishment is large and three-dimensional , it could be stored separately and avoid being crushed in a closet or garment bag . <p> You can clean the garment without fear of harming the embellishment . <p> Instantly change the mood of your garment by adding or taking off the adornment . <p> Making a detachable flower embellishment , a sort of fabric flower corsage as shown , is very simple .

I hope it inspires you to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fold a ribbon flower <p> The sheer ribbon rose is based on the freeform folded rose technique described by Helen Gibb in " The Secrets of Fashioning Ribbon Flowers . " With a little practice , this flower is very easy to make . I made mine with wired-edge ribbon . <p> Start with a length of ribbon at least 12 inches long . You may wish to leave the ribbon long and just cut it when the rose reaches the size you wish . A folded ribbon flower can be made with wired or unwired ribbon . For the example , I used 1+-inch ribbon . For that width of ribbon , I usually use a ribbon piece 15 inches long . <p> Fold the ribbon at a right angle about 4 inches from an end . <p> Roll the vertical ribbon to form the flower center and stem . This is the tightest part of the flower . As you fold and form the petals , remember that a natural rose has larger and larger petals as you move out from the center . <p> Stitch through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon away from the flower at a 45 degree angle . Keep the angled fold soft and roll it loosely around the center with the fold perpendicular to the stem . The diagonal fold forms the edge of the petal . Stitch through the base to secure the pedal . Repeat folding , wrapping , and stitching until your rose reaches the size you want . <h> Craft a " modified " Dior rose <p> I call this " modified " because I use two short petal sections to form the flower center . I like the fullness they add to the center . A tutorial on a single-piece Dior rose can be found on the Sewing Divas blog . <p> I made this flower from soft , silk charmeuse . Cut three 3-inch wide bias fabric strips . One strip is about 12 inches long , the others are about 4 inches long each .

Then wrap the long bias strip around the bud , stitching as before to make the flower ready for its backing . <p> Keep the base of the flower flat as you wrap and stitch it . <p> Do n't pinch or press the petal edge fold , but keep it soft and full for an attractive rose . <h> Back and attach <p> You may decide to keep the backing inconspicuous , but I chose to use layers of sheer wired ribbon , making the backing part of the embellishment itself . <p> I tacked the bases of the blossoms through the ribbon layers . <p> After checking the placement of the embellishment on the garment , I added two snap closures to attach it .

Some of them plan to attend a school for post-high school training . Others have obtained training through the school of hard knocks . They either want to start a business and become their own boss or land a job with a prestigious company . The field is extremely broad with innumerable possibilities , and it 's difficult for us to provide advice to cover every option . Perhaps you can help . <p> Advice from our Contributing Editors:I recently intereviewed each of our contributing editors , and among other questions , I asked them what advice they would give to those aspiring to a career in a sewing or design related area . Here 's what they said : <p> Louise Cutting : Learn how to sew . If you 're going into design , you need to know how to sew first . Young people today think they will become the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face it , that 's highly unlikely . Many well-known " designers " today ( like Jacqueline Smith for K-Mart ) are n't really designers . They 're just a figurehead . You have to know the business to be really successful .

The reality is that the big department stores already had a great fashion illustrator , and they were n't going to get rid of that person every June to hire the new kid on the block . You have to make yourself exceptional . My advice is to know ALL of the rudiments of the business . No matter what school you go to , learn beyond the teacher . You 're only as good as the teacher . If she 's adequate at best , then you 're going to be less than that unless you put in extra effort . Learn everything you can not only what they 're teaching you , but more .

Its the dues you pay for becoming proficient . <p> However , if you are willing to charge forward , cut into that fabric , try something different , and risk making a mistake , there will come one day when you realize that you 're sewing without that knot of worry in the pit of your stomach , and the process effortlessly glides along . <p> Mary Ray : Immerse yourself in it .

The waxed q-tip , will pick up the stone and gently deposit it on the place you have applied the glue .

I 'm very new at this and do n't see my previous post . <p> I 'm moving from the US to France for 2-3 years . Of course , I want to bring my sewing machine . US has 110V 60hz power and France has 220V 50Hz power . Does anybody have experience running a sewing machine that was designed for US power by connecting through a step-down transformer connected to 220V ? Have you had any problems ? Should I get a transformer with a voltage regulator ? I 'm worried about frying my beloved Bernina. <h> ( post #26602 , reply #2 of 13 ) <p> Hi Sewing Engineer ! You may want to contact Bernina to ask them this question . I will have the opposite problem when I take my Bernina purchased in Europe home to the US later this year . I 'm hoping I can purchase a different electrical plug for it and be fine but I wo n't know until I ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13 ) <p> I do n't think a plug adapter will not be sufficient to use your European machine in the US . I know that if I do that going from US to Europe , I will risk damaging my sewing machine . <p> The plug adapter does n't change the voltage of the electricity coming from your wall . Your motor needs 220/240 VAC and US electricity is 110/120 VAC . V stands for Volts and AC stands for Alternating Current . Plug adapters can be used for items that accept both 110 and 220 VAC . Many AC to DC converters used for charging phones , mp3 players , and computer batteries work with a simple plug adapter . Lamps also work with a plug adapter if you put the correct light bulbs in the lamp . Check the information on your converter or electrical appliance . It should list whether it accepts 110V or 220V electricity . When in doubt , use caution . I know many people who have ruined their TVs , DVD players etc by plugging into the wrong power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use my machine with a step-up transformer . I was concerned that there might be a problem with the different frequency because transformers do not convert the frequency of the electricity . US electricity is 60Hz and France 's electricity is 50Hz . I was also concerned that the initial power surge required when you first start sewing an item might be a problem for the transformer . This is great news . <p> For people looking for transformers and adapters , there are quite a few businesses on the web that sell these . Their prices can be better than what you might find locally . <h> ( post #26602 , reply #6 of 13 ) <p> Yes , you are right ! I 'm just hoping that the machines ( since they are made and sold all over the world ) are dual voltage . If they are , the change in the electric plug will do it . If not , then I 'll have to get a step down transformer in order to use it at home . <p> A word of caution for you - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown fuses on several occasions and one ended up being unusable . We bought them before leaving the US because they cost less and so that we could have them shipped with all of our stuff but we obviously could n't really try them until we got here . If we had it to do over again , we 'd bite the bullet and buy them here ( and not via a website ) . They are extremely heavy and it 's not something you want to have to return in the mail ! <h> ( post #26602 , reply #7 of 13 ) <p> The hertz thing , with the US being 60 and here ( and France ) being 50Hz .... the only thing that I was told was that I have to be sure that the machine does n't overheat , as it will run hotter and that might shorten the lifespan of my serger ( which is the machine I use the most ) . <p> Sorry about not remembering the name of the thing " step up transformer " . Doh . When you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need .... cos of spikes and surges . <h> Hi Mary - how did you ( post #26602 , reply #11 of 13 ) <p> We have the same issue - US bought Bernina now arrived to Netherlands . I am concerned about simply hooking up a stepdown transformer because I am afraid the mismatch in frequencies 50/60 Hz may overheat the motor . So I am considering to pay a Bernina sewing machine center to replace the necessaries and effectively convert the machine . <p> I wonder if the motor overheating is an issue with US machines in EU and not 240 volt machines in US . I ran our Australian Amana fridge in the US in the garage on a step up transformer without problem .... except it needed a much heavier fuse to cater for current surge on startup , and even then the fuse would blow once or twice a year . <p> And my brother-in-law bought a bunch of US power tools and used them in Europe - they burnt out within about a year . <h> ( post #26602 , reply #3 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have my US machines hooked up to a transformer as the system is completely different here . The transformer was $100.00NZ but its the best way to use anything expensive that 's electronic on another system . Those converters that you can buy that merely change the plugs and have a small converter on them , are fine only for hair dryers , curling irons , shavers , but not much beyond that . <p> Good luck <p> Nancy <p> p.s . Go to best buy or circuit city or someplace where they have GOOD heavy duty transformers , and get at least two to bring with . They will cost more outside the US . <p> Here is the answer for all who are in this dilemma . I did so much research on this , including purchasing a very expensive transformer , but there were definitely still issues , and after reading about those who had burnt out their motors etc . I finally found an incredibly inexpensive and perfect travel transformer which has never let me down . Even though there is a slight hum as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine and it operates perfectly . This company ships overseas from the U.S. also . So here is the link : <h> European versus North American Electrical Service ( post #26602 , reply #10 of 13 ) <p> I lived in Europe twice and here 's how you ' convert ' your machine to work on another continent ( in priority order ) : <p> 1 . Check with the manufacturer to see if the machine is dual voltage . If yes , it us ususally as simple as flipping a little switch located somewhere fairly hidden , sometimes beneath a sticker that reads 110/60 or 220/50 . This prevents you , or your child , from accidentially changing the voltage of the machine . Once you flip this switch , put a converter plug over the prongs . These cost maybe a US $1 . <p> 2 . Buy a step up or step down transformer that will accomodate the number of watts the machine draws . Look at the label on the back or bottom to find out what the wattage is for each of your appliances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have to buy a 750 watt transformer that will ' step down ' from US to EU . To go from EU to US , you 'll have to buy a ' step up ' transformer , again with at least the same number of watts as the machine . Do n't try and cheat on the watts or you will burn out your machine . <p> This works for all your electrical items ( except lamps where you simply switch bulbs and plugs ) , including irons , microwaves , coffee pots , etc . I bought a set of used 300 , 750 , and 1200 for each floor of my German house . That way I did n't have to hoick these heavy puppies up and down stairs . However , the second time I moved to Germany , I just put most of my small applicances in storage or gave them away and bought new ( toaster , coffee pot , iron , micowave , vacuum , etc ) instead . The transformers are pretty expensive when new and can cost you more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicances were pretty ancient . <h> The cycles are the issue 50/60Hz ( post #26602 , reply #12 of 13 ) <p> I know this is an old post but it is important . I stumbled across this thread searching for a motor for a sewing machine that runs on 50 or 60 cycles for my Daughter-in law who lives overseas in Europe . Seems she bowered a sewing machine from another American couple living nearby them . I get a call from my son wanting me to explain why the motor burn up on the sewing machine they had borrowed after working for over an hour . A 60hz motor will try an work on 50 hz power but will over heat shortly . Even if you use it only for very short times you are doing damage to the motor . <p> This is quoted from wiki . And the information is correct . <p> " Frequency is most likely to affect clocks and devices with motors ( Like sewing Machines ) . They may run faster or slower than they should and may be damaged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some motorized devices may function correctly on either 50 or 60 Hz-- especially if they also operate on batteries . Just look on the label or plug . <p> However , you still may need to be careful if you have a sensitive or expensive device that converts AC ( power from the wall ) into DC ( battery-like current ) --especially if you also need to convert the voltage . A device will convert AC to DC either to save battery power by allowing you to plug into the mains or charge a battery in the device . The design of power supplies where AC is converted into DC does take frequency into account . <p> Even though 60 Hz converts a little more easily to DC than 50 Hz does , there 's enough tolerance in most small appliances and electronic gadgets that you can ignore frequency . However , if you also need to change the voltage ( because the voltage of your device is different from the mains power voltage ) , you can not use a switching-type converter . You must use the heavier iron-core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods dealer . <p> If your device wo n't operate with a different frequency ( powerful motors and non-quartz clocks ) , there is really nothing you can do to change it . Unlike voltage , frequency can not easily be converted . Foreign embassies may have to use huge generators to provide current compatible with equipment from home . <p> If you desperately need to have power at your home country 's frequency , you might try using a 12V DC to AC converter intended for vehicle use . However , most of these ( especially those commonly found in stores ) output a " sawtooth " wave instead of a sine wave . ( Check the manufacturer 's website if you need a sine wave output . It may be special order . ) Make sure the wattage of the converter is sufficient for whatever device you need to operate , and the 12V battery has enough amps for the job . For example , 12V times 15 amps gives 180 watts ( or less after losses are included ) . " <p> Hope this saves someone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nameplate on the motor will tell the frequency ( Hz ) the motor requires to correctly . <p> I am planning to send my Brother sewing machine and has been searching what is the best wattage for this model(80W) .

These are both necessary , regardless of the style of your garment , to ensure a comfortable neckline , a smooth-fitting collar , and a hem that does n't ride up at the center back . <p> Begin by determining your back-waist length . We 'll assume that your pattern has already been adjusted , if necessary , to accommodate any variation in your height or waist position from the original pattern . Measure from the base of your neck , where a necklace would naturally fall , to your waist , and compare this measurement to your pattern . If you do n't know where the normal neckline is on the pattern , or if the back waist is n't marked , you can find the standard measurement for your size in the back of the catalog for your brand of pattern . The difference between your measurement and the pattern is the amount you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrange pattern back against guideline on large sheet of paper after drawing slash lines 1 , 2 , and 3 . <p> Draw a slash line on the pattern , perpendicular to the grainline , from the center back to the mid-armhole . Draw a second slash line from the midneck at a slight angle to the first line , and a third line from midshoulder to where lines 1 and 2 meet . The exact position of this point is n't all that critical ; simply refer to the drawing just mentioned and draw something similar . On a large piece of paper , which you 'll place under your pattern as a guide while making the following alterations , draw a long vertical guideline . If your pattern 's center back is straight and parallel to the grainline , place it directly over the guideline . If your pattern back is shaped , arrange the guideline so that it 's parallel to the grainline and centered over the pattern 's center back . <p> Cut on the first slash line to , but not through , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slash on the second line to , but not through , the first line , again leaving a hinge of paper , this time between sections A and B thus created . If your back-waist-length difference is 1 in. or less , anchor the lower section ( below line 1 ) and slide section A up along the guideline the amount needed . <p> For upper-back adjustments under 1 in. , slide section A along guideline to add needed length . Allow hinge to break if necessary to keep section A aligned with guideline . <p> As you slide up section A , you 'll see that the higher you go , the harder it is to keep the section touching the guideline without breaking the paper hinge at section B. If you need the extra length , pop the hinge and let section A move as necessary . The hinge is useful as a way of keeping everything aligned as far as it goes , but it is n't required . After positioning and securing section A at the proper height , pivot and anchor the armhole/section B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners are level , as in the drawing just mentioned . <p> As you can see , a dart will have opened up along the second slash line , but it will need to be trued . Lightly pencil in new dart legs about 3-1/2 in. long , then fold the dart as it will be sewn and pressed ; with the dart underlay toward center back , trace over the neckline to get the correct seam-allowance shape . <p> If you need to add more than 1-1/4 in. , the process is the same as just described , but the dart that will open between sections A and B will be too severe , and you 'll want to distribute some of the excess fullness elsewhere . You can do this by any or all of the following means : adding a center-back dart to be absorbed into a center-back seam , adding a shoulder dart and/or ease , or adding length to the back armscye . This last approach is a good idea if you 're adjusting by more than 2 in . <p> For 1- to 2-in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll probably want to distribute some dart shaping to center back by allowing section A to pivot away from guideline . This will reduce dart between sections A and B. True all darts to 3-1/2 in. long and fold in place to shape seam allowance at neckline . <p> To add a shoulder dart , slash on line 3 and pivot section B to open dart space in shoulder , then true . You can combine this with center-back dart , and/or convert shoulder dart to ease . <p> To add a center-back dart , pivot the raised section A in toward the neck dart from its lowest point on the guideline , opening up a small amount of center-back dart space ( typically smaller than half the neckline dart width ) . Redraw the neckline dart legs as described above , and redraw the center-back seam so that it blends into the guideline about 3-1/2 in. below the neckline .

Draw in and true the dart legs as before . <p> If you need to add more than 2 in. , slash completely across on line 1 , and slide up the entire upper back , moving it up to 1 in. above the slash line .

Contour the darts slightly and reposition them as needed ; they should release over your fullest area . If you need more width , let out the center-back seam . <p> Next , look at the fit in front . It 's not unusual for rounded backs to be combined with shortened fronts , particularly above the bustline . If you have horizontal wrinkles across your upper chest , pin out an even tuck from midarmhole to midarmhole . Once you settle on the needed amount , correct your pattern . If the neckline feels a little high in front , lower it by clipping until it 's comfortable . <p> To adjust sleeves , draw a horizontal line from underarm to underarm , and a vertical line from front and/or back notches ( depending on whether your previous alterations changed front and/or back armscye ) to horizontal line .

But if you 've added the same amount in back that you removed in front , note that all you need to do is shift the shoulder dot on the sleeve pattern toward the front by the amount of change , since the armscye has n't changed in size , just in distribution . To accommodate armscye-size changes , follow the directions in the drawing . <p> It 's important with each of these changes that you do n't overfit ; just keep the fabric smooth and unstrained across your back .

It works somewhat similarly to the seam roll , but I like the more stable base of a sleeve board .

How many times someone has lamented that his/her garment was rendered unusable because of shrinkage ? Wool crepe is the worst . Take it to the cleaners for the whole works . It is worth the extra effort and cost . Remind the cleaners to not hang fabric , but fold it carefully . Also remind the counter person that this is wool yardage - not a tablecloth ! Actually happened to me - the order was listed as a tablecloth . One cleaner asked me what the order was and what would I do with it ? ? ? This was ten yards of wool crepe .

He also offered to send me a NEW PATTERN with a diffent style of thumb , since I am making my gloves with the seams INSIDE . <p> I asked him if I could post his fitting advice here and he said sure ! As it turned out , the problem was only with the FINGERS . Once I made them LONGER , the fitting problem went away ! Also , one must note and allow for the proportions of one 's own fingers relative to the pattern ; f'r instance my forefinger and ring finger are only marginally SHORTER than my middle finger , but in the pattern , you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The glove will not " seat ' properly on your hand if the fingers are too SHORT , or if ANY of them are too short ! <p> Anyway , here is what he gave me : <p> " Thank you for your kind words . I will do what I can to help you with your dilemma . Often the problem with fit is either the fingers are too short , the thumb is too short or the gouch is improperly located . In adjusting a glove pattern it 's the same as making a muslin before constructing a dress . It allows you to correct the fit first . To lengthen a finger or thumb I first draw the entire pattern on a piece of paper . <p> I then determine which finger(s) need to lengthened/shortened . Generally , I increase in 1/4 " increments . Make a mark 1/4 " above the finger(s) to be adjusted , slide the pattern up to meet the mark and re-draw the tip of the finger(s) . Remove the pattern and blend the lines into the side of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid confusion and do n't forget to adjust the opposing finger on the other side of this trank . To shorten , I try on the sample glove and pinch the tip to see how much to shorten . Do n't forget to leave the seam allowance . <p> Say for example , you can pinch 5/16 " excess . You would not shorten it 5/16 " but rather 5/16 " less 1/16 " ( or so ) seam allowance or 4/16 " . Does this make any sense ? It sounds as though you have already determined that the fingers are too short but in addition to that your thumb is located farther down on your hand . I would retrace the gouch approx. 3/8 " lower to start , make a sample glove basting it together and try it on . From this adjustment you will see if any more corrections need be made . Often it 's a trial and error effort . <p> Remember that in glovemaking you are dealing with minutiae . The smallest adjustment can bring about big changes . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematically , but I was self-taught and just learned the hard way . You learn a lot more . It may take you a few times but in the end you will have a great pattern .

It 's difficult to transmit something so technical and expect it to come out correctly , however , I printed out all three patterns and think I have the solution . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as close to the original as one could hope . I am certain that not every one that tries this will get the same results . In that case they may have to experiment to find the exact percentage to use . In order to do this the correct final small pattern should measure 9 7/8 inches from the tip of one of the double finger tips to the cuff , the medium 10 1/2 inches and the large 10 11/16 inches . To get a full pattern one must print on 11 x 18 paper . Since most people do n't have this ability I found by printing the downloaded pattern in quadrants and taping them together I was able to create a full pattern . Some people may find it just easier to go to a photocopy store and do it on a copier with this capability . <p> I hope this makes sense and is of some benefit . Best wishes , <p> John <p> Most people are not having a problem printing the pattern and enlarging it to the correct proportion . We know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you ca n't print it at all , try going to a public library to print the pattern . Then take it to a photocopy machine to enlarge it appropriately . They have proportional scales and can help you . Each of the four squares in the lower right corner are 1 inch square . Measure the square on your printed version and determine how much you need to enlarge the pattern to make the squares the correct 1-inch size . Check the size after you 've enlarged it . Remember , these are standard sizes , expect to alter the glove , that 's one of the benefits of making your own .

Making a muslin requires marking and pinning - not easy when you are the one wearing the muslin . How can I fit successfully on my own ? -Nancy Gruber , via email <p> This is a common question . Ideally , each of us would have a fitting helper , but that is not always possible . Here are some practical solutions and tips that I share with my students . <p> First , purchase some adhesive dots from an office supply store , and use them to mark reference points - distinct start and stop locations - on the body ( bust apex , shoulder point , side seams ) for measuring . Stand in front of a mirror while measuring so you can check the measuring tape 's alignment with the dots . <p> The fitting method I teach divides the body into smaller areas for measuring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps you more precisely compare your body 's lengths and widths to a pattern 's lengths and widths . For example , mark your body 's side seam locations . Then , measure your front-waist width and your back-waist width . Add them together for your full waist circumference . You can break this down further into smaller areas of measure if you wish . Compare those measurements to the same areas on a pattern . If you do this before sewing a muslin , you 'll eliminate most fitting issues , and it does n't require assistance . <p> I also teach that sleeves should not be attached to a muslin until the rest of the body fits correctly . Sleeve fitting issues affect the rest of the garment and vice versa , and it can be difficult to distinguish whether it 's the sleeve 's fit or the body 's fit causing a particular issue - especially when you 're fitting yourself . So save sleeves for last . <p> Fine-tuning and polishing a muslin 's fit by yourself works the same as if you had a fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off the muslin a few additional times . Simply mark the change on the muslin while it 's on your body with tailor 's chalk or a marker , take the muslin off , pin the area that needs adjusting , and put the muslin back on to check . Use a seam gauge when marking fit adjustments on the back . Write the changes on paper , take off the muslin , pin the changes , then put the muslin back on to double-check the fit . <p> Do n't feel limited if you face the challenge of fitting yourself . With a few work-arounds , you can do it successfully . <p> This post was originally featured in the Q&amp;A department of Threads #177 ( February/March 2015 ) .

When i bought a new one I made sure it was ajustable . There should be a lever on top of the machine or on the side that says needle position .

Could your machine have a similar button ? If you ca n't find a way to set the needle position , is it possible you have a used machine with feet and other attachments that actually belong to another model ?

This was done so that the machine could create a buttonhole with a cutting space , and/or sew on a button .

@@22148776 @2148776/ <h> Beginner Help Shortening Flared Skirts Dresses <p> I 'm new to sewing . Brand New ! I just bought my 1st sewing machine a vintage Kenmore in a cabinet . My projects mostly consist of reconstructing vintage clothing to sell online and I 'm currently working on shortening vtg skirts &amp; dresses to mini 's ( very popular right now ) . I always have lots &amp; lots of trouble shortening skirts or dresses with a flare to them ( i.e. a-line styles , styles with gathered waists , styles w/ pleats at the waist , empire waists etc ) . It takes me forever to get it pinned and ironed straight and even when I think I have it I 'm usually a little off in some spots . I normally try the dress/skirt on to decide how short I want it then I 've tried hanging them on my dress form to pin it straight but ca n't get it right , I normally end up just laying them flat on my table and measuring , pinning , ironing which takes a lot of trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally takes me try after try after try to get the hem straight whenever the dress has a flare . Is there a secret ? Does anyone have any tips or tricks ? Maybe if I I knew how to construct flared skirts &amp; dresses I would understand how to shorten them better ! <h> shortening flared skirts ( post #33006 , reply #1 of 6 ) <p> Most flared skirts are not cut on the straight of the grain . A circular skirt , for example , might be perfect while laying flat on a table , but after hanging on a hanger over night it will probably " grow " in length on 2 sides . <h> Hi Angie : Is the problem ( post #33006 , reply #2 of 6 ) <p> Is the problem you 're having that there seems to be more fabric in the ' hem ' part than the part it 's being stitched to ? If you think about the shape of an A-line skirt , if you measure the circumference at your desired length , then measure -say 1.5 inches lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't too wide , you can sometimes ease in this difference with a serger that has differential feed ( it will ' tighten ' the bottom of the hem somewhat ) . You can also take in the side seams right at the hem line to remove the extra flare . You do n't have to take in too much - especially if there are several gores ( or panels ) to the skirt - but it 's important to reduce all of them . Hand sewing the hem may also help as it 's easier to ease a softer fabric in small increments while hand-stitching . <p> I used to work at a tailor shop and when shortening skirts , we worked under the assumption that the skirt hung straight on the client ) unless of course , the client identified a problem - such as a high hip or stretched-out side seams -- in which case we would pin-mark the garment while the client was wearing it ) . Anyway , operating under that assumption , if a skirt was to be shortened , say 6 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hem all the way around the skirt . ( measuring about every 4 - 6 inches depending on the skirt width , fabric , etc . AND then joining these marks up to make a complete ' circle ' around the garment . ) If any of the markings seemed ' off ' ( e.g. dipping below the other marks , say , at a seamline ) , we would ' eyeball ' the mark and the existing hem and figure out what the discrepancy was due to ( e.g. change in grainline , stretching at side seams , etc . ) . The new hem would be ideally as close as possible to replicating the orignal hem ( in depth and method ) . So from the ' circle ' marking , we would measure and mark beneath it by the depth of the new hem . If it was a foldover hem , we would mark again below the line for the depthof the foldover . So we 'd end up with a skirt with 2-3 lines drawn around it . <p> The lowest line was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of fabric at a time . The other line(s) was/were foldover lines . This sounds like a lot of work , but one could get pretty fast at it . Usually we 'd serge the raw edge ( if there was just one fold line ) and then blindstitch ( most contemporary suit skirts are hemmed this way originally ) . I 'm not sure what your choices/options are when working with vintage clothing as I 'm not completely familiar with those techniques . <p> We used tailor 's wax to mark ( tested on the fabric first ! ) and tape measures ( or rigid rulers ) and mark the OUTSIDE of the garment . We would rarely press a hem before stitching it . ( this would depend on the width of the garment and fabric type , of course ) ( Pressing can distort or stretch an unstitched hem ) . We would use few pins , if any , to hold up the hem . If we did , they were usually at the seams - kind of for a checkpoint while stitching . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working ' inside ' the circle ) as we usually used industrial machines and they have flatbeds rather than freearms . The blindstitch machine would require that the garment be turned inside out for hemming . After the hem was complete , THEN we would press - with lots of steam , very little ( if any ) pressure from the iron , and a heavy hardwood clapper to hold in the heat . A lot of fabrics will actually ' ease ' themselves in with the right application of steam , BUT always test the fabric 's heat-bearing tolerance first ! ! If you 're hemming anyway , there 's bits cut off that you can test with . Most hems look best if you do n't press the entire hem depth , just the fold . That way , you do n't leave the impression of the hem depth all the way around the garment . <p> If the garment was lined , we would n't have touched the lining until this point . We 'd lay the garment down and mark the lining at the point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way around . This was the cutting line for the lining . We did n't usually mark it anymore as most linings are just folded over twice and stitched ( lining hem facing garment hem ) , but you could mark up one inch from cutting line if you wished ( before cutting ) and that would be your hem depth ( do n't mark the first fold line for a lining - ever- too time consuming and unnecessary ) . The lining would end up 1 inch shorter that the garment hem . <p> Anyway , I 'm not sure if this helps at all . A lot of how you approach the hem depends on the garment cut , the fabric and your equipment options . I had access to professional , industrial equipment and tried-and-true techniques that were supposed to keep our work both fast and accurate . And I worked with people who had decades of experience in both custom and industrial garment construction . I do recommend trying ( depending on the fabric type and garment cut , of course ) to hem without pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it solves . If you have any more questions , please contact me . <h> You have been given good ( post #33006 , reply #4 of 6 ) <p> You have been given good information . It works best if you use a very narrow hem . If I was doing this I would go for a half inch hem , serge the edge and turn it under STITCHING WITH THE RIGHT SIDE ON TOP . The feed dogs will help to feed the little excess and make it lay flat . This can also be done with a rolled hem foot which you should be able to get for your machine . They come in different sizes . Take a look at other hems in ready to wear for some ideas . And keep sewing ! <h> Thank You Everyone ! ! ! ( post #33006 , reply #6 of 6 ) <p> Hello everyone !

I follow a tip I gleaned from a Sandra Betzina show years ago ........ I no longer overlap my elastic but rather use a piece of light fabric and butt the ends of the elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide zig-zag stitch . Then I either fold the fabric over the elastic and secure or trim the excess away ........ somewhat depending on the strenth of the fabric and the width of the elastic .

I do the sew-on method with my serger and then fold over and stitch my casing . Of course , I do mostly childrens ' clothing and pull-on pants for myself so this works !

Pants have to adjust to diagonal stresses that just are n't present in skirts . <h> ( post #29156 , reply #7 of 12 ) <p> In order to fit a pair of pants , you have to SEE what changes need to be made .

It was so frustrating I gave up sewing for years and wore only turtle necks or camis . <p> Last fall I came across Kathleen Fassinella 's book ( fashion-incubator.com ) where she has a short chapter on improving product fit . It changed my sewing life ! <p> The fix for the ' riding back ' issue is quite simple . Her book details it and I 'd recommend buying it or sending a little gift her way because I think it 's such a great tip . Basically all you need to do is raise the CB neck depth a LOT more than you might expect or may have done with the other adjustments you described ( dowagers hump adjustment for example ) . The end result is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half inch or less . So if you were to square a line from your neck shoulder point and square a line at CB neck , the difference in depth would be around 3/8 inch . The finer boned you are the shallower the CB neck depth needs to be . kathleen describes why this works by giving an example of a little kid wearing an adult tshirt . Ever notice the tshirt rides down the back of the kid 's neck ? Kids have no bust , typically they have n't decelpoed a forward shoulder , and do n't have prominent anything , like broad shoulders or other posture adjustments we decelpoed with age . Yet give a 5 year old dad 's old softball league Tshirt and the neck will ride down the back . Now take the same tshirt and put a big clip along the cb neck , effectively raising the neckline and making the neck circumference smaller in the back , and voila , the tshirt stops riding back . <p> I make this adjustment with all of my patterns , and have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CB , like a wide cowl neck on a raglan sleeve , for example I 'm still experimenting with how best to adjust this type of pattern , and was doing some research on how to fix this when I csme across your post .

Or does it mean that I cut out my size and then measure in 5/8 " and that 's where the seam allowance is ? <p> I 'd appreciate any help in regards to this - I 've used the search feature , but apparently this is common knowledge to all but me. <h> ( post #25078 , reply #1 of 11 ) <p> Welcome to the world of sewing ! No question is ever stupid .... ask away ... there is a wealth of knowledge from years of experience to be had in these forums . <p> Regarding your seam allowance-in McCall 's patterns , your 5/8 " seam allowance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and the seam line will be 5/8 " inside the cut edge . Since you are new to sewing , please make sure you check your measurements against the pattern and fit the tissue before cutting your fashion fabric . Make sure the yoke area on the pattern ( M5110 ) will fit in the hip area . New sewers can become quickly discouraged if by cutting and sewing too quickly , only to find that the garment is not large enough . This is a very cute pattern and should make a beautiful soft summery skirt . <h> ( post #25078 , reply #2 of 11 ) <p> That 's a good question to ask . Most American patterns include the seam allowance . If you look at your pattern pieces you will see a broken line to represent where you stitch , usually 5/8 inside the edge of the pattern pieces . ( Every once in a while it will be different than 5/8 . ) <p> It seems to me that when I do n't know much about a subject it can be really hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people on this site are , ( like the previous writer , ) good about giving you additional info they think might help you . <h> McCall patterns broken lines ( post #25078 , reply #11 of 11 ) <p> I think you meant to saye. that the various broken lines represent the sizes , and you cut along the line that corresponds to you size . the pattern for McCalls do include the sewing allowing of 5/8 inches which means you sew in from that cut edge 5/8 away from the cut edge . Sorry for interrupting , but I read your instructions with a double meaning . <h> ( post #25078 , reply #3 of 11 ) <p> Welcome Jaderaven . May I add that not all patterns are this way , but the big four , McCalls , Vogue , Simplicity and Butterick do have 5/8 " seam allowances already included . Some other pattern companies do not and you have to add this before you cut . Have fun sewing . <h> ( post #25078 , reply #4 of 11 ) <p> Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll assume it is a multi-sized pattern , it has several cutting lines and NO printed seam lines . I sew for 3 very different sized daughters and self and grandkids ( who grow ) so I NEVER cut the original pattern ( white tissue paper is cheap ) . I make a copy and label which size I used , then if I goofed , or someone else wants one too , I still have the pattern ! <h> ( post #25078 , reply #7 of 11 ) <p> Jaderaven , welcome to the sewing world ! You are among good friends here so ask away ! <p> Before you start take a tape measure or ruler and line up the starting line with your needle . Look over to your right and see where 5/8 is on the ruler . It is usually the mark after the half inch mark . Once you find the 5/8 mark , look at the machine to right of the needle . There is probably a mark on your machine that lines right up with this to indicate the 5/8 measurement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , line up the cut edges of your fabric pieces with this 5/8 mark as you sew . This will give you the accurate seamline . You want to keep your eye on that edge , not on where the needle is going . You will be more accurate that way . Do some practice pieces before you actually start sewing on your garment . Read your pattern directions carefully . Its rare , but every once in a blue moon , the pattern will have you use a different measurement for a seam or two , usually the neckline or collar . <p> You have gotten some good advice in regards to measuring . Good luck and let us know if we can help some more . <h> ( post #25078 , reply #8 of 11 ) <p> Re : Simplicity , McCalls , Vogue and Butterick ...... Inside your pattern envelope are the instruction pages . Page one will have the layouts and General Directions . This is where it reads ... Seam allowance : 5/8 " ( 1.5 cm ) unless otherwise stated is included but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a solid line for cutting and a broken line representing the seam line . <p> Read over the instructions and note anywhere the seam allowance is not 5/8 " . <p> It 's been awhile since I used Burda , but I do remember having to add the seam allowances to the pattern before I cut it out . It was a great pattern , but not because I had to add the seam allowances .... did n't care for that added chore. <h> ( post #25078 , reply #9 of 11 ) <p> Lots of good advice so far ... here 's another tip : After you cut out your fabric , mark the seam lines with chalk ( either tailor 's chalk or regular chalkboard chalk will work ) on the wrong side of each piece before you start stitching it . <p> While you can use the 5/8 " mark on the sewing machine plate as a guide , it 's easier for beginners to stitch along a chalked line at first . Plus , by marking the wrong sides with chalk , you 'll always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important challenge for learners . <h> seam allowances ( post #25078 , reply #10 of 11 ) <p> I have sewn for many years and the patterns in the past , in my opinion , were so much easier to read and the directions were very detailed . Not so much any more . <p> I recently picked up a McCalls pattern for a dress for my granddaughter . There was so seam allowances printed on the tissue pattern pieces . So I wondered the same question you had , do I add 5/8 inch to the fabric or was it included .

@@22148813 @2148813/ <h> Lapped Zippers Rule ! <p> Lapped zippers are easier to insert than centered zippers . Lapped zippers ensure that the zipper teeth and pull are completely hidden <p> by Shirley Smithfrom Threads #79 , pp. 60-64 <p> I 've never understood why most commercial patterns provide for a centered zipper when installing one attractively is so challenging . And no matter how well installed it is , that centered opening will always expose the zipper teeth to some extent . I much prefer the easier-to-insert lapped zipper , which ensures that the zipper teeth and pull are completely hidden . Here are a few variations on the lapped zipper , along with a neat trick that fixes zippers buckling at the bottom of your waistbands , and a few tips for adding hooks , snaps , and eyes . <p> Facings , flies , waistbands ? No problem ! <p> With a lapped zipper , the zipper teeth and pull always stay hidden from view when the garment is worn . <p> Unless your design has centered topstitching on both sides of the seam in the zipper area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an invisible zipper seems more appropriate than overlapping layers , there 's no reason to center the zipper , whether it 's at the waist or the neckline . One of my favorite tricks for inserting a fly zipper can be used on the plain zipper too : extending the zipper to the top of the waistband to eliminate the awful buckling that 's so common at the base of most waistbands , right where the zipper pull usually sits . Tuck the top of the zipper beneath the overlap of the waistband , and your zipper will lie as flat at the band as it does below , whether you use a fly or a simple closure . <p> Zipper and interfacing basicsKey to all the zipper techniques I use is marking the exact seamlines on both sides of the zipper area with a line of thread tracing . It does n't take much time to chalk the lines , then put in a quick running-stitch marker that 's easy to see from both sides and wo n't rub off . I also cut the seam allowances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are cut as directed on the pattern ) to make sure there 's plenty of width to create an underlap . In either case , interface the seam allowances with a soft fusible if the fabric has any give . <p> Always use the actual zipper to measure the length of the opening you need , since not all zippers are exactly the length the package promises . The bottom of the opening should be just above the metal stop , and the top of the zipper in garments with a facing should be about 1/2 in. from the top seamline , leaving room for a hook or snap , as described below . In garments with a waistband , the zipper top should be just under the band seamline , unless you 're extending it as I suggest , in which case the zipper should stop 1/4 in. below the top edge of the waistband . My zipper of choice is a nylon coil zipper . <p> To interface waistbands , I use Armoflexxx or Ban-Rol cut to extend to the cut ends of the band . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to completely wrap the cut band with fusible knit interfacing cut to just fit around the interfacing with no overlaps . <p> A how-to look at snaps , hooks , and eyesHooks and their associated eyes are required whenever you need the closure to take some strain , as you would at the waistband or faced waistline of a skirt or pants , or at the ends of a waistline stay in a fitted bodice . Typically , you 'll need a hook strong enough to hold the garment in place while you close the zipper or buttons that form the main closure , and you 'll want to position the hook at the waist level or wherever the tension is greatest . Snaps are n't usually strong enough , so they 're confined to keeping tabs , belt ends , flaps , and underlaps or overlaps from flopping about after the closure is closed . You can put them wherever they 'll do the most good , and occasionally substitute small wire hooks for them . For most higher-tension waistline closures , I use a heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I use a waxed , doubled , cotton or polyester thread for strength and to avoid snags and knots . To wax the thread , simply drag it doubled across a lump of beeswax ( available at most notions counters ) , then slide its full length between a hot iron and a scrap of fabric so that the wax melts into the thread and the excess does n't mess up your ironing surface . <p> Basic side-by-side or end-to-end running stitches are fine for attaching hooks and snaps , but you can also use buttonhole stitches , to strengthen and dress up the attaching threads . Whenever my stitches need to be longer than about 1/16 in. , I cover them by making a few buttonhole stitches around the stitch , knot off with a few looped stitches , and bury the thread end in the fabric . <p> When I 'm using a lightweight wire hook in place of a snap , I usually choose to make a thread-loop eye , instead of using the bulkier and more conspicuous metal eye . I form the base loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thread , then cover all of them with buttonhole stitches . <p> For garments without a zipper guard covering the entire zipper from the inside ( which is where you 'd normally attach the waistline hook ) , I often attach a small inner tab of matching lining or ribbon to the underlap waistline , long enough to reach across to the overlap side , as shown on the faced opening at the bottom of the photo above . This holds the pants hook and allows it to extend across the opening so it can secure the waist before the zipper is closed . <p> It 's easy to cover snaps . Simply cut two disks of lining or lightweight garment fabric about four times the diameter of the snap , and poke a small hole in the center of each fabric disk with a heavy needle . Sandwich the disks between the snaps and close the snaps through the holes , then trim the disks down to about 3/8 in. from the edges of the snaps . Gather up the fabric by hand with a running stitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when sewn to the garment , the gathering is completely covered . <p> An uncovered , " hanging " snap is often a good substitute for a small hook underneath a lapped zipper at the neckline , especially if the garment is a knit or would otherwise snag in a hook . Attach the male snap piece to the edge of the underlap using just two of its holes . Close the zipper and snap the snap parts together to see where the remaining half needs to be attached . <p> I hope you 'll try out these lapped-zipper techniques in your next sewing projectand that you find them as superior to zipper-centering as I have ! <p> Shirley Smith writes about and teaches sewing and fitting in White Salmon , WA . <p> user-4258047 writes : I see your point , but in this case I found the photos very useful , as I researched a few articles to decide which zipper to install in a pair of shorts I am making .

@@22148814 @2148814/ <h> Crazy Patchwork by Machine <p> The allover patchwork jacket is a combination of programmed machine stitches and a few hand-sewn touches , like beading , ribbon work , and French knots . <p> Allover patchwork jacket detail <p> Crazy patchwork pillow <p> The allover patchwork jacket is a combination of programmed machine stitches and a few hand-sewn touches , like beading , ribbon work , and French knots . <p> by Alice Kolbfrom Threads #96 , pp. 40-43 <p> I 've been fascinated with crazy patchwork ever since I helped with a quilt show in my community a few years ago . Among the treasures brought in for display , two crazy quilts in particular caught my eye . The colors , textures , and memories stitched into these quilts were vibrant . And , after examining the traditional hand-sewing techniques used to create them , I decided to draw on my background in machine sewing to duplicate this work using the many decorative stitches available on my machine . Today 's machines make this easy to do because many offer an extra-wide zigzag stitch , which looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simplify and perfect each stitch , like mirror-imaging a stitch pattern or offering quick memory access to a previously sewn pattern . But even if your machine has only a few decorative stitches , you can still have fun with crazy patchwork . <p> Decorative machine stitches worked in a variety of threads mimic traditional hand-embroidered stitches . The allover patchwork jacket ( Vogue 2232 ; detail at right ) is a combination of programmed machine stitches and a few hand-sewn touches , like beading , ribbon work , and French knots . <p> Choose a kaleidoscope of fabrics or pick a themePart of the fun of this technique is selecting the fabrics , threads , stitch patterns , and other embellishments . I 'll talk about thread and stitch options in a moment , but start designing your garment or other project by first choosing the fabric . <p> Use this up-to-date approach to crazy patchwork to embellish both garments and home-decorating projects , like this pillow . <p> For traditional crazy quilts , choosing fabric often involved a scrap-bag approach using bits and pieces of fabrics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of values , intensities , and textures that , although appealing , may not be the look you want in a garment . A more contemporary approach to crazy piecing is to follow a color scheme or choose fabrics that are all similar in type . For example , you might design a garment using only fabric from men 's ties or loosely woven textured fabrics or opulent fabrics , like velvet and brocade . I suggest avoiding heavy or bulky fabrics , because the seam allowances will get too thick and the decorative stitches may fade into the dense fabric . However , when you choose fabrics that are very thin and silky , you may want to apply a fusible-knit interfacing to the wrong side of each one before cutting it out in order to give it more body to support the decorative stitches . <p> Although making crazy patchwork is faster and easier by machine , it 's still an ambitious project if you piece a whole garment . So you might want to embellish only a small pattern section , such as a yoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around the neck or down the center front , as I did in the vest here . In this case , I think it 's best to carry the piecing from front to back , over the shoulder and/or around the side for continuity , as I 'll explain in a moment . <p> The best patterns for allover-patchwork garments are styles with dropped shoulders ( rather than set-in sleeves ) , jewel necklines , or shawl roll collars in order to avoid bulky seams in close-fitting areas . Choose patterns with few pieces and simple construction . And , if you have n't made the pattern before , pin-fit the pattern tissue or make a muslin before sewing the garment . <p> Straight-stitch machine appliquT speeds up piecingCrazy-quilt patchwork is a marriage of irregularly shaped fabric pieces and embroidery sewn to a fabric foundation . For allover pieced garments , I use a lightweight muslin for the foundation and cut a rectangle of muslin for each front , back , and sleeve , about 1 in. larger all the way around than each pattern shape . I trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this outline as a guide for placing the pieces , extending the patchwork just beyond the lines ( see Create crazy patchwork on a fabric foundation , below ) . When I 've finished piecing and embellishing each area , which I 'll explain below , I pin on the tissue pattern and cut out the shape . <p> Create crazy patchwork on a foundation fabricAfter tracing an outline of the pattern piece on a muslin foundation , as shown at right , crazy patchwork by machine involves a three-step process , below : <p> 1 . With a selection of random , straight-edged fabric pieces , place one piece face up at the pattern 's top corner . Press under an edge on another piece and cover one raw edge of the first piece . Repeat to cover the pattern shape and all raw edges within it . <p> 2 . Edgestitch along each pressed fold , using thread that blends with the fabrics so it wo n't detract from the decorative stitching in step . Trim excess fabric from covered edges to reduce bulk . . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative machine stitches , and optionally add hand-stitched embellishments , like ribbon and beads . <p> If I plan to embellish only a small section of a garment , the actual garment fabric is the foundation . I cut and mark the rectangles in the same way , chalking the area to be pieced on the fabric . But if the patchwork is meant to flow over a seam , as , for example , at the shoulder , I cut the adjoining sections along the shoulder cutting lines only , and stitch the seam as usual . And I always staystitch a neckline or other curved area before I piece to prevent stretching . <p> To make the patchwork , cut your fabric into random , angular shapes of various lengths and widths , but approximately 2 in. by 4 in. in size . Start at a top or bottom corner of the marked pattern piece and place one fabric patch right side up on the foundation . Choose a second piece , press under a 1/4-in. seam allowance on one edge , and place the pressed edge over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics to the foundation . Continue adding pieces in this way until the foundation fabric is covered with pinned patches whose raw edges are all covered . Check under each piece as you go , trimming excess fabric from the covered edges to 1/4 in. to reduce bulk and shadowing . <p> When all the pieces are pinned in place , topstitch along the folded edges using a straight stitch and regular sewing thread in a color that blends with the fabrics . To press , turn the completed pieced section face down on a soft surface , such as a towel . I add body to the fabric by lightly spraying the wrong side with starch or spray sizing before I press . <p> Decorative machine stitches define the look <p> Even a basic selection of stitches can be varied by changing the stitch width and length or by using different types of thread . <p> To embellish your crazy patchwork , start by exploring the stitch patterns on your sewing machine . Stitches vary from model to model and are more elaborate in top-of-the-line machines , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by changing the width and length of each stitch . <p> I group machine stitches into seven categories : ( 1 ) utility stitches , like straight and zigzag ; ( 2 ) traditional embroidery stitches with the look of hand-sewn stitches , like blanket , briar , and feather stitches ; ( 3 ) thick , compact stitches , like solid ovals and diamonds ; ( 4 ) edging stitches that fall to the left or right of the needle ; ( 5 ) multi-motion stitches , like florals and animals ; ( 6 ) alphabets ; and ( 7 ) very wide flora , fauna , and alphabet units . All of these stitches can be used to embellish crazy patchwork , but I think it 's best to focus on a small selection of stitches for each project ( for example , a group of geometric patterns ) . <p> Partner the stitches with decorative threadsChoosing an assortment of threads in colors that blend with your fabric for subtle embellishment , and/or contrast with it for more impact , enhances the variety of stitches . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many types ( see " Choosing Machine-Embroidery Threads " by Sharee Dawn Roberts ) . Lightweight thread , like cotton and rayon machine-embroidery thread in a 30 wt. or 40 wt. , is suitable for all decorative stitches , even complex stitches that work with a forward-backward and/or side-to-side sequence . Medium-weight threads , like topstitching and metallic threads , are best for stitches that sew forward in a simple repetitive sequence . And threads and ribbons that are too thick to feed through a needle can be used in the bobbin to create bobbin-work embroidery that 's stitched from the wrong side of the fabric . Just changing the type of thread can add depth , texture , or sheen to the simplest stitch pattern . <p> Organize the stitching processTo simplify the embellishment , sort your stitch and thread choices into groups , matching threads that require bobbin thread ( extra-fine , neutral-colored thread designed for use in the bobbin ) and the same size needle , so that once you load the bobbin case and have a needle in place , you need only change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the patches , completing all the stitches in one thread before moving on to the next . Always start with a new needle , taking care to select one that 's right for your thread type , and be sure the machine and bobbin case are free of lint . <p> The decorative stitches in traditional crazy quilting are sewn along the patchwork 's seamlines . I like to sew a row of stitches on each side of the seamline , and sometimes add a row of satin stitches on the seam as well . <p> If the stitches pucker as you sew , try lightly spraying the wrong side of the fabric with spray starch or use a narrow strip of tear-away stabilizer under the seam , trimming it away when you 've completed the stitching . And to secure the stitches at the beginning and end of a row , either lock the stitch by sewing with a zero-length and -width setting for three to four stitches , or leave a thread tail , pull the upper thread to the wrong side , and knot it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , like beads , buttons , or ribbons . It 's best to add them by hand after you 've completed the machine embellishment . <p> Binding is the ideal edge finishTo finish the inner edge of a small area of patchwork , you can turn it under and decoratively machine-stitch it in place , or you can cover it with appliquTd bias binding : Right sides together , machine-sew one edge of the binding to the patchwork , using a 1/4-in. seam allowance , then fold under and hand-stitch the binding 's other edge to the garment . To finish an outer edge , bind it with a 1/2-in. -wide bias binding in a complementary fabric . But before binding the edges of a garment , use your pattern to cut a lining , choosing a lightweight , slippery fabric if you 're making a jacket so it slides comfortably over what you 'll wear underneath it . Stitch the seams of the lining ; place the wrong side of the lining to the right side of the jacket ; pin it in place ; and attach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loop buttonhole instead of a conventional one , so you do n't have to cut into the patchwork . <p> Crazy patchwork is a beautiful way to display your machine 's stitches . I 'm hooked on it if you try it , maybe you will be , too . <p> Alice Kolb sews in Fredericksburg , Texas , and teaches classes around the country .

@@22148819 @2148819/ 4377 @qwx204377 <h> Need to add weight to a roman shade <p> Hello , this is my first time here . : ) I have made a set of roman shades for my living room using a fairly heavy fabric which came out beautifully . I used blackout lining primarily for the insulating qualities but liked the way it helped them fold up so very neatly . <p> I decided to do a repeat for my kitchen windows , but chose a slightly lighter-weight fabric . ( Unfortunately it was also much more expensive ! ) The shades looked great on the worktable but when I hung them up , the fabric droops a little here and there , and they just look kind of pathetic . : ( Great when pulled up , not so great when left down , which is where I like them in the wintertime , covering the non-sunny windows . <p> So my idea is to take them down , open up , and attach something to the fabric to give it some more weight , like the living room shades . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate with iron-on in the past is not so terrific , I get wrinkling and such . Sew-in is not desirable as I do n't want any seams showing on the front side , and I 'd probably still have some drooping that way , so I think it must be something that I attach fully to the fabric . <p> Does anyone have an idea for how to use iron-on effectively ? Or is there some kind of spray-on stabilizer that I do n't know about ? Any help will be greatly appreciated . I 've invested too much $ in these things to give up so easily . <h> ( post #28492 , reply #1 of 11 ) <p> An interlining might be your best answer . When using lighter weight fabrics for window treatments interlining with a double faced flannel works well , it will help with your insulation as well as your light bleed through . You will need to deconstruct your shades , baste the flannel to the face fabric and then sew them up as you would normally . If you want to completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black out fabric for your lining , or interlining . Any of these methods will add heft to your project , but if you are looking for a super crisp fold use an interlining that has the crispness you desire , maybe crinoline . And to answer the fusible interfacing issue , you always need to pre-wash your interfacing , and then for fusing yardage or large pieces you need a large surface , say your dining room table with some padding ( blanket or towels ) secured to the table , then " baste " your interfacing to your yardage starting in the center and working out towards the ends . You baste by just pressing lightly at first in a scattered pattern to tack things down , before you start your real pressing . And remember always press , never iron ! <h> ( post #28492 , reply #2 of 11 ) <p> When I made Roman shades for my dining room I used a medium weight cotton , lined in drapery cotton and sewed a pocket at the bottom and inserted a metal rod ( 3/8 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It works great ! <h> ( post #28492 , reply #3 of 11 ) <p> I 'm no pro at window coverings but the flannel interlining does wonders for draperies and the rod certainly adds weight at the bottom . Re : the wrinkles in your fabric , try the rod to add weight to pull the wrinkles out but if that fails , I 'm thinking the fusible interfacing is needed to support the fabric much like in the front of a suit ( my area of expertise ) . When using fabrics with rayon , or fabrics like crepe , they have to interfaced over the entire jacket and I use FUSIBLE INTERFACING . My problems with fusibles ( getting bubbles , wrinkles , etc. ) disappeared when I started READING AND FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS for the fuible and USING A CLOCK to time the fusing process . Since your Romans are complete , your fabric has probably shrunk already so you can move onto fusing the interfacing . You can avoid having to preshrink by holding your steam iron very close to the fusible and hitting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's weft or knit . The Pellon nonwoven types are not required to preshrink and since they are made from poly they will not hold the folds for your romans either . <h> ( post #28492 , reply #4 of 11 ) <p> I do n't care for anything fusable for windows because the glue will break down much sooner in the sunlight . Either lining or interlining is your best bet . The other possibility would be to make a sleeve and insert a wooden dowel or strip of metal for weight . <p> I once made a shade with these little sleeves at 12 " intervals all the way down the fabric and inserted flat wooden slats in each opening . These hung more perfectly than any I have ever made as each fold hung straight across when fully or partially opened . <h> ( post #28492 , reply #5 of 11 ) <p> Have you tried spray starch ? I found a can of Extra Stiff spray starch at a dollar store recently and found it revived some very droopy tablecloths and decorative bows . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make sure that it does n't react with any finish that is already on the fabric , but it has n't caused any problems on my varied fabrics . <p> A decorator 's trick for giving a little extra body to draperies and swags is white gift wrapping tissue . On most Roman shades , the bottom row of poufs is never flattened out , so a few crumpled tissues inside each fold stay in easily and provides a light support . I 've even used sheets of tissue behind drapery panels--tacked with tiny stitches at the top or basted along the top seamline--to provide invisible support ; I just tear them out and replace them whenever I launder the fabrics . <h> ( post #28492 , reply #6 of 11 ) <p> Thanks everyone for your replies . I have found a spray-on fabric stiffener that appears from a sample I made to perhaps be the answer to my problem .

@@22148821 @2148821/ <h> When Thread Is Too Short for Even One More Stitch <p> We 've all experienced the need to bury or knot a thread tail that is shorter than a needle . One easy solution is to position the tip of an unthreaded needle where you want the thread to disappear , and push it through the fabric , just up to the eye . Then thread the too-short thread through the eye and pull the needle and thread tail all the way through . An Easy Threading needle ( the kind with a spring-closing slot at the top of the eye ) makes my tip effortless-- instead of pushing the thread tip through the eye , you snap the side of the thread through the slot .

That means that in order to make them wearable in woven fabrics , you would have to split the pattern apart and add ease or room through the middle of the pattern as well as the sides .

Time=Money Cathy <h> ( post #30106 , reply #3 of 12 ) <p> While I agree with the others that knit patterns are usually not good for wovens , some patterns that call for knits with very little stretch can be converted fairly well if made in a very drapey woven fabric using a size or two larger than usual . <p> However , the difference in fit between knits ( most of what we buy in RTW ) and wovens ( what home sewers are pretty much limited to ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are at fitting , a woven top is not going to fit or feel like a knit t-shirt , even if you 're using a woven cotton with spandex . <p> Before wasting time , check the pattern books for styles that are similar to what you like about the knit patterns .

If the skirt has a waistband , the band is applied to both skirt and lining ( basted together along the waist seam allowance ) . With skirts with no waistband , one pattern I have ( which also uses the skirt pattern as the pattern for the lining ) attaches the lining to the skirt ( right sides together ) with stay tape along the seam .

Nancy <h> ( post #22260 , reply #4 of 7 ) <p> You can do a couple of things . You can underline your skirt or you can line it ( or BOTH ! ) . Underlining a skirt is best if your fabric needs to be stablized or needs additional body to drape properly . To underline you cut out basically a second skirt out of a lining fabric . When working on wool , for example , I underline the skirt with a woven cotton fabric or a cotton/polyester . The technique is simple , you match up and baste your underlining to your fashion fabric wrong sides together and treat them as one piece of fabric . <p> To line your skirt , just cut out a second skirt from the same pattern pieces you used for your fashion fabric . Sew your darts , Stitch up your side , front , and back seams .

Press your seams open .

I redraw the skirt to create the lining pattern pieces . To do that I trace the pattern pieces on tissue ( or whatever ) from the waist UP TO the point at which the lines of the pattern deviate to form that fashion element . Put a ruler on your lines and continue the lines of the skirt down to the hem . Make sure you follow the angle out long enough to reach the bottom of your skirt .

Lefties can use ' regular shears ' by learning how to push where others pull and vice versa , some of the newer high end shears are so well balanced it probably wo n't matter who uses them , except for the shape of the handles .

Here 's one more : any time you are learning something new , you have the opportunity to use whichever hand works best for each part , instead of relying on a lifetime of habit . Many times , I 've wished I were more lefthanded while sewing , as the needle is on that side , and my left arm and hand have more space to move ; sometimes I teach myself to use my left hand for certain tasks so that I can rest my over-used right one . <p> A left hander will need to cut out the fabric in the opposite order that a right hander will , keeping the scissors to the left of the pattern piece , but other than that , it should n't make much difference . <h> ( post #22561 , reply #5 of 9 ) <p> Quite a few decades ago , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been flexible about handedness .

Using a sewing machine is not a problem . <h> ( post #22561 , reply #6 of 9 ) <p> I have three left handed daughters and I taught the three of them how to sew.First Iput them in front of me , like a mirror image and taught them handsewing.There is no prblem with machine sewing.The real problem are scissors , because even if they have rounded handles the blades are in a different position so if you can find them lefthanded scissors are better , if not Fiskars softouch scissors are good . <h> ( post #22561 , reply #7 of 9 ) <p> My Mom was a leftie and she taught me to sew , knit and crochet .

And also for needlepoint . <p> Scissors for cutting are a real problem , not just the way the handles fit . Right-handed scissors have the lower blade to the left , while left-handed scissors have the lower blade to the right . Thus when cutting along the cut-line of a pattern , or when grading seams , if the lefty holds right-handed scissors , the end result may not be as clean . If the lefty holds left-handed scissors , will have to cut the opposite direction than a righty . This is hard to explain .

You could think of it as a vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hipbone with a shaped hem like that of a vest or light jacket . <p> Two similar tops are peplum tops--fitted to a waist seam with a shaped peplum skimming the upper hip-- and dress jackets--unlined , fitted , short jackets of the same fabric as a dress or skirt . All of these are available as " two-piece dresses " or " coordinated separates " in ready-to-wear , and when worn with coordinating skirts , they are wonderful options for dresses for people with different size tops and bottoms . <p> Westkit blouses allow a lot of freedom of movement ( important for us teachers ) but also have professional polish without the extra weight of a blazer or vest . Most have pockets , either patch pockets at the chest or welt pockets at the waist , and even in the most luxurious fabrics are extremely practical and comfortable . <p> More fitted than a campshirt , a weskit blouse can also be worn over a cami or tshirt for a layered look that is very flattering . <h> ( post #30792 , reply #8 of 13 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm pretty busty .

I do n't like anything that emphasizes my bust and I have found that V-necks help to de-emphasize the bust ( which can look huge in crewnecks , whether fitted or looser ) . It sounded a bit counter-intuitive to me at first , since there 's more exposed skin , but I 'm sold on V-necks now . If you get a good color and one made of a bit nicer material , it CAN be office-appropriate . <p> I got one of those cami 's with a bra built in ( not the shelf-bra , a real one , with underwires and all ) and that works for me , but it is more flattering ( and a lot less revealing ! ) if I do a light jacket on top , like someone else has suggested also .

Anyone have experience with sewing natural furs ? <h> ( post #22210 , reply #1 of 8 ) <p> Sewing pelts .... all instructions for sewing leather apply and in addition , you want to comb the fur away from the edge where you will be sewing the seam.There are some really experienced sewers of leather on this site , so hopefully one of them will chime in , but the thing to remember is that holes are forever ! Really make sure that you have your machine settings tested on scrap before sewing your garment . I would use a slightly longer stitch than normal so as not to make perforations in the leather too close together . There are special leather needles that make it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My experience is that fur pelts have more fragile skin than say ... buckskin type leather . In fact , some of the skin seems *really* thin in parts depending on what part of the animal you are looking at .... and you will want to make sure that any sections that are thin are not used in areas of high stress in your garment . <h> ( post #22210 , reply #2 of 8 ) <p> My grandmother ( who taught me to sew ) was a furrier with clients all over the country in the 40 's , 50 's and 60 's . She mainly did restoration to fur garments . I remember that she had a " prized " machine that specifically sewed seams on pelts but before she acquired it she employed ladies to hand stitch the seams using a stitch similar to a buttonhole stitch and the stitches were very small and unobtrusive .

There are a lot of natives here in Alaska who sew furs by hand and it seems to take forever though their results are often amazing . I do n't reall want to spend the money to buy an actual fur sewing machine which compresses the pelts and sews with a needle from the side like the commerical furiers do . I 'm using a fairly good quality Viking and I do have a serger as well that I can use without the blade attached . <h> ( post #22210 , reply #4 of 8 ) <p> Patrick , I have n't sewn with beaver , but I have sewn with mongolian lamb , which is a hairy pelt .

Once the pieces are cut , I gently separate them from the rest of the skin , pulling the hair along with them . I trim the hair from my seam allowances with an embroidery scissors . When sewing , I make sure to keep the fur out of the seam allowances using my fingers to smooth it away from the presser foot . Other than that , I treat it pretty much as I do leather - using binder clips to hold pieces together while sewing , using a teflon foot and leather needle . <h> ( post #22210 , reply #5 of 8 ) <p> Thanks for the info , sounds like the same way you 'd sew faux fur .

Beaver is very round in shape when it 's tanned so I guess I 'll just have a lot of scraps . Any waste is expensive so I 'm doing as much research as I can before I start tossing money away .

I have also worked with commercially tanned hides and they are generally more consistent in thicknesses of hide . I agree , cutting the fur away from the seam is important or it will stick out from the seam , rather than laying flat .. plus be bulky plus make sewing crazy making . Although I prefer to do most by hand , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use a zig sag stitch , and if the hide is thin also add a thin strip of light weight bias cut cloth in between to give it more strength . That can take more attention so it does n't show and has to be fed carefully . If the bottom hide seems to be dragging on the plate will add thin strip of tissue on the bottom piece , then take off as much as I can when done for a cleaner look .. not that it really matters . If push comes to shove will glue the seams together first with leather glue as thin as will hold , as it can catch your needle and gum it up if too thick . Its been awhile , but as I recall there are needles for leather for sewing machines that do n't have a round tip , but angular like hand sewing leather needles .

Perhaps fabric paint or applique work ? <h> ( post #27784 , reply #8 of 14 ) <p> Yes , that is a great suggestion . I will try to get some permanent dyes for linen , and paint it on . I ca n't take the garment apart and reverse it as Karen suggests because it is tailored . And I ca n't embellish it either for the same reason -- it is a very classic suit . So I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permanent linen dyes ? <h> ( post #27784 , reply #9 of 14 ) <p> You could use either acrylic paint or you could use dyes . The paint may be easier to control . It will also bleed less onto the lining . The disadvantage of the paint is that it leaves a plasticy feel whre you paint with it . You can also thin down the paint - that will cut down on the plasticy feel . Yes , you can use those cute bottles of Liquitex . I would do a simple repeated design , dots , spirals , triangles .... Unless you are a super confident artist I would n't try anything really ambitious like say , a night scene of Paris . You may want to cut stamps in simple designs out of a couple of erasers . Yes , you can thin down the paints . You can also do cool stuff like mix your color with a metallic . Do n't go for perfection . You wo n't achieve it anyway . Think about those nifty Bluefish dresses - part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in how the designs were stamped on . I think your goal should be to make it busy enough to fool the eye - you could do tone one tone or go for higher contrast . You may want to add some of the stamped elements to the skirt as well . Then it looks like you actually planned it that way and less like a rescue . <p> Dyes are lovely to work with . You can contact the terrific &amp; helpful folks at dharmatrading.com . There are a variety of dyes that will work fine on linen . Some need to be steam set in a special steamer ( Or a specially rigged up pot ) some need to be set just by ironing , and some just need time to set the color . Dyes are much wetter than paint and you have somewhat less control . If you want to do something precice , go for the paint . If you are willing to go abstract - some lovely brushstrokes over a larger field of coloer , go with the dyes . the dyed will bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to do . <p> I work with both dyes and paint . If you decide on dye , do n't forget to take the texture of the linen weave into account . You can do a simple pattern with a wide brush , a basketweave for example . Again , you will be happier with the results if you do n't plan on machinelike precision .

I believe that they carry it in the ' silk painting ' section of the catalog . <p> This works on natural and synthetic fabrics and , even though it is a dye , it has the thickness of a tempra paint or a liquid acrylic paint . It needs to be heat set , but I have always gotten excellent results by setting it with a steam iron . I use paper towels for pressing cloths . Occasionally some of the dye transfers to the towel , so I throw it away and use another . <p> I generally do lots of fabric painting in the summer and not much any other time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's easy to use , it cleans from my workspace , I have stored it for a year without a problem , and the color selection is wonderful . <h> ( post #27784 , reply #12 of 14 ) <p> *I find that the deka paints are really easy to use . Their colors are kind of brash &amp; icky . They do n't mix that well . When folks use the deka colors you always can identify the exact shade that was used . Jaquard 's colors are nicer . <h> ( post #27784 , reply #14 of 14 ) <p> *One quick comment - you could remove the lining before you paint/dye to avoid bleed-through . If some paint got on the lining it might stain clothing worn under the jacket . Removing the lining totally would be a pain though - perhaps just unpick it at the hem and put a towel inside while you paint ? good luck .

@@22148852 @2148852/ <h> Style adaptations are a must when sewing for the disabled <p> CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS COMFORTIn 2005 the US Census Bureau reported that 35 million Americans were severely disabled . Periodically Threads readers have asked for information about sewing for the handicapped , especially those who spend a great deal of time in a wheelchair or bed . Probably the most difficult challenge for a disabled person is dressing and undressing , so the key is to make garments that are simple to put on and take off without compromising function or appearance . Over the years I 've gathered many suggestions and tips which I will share with you here . Pants , skirts , dresses , shirts , and jackets can be easily redesigned for handicapped comfort and convenience . I encountered more pants adapting tips than tips for other garments , so I 'll focus on them here . If you 've had occasion to sew for someone with limited mobility , I invite you to share your tips and design ideas . There are also some great online sources where you can find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they include patterns for the disabled on their website . Scribd includes a downloadable pattern for converting a dress for the disabled . In addition , Sew Much Comfort provides custom-made adaptive clothing ( at no cost ) to injured service members from all branches of the US military and national guard who were injured while serving in our current conflicts . <p> THE SEATED FIGUREAs we all know , when we sit , the front hem of our pants rides up , the back waist rides down , the abdomen area bunches up , and the crotch area becomes more snug . For someone confined to a wheelchair for a good part of the day , it makes sense to make adjustments for these situations . It 's easy to lengthen the center back seam and shorten the center front seam . It 's also helpful to contour the pants hem so that the front hem is longer than the back hem . Extra room should be given in the seat , crotch , and thigh areas which tend to spread when sitting . ( For more information read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy in Threads issue #122 . ) Knit fabrics have more give than woven , and a waist with pleats in the front can give extra room to the seated figure . <p> RETHINK PANTS POCKETSIt 's often difficult for a disabled person to run to the desk to get a pen and paper , or go to the bathroom to find a tissue or hand cream . However , using a traditional pants side pocket to store essential items is impractical because the standard pocket is next to impossible to access while in a wheelchair . Relocated roomy pockets can help eliminate this concern . Cargo pockets are a real plus , but placing them on the front upper thigh will make the pocket even more accessible . You can also add a bag pocket that hangs from a belt or the waistband . For something less noticeable , place a pocket in the side seam along the lower thigh or upper calf using an invisible zipper to keep the pocket almost invisible . In fact zippers are a wonderful addition to any disabled pocket to keep stored items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick items up that drop on the floor , so keeping their stored items in place is helpful . <p> PANT FRONT AND SIDE ADAPTATIONSAlways choose a center-front pant zipper over a standard side zipper , but even that can be a problem for someone who is severely disabled , especially at bathroom time . Consider a drop-front panel that snaps or buttons just under the waist and attaches on the sides with buttons or hook and loop tape . Another option is to put a long invisible zipper along almost the entire side seam from the waist to mid calf . Zippers are extremely effective in allowing garments to open in places that one does n't expect . As long as there 's a seamline , you can add a zipper , and an invisible zipper wo n't be noticeable . These openings make dressing , etc. , easier for the disabled . <p> AVOID PRESSURE SORESFor someone that spends lots of time in a wheelchair or bed , pressure sores are a concern ( also known as bed sores ) . They develop when sustained pressure against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cells and underlying tissues even in a small location . Sitting on or leaning against a bulky seam for an extended period of time can cause this problem to occur . The handicapped may not be able to lift themselves easily enough to adjust clothing to remove a wrinkle or move a thick seam to another place . For the severely disabled , a better option might be pants styled with no seam in the center back . Sweat pant styles work especially well for this , and a gusset in the crotch area can provide additional room without adding bulk to the back . ( See " Gusset Solution " by Kenneth D. King in Threads issue #153 . ) <p> DESIGN RULESAll of the well-known style " rules " are just as important for someone in a wheelchair . For example , vertical lines on a standing person might make her look thinner , but for someone in a wheelchair , vertical lines make her appear taller . Keep all style lines in mind when sewing for the disabled . Pay attention to the body 's silhouette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that position . For more ideas you can also read " Discover the Best Proportions &amp; Styles for You " by Nancy Shriber in Threads issue #125 . All of the same rules apply involving choice of fabric and garment styles , except that the silhouette becomes a seated figure rather than one that 's standing . <p> SHARE YOUR IDEASIf you 've ever sewn for the disabled , please share your tips and techniques as well as your successes and failures by leaving a comment below . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 19 ) <p> michellepaganini writes : Thank you for the article .

Maybe it was just that I had mastered it and it was comfortable , but I seem to have so much more control with it than with the new ones . I still get it out whenever I need to sew close to something , like piping . <h> ( post #30664 , reply #9 of 10 ) <p> &gt;&gt; ...

When the White I bought for daughter as she told me , LONG ... was limiting , I found the Singer 500A . She had a friend remove the White head out and used the console top for the Singer . The White was the style that the head came up as the top was lifted open . My mother had one exactly the same . Which is mine now as well . <p> Daughter married , had a sewing room and the Singer became limiting because it came w/o the cams . So she moved up to a Kenmore to do some fancier stitching .

Some of the more upright styles can actually interfere with the motion of your machine , and can push the machine off the zero point ! They have to be hooped higher than you think . The lower sloped caps do not run into this problem . I ran into that blessed problem , argh ! Good luck .

After some other checking , we figured out that my cap attachment part that holds the brim down was bent out of shape . After 3 years of sewing caps , all those stiff brims slowly bent that part forward . The dealer explained how to bend it back into the correct shape , which my husband did , and voila ! Back in business ! Can you believe it ? The dealer said he 's seen it before and will let Brother know how often he 's seeing this issue . This dealer is always helpful , and tonight he stayed on the phone with me after his store closed to make sure I could get my machine working properly . Yet another example of stellar customer service ! <p> New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread , but it 's breaking every couple minutes . Slowed it way down , but no help . Wondering if the caps ( structured ) require a thicker needle than the standard ? <h> ( post #30664 , reply #7 of 10 ) <p> Yes ! The buckram in the cap will require a thicker needle and possibly a slower sew out ! Just like a sewing machine , embroidery machines sometimes need to have needles for the thicker materials . A size 12 is a standard size enough for most projects , but you might have to up it a size . or maybe two . The speed and flex of the needle is higher , and the stress is higher on these machines . Put a heavy buckram backing into the mix , and it is just asking for trouble . Because you are sewing on a flexing curved surface as well ....... Needles are not that expensive , and are worth changing to suit the purpose . Sounds like you need to go outside and SCREAM ! Hope you get this project well underway soon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were always full of pesky problems , but were really a capfull of satisfaction when they were finally DONE !

When cutting a V , a shallow curve from the shoulder to the point is much more attractive than straight lines . <h> ( post #23751 , reply #3 of 15 ) <p> Thanks . It 's a shallow scoop so should n't be a problem . How do you sew the point of the V so that it does n't keep ripping open ?

You should have no unfinished fabric on the right side of your neckline . <p> You could wear a scarf under the scoop neckline in a V shape ( crossed over at the bottom ) , if you do n't want to cut it the neckline , or , as Cathy suggested , fill it in with lace or a modesty panel ( like a dickey to sit right across the cleavage ) . <h> ( post #23751 , reply #5 of 15 ) <p> Gloriasews has the right idea .

The idea of a little piece of lace or something pinned to the bra straps is appealing as sometimes wearing a strap top under something adds extra unwanted bulk , or stops a top feeling as fine or slinky as I want it . <h> ( post #23751 , reply #11 of 15 ) <p> If you look around for some nice lace pieces , and sew them to organza for some body , then put a button hole and a button on a string , you do not even have to use pins .

Cathy <h> ( post #23751 , reply #12 of 15 ) <p> That is such a lovely idea ! Thank you . I had thought of pins showing or making a bump , but tiny pretty buttons would eliminate that worry . You know , I have a few strappy tops I might wear under certain jumpers for that purpose , but often they slide down and so do n't do their job , and I 've had to pin them with safety pins to my bra straps . Your idea with lace and buttons is a little star ! <h> ( post #23751 , reply #13 of 15 ) <p> You may find a rectangle or square of fabric that is scooped down on the lower edge will stay better in place than a triangle of fabric as well . The triangle shape tends to fall between on a bosom and gape , while the wider fabric square or rectangle stays put . More coverage for a variety of tops as well .

A binding or bias trim in a similar colour on the inside of the garment should not show , so the actual colour would not matter as much .

We have well water that is very hard and no chlorine in it , so it is very hard to keep things white , and this has always been very successful for me at removing stains gently , even really stubborn tough ones that have been there a long time .

The zipper is approx. 48 inches long and believe me if I could just find the little metal bar and be able to attach it , it would be much easier than replacing that zipper. lol <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still not quite clear what part of the zipper you need . The thingie that goes up and down , and causes the teeth to mesh together is the " slider " . The bit of the slider that you hang onto is the " pull " . See : LONG ... <p> I think you 're asking about a zipper pull . Often , there 's a hole through the slider that the pull fits into by means of two little arm-like projections . If that 's so , you can thread a paperclip , a safety pin , keychain or a thread loop through there and use it as a pull if you do n't want to salvage a pull off an old zipper . Or there are zipper repair kits : http : **31;348;TOOLONG <p> As far as buying new sliders , yes , they are available , usually at a place that sells zipper by the yard : e.g. : http : //www.atlantathread.com/ and then search for " zipper slider " . <h> ( post #24636 , reply #10 of 17 ) <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility : zipperstop.com is another -- a 48 " two way jacket zipperthere is $5 . <p> If you 're no more enamoured of replacing zippers than I am , you might consider cutting the teeth off the current zipper , sewing the new tape to the remains of the old tape , and dressing it up with some trim like grosgrain ribbon . Wondertape ( the double-stick washable-outable tape from Collins that 's about $3-4/roll ) is very useful for basting long zippers prior to sewing . <h> ( post #24636 , reply #11 of 17 ) <p> I can not cut if off , if I do n't have a pull it does n't matter , and I looked into replacement type zippers and it seemed like I could n't find one and they where not the right type . lol If I could just find a little probably 3 cent pull , and fix the thing . <p> Thanks Kay for all your help . You have gone way beyond trying to help me here . lol <p> You know second thought , I could cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had an old robe like that , the zipper did n't go all the way to the bottom , I could do that then take the rest of the zipper out and just sew that seem up from the bottom about a foot or so .

Any ideals where to get one close to that size . I will start searching the internet. <h> ( post #24636 , reply #13 of 17 ) <p> Looks like you can get one at http : //www.zipperstop for $2.50 , or $3.50 if you really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you one if the standard ykk jacket zipper is n't what you need . <h> ( post #24636 , reply #15 of 17 ) <p> Kay , just wanted to let you know that I placed my order for a replacement zipper with zipperstop.com and it is being mailed out today . Boy will be glad to get this fixed , since I have looked at it needing repairs for 1 1/2. lol <h> ( post #24636 , reply #17 of 17 ) <p> Sounds like you will have to replace the zipper . I have never heard of being able to replace that part of the zipper . Check with Hancocks they may be able to special order the size that you need or go online there are places that do sell them . I think Clotilde sells them that size or perhaps Nancy 's Notions . Good luck .

Adding horsehair braid to the hem all around the dress may be all you need . It comes in many widths , but I think a 1 " to 1.5 " would work . If the dress is chiffon , the horsehair would be too heavy . <h> ( post #25384 , reply #8 of 14 ) <p> I purchased dual silk satin ( a two sided satin silk ) at a specialty wedding fabric shop in New York . They also sold me the horsehair braid for the hem . It is a synthetic , in fact it looks like white plastic but I presume this is what is usually used . I have no idea how to insert it in the hem any suggestions would be appreciated . The ruffle that I was asking about is not so much for support as it is to keep the hem out of the dirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 14 ) <p> Depending on how you finish the hem , the horsehair ( actually a plastic braid ) is sewn right next to the seam when seaming the satin and lining at the hem . Understitch through the horsehair and the seam allowance . Turn right side out and iron the hem . As an option , the other edge of the horsehair can be stitched just to the lining . Or , if doing a hand stitched hem , stitch the hem inside the hem allowance with one edge on the hem fold . The hem is the same width as the horsehair . Then fold up the hem and hand stitch . You can also stitch a lace hem tape to the edge of the hem to finish it off in style instead of just a serged edge . <h> ( post #25384 , reply #9 of 14 ) <p> The ruffle may be attached to the lining of the train--the side that has contact with the floor.The ruffle needs to be about 2-2.5 inches wide ( but this is up to you ) and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the shape before attaching to the train lining.If the train has a sewn in lining then the ruffle can be attached first by machine or hand , over the previous middle stitching line . Attach the ruffle so it 's between 0.25 " and 0.5 " from the outer finished edge of the train.I would tack in place before sewing so it looks the same distance from the hem edge when viewed from behind-- ( back views are just as important as front views ) If the lining is loose the ruffle can be attached when the garment is nearing completion , as mentioned above . Net/tulle would be the fabric to use.The edges can be left raw or finished with a rolled hem etc . If you 're not lining the train then attach the ruffle to the hem--which would need to be extra wide.No stitches should show on the outside.The other alternative is to use a ready made ruffled lace , the kind that is sewn to a straight band.Two or more , depending on preferences , overlapping layers stitched to the underside of the train and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope this helps . <h> ( post #25384 , reply #10 of 14 ) <p> I think I understand most of the instructions but was not sure of how the ruffle forms a figure eight .

Unless the pleats are REALLY shallow you will have way more fabric from the waist down to mid thigh than is easily removed by a couple of darts . In my case the difficulty was the area below where normal darts end . Running the darts down that far was really conspicuous to me . If there had n't been pockets , I could have just opened the side seam and taken the excess out of the front from the sides .... maybe . <p> Oh , and there was a lining to refit . <p> By trial and error I made it accpetable , but it was n't something I would do again unless I really , really , really loved the pants and thought they made me look like a movie star . <h> ( post #28911 , reply #6 of 8 ) <p> Another , easier option to take some of the fullness out of pleated pants is to iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few inches , creating tucks .

@@22148865 @2148865/ 4377 @qwx204377 <h> Adding rope/piping/cording to edge <p> Hello . I am making drapes for our home and am at a slight stand still ! I thought a rope trim would be a nice touch to the leading edges of the pinch pleated panels for our dining room . I have the Tauton book on Edges &amp; Corners , but it does not tell how to start and stop along a straight edge . Directions I find are for a cushion . The trim has a lip so I can align the face fabric edge with the edge of the lip , then add the lining . Not as easy as I thought ( stop thinking Lisa ! ! ) But , how do I start and stop the rope ? I opened it up but it is all twisted and does not lie flat . I sewed over the lumps , trying to curve it at the ends , but it is not very even or neat . <p> Any experience with this ? How do I get the ends to end on a straight edge ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get snug in there with the face and trim , but the lining is not tightly sewn the first time so the lip is exposed . I sewed it again and it was tighter . Will I need to go over it 3 times ? <h> ( post #27850 , reply #2 of 4 ) <p> Lisa , I have trouble getting close enough to the cord too ( on drapery piping ) . The zipper foot I have does not allow the needle to get close enough so I end up stitching it in by machine then going back with hand needle/thread and stitching very closely to the cord thru all layers just as if sewing by machine . Be sure to look at lip cord--it rolls to one side more than the other and I always make that be on the front to help hide the little bit of " lip " that still shows . As for stopping the cord , a drapery maker said she uses the fray check liberally , let it dry , then cut . I just can not go with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the seam . I 'm not happy with the look but it 's better than having raw edges . Maybe someone else has a better method ! <h> ( post #27850 , reply #3 of 4 ) <p> Thanks for your reply . I have been experimenting and find that tucking the ends into the seam is the best I can do at this point . The trim does not go exactly to the end but I found no other choice . <p> I , too , am having difficulty with the turning of the cord . It seems that the lip is sewn on " around " the cord , making it nearly impossible to sew the round trim into the flat seam without the sewn-on part of the lip showing . As I 'm going now , the lip shows on the lining side , which is not horrible - just sloppy looking ! <p> I guess if the fabric was thicker , the sewn-on portion of the lip would not show . And the little part of the flat lip would be hidden . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My husband says no one but me would notice . Still , I 'd like it to be neater ! I guess that 's why I 'm a Threads reader ! <h> ( post #27850 , reply #4 of 4 ) <p> try the method using narrow fusable web and place the cording in the fold and then place the strip of fusable web in there and press firmly . I picked up this hint on the web and tried it with my window treatments and this eliminated one step and then the zipper foot and if you have this feature , move the needle over closer to the cording . <p> I have also had the problem of unwinding cords or decorative trims and then carfully twisting the two ends into one .

This is a pretty creative bunch , hopefully something will emerge that can help me out . <p> OK , so I was helping around the house and doing laundry . One of the cats decided to " mark " the new bedspread . I put it in the wash , then dried it . And it shrunk from Queen side to Twin size . When I informed my wife , she said " oh , that was VERY expensive ! ! It cost me $300 and that was marked down from $600 !

I was thinking about wrapping it on to a spool of 10 " PVC pipe or something and then winding it onto ANOTHER spool ; or something along those lines . but that seems like a big project , and it takes quite a bit of effort to stretch even a small area , so perhaps I need to do it one square foot at a time ...

I 'm not sure if your borders is squares or swag shape . if it 's squares just draw a narrow square shape to add it to the speadspread. if it 's a swag follow your swag shape from your bedspread and draw it to some kind of large paper so you 'll have a template to draw it over the fabrics to get the exacts sizes to expand bedspread. hope this will help .

If the yarn wo n't unravel from the top then it just means the sweater was knit in the opposite direction , start unravelling those sweater pieces at the bottom . Most sleeves are knit from the cuff to the shoulder so first try unravelling at the top of the sleeve . If that does n't work start at the cuff . <p> You can unravel two different ways : 1 ) Unravel into balls and then make hanks . 2 ) Unravel the yarn directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball winder to unravel the yarn from the sweater . I find this easier than unravelling it directly onto the swift . ( See the final section for tips on how to form hanks without a swift . ) <p> ALWAYS secure the hanks so they wo n't tangle . Loosely tie pieces of scrap yarn in three or four places around the hank . I use acrylic yarn for the ties so there is n't any chance of dye staining the recycled yarn . <h> ( post #25183 , reply #9 of 17 ) <p> What you found on Google is true in the sense of UNRAVELING a knitted piece , however if you cut a sweater off at the bottom you will find that it will too " unravel " just not the same way . The stitches will " run " . Either way to hem the sweater you have to secure the edge somehow . <h> ( post #25183 , reply #10 of 17 ) <p> Have you guys heard of steeking hand knitted pieces ?

Or whatever you want to change knitted items into , you can stabilize the area by stitching above where you want to cut . Just a thought . <h> ( post #25183 , reply #11 of 17 ) <p> I guess it all depends on the definition of unraveling . In any case , I agree with you that something has to be done to the bottom of the sweater when it is cut , and in fact mentioned this in my first post . <h> ( post #25183 , reply #12 of 17 ) <p> Recently , a fearless young lady demonstrated this on Sewing With Nancy . She and a young friend had reconstructed old sweaters into new fashion sweaters . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it because I can not find it , but I do remember iron-on fusible was mentioned . <p> This is how I would do it - If a plain hem at the bottom will work for the material in the sweater , cut a strip of iron-on fusible tricot interfacing ( the width you want the hem to be ) and place it ( iron it on ) where you want the new bottom of the sweater to be . This should provide a little give and a little support . Then serge a new cut edge for the amount you will be folding up . A zig-zag stitch should be enough to hold the hem and and still allow some give . <p> I suggest trying this first on an old sweater you are not that fond of , or pick one up at Goodwill and use it for testing . <h> ( post #25183 , reply #13 of 17 ) <p> I had an alteration customer who wanted me to cut down a sweater that was too long , both body and sleeves . I advised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his girl friend gave it to him and he did not want to do that . Here is how I did it . There was a ribbing at the bottom . I pinned a tuck above the ribbing and used a serger to sew and remove the excess . ( Both sleeves and body ) . You end up with a seam where there was none before just above the ribbing . The biggest problem I had with this was adjusting the serger stitching to the knit fabric I had , as you do not have fabric to practice on . You need some sweater knit to use to adjust serger tensions . I did it and the customer was happy .

My daughter very confidently assured the salesman that her Mother would know exactly what to do , he having offered their alteration service . Although I have sewn for many years and done many alterations I have no experience in allowing for growth .

My daughter didn , t pay much attention to it so confident was she ! ! ! ! ! . Does anybody know the official way to deal with this- anybody been involved in alterations for schools outfitters etc ?

However , this traditional surface embellishment is making a comeback in unexpected ways in modern design . It was a featured technique on Lifetime Televisions Project Runway , and has resurfaced on ready-to-wear , and on designer runways . <p> The following pattern variation on North American smocking , known as the lozenge , is sewn using a grid that alternates taut and slack stitches .

The technique creates multiple folds and pleats , so do n't  select a material that has a lot of bulk . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics width and length . If your pleats are very deep , more fabric is needed . Always test your design on scrap fabric first to estimate how much yardage you need . <p> Adjust your pattern Before stitching the design , measure a test fabrics length and width . Smock the fabric , and measure it again . Divide the fabrics original length and width by the new measurements . Multiply the quotient by your target measurement to determine how much fabric is needed . <p> For example , my 10-inch square scrap became a 5-inch square after smocking a lattice pattern ( see Threads 151 to get lattice pattern ) .

Why am I putting polyester and glue on a nice cotton ? ! It has been years since I have used fusible interfacing and I was n't too thrilled about it then either , but I thought I would give it try in case it was much improved . It works but I really do n't like working with it ! <p> I use silk organza on silks for a soft touch and I like softer types of clothing in general , bias - my new favorite sewing , and drapey things without collars so there is n't much need for crisp or structured anything .

The cotton is fused already but I ca n't make myself do it to the rayon . Does anyone have a favorite alternative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #27965 , reply #1 of 8 ) <p> It 's not " natural , " but you can use a well-behaved , soft , knit sew-in called " Sewin ' Sheer . " It looks a bit like a fine mesh , and comes in white , flesh , and black . Nancy 's Notions has it , and probably a number of the mail-order businesses , too . I use it all the time for anything but the lightest silks . For cottons , I use cheap poly/cotton batiste from Joann 's , etc. , because it 's nearly natural--but it does n't wrinkle . You might be able to use this kind of batiste on rayon , because it 's quite lightweight and soft . <p> If you decide on Sewin ' Sheer , and you want it to be even softer and drapier , just cut it on the bias . <p> One caution , though : Sewin ' Sheer , though synthetic , shrinks ! So , I soak it in really hot water for 20 minutes , roll it in a towel , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and steam it with my iron , holding the iron about an inch or so away from the fabric . You can see it shrink a little more right before your eyes . After it 's dry , I store it , knowing that when I pull it out , I 'm not going to have any shrinkage problems . <h> ( post #27965 , reply #3 of 8 ) <p> Thanks for all the good advice ! I 'm ordering some Sewin ' Sheer from Nancy 's Notions and I can even take advantage of a free shipping offer this time . A little well-behaved nylon in small areas and without glue sounds ok . I had been thinking about batiste and how that might work and wondered about the shrinking . The poly blend is a good compromise considering the wrinkling factor . <p> The cotton shirt is almost done and the fusible works very well with it . Now that I ca n't see the interfacing much I am almost able to forget about the glue . The rayon will get a different treatment though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sewin ' Sheer . Not enough info comes with the products usually . <h> ( post #27965 , reply #4 of 8 ) <p> For the rayon , I 'd recommend using another layer of the actual garment fabric as the interfacing . The weight is right , and the shrinkage will be the same as the outer fabric . <p> If you want to use non-fusibles and stick with natural fibers , try using lightweight linen ( prewashed , then ironed ) for collars and cuffs . I will general cut this on the bias because I do n't often have a use for stiff interfacings for myself . It works beautifully . You might want to keep on hand some silk organza for some uses . With the linen and the silk , I 'm in pretty good shape for most of my sewing . For something that needs a bit more " oomph " , I use two layers of the linen , with the bias cuts opposing one another ( cut one piece on the bias in one direction , then flip the pattern piece so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a stiff collar ( like a fine cotton men 's dress shirt ) , the linen is cut in two layers , one on the bias and one on the straight of grain . <p> However , I really use fusibles most of the time .

@@22148877 @2148877/ 4377 @qwx204377 <h> adjusted shoulder seam and sleeve <p> Hi all , I have been reading a lot of the fitting tips here lately and I ran across a discussion about moving the shoulder seams of a blouse to help make the back armhole longer than the front . If I understand correctly what I read before , this will also help with that feeling of a blouse slipping backward . What I did n't read was IF you add .5 to the back shoulder and remove .5 from the front , keeping the size of the armhole the same , do you put the top mark of the sleeve cap at this adjusted seam or do you put the sleeve in the original position ? Everything I have made so far slids back on me , my neck is the only thing that keeps garments from sliding right off my back so I thought this would be a good solution but I do n't know what to do with the sleeves . Funny , RTW does n't do this , only the stuff I make . Any comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 8 ) <p> If you move the shoulder seam forward , you 'll need to relocate the center of the sleeve cap back so that it 's hanging straight from your shoulder bone . Otherwise , to right itself on your arm , the sleeve will pull the shirt back even worse . <p> The recent article on fitting tshirts on the Threads home page mentions making sure that the back armhole is longer than the front one . By moving the shoulder seam forward as you 've done , you have n't made the total armscye any longer , which might why your shirts pull back . <p> Have you tried slashing the pattern across the upper back , spreading it by .5 inch and lengthing the back armholes that way ? Although this might require adding to the sleeve cap , too , I 've found that there 's usually too much ease in the sleeve caps originally , and this adjustment solves two problems at once . <h> ( post #29012 , reply #2 of 8 ) <p> Thanks Teaf5 for the info . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give it a try . The blouse I finished last night using the shifting of the shoulder seam method feels very nice so I think I am on to something when it comes to the back armhole . And after spending hours basting , removing and re-basting the sleeves I figured out that of course the sleeve still needs to be positioned at the top of the armhole or else the sleeve hangs off-grain . Duh ! Live and learn . Again , Thanks ! <h> ( post #29012 , reply #3 of 8 ) <p> In the online article by Marcy Tilton that Teaf5 mentions ( on fitting t-shirts ) she has drawings that illustrated moving the shoulder line forward ( lengthening the back shoulder 1/4 inch , shortening the front shoulder 1/4 inch ) , and re-drawing the top point of the sleeve 1/2 inch toward the front . Just a suggestion , but a look at that article might clear things up . <h> ( post #29012 , reply #4 of 8 ) <p> All commercial patterns fall back off my shoulders . Moving the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish it did ; it would simplify things a whole lot . The only solution that I 've ever found for my fitting problem is to take the tuck down center front until the shoulder seam moves into proper position , then adjusting the front neckline and side seams ( i.e. , bust , waist , hips , if necessary ) . This keeps the entire armhole intact , with no alterations necessary for the sleeve . Sometimes , if the commercial pattern is just shy of falling off , I 'll opt for pushing the center clip of the sleeve cap back by about 1/4 to 1/2 " . This pulls the shoulder seam forward a tiny bit and is all right if it 's not a real bad fall backwards . <h> ( post #29012 , reply #5 of 8 ) <p> Blingy , All this does ( shifting the back armhole and then the front ) is adjust the location of the shoulder seam . It does NOTHING for fitting . If you have rounded or forward shoulders , then you may need to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , not just relocate the seam . <p> It seams ( pun intended ) that the issue of shirts pulling backwards is a common problem with commercial patterns ( it happens to me too ) , and this just goes along with the very poor pattern drafting of commercial patterns , and the use of a very erect posture for the fit model . Real human people ( us home sewers ) are not shaped like runway models . <p> What is most likely needed is more length in the back - at the shoulders and neck area . If yo have someone who can help try this experiment and you will see what I am talking about . have someone hold a tape measure at the big bone at the back of your neck , and at the waistline ( center back ) now , stand very erect ( you remember the " shoulders back , stomach in " ) . See what the measurement is . Now , slouch forward - exaggerate the posture so you are like a stooped old lady . The measurement will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the shodler seam , it 's at the center back . So , my point is that length is needed at the center back , the neck line needs to be raised . <p> NOw , do the same experiment at center front . Stand erect and then slouch forward mimicking the same two postures , when slouched , your front length will get shorter . <p> Commercial pattern pieces are very balanced- the front and backs are the same length and width ( well not exactly as the front neck edge is lower that the back ) , you may need a back that is significantly longer then the front . <p> The same applies to the width of a pattern . If you have a narrow back but large boobs , the back pattern piece will need to be much narrower than the front to go from side seam to side seam , but the front , in order to get across those big bobs , ( I 'm not implying here that YOU have big boobs , I 'm just throwing this out as an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to be much wider . <p> Hope this sheds some light on this issue <p> Oh , and I think I posted this once before on this subject . The only reason to make the back armhole longer than the front is if your body needs it to be longer . <h> ( post #29012 , reply #6 of 8 ) <p> For the most part , your suggestions are very good . But I must disagree with you that shifting the shoulder seam forward does nothing for fit . As another poster pointed out , if you shift shoulder seam forward , you will need to adjust the sleeve , or the sleeve will pull the bodice backward in order to hang straight on the arm . So , obviously , moving the shoulder seam forward affects sleeve fit . It could also affect collar fit , depending on the design of the collar . <p> I also believe that , for most people , the depth of the back armhole needs to be longer than the depth of the front armhole . Also the actual length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be longer than for the front . This is because the arm sits forward on the body . <p> I 'm the one who started the earlier post on this , and got a lot of good responses . I then experimented and here 's what I learned that works well for me ( NOTE : DonnaKaye 's response of what works for her may also be appropriate--making the front narrower across in the armhole area ) . In addition to text below , I 'm also attaching diagrams ( in one pdf file ) . <p> 1 . First I correct for my own body 's quirks that can affect shoulder fit and cause the bodice to slide backward : <p> 1a . My head sits forward , which creates a slight roundness high on my back , in the area of that protruding bone at the base of the neck . To correct for this problem , I slice across the pattern about 1 inch below the back neck , from CB to a pivot point at the armhole seam . Then I raise the top part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pivoting at armhole . <p> 1b . I also have forward shoulder , meaning that the shoulder seam is positioned correctly at the neck ( under my ear ) , but is forward at the armhole . This correction is made by shifting some of the front armhole to the back armhole . I need to shift it forward about 1/2 inch , so I draw a new shoulder seam on the back , from the existing intersection of shoulder &amp; neckline seams , to the armhole , so that it is 1/2 inch away at the armhole ( toward the front ) . If there is a shoulder dart , I first fold out the dart , draw the new shoulder seam , then unfold the dart and correct the dart legs as necessary . <p> Then I draw a new shoulder seam on the front , from the existing intersection of shoulder &amp; neckline seams , to the armhole , so that it is 1/2 inch away at the armhole , down the armhole ( sloping down ) . <p> 2 . Then I measure armhole depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both front and back , perpendicular to grain , the first under the armhole , through the point where armhole seam meets side seam ; and the second where the armhole seam meets the shoulder seam at the top . Then I measure the vertical distance ( parallel to grain line ) between the two horizontal lines . The back should be about 1 " longer than the front , for me . If it is less than that , I need to adjust . <p> At this point it gets tricky , because there are 2 ways to add the length . One is by moving the shoulder seam forward ( adding to back and taking away from front ) , or by slashing across back and spreading ( can use same slash I used for the forward head adjustment in step 1a ) . These two methods are NOT equivalent , and which to use depends on the fit in the front . Either using a muslin or by pinning the tissues together at shoulder and sideseam , I examine the fit . If there is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seam forward . If the front length is good , then , while wearing the pinned tissue , I reach forward with both arms . If the pinned tissue shifts backward to allow that reach , that 's a sure sign extra length is needed in the back ( by slicing across the back ) . sometimes both are needed ( shift half the amount forward at shoulder , and add the other half by slicing across back ) . <p> 3 . Now the sleeve needs to be adjusted . This has been discussed elsewhere in Gatherings , and in Threads magazine . There are several ways to do it : <p> --simply move the shoulder point forward by the adjusted amount . This can cause pull lines on the sleeve cap , which will require further adjustment . <p> --leave sleeve as it is and simply rotate it in the armhole seam , so that the shoulder point aligns with the new shoulder seam postilion ( this means underarm seam will not line up with sideseam , which is not good aesthetically ) <p> --redraw the sleeve cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website : LONG ... This method gives the best sleeve fit , and can actually improve on an ill-drawn sleeve cap : The curve of the sleeve cap on the back should be gentle and mostly on bias . The curve on the front cap should be steep , and closer to vertical , for the best fit and ease of movement . <h> ( post #29012 , reply #8 of 8 ) <p> This has been a very interesting thread to follow . Let me mention something that Bishop Method teaches , for what it 's worth . <p> One of the great things about Bishop Method , and one the magical things that Edna Bryte Bishop did for home sewers , is that it teaches absolute truisms in pattern design and construction , in other words , what comprises a good basic pattern . And one of those teachings -- Bishop teachers out there , correct me if I 'm wrong or my brain has gone to mush -- is that one of the features of a good master pattern is that the front and back armholes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that alterations would not be required ; of course they would . But Edna Bryte Bishop disagreed with the notion that the back armhole depth of a good basic pattern should be longer than the front . This teaching is not something that has not been tried and tested over and over and over again . She taught that this almost always created more problems than it solved . Commercial pattern bodices have consistently been the proof of this . <p> Just thought I 'd throw that two cents in . <p> Y'all may have stumbled upon the Sandra Betzina/Vogue Patterns disaster , wherein Vogue altered the design of her pants pattern for the Today 's Fit without her knowledge . This is a perfect example of the pattern companies ( sorry , Vogue ! ) thinking they know more than the home sewer . I think we get the idea that the " big boys " somehow know more secrets of good pattern design and construction than we do . Nothing could be further from the truth . The reality is that we as home sewers are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we open up a commercial pattern . The independent pattern companies are attempting to change that trend , and I applaud them for that . It 's about time we have something else to choose from . <p> Every pattern that we buy should contain good basic design features . Good example ? The pants patterns . Bishop teachers learned through the years ( from hands-on fitting of thousands of home sewers ) that a good basic pants pattern is straight of grain on the center back seam and has a front inseam slightly longer than back . Now , again , this does n't mean that alterations are not necessary . No one is a perfect fit for any pattern , and if they are , they 're just downright lucky ( it does n't take any particular fitting skill for that lucky individual to construct a well-fitting garment ) , but Bishop Method teaches ( or taught ) , what am I supposed to look for in any pattern , as a starting point , to eliminate my fitting frustration ? <p> I do n't think it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeve , as it causes pull lines in the sleeve cap . <p> The method described in Fit For Real People suggests simply rotating sleeve as it is , in the armhole so that the shoulder dot matches up with the new shoulder position . But this causes the sleeve underarm seam not to align with the bodice side seam .

She has a quick-fix solution that does n't involved messing around with the armscye seam at all--which is a place where , as you 've gathered , you can run into some tricky situations . <p> If , indeed , all you want to do is narrow the distance between the neck and the shoulder joint by about 1 inch , and your garment is unstructured ( although you could do this with a tailored jacket , too--it would just be a huge pain in the neck ! ) , here 's what you do : <p> Unstitch the shoulder seam partway , starting at least an inch from the neckline ( this will depend on how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ending about an inch or so from the armscye .

If the dart is n't too deep ( less than 1/2 inch or so , I 'd say ) , you might be able to ease in the back shoulder . If the dart is deeper , you 'll probably have to create a matching dart in the back shoulder so the seamlines are the same length ( this dart could be shorter than the front dart if it fits over your shoulder better that way ) . <p> Whichever you decide , do the same on the other shoulder as well .

I should know better - if I get frustrated and put something aside , I 'm not going to magically know how to do it when I pick it up again months or years later . <p> Fresh-starters on the other hand - and this is the group I fall into - get all excited about starting a project , but their enthusiasm and energy wane before the project gets done .

Having that specific deadline helped because it automatically defined the goal . Which included 7 outfits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expandable waists . Two needed to be formal with some glitz and sophistication , and 5 needed to be smart casual . <p> I first started with one pair of black formal pumps and one pair of beige fancy sandles and decided that all outfits would match to save packing space . I shopped and found some tops , skirts and dresses . I tried on several new styles and noticed new trends in colors and lines . I purchased what I could find that fit or that I could alter , and then got patterns for the clothes I tried on that I could n't alter . For example I found a fun black and white flippy skirt that fit perfectly but was too short . So I measured the store skirt panels and godets and yoke and length etc. and adjusted the pattern so it would fit like the one I tried on . <p> After a full day of shopping and buying parts and pieces , I knew the feel of what I wanted to get to fill in the gaps . First I shopped in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric type and made several adjustments to my list . This built anticipation and gave me time to let my ideas gel . A fabric store is not a good place for me to get ideas if I have to finish something ! Then when I went to the fabric store I was more efficient because I was looking for a certain color with one pass or just knits the next pass through.etc . I get easily distracted otherwise ! <p> When I had a pile , I sorted the alterations and the fabrics by darks and lights . With white on my serger and regular machine I did everything I could with it . If the lining or collar required black it went to the dark pile until I finished the white serger pile . Then I switched the serger color and started on that pile . If I came to a point I needed a zipper or button or elastic or specialty thread I put it in a bag that went with me to the fabric store along with anything else that it needed to match it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then did some easy quick things and then when I was too tired the fabric store was the reward . As projects started to be completed I would take them along and after the fabric store , I would stop and see if I could find jewelry or a purse in the department store . If not , I would get the supplies to make what I needed the next fabric store visit . The jewelry and purses were the icing on the cake . If I moved along I knew I could be totally coordinated . If not my packing deadline would come and I would have to forgo those fun things . By the end I had time to put creative energy into two fun matching purses and two necklaces - true luxury ! <p> A great pattern for a knit dress is New Look 6802 . I made it in a black matte knit and then added just the cross over top part like a separate vest made in a black beaded sequined fabric to dress it up . One easy and fun bias top I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would lay down to rest and read in my Threads magazines to help me with problems and get me inspired .

I agree with Keren that buying fabric must be after choosing the design and the pattern this will make it much easier and saves the time I prefer to do one project at a time and to have at least two weeks to finish it because I do it without any outside helpers Some sewing workshops finishes the garment in three days Posted : 8:01 am on April 6th <p> 1 . Keep your sewing room and sewing area quaint and tidy . If it 's messy , I can not stand to be there . <p> 2 . Work calmly and in a relaxed manner . If I start getting frustrated and annoyed , I 'm just going to link that bad feeling to sewing and I 'll avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the next . Do n't think about how much you have left to do - set small , reasonable goals - baby steps ! Tell yourself " today I 'm only hemming the dress " or " today I 'm only cutting out the fabric " . Many times you will find that if you set *small* goals , you end up doing much more because it is not done out of a feeling of obligation but because you really want to ! <p> 4 . Do n't " over-fix " a project . You made it , you made mistakes , OK , move on . Do n't undo the seams and fix it over and over because it 'll tire you out . Instead , implement what you 've learned into your next project . <p> 5 . Remember that if you buy fabric without knowing your pattern , then you are just wasting money because you usually buy excess fabric . Also , the fabric is most suited for the garment when you buy it having the pattern in mind ! And when you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have spent your money on a different fabric ! So first find a pattern , then buy the fabric , and ONLY the fabric you need ! Finish the project over a period of a few days or weeks . Congratulate yourself on the progress . Maybe take photos of the progress and post them in a blog or show them to friends who encourage you . It helps ! <p> 6 . Post up your finished works on a site such as burdastyle . Email the photos to your friends . You will LOVE getting the feedback and you will feel so good to have finished it , and in the future you will really want to finish your projects ! <p> 7 . Do n't start 2 or more projects in parallel . It 'll overwhelm you and create a mess in the sewing room , and switching between thread colors and fabrics and tensions is just unnecessary " noise " . Also , you ca n't apply what you 've learned from one project on another project unless you do them one after another right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your technique faster . Who wants 2 dresses with the same technical error in them , right ? <p> Enjoy what you do ! Make sure to create a positive experience . And then the sewing will flow !

Those who get excited by finding great patterns , searching out the perfect material and notions , maybe even getting as far as cutting out the pattern pieces , and then getting sidetracked by another fantastic idea ( or another , non-sewing-related project ) , and letting the original project sit on the back-burner indefinitely .

But no matter how easy a simple summer dress appears at first , there 's always something that ends up taking more time than projected . Out of 5 dress projects I had planned last summer , I completed two . They 're perfectly finished , but there 's something slightly " off " in the fit of each . So they need tweaking to make them more wearable , and then I 've accumulated EVEN MORE dress projects ( patterns and fabric ) , and I absolutely MUST complete at least two of them this summer . My strategy lately has been to cut out multiple patterns in one sitting , and then start off slow on one , work until it 's finished , and then start on the next one .

One is a machine sewn garment , the other is one requiring a lot of handstitching . So whatever time was available I could work on something . If I was only up to watching TV on the couch , it was time for my hand sewing project . If I had time to scoot away to my studio , time would be spent on my machine project . I do not cut a new project until a current one is finished . This formula works for me . I also look at the purchase of fabric as a reward for finishing my current project . I have disciplined myself to stay with the formula and am glad I do . There is a piece of grape colored good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make into a bag . I wo n't buy it until my current project , a dress , is finished . <p> I learned all of this the hard way . Until you have moved and gone thru every nook and cranny of your sewing room and found all of the good intentions and unfinished objects hiding in so many corners , you maybe ca n't appreciate it . That 's what turned me around . I have to say since taking this strategy I complete many more garments and complete them more successfully .

@@22148928 @2148928/ <p> For the artistic type , writing letters with fabric markers might be the best way to go . <p> Dana Finkle <p> Using sequins to write letters may be time-consuming , but the results are stunning . <p> Photo : Dana Finkle <h> Fun techniques for adding text to projects <p> There are a surprising number of ways to write on fabric . Some techniques are straightforward , while others require several materials and more time . The method you choose is a matter of personal preference and will generally be based on the result you 're trying to achieve . Below , I 'll describe nine ways to write on fabric so you can decide which technique(s) works best for you . <h> 1 . Heat Transfer Paper <p> This is a quick and easy way to iron a printed image directly onto fabric . To achieve this effect , you 'll typically need to print the design 's mirror image onto heat transfer paper with an inkjet printer . However , you 'll need to refer to the manufacturer 's instructions for your specific paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer material for light fabrics . ) Next , cut around the object(s) as close to the ink as possible . Then , press down on the image with a hot iron before peeling off the backing . <p> It helps to practice this technique at least once before transferring the actual design to the fabric . <h> 3 . PreCut Iron-On Letters <p> This process is similar to option 2 and requires you to read the manufacturer 's instructions thoroughly before beginning . To apply a Dritz iron-on letter , - as shown- below , set a dry iron to its cotton setting . Place the letter , adhesive side down , on the fabric in the desired location . Cover the letter with a press cloth , and press on the letter for 15 to 20 seconds . Finally , remove the sheet while it 's still hot . <p> You 'll be amazed at how quickly this process works . <h> 4 . Buttons <p> This option is more time-consuming than the last , but it 's much more interesting and fun to create . To begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your project . Use an embroidery hoop to hold the fabric taut . Then , plan out the orientation . Double-thread a hand-sewing needle and begin sewing the design , one button at a time . <p> Before you begin sewing , consider lightly sketching the design on the fabric 's right side with a pencil or water-soluble marker to keep the buttons properly aligned at all times . <h> 5 . Sequins <p> Writing with sequins is a great way to add sparkle to what could have been a bland project . Begin by selecting a sequin size and shape that works best for your project . Next , use an embroidery hoop to hold the fabric taut . Now , it 's time to plan how you 'd like to orient the sequins . If desired , lightly draw the design on the fabric 's right side with a pencil or water-soluble marker . Finally , double-thread a hand-sewing needle and begin sewing the design , one sequin at a time . <p> Sequin letters are eye-catching and easily secured with two stitches per sequin. <h> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , write on fabric with fabric markers or paint . You may want to use a stencil , ruler , or a light pencil outline to help you get started . Otherwise , freehand-sketch the letter to give it more personality . Last , consider using multiple colors to add more interest to the design . <p> A ruler was used to help make these fabric marker lines straight and crisp . <h> 7 . Puffy Paint <p> Puffy paint is great for adding texture and dimension to a project . Multiple puffy paint colors can be layered without mixing together like other paints . Just do n't pile on too many coats or the liquid will take hours to dry . To write- with puffy paint , simply draw the desired letter freehand , or use a pencil to lightly sketch the design on the fabric before you begin . Be careful not to squeeze too much liquid out of the bottle at once . <p> Add some dimension and shine to your project with puffy paint . <h> 8 . Hand Embroidery <p> Hand embroidery is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only requires an embroidery hoop and embroidery floss . Begin by hooping the fabric . Then , single- or double-thread an embroidery needle with embroidery floss . If desired , lightly draw the letter with a pencil on the fabric 's wrong side so the lines do n't show through , and refer to the wrong side for the proper needle placement before each stitch . While a variety of embroidery stitches- are appropriate for this technique , we used a simple backstitch in the example below . Another option is to machine-embroider letters on fabric . <p> Add some personality to your embroidered letters to really make them stand out . <h> 9 . Fuse Fabric Letters <p> If you 're looking to add a strong color or print to a project , this is the way to go . Therm O Web 's HeatnBond Ultrahold iron-on adhesive enables you to bond fabric letters to fabric with minimal effort . <p> Start by drawing a letter 's mirror image on the adhesive 's paper side . Cut out the letter and adhere it to the fabric 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Next , use the paper 's outline as a guide to cut the letter from the fabric . <p> Continue by peeling off the paper to reveal the shiny adhesive , which has bonded to the fabric 's wrong side . <p> Finally , place the fabric letter right side up onto the fabric 's right side , and press the letter in place with an iron to adhere it to the fabric . 4378 @qwx204378 4374 @qwx204374 <p> Viberks writes : Sequins look very nice to me this option like the most Posted : 4:26 am on June 6th <p> PatHersl writes : Enter the world of rubber stamping .

Our experienced- Threads- editors personally walk you through the fundamentals , from threading your machine through attaching that final button . The skills found in Teach Yourself to Sew are perfect for new sewers or for those looking to brush up on the basics . Lessons include hemming , attaching buttons and zippers , how to iron , and sewing a jacket from a pattern . 
@@22148932 @2148932/ <p> Besides all the surprising things that I 've inevitably learned from the ingenuity and talent of my students , one of the most interesting aspects of working with lots of sewers is how one begins to see that almost everybody ( myself included ) , no matter how skillful or experienced , has a few blind spots , or areas where they could improve their results . Of course , blind spots will vary from sewer to sewer , but they tend to occur in areas you think you have down cold . So , I suggest reading through the following wide-ranging list of potential pitfalls ( developed in the course of conversations with my students and other teachers , in our relentless pursuit of ever-more-satisfying sewing projects ) with as open a mind as possible . May it prove as useful to you as it has to us ! <p> 1 . Mark the things that matterIt 's important to always mark center front . Thread-trace lines that need to be seen on the right side ( pocket placement , roll lines ) . Color-code your markings-how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've tailor-tacked them in the same thread color ? This will save time , not waste it . How often have you pulled out the pattern pieces to double-check a marking ? <p> 2 . Establish priorities when choosing a pattern sizeFew of us are one size all over , so be sure to select a pattern size to best fit the part of your body that will carry the weight of the garment . When buying a pattern for an upper-body garment ( jacket , dress , shirt , blouse , or coat ) , choose the size that fits your shoulders and neckline . When buying a lower-body pattern ( pants or skirt ) , choose a size that fits your waist and upper hip . Shoulders/necklines and waists/upper hips on patterns are very difficult to alter , so it 's easiest to start off with the closest possible fit right from the pattern envelope . <p> When you choose tops , use your chest measurement ( above the bust , as high as possible under your arms , and over your shoulder blades-do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and alter for the bust if there 's more than a 2-in. difference between your chest and bust measurements . It 's always much easier to make a pattern larger than smaller . <p> 3 . Work with , not against , your sewing machinePolice yourself for bad fabric-handling habits . Look for evidence . Do you have nicks across the top of your bobbin case ? These can be caused by broken needles , sewing over pins , or the needle striking the bobbin case in a machine whose timing ( the relationship between the needle 's downward stroke and the rotation of the bobbin hook ) needs adjusting . Breaking your needle on a pin at high speed can be enough to knock a machine 's timing off . <p> Do you have scratches on your throat plate running out backward from the needle opening ? This is caused when the needle is bent backward , usually by sewers who use their hands to overzealously " help " the fabric feed through the machine . This practice causes deadly wear and tear on machines . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance ( when a curved seam needs to be straightened , or when turning an inside curve or corner ) and when to actually remove fabric from the seam allowances with a notch ( when turning an outside curve or corner ) . Grade seam allowances bravely ; do n't let your fear of fraying make your sewing lumpy . You can trim as close as 1/8 in. to the seamline without fear , so get a ruler and remind yourself what 1/8 in. looks like . Whenever possible , use a flat finish ( for example , serging or zigzagging , then stitching in the ditch to finish a waistband ) rather than folding under and slipstitching . <p> 5 . Buy longer zippersA good choice is at least 1 in. longer than the pattern suggests . Stitch both waistbands and neck facings right across the top of the zipper tape ( use nylon zippers ) , cutting off the excess at the top . This eliminates that annoying gap between the top of a zipper and the waistband ( many fly-front pants deal with the problem this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the need to sew a hook and eye to the top of a dress zipper . <p> 6 . Give gadgets a chanceKeep up with new notions and accessory feet . A job you hate may turn out to be a snap with the right tool . Learn how to use a loop turner , a bias-tape maker , a narrow hemmer , and a flat-felling foot . But do n't stop there ; keep on learning . <p> 7 . Respect " turn of cloth " Folded fabric layers take up room , so press completed collars before attaching them to a garment , carefully rolling the collar seam to the underside . Expect the undercollar to protrude slightly along the neck edge . Trim away this excess fabric and baste the collar 's raw edges together . Also , to allow for fabric thickness when attaching buttons , make sure the shank ( thread , plastic , or metal ) is as long as the fabric layers are thick . <p> 8 . Use traditional pressing tools to supplement the performance of your ironThe iron is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excessive steamers . Dab or spritz water on small or hard-to-press areas . Extend the capacity of your iron with a clapper and a point presser made from hardwood ( do n't use pine ; it 's too soft and resinous ) . Wood absorbs extra heat and moisture and returns it to the fabric so that you can press longer without scorching , plus it provides the hard surface you need to make sharp creases or open seams fully . <p> 9 . Consider an underliningAdding an underlining can supplement or change the weight , hand , or drape of a garment fabric . Duplicate the pattern piece that needs help in a second fabric , and work with the fashion fabric and underlining as one . Underline , for example , to support a limp fabric with a firm fabric , or a loosely woven fabric with an opaque one . Always treat the underlining fabric as the secondary fabric ; do n't let it outweigh or dominate the primary fabric . <p> 10 . Eliminate back-neck facings in garments with a collarSubstitute a serged or bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you wo n't have to struggle to make it lie flat . <p> 11 . Cross seams , do n't pivot , whenever possible , at the junction of two seamlinesPivoting can cause twisting and distortion of the grain , which often creates a bubble at the point of an in-set , for example , that no amount of pressing will eliminate . For the same reason , always stitch both seams away from , rather than toward , the point of intersection . <p> 12 . Keep in mind that shoulders moveIf your garment has shoulder pads , you 'll need to stitch some mobility into the points of the shoulder pads . Working from the right side , hand-sew a small , invisible backstitch in the ditch of the shoulder seams to attach shoulder pads from sleeve to neck , catching just the pad cover , and use small swing tacks on the inside to anchor the points of the pads to the armhole seam allowances . <p> 13 . Prepare sleeves to fit armholesMeasure the armhole and shape the sleeve cap to fit ; do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press it into shape . Ease and gather the sleeve seam until the measurements of the sleeve and armhole match . Then hang the sleeve cap over a tailor 's ham or the small end of an ironing board and steam-press it until it 's smooth , shaped , and all puckers have been eliminated . Only then , pin and stitch the sleeve into the garment . <p> 14 Learn the difference between topstitching and edgestitching . The side of your presser foot is n't always the best distance to stitch away from an edge . Topstitching defines an edge or attaches a detail with stitches more than 1/8 in. or so from the edge , and edgestitching ( stitching less than 1/8 in. from the edge ) often does this job better . Keep your topstitching , like all other elements , in proportion to the scale of the garment and fabric . Consider placing topstitching a distance from the edge of the fabric that reflects the fabric 's own body and thickness . Thin , hard fabrics like fine gabardine should be edgestitched close , perhaps 1/16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contrast , would probably look better topstitched 1/4 in. or more from the garment edges . <p> 15 . Do n't use a standard hem measurementA good hem is one that hangs nicely , which in different fabrics means different hem widths . As a rule , the wider the skirt , the narrower the hem-and vice versa . <p> 16 . Clip to the stitch , do n't stitch to the clipMany patterns ( especially those with V necks ) tell us to clip and then stitch to the end of the clip . This can be very difficult when the fabric frays easily , or when we lose sight of the end of the clip under the presser foot . It 's much easier to mark the point to be clipped to , stitch to this point , stop in the needle-down position , lift the presser foot , and then carefully clip to the stitch . Then lower the presser foot and complete the seam . <p> 17 . Interfacing is a discretionary material ! Do n't just follow the pattern ; treat the suggestions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own hands and eyes to tell you what areas in this garment need support or body . Examine your own clothes ( actually open the linings ! ) to discover how ready-to-wear uses interfacing to get results you like-it 's got to be either the fabric or the interfacing , or both . And do n't just buy a basic interfacing or two and use them everywhere ; start a collection and test each one . <p> Also , do n't be afraid to layer a favorite interfacing until you get the effect you want , or to use more than one type of interfacing in the same garment . In fact , it 's sensible to use a heavier interfacing in a lapel , a lighter-weight one in a jacket front , and a medium-weight one in a hem , even if it is n't suggested in the pattern . That 's how it 's done in ready-to-wear . <p> 18 . Deal with ambitious seams in sectionsFor example , when sewing a seam that will involve matching up crossing seams or details ( two sides of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stitch only a few inches at the point of intersection . Stop , check to see whether the cross seams line up , adjust if necessary , and then complete the seam . <p> 19 . It 's easier to stitch a curved edge than to press a curveForget about using those metal corner-shaping templates ( unless you can find a way to use them without burning your fingers ) or turning up along a stitched line . Instead , simply line and turn all curved pockets , flaps , and similar details . It 's faster , simpler , and cleaner . <p> 20 . Sewing is , above all , a sensual and emotional experienceDo n't even begin a project if you do n't love the color and enjoy the feel of the fabric . Fit may be flawless , design stunning , workmanship impeccable , but if the fabric does n't appeal to the senses , you 'll never wear it . 4378 @qwx204378 4375 @qwx204375 <p> user-3957048 writes : The diagram that shows when to clip a slit and when to clip a V is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clipping a slit is correct . There is less fabric on the outer edge than on the seam , so the curve will spread these slits apart to allow the outer perimeter to be larger than the inner one . You do n't need to clip a V. <p> On an internal curve , the perimeter at the outer edge is larger than at the seam . It needs to squash up into a smaller space so to you need to clip V notches to prevent the fabric from overlapping and being lumpy .

Piece the fabric before cutting out the canopy segments . <p> Photo : Jack Deutsch <p> by Sandra Ericsonexcerpted from " Umbrella Recovery " Threads issue 145 <p> There is something captivating about umbrellas ; the way they open with arms outstretched and then close back down into perfectly compact forms can seem downright magical . They keep us dry on rainy days and shield us from the bright sun on hot ones . <p> If the cover of your favorite umbrella is ripped or torn , do n't  just toss it in the trash . Simply remove the old cover , assemble a new canopy , and attach it . <p> The process is simple to master and enables you to re-cover any umbrella frame you find , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could even make umbrellas to match your outfits . Before you know it , you 'll have so many gorgeous umbrellas that you 'll be looking forward to rainy days . <p> Get to Know Your UmbrellaAlthough there are many different styles , configurations , and uses of umbrellas , when you 're considering re-covering an old umbrella or covering a new frame , the most important features are the length of the ribs , the number of sections , and whether the tips are built into the ribs or they slip over the rib ends . The more sections your frame has , the better , since each seam needs to stretch less , assuring a better fit for the canopy . <p> Umbrella Anatomy Each rib has a corresponding seam in the canopy . At the end of each rib is a tip . Study your umbrella to see how your canopy is attached at the tips . They may be hand sewn to the ribs . Or , the tips may be hand sewn directly to the canopy and pop off easily . <p> Select the Right FabricSomething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the behavior of todays fabrics as opposed to that of vintage fabrics and the relationship of the fabric to the shape of the pattern . For most umbrellas , 2.2-ounce nylon taffetas and 2.5-ounce Supplex with UV protection are usually good choices . Both are available at TheRainShed.com . Many vintage umbrellas are covered in natural or more loosely woven fabrics . If this is the case with your umbrella , choose a fabric with equal amount of bias stretch needed to arch over the ribs ; however , if you choose a fabric that is a very tightly woven synthetic with a fine yarn , it will not stretch as well over the ribs , and you will need to curve the long edge of the pattern slightly . Keeping the area around the point at the top flat to prevent ripples as the panels converge there , draw the curve into the top third of the pattern from just beyond the point , curving it out smoothly from 1/8 to 1/4 inch at the most , depending on the number of ribsmore ribs , less curve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy depends on the ability of the seams to stretch enough to accommodate the curve of the open umbrella . Make certain that you cut absolutely on-grain . <p> 1 . Take apart the old canopy . Using a seam ripper , take apart the original canopy seams . Choose the least distorted , most intact segment from which to make your pattern . Press it with the grain . Keep your umbrellas fabric in mind when pressing ; you may need a press cloth to avoid damaging the material . <p> 2 . Straighten the segments edges . Fold it in half down the center , and press . Straighten the sides if they are stretched out of shape . <p> 3 . Trace the pattern . Fold a large piece of paper in half . Align the segment fold along the paper fold , and trace the half section . Include the size of the seam allowances ; its usually 3/8 inch . To get an accurate pattern , mark the beginning and end of the cutting or stitching line , and then connect the marks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so both sides match . <p> 4 .

Select a fabric that is similar to the original canopy because that fabric was initially chosen to suit the frame construction and provide adequate bias stretch ; use the same fabric type throughout your umbrella . There is only one pattern piece for an umbrella , and its cut on the cross-grain with the hem parallel to or on the fabric selvage , depending on whether you use the selvage edge as a decorative edge or you sew the hem . Place the unfolded section on a single layer of fabric , chalk-trace , and use a rotary cutter and mat to cut each one accurately . <p> Chalk-mark the edges . <p> Assemble the New CoverSew each seam twice for added strength . Use a polyester or weather-resistant thread ( available at SeattleFabrics.com ) and a small stitch length ( 12 to 14 per inch ) . <p> 1 . Hem the pieces if desired . First , if the finished selvage wont be used for the edge , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie . When finished , the tie is a 1/2-inch-wide , double fold of fabric that 's long enough to go around the closed umbrella . Finish the exposed end since there will be a ring or loop sewed onto it . Wrap the tie around the umbrella to check for proper length . Insert the tie about a third of the way up from the lower end of a seam as its sewn in the next step , or add it to the fold of a section later . To attach a tie to the fold , topstitch it after you 've attached the canopy to the rib tips . <p> Insert the tie into a seam . <p> 3 . Connect the pieces . When sewing the sections together , sew all of the sections together in pairs first . Then sew pairs together into groups of four , sew those groups together into eight , and so on . From the top to the tips , stitch a seam allowance the same size as the original canopys ( or 3/8 inch ) . Fold the seam allowance in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowances next to the first stitching line . When all of the pieces have been sewn together , there should be a small opening at the top for the insertion of the point of the umbrella tube . If the opening is too large , re-stitch all the sections so the opening fits snugly over the point of the umbrella . <p> Sew the seam , fold the seam allowance over , and stitch again . <p> 4 . Secure the canopy over the umbrella frame end . Place the canopy over the frame , and place a 31/2-inch-diameter circle of fabric with a 1/2-inch-diameter hole in it over the canopy . Place the ferrule over the top . If a new ferrule is unavailable , and the old one cant be removed , insert the umbrella end into the canopy hole . Turn the canopy back over the ferrule . Use upholstery thread to wrap tightly around and secure the raw canopy edge between the ferrule and the base of the ribs . Hold the umbrella upright , and let the canopy fall over the ribs . Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy in place below the ferrule . <p> 5 . Attach the canopy to the rib tips . If the umbrella has detachable tips , remove them from the old canopy . Sew the tips onto each seam end by placing the rib tip upside-down on the canopys right-side hem . Use waxed buttonhole thread , and hold the fabric at the tip as you sew . Stitch from the inside of the umbrella into the hole in the rib tip two times , and then knot off the thread . When the rip tip is turned right-side up , it will hide the stitching . If the umbrella has tips that are part of the rib ends , fold the end of each seam under , and sew over the top of the rib and through the hole underneath the rib . <p> Sew the tips to the canopys seam hems . <p> 6 . Press the canopy , and attach the tips . Steam-press the canopy seams , pulling them to make them stretch a little longer . This makes it easier to pull the tips over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steaming more while open if it seems too tight .

Tutu-like garments are shown styled for both casual and dressy occasions and , in every case , are fun to wear . Making your own is n't difficult . However , tulle skirts typically have several layers of gathered fabric , and this can pose a problem when it comes to cutting an even , neat hem . I 've made and hemmed lots of tulle skirts and want to share a few tips for sewing , pressing , and hemming them . <p> - <p> Fabric and design : <p> Tulle is a thin , net fabric , typically synthetic but also available in silk . It can be a solid color or have a sparkly finish applied to it . Net or netting is a stiffer fabric with more body and is usually used to make petticoats . When purchasing tulle or net , be sure there are no big wrinkles ( usually near the end of the bolt ) as these can be difficult to remove . Tulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when selecting tulle fabric . <p> A tulle skirt can be designed from several rectangular layers of tulle cut to the same dimensions . This is a " princess " shaped skirt with a lot of fullness at the waist . Alternatively , the skirt can be cut in an " A " shape , with some of the fullness removed from waist to hip . Sometimes the tulle layers are different in volume , with a fuller top layer over slightly less full underlayers . <p> You can easily design your own skirt , but if you prefer to use a pattern , try Simplicity 1427 by Andrea Schewe ( do n't miss Andrea 's video tutorial on arm mobility . ) <p> - <p> - <p> Sewing tulle : <p> Tulle is a semitransparent fabric . I prefer to sew it with thread that 's a bit lighter in color . Because the top and bobbin threads interlock , the finished seam can look like a dark line . You can use clear thread for an invisible seamline , but clear thread can be challenging to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very conspicuous . It is best to make a few seam samples before sewing your skirt , to see what you find pleasing . Remember that your skirt is made of several layers . A sewn seam may look conspicuous in one layer , yet blend into the skirt when all the layers are together . Backstitch to secure the seam at both ends . <p> - <p> Pressing tulle : - <p> I recommend pressing seam allowances open . A press cloth is a must . You run the risk of melting the tulle if the iron is too hot . I often use a piece of tissue paper as a press cloth . A square of silk organza works well , too . It is a bit transparent and makes it easier to see what you 're pressing . <p> - <p> Hemming a tulle skirt : <p> This final step in making a tulle skirt is where you might find yourself a little overwhelmed . Controlling several layers of springy , gathered , sheer fabric takes patience , but is doable . If all the layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut them together , following these instructions . If the layers have different hem circumferences , you 'll need to mark and cut them individually . <p> Prepare the layers . Begin by steaming the skirt , or pressing with a press cloth , so all the layers are smooth and unwrinkled . <p> Secure the layers . Hand-baste or pin the layers together from the waist to the bottom edge , placing a line of pins or stitching about 12 inches apart . Hand-basting is the most time-consuming method , but also the most secure . <p> - <p> Pinning is faster , but requires some care in handling . <p> - <p> - <p> Straight sewing pins do n't stay very well in tulle , so I cut small rectangles of felt , and pin through them . They give the pins something to grab onto , and make the pins more visible . <p> - <p> - <p> Another option is to use long pins with large , flat heads . They stay in the fabric better than standard dressmaker pins , but you must handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - <p> Mark the hem . Put the garment on the wearer , and be sure she stands with her hands at her sides and looking straight ahead . Mark the hem slightly longer than you think you want the final garment . Tulle tends to spring up and shorten , and tulle skirts look- better if they are longer . You can always trim off a little bit later , but you ca n't put it back on . <p> Try school chalk or wax tailor 's chalk- to mark the hem , as it leaves a distinct mark that is removed easily . You may be able to use a wax crayon ; if so , mark 1/2 inch below the desired hemline , so you can cut away the crayon mark . Test any marking method on a scrap to be sure you can remove any marks that end up in the wrong place . <p> Some fabrics simply wo n't take a mark from chalk or crayon . If you 're having trouble making a clear mark , pin all the way around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut 1/2 inch below the pins . <p> Cut the hem . The cleanest and most even edges are made with a rotary cutter or serger blade . Once you have basted or pinned all the layers together , you make just one cut . Install a fresh rotary blade , lay the skirt on a cutting mat , and cut along the marked hemline with a smooth motion . <p> How do you use a serger to cut ? Simply unthread the serger and then run the skirt through , letting the serger 's knife cut just above the chalk or crayon marks . <p> If you must use scissors , do so with the skirt on the wearer or on a dress form . First , cut with a pair of shears , in smooth , even strokes . There will be some small , jagged bits of tulle where you stopped and started . Simply even up the jagged bits with a small pair of scissors . <p> Resew the seam ends . In cutting the hem , you will have trimmed off the backstitching that secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restitch the bottom few inches of the seams , backstitching when you reach the hem edge .

I really like the idea of trimming the hemline with the serger . Not sure that I will make one but I can just bet one of my 4-H students will ! : ) <p> Heminem writes : Here is a tip when hemming tulle , use your serger .

@@22148937 @2148937/ <h> How to Make Painted Lace <p> Lace is romantic , but painting it with multicolored dyes can make it sophisticated , fun , or wild , as well . Dyeing lace trim with a paintbrush opens a kaleidoscope of possibilities-color depth , precise application , and artistic blended effects-not possible with dip-dyeing . And it 's an easy way to create a beautiful , unique detail for garments and accessories. - <p> You can paint lace of nearly any fiber using the proper dyes , but lace made from rayon-especially Venise lace-takes color much better than any other . Rayon Venise lace trims have a wonderfully fluid hand and come in many designs and widths . Their heavier , satin-stitched motifs also provide substantial surfaces for you to paint with colors. - <p> I use a kit of seven color dyes specially formulated for lace , and the colors can be mixed to expand the basic palette . Dye bonds to the fibers without changing the lace 's hand or feel , unlike most paints . Other good fabric dye options include Rit and Jacquard 's I-Dye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , become a Threads Insider and get access to other projects like this and much more . <p> Go Ahead : Pick Up a Brush <p> You can get different effects by using more or less water in the dye mix or on the lace . Using more water in the dye mix and on the lace encourages paler colors and a watercolor effect , and reducing the water in the dye mix and on the lace gives stronger , more saturated colors with less blending . Practice painting on a couple of lace end pieces. - <p> 1 . Set up the workspace . Lay a plastic bag or dropcloth on a flat surface . Fill a fine-mist spray bottle with water , and keep it near the workspace for quick touch-ups and to keep unpainted lace damp as you work . If you are using the Permanent Lace Dye Kit , replace each bottle 's cap with a sealed dropper cap , then shake the bottles well . Position the divided dish on the dropcloth , along with the paintbrush and towels for blotting . <p> Gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix the dyes to get the colors you wish to use . The Permament Lace Dye kit is shown here . <p> 2 . Squeeze one to two drops of each dye color onto a divided plastic plate or other sectioned container , and add 10 drops of water . The dyes are concentrated , so a little goes a long way . For stronger , darker color results using either wet or dry application , increase the ratio of dye to water . <p> 3 . Soak the lace in a sink or basin of water . Remove excess water by rolling the lace in a towel , until the lace is just damp . If the lace is lightweight or loosely patterned , spritz it with water from the spray bottle a little at a time as you paint . For the most distinct color separations and saturation , keep the lace completely dry. - <p> 4 . Load the paintbrush with dye , and paint on the lace . Venise lace absorbs dye quickly , so paint with a light touch and build up to the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for precise application ; to cover larger areas more quickly , use the entire brush head . <p> - <p> In a wet application , the dyes bleed together through the lace fibers . <p> - <p> Encourage this watercolor effect by keeping the lace damp as you apply dye and using the brush to blend the dyes further . In a dry application , each color is separated from the next . The drier the lace and more concentrated the dye mix , the more distinct the color separations . <p> 5 . If the lace becomes oversaturated , blot away the excess . During a wet application , use a paper towel to remove excess dye . If you are n't satisfied with your results , you can completely remove the dye from the lace . Note that dyes are darker when wet . <p> - <p> 6 . Overdyeing will darken colors that dry too light . Allow the dyed lace to dry completely , then paint additional layers of dye on any area where you wish to intensify the color or accent details of the lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - <p> 7 . Dry the lace . Letting the lace dry naturally allows it to acquire a mottled appearance . Using a hair dryer to speed up the drying process reduces the migration of dye colors as the liquid evaporates , limiting the mottling effect . <p> 8 . Once the lace is dry , set the color . Iron it from the wrong side for about 2 minutes , using your iron 's wool setting .

And the only way I know to successfully fit an armhole is to use a muslin . For more information on armhole fittings be sure to pick up Threads #117 , and do n't miss other techniques like this one by ordering a print subscription which comes with FREE access to our tablet editions . <p> People with identical bust and over-bust measurements often fit into the same size and style pattern differently ( see Same measurements , very different figures ) . The shape of your body depends on where you carry your flesh and dictates the shape of an armhole . A muslin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fit issues . <p> Same measurements , very different figures <p> A muslin is a test garment in inexpensive fabric , initially sewn without facings or edge finishes . You pin-fit the muslin right on the body . The object is to make the fabric skim the body with no signs of wrinkles or strain lines . Although becoming a fitting expert can take years of practice , I 'm going to give you a straightforward method of how to fit an armhole and develop a well-fitting bodice muslin that accurately reflects the shape of the body . <p> Follow this order when fitting : bust , back , underarm , shoulder seam placement and slope , shoulder point to underarm , and side seams . Then adjust the pattern tissue using the fitted muslin as your guide . Such a completed pattern can be used as a reference to position darts and establish the armhole shape in future patterns . You 'll end up with a perfect pattern for a closely-fitting bodice with or without set-in fitted sleeves . Just because fitting can be complicated , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Use this glossary to help navigate your pattern and understand the fitting process and the terms used in this article .

( See above- Glossary of terms for an overview of the pattern areas that will be need adjustment . ) Make sure the finished bust measurement printed on the pattern is between 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 inches greater than your actual full bust measurement to allow enough wearing ease ( wearing ease is the difference between your body 's measurements and the finished garment 's measurements , which is necessary so you can move in the garment ) . Use a stable woven fabric without spandex , and follow the pattern to make your sleeveless , collarless muslin . Sew your seams using a long machine stitch , and use a thread color that contrasts with the muslin fabric so that you can easily see to clip and release seams during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting process . Consider hiring a dressmaker to help you . Plan on making several muslins to get the right fit ; the results are well worth the effort . If you 've never made a one , watch this video to learn how to make and and use a muslin . <p> A muslin tells you more than your measurements alone doThe first muslin serves as the rough draft for blocking out the major fitting changes . I always make at least one additional muslin to check my first fitting results . If you 're a beginner , it 's better to make more muslins with fewer changes to each than to try too many changes at once . <p> Do n't try fitting a muslin that 's a size too small because the tightness distorts the overall fit . For example , if you get a strain line between the bust points ( drawing above right ) , start over using a larger size pattern . <p> It 's important to make sure the bodice stays level around the body and does n't dip in the front or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ( HBL ) , on the face of the muslin so I have a point of reference that I can easily see while fitting ( drawing below left ) . I often use the lengthen/shorten line ( between the waist and underarm rather than at the hem ) as my HBL . While fitting , periodically check the level on the front and back HBL . If the back HBL dips , pin a wedge out of the upper back to level the line . <p> Use horizontal balance line ( HBL ) to help you keep your pattern level . <p> - <p> If your side seams strain , open them over the problem area . <p> Stand back and read the muslin to assess the fitTo get started , study the general fit of the muslin and make any obvious adjustments . If the side seam strains over the hip , open both side seams from the hem upwards until the muslin falls nicely ( drawing above right ) . If the shoulder seam is too loose , pin out the excess fabric . The muslin should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get a pattern that reflects the shape of the body , you 'll want to develop a fitting muslin that fits like a second skin-snug but not tight . Add design and additional wearing ease later . <p> Most often fit only one side of the muslin after making the HBL level . If the person is particularly asymmetrical , over-fitting can actually accentuate an uneven body . In general , if one side of the bust is larger , fit the larger side ; if one shoulder is higher , fit the higher side , and adjust the low shoulder with a pad . <p> Assess how the muslin fits at the bust <p> - <p> Ease excess fabric to form darts . <p> Darts contour the fabric to accommodate the swell of the bust while keeping the garment looking trim . Anyone with a full A-cup or larger benefits from properly placed bust darts , which make the center front of the garment fall straight to the waist and not swing away from the body . This results in a more flattering silhouette . The correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some women carry bust tissue under their arms , other women carry it in front . Experiment with positioning the angle of the dart until it 's most flattering . The dart placement alone can visually slenderize the figure . <p> I prefer to use side darts in a base pattern such as this , but pinching out a dart in the armscye to eliminate the gape and then moving the dart to a better location later is a good approach . Read the muslin and use your fingers to ease up any dragline-in this case , a diagonal fold of fabric occurs between the bust apex and the side seam-into the side bust dart . <p> The way you drape a bust dart influences how it flatters the body . Use the dart as a design element that directs the eye to your advantage . <p> Set the point of a dart closer to the apex for a smaller bust , farther away for a full bust . Do n't be surprised if your dart seems larger than usual as long as you 're getting a smooth fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very full bust . If this causes an unattractive bubble at the dart-point , two parallel darts will solve the problem . Pin in the required dart(s) that best fit the bust . <p> - <p> Raise the depth of the armhole . <p> Increasing the size of a side-seam dart lowers the front armhole . Fill the vacancy with a small piece of fabric to bring it up to the original height and redraw the armhole seamline . <p> Stand back and evaluate whether the dart-point hits in a pleasing place on the bust . If the dart 's too low , it looks matronly , and if the dart 's too high , it can look unflattering as well . The way you drape the dart influences how it flatters the body . Decide whether a slanting or straight dart fits you best . <p> Dart corrections on the back should n't end in the armholeNow that you 've adjusted the bodice front , check the back for excess fabric or undue strain at any point and assess the fit in the same way you did on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side seam and push the side back toward the front to diminish the gape and redraw the side seam . <p> If the back armhole gapes , reposition the side seam . <p> - <p> Add princess seams and a center back seam to accommodate extra back curvature . <p> If there is considerable roundness in the back , adding darts at the shoulder seams or even adding a center-back seam for extra curvature is a good solution . If an armscye dart is needed to fit a muscular back , incorporate the dart amount in a princess line ( back armscye darts are not traditionally used ) . The object is always to reduce any excess fabric in the circumference of the armscye . <p> Most patterns are cut too low under the armNow that you 've draped darts to match your curves and removed excess fabric from the back of your muslin , the shape of your armhole has probably changed . Deciding where the armhole hits under the arm is partially personal preference . Remember that an armhole cut high up under the arm is generally more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garment with sleeves ; this is often counter-intuitive to a beginning fitter . A sleeveless garment is only 1/2 inch higher under the arm than a fitted garment with a sleeve . <p> If the armhole is cut too low under the arm , add a piece of fabric and draw in a new depth ; or make a note to raise the underarm a specified amount on your pattern tissue . If you hold a ruler under your arm as high as is comfortably possible , the underarm seamline should fall barely below where the ruler is touching the flesh . <p> - <p> Center the shoulder seam and correct the slope . <p> - <p> From the shoulder point follow the body curvature and draw a new armhole . <p> Check the shoulder point and side seamChanging your shoulder seam is a judgment call . The seam should lie along the top of the shoulder at a place that balances the body front to back and follows the natural slope of the shoulder . The shoulder point falls on the shoulder seam at the exact place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lift your arm . <p> On the muslin , draw a line that falls from the shoulder point to the " crook " of the arm ( where the arm attaches to the body ) and then runs under the arm at the " break of the arm " ( where the curve begins to go under the arm ) . Draw the curvature of the armhole on the muslin to follow the body curvature from the shoulder around the arm on both the front and the back . <p> Check that the side seam hangs straight . Make adjustments by releasing and repinning the seam so that it 's perpendicular to the floor . Assess if it divides the side of the body attractively . <p> Transfer the muslin alterations to the patternMark the seam and dart lines directly on the muslin , and follow any instructions noted on the muslin during the fitting . Use a permanent marker and always mark and concentrate on the actual seamlines . To reduce confusion , ignore seam allowances until later . The muslin is now a road map of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of all your adjustmentsGo back to your original pattern and transfer the muslin corrections to the tissue . I do n't use the muslin as a pattern because fabric molds to the wearer 's body and stretches with cuts across grainlines . Plus , it 's easier and more reliable to walk and true seamlines in paper because paper does n't stretch or distort . <p> How to walk and true a seam <p> In the course of adding darts and making other fitting adjustments you have also made multiple changes to the seams . Now you have to determine that both sides of a seam are the same length-to do this we walk and true the seam . <p> To walk the seams on your paper pattern , first pin in the darts and then compare the stitch lines of adjacent seams ( side front to side back , or shoulder front to shoulder back ) in 1-inch increments from one end of the seam to the other . If the seams are n't the same length , use the HBL , notches , and key landmarks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to compare actual seamlines excluding the seam allowance ; the seamlines must match in length to enable precise construction . <p> After walking the seam , true it by using a fashion rule or French curve to blend any jagged seamlines ( that formed during the alteration process ) by drawing a new smooth line to bridge the gap . If you 're unsure what the ideal blending line is , it 's safe to split the difference between two lines-and remember , you 're making another muslin and have another opportunity to fine-tune the fit and seamlines again . <p> Once the changes are made to your pattern , it may look substantially different from the original-especially in the front armhole . On a large bust , the armhole might now have an " L " shape . We 're accustomed to seeing a long gradual curve on commercial patterns , but that is n't the shape many of us need . <p> Concentrating on the stitching lines , add new tissue to your pattern where it 's needed . Pin in the new darts and walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true a seam . <p> - <p> Clip to the stay-stitching around the armhole to enable armhole fit assessment . <p> After the seamlines have been corrected and trued , draw and cut the new seam allowance while the darts are folded so the correct dart legs automatically form . <p> Now make your second muslin . This time staystitch the armhole seams . The armhole is much higher now and you 'll probably need to clip the curves to the staystitching for a comfortable fitting . The new armhole curve should not be tight but should just skim the body . <p> The second muslin will most likely require few dramatic changes . Follow the same steps as before , this time fine-tuning the fit and the position of the seamlines . <p> Sarah Veblen teaches , designs , and sews from her studio in Sparks , Maryland . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 11 ) <p> sonut writes : If the armscye is altered , then does the sleeve also need to be altered , and how does one know what changes to make in the sleeve ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : love this post ....

@@22148939 @2148939/ <p> It 's that time of year when velvet starts making its triumphant comeback with holiday dresses for girls and ladies of all ages . Get tips from the pros who can sew it best . <p> This season designers looked to this winter staple to create looks that were anything but ordinary . Here are a few techniques that will help you get the look with none of the hassle . With new technical information and new sewing aids , velvet is no longer intimidating to sew . After you get a few skills under your belt , you 'll be able to include it in your day or night wardrobe with ease . <p> Woven with an extra set of warp yarns that form a pile , velvets range in weight from chiffon to heavy upholstery fabrics . Originally made of silk , velvet is now available in cotton , rayon , acetate , polyester , and various blends . It 's usually woven as double cloth ; two layers of fabric are woven simultaneously , one on top of the other . The pile , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that signature , luxurious nap . <p> STYLES AND PATTERNSBecause of velvet 's nature , stitching lines tend to show . Try to minimize design details such as darts , seams , buttonholes , and topstitching . Choose simple semi-fitted to loose-fitting garment styles . Gathers , soft folds , and drapey styles work better than those that are fitted and contoured . <p> Avoid ripping out stitches because that makes the fabric look damaged ; refine the fit before you start your project . Or , make a garment from a pattern you have already perfected . <p> Velvet has a definite nap ( direction of the pile ) . When you run your hand over the fabric , you will be able to tell whether the nap feels smooth to the touch ( the pile is going down ) or pushing against the pile ( the pile is going up ) . If the nap is up , the velvet looks darker . If the nap is brushed down , the fabric looks lighter . <p> CUTTING AND MARKINGThere are no hard and fast rules about which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut with the nap going down , but if you prefer a richer , darker color , cut the garment with the nap going up . On the other hand , velvet will often wear better and mat less when cut with the pile down . It 's important to be consistent and cut all of the pieces with the nap running in the same direction . Use a chalk marker or a sliver of soap on the wrong side of the fabric to mark the nap direction . <p> Lay the fabric wrong-side up in a single layer on your cutting table , so the pattern pieces are on the fabric backing . When pattern tissue is placed on the pile side , it moves and shifts , making pinning difficult and cutting inaccurate . <p> Use chalk or tailor 's pencils to mark dots and other necessary markings from the pattern on the fabric 's wrong side . The best way to mark velvet is with tailor 's tacks or with hand basting . Thread a very fine , sharp hand-sewing needle with silk thread to sew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the pressure of chalk and can be removed easily . If you need to mark long edges such as a hem , use thread-tracing . Avoid using a tracing wheel and tracing paper . To mark notches , make a small snip into the seam allowance for a single notch or multiple snips for double and triple notches . <p> - <p> Lay out the pattern pieces on the fabric 's wrong side for easy cutting . <p> SEWING SEAMSAnother product that saves time and enormous frustration is temporary spray adhesive . Now , instead of painfully pinning , basting , and stabilizing , and hoping for the best , simply spray a light line of adhesive along the seamline on the fabric 's right side . Then place the right side of the corresponding piece along the seamline , and stitch the seam . You do n't even need pins ! If you do n't get the pieces positioned perfectly the first time , pull the fabrics apart , and place them together again . There is no need to spray the adhesive again ; the first spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this process when sewing a layer of velvet to other types of fabric such as lining or any other smooth , no-pile material . The most amazing thing is that the adhesive dissipates cleanly . <p> The adhesive dissipates from the fabric , but it wo n't disappear from your table , the floor , or the surrounding surfaces , so always cover your work space to catch overspray . Adhesive manufacturers also make products to help remove the overspray from hard surfaces . <p> Stitching two pieces of velvet together can be tricky ; traditional sewing methods simply do n't work . No amount of pinning and/or basting prevents the fabric from shifting and moving-in both directions-when you sew . Here are some classic tips for sewing seams in velvet : <p> G Hand-baste with one or more of three basting methods-double , backstitch , or diagonal basting.G Loosen the machine tension.G Hold the fabric taut as you sew.G Use a walking foot , Teflon foot , or roller foot.G Use the stop and start sewing method.G Stitch with tissue paper or a stabilizer between the layers and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , use universal or sharp machine needles sizes 70/10H or 80/12H and 100-percent cotton or silk thread . Always stitch in the direction of the pile . To minimize bulk , trim and grade seam allowances , and slash darts along the fold . Press the darts open . <p> For easy stitching , try loading your machine with a walking presser foot . It has feed dogs on its sole to help feed the fabric evenly through the machine , and helps eliminate the fabric crawling . <p> - <p> Test the foot on a swatch first to make sure it does not leave tracks in the fabric 's pile . <p> PRESSING VELVETIroning velvet is always delicate work . It is easy to mar the pile with an iron , so use only steam-never allow the iron to touch the fabric . There are several pressing-board surfaces you can use to safely position the velvet pile-side down while steaming from the wrong side . <p> Needle and Velva boards are both good surfaces , but they are rather small and need to be moved frequently while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface with a piece of stiff-pile fabric such as heavy velveteen , mohair upholstery , frieze , or even a thick terry towel ; that way , you do n't have to shift the surface as you steam . <p> If your hands are sensitive to heat , use a press mitt or a finger mitt . Use a large scrap of velvet as a press cloth . <p> - <p> Steam velvet face down over a needle board or towel to avoid crushing the pile . <p> HEM FINISHESBefore hemming your garment , let it hang for at least 24 hours , giving it time to relax . Re-measure and re-cut the hem length if necessary.A hem may not need an edge finish . Simply turn it up , and stitch by hand , using a hand catchstitch , or by machine with a blindstitch . Either way , steam the hem ; never let the iron touch the fabric . Finger-press the hem to leave a soft fold at the bottom.For longer , lined garments such as coats and capes , use strips of bias-cut cotton flannel 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Position the strip parallel to the hem with the lower edge , crossing the hemline by 1/2 inch . The upper edge will extend above the hem allowance 1/2 inch .

The key to selecting the right one , however , is to determine its intended use . Below , I 'll describe a few options to consider before selecting your ideal dress form . <h> Dress forms vs. mannequins <p> What 's the difference ? I get this question all of the time , so I figured I 'd start here . Dress forms are most often made to represent a body 's torso and are usually constructed with a hard interior and a foam or fabric exterior , which is helpful for pinning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll usually come across in a retail store . It generally has a hard outer shell and often represents an entire body . For the remainder of this post , however , we will focus solely on dress forms . <h> Types of dress forms <h> 1 . Display dress form <p> - <p> The first thing to consider when buying a dress form is to identify its desired purpose . <p> If you only plan to use your dress form to display garments , then you may want to go with a cheaper option , such as the standard display version ( shown above ) . Display forms usually cost less than $100 and can be found on the following websites : The Shop Company , Mannequin Maven , and eBay . While the proportions of these forms tend to be unrealistic for fitting and draping , display forms usually have an adjustable height and are easily pinnable. <h> 2 . Professional dress form <p> - <p> If you are looking for a form that can assist you throughout the construction process with draping , pinning , fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment . <p> While these forms generally have a much higher price tag ( usually between $150 and $1,000 ) , their features and longevity significantly outweigh those of the standard display versions . For one , professional dress forms feature more accurate proportions and are available in a variety of sizes . <p> They also come on wheels for easy mobility , have a cage-like bottom to help with hemming , collapsible shoulders so garments can be easily put on and removed , and an adjustable height . Here are recommended sources for professional dress forms : The Shop Company , PGM , Mood , and- Fashion Supplies Inc . Just remember that since these forms might not match your measurements exactly , choose a size based on your smallest measurement(s) so you can pad the rest of the form later . That being said , if you 're willing to spend even more money on a dress form , consider these custom-made services : Fabulous Fit and Wolf Form . <h> 3 . Bifurcated dress form <p> - <p> Bifurcated forms are one step up from professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main difference is that they include legs for trying on shorts and pants . These form types are especially useful if you plan to drape either of these garments or if you do a lot of pant fittings . Another feature to consider is whether you want your dress form to have arms . Again , if you do a lot of draping and/or patternwork , you 'll find a dress form with arms useful . Many companies make dress forms with removable magnetic arms that you can attach when necessary . Here are some sources worth checking out : The Shop Company , Mood , and Fashion Supplies Inc. <h> 4 . Adjustable dress form <p> - <p> Adjustable dress forms are exactly what they sound like . They are forms that can be adjusted with dials to match your body 's measurements . <p> They are often lightweight , like display forms , but their proportions are more realistic . The great thing about these forms is that they 're more affordable than professional forms , as they usually cost under $300. - Some can also accommodate pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool attached to the adjustable height pole . In comparison to professional forms , however , they are far less durable , the shoulders are n't collapsible , the structure is n't as easy to pin , and they are n't as ideal for draping . <p> The problem is , once you start turning the dials , the panels begin to expand away from each other , creating gaps at the seams . This can make it impossible to pin at the waist , center front , and at many other important marking points . In addition , it can be hard to mold these forms to your exact measurements , since they can only adjust so much . This means that if your bust is significantly larger than your waist , for instance , you may not be able to expand the bust enough to meet your needs .

@@22148943 @2148943/ <p> First of all , toss the bent pins . I ca n't tell you how many pincushions and pin boxes I reach into in the course of teaching , and find them full of bent pins . They 're done ! They 've done their work ! They ca n't be straightened ( well , I suppose they could be , but it is n't worth the time ) , so do yourself a favor and throw them away . You 'll only waste time searching around for useable pins in a pin dish full of clunkers . And while you 're at it , you might take a couple of minutes and separate out all of the other things that seem to work their way into a pin dish or onto a pincushion : sewing machine needles , safety pins , hooks and eyes , paperclips , and a snarl of threaded needles . None of these belong with your pins . <p> I have two metal tins for my pins. - One- contains a few heavy-duty pins that I reserve for heavy-duty jobs ( jobs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other has very sharp , lightweight glass-headed pins that go easily into any fabric . And that 's what you want your pins to do " there should be no hesitation , no effort to get the pin into the fabric , no shifting around of the fabric as you pin . <p> And beware of plastic-headed pins " they 're okay , but they can melt ( and possibly stick to your fabric ) when ironed . I like glass-headed pins because they 're easy on the fingers , and I think I got used to using them after so many years of working with lace . They tend not to sink into- the lace- and disappear the way metal pins often do . <p> When you 're pinning to a section of a garment ( pinning on the pattern tissue , for instance , or pinning an underlining in place ) , keep the pins in the seam allowances . Most fabrics are n't marred by pins , but some are , and if the pins are thick , then the damage will be worse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I place the pens perpendicular to the seamline . That way when I gather- the fabric onto the needle with basting stitches to join the layers together , the pins wo n't stick me . The perpendicular pins- nestle into the folds of fabric- loaded onto my needle ; and I do n't have to constantly stop to remove them as I baste . The whole process becomes much faster . <p> - <p> If the pins- are placed parallel to the seam , I have to stop- basting to remove them , and they are in the perfect position to- stick me . As you can imagine , it 's a much slower process . <p> Another advantage to placing them perpendicularly : they 're easy to remove with your hand " you can just sweep them out of the fabric with your fingers held flat . It 's quicker ( and more fun ) than un-pinning each one . And while this is n't an action shot , you can get the idea . <p> I also place the pins perpendicularly when I 'm pinning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility in the fabric .

Your stitches , therefore , wo n't be as accurately placed as they should be . <p> I often tell my students a phrase I hear my patternmaker colleague Julien Cristofoli use , " Use your pin as a stitch . " You can see his point . While a pin placed parallel to the seam does hold the layers together , - you can see that- the perpendicular placement- is far more secure. - It holds things in place precisely , beautifully defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate result . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 46 ) <p> danswife writes : This is in response to Finely Fabricated 's question about fine , sharp pins .

Especially haute couture . I 've seen it and lived it . Ready-to-wear clothing do not usually use pins when working in an industrial setting , but when they do they say place parallel . Placing perpendicular is a home sewing technique that has taken hold and become popular because the majority of home sewers do not know high fashion ( hate couture ) techniques . Also , placing parallel allows you to see the finished product before making any sort of stitches ; an advantage perpendicular pins do not allow . The only time to use perpendicular pins is closures , such as zippers . At least you got that right .

But why top off your outfit with basic spaghetti straps when there are so many fun options to explore ? Below , I 'll share four strap variations that can easily be incorporated into your wardrobe with just a few materials . Let 's get started . <p> Note : - Before you begin , make sure to prepare the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams . In addition , unless the garment you are working with is made of a stretchy fabric , you 'll need to insert a zipper ( or other closure type ) when creating one of the first three options below . These same three techniques also require a garment facing or lining . <h> I. Braided Straps <p> This design is basic and eye-catching . While I used six pieces of 2-mm rattail cord in two colors for each strap , you can personalize this look however you desire . For instance , consider using only one color or six different colors to complement the body fabric . <p> Six cords make a substantial yet delicate strap . For a narrower strap , use just three cord pieces , and for a wider strap , use nine cords or more . <p> 1 . Determine the strap length. - Measure the distance from the front bodice 's top right edge ( in the location you plan to insert the strap ) to the back bodice 's top right edge . Repeat for the left side . Add at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2 to determine the total yardage needed for each cord piece . You will need six thin cord pieces in up to six colors to create the look above . <p> 2 . Prepare the pieces . Cut all six cords in half . Take one pile and orient the cords in the desired order from left to right . Baste them together about 1 inch from the top edge , as shown below . Repeat with the second pile . <p> Consider securing this top portion to a clipboard to make it easier to braid the strands together . <p> 3 . Braid the cord . Begin braiding , using two strands at a time . Be sure to take your time so the strands remain neat and untangled . When you get to the end , pinch the remaining cord pieces together and baste across this portion , about 1 inch away from the edge . Repeat with the second group , reversing the order of the cord colors to make the second braid symmetrical to the first one . <p> The silky nature of this cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Sandwich the strap. - With the garment 's back bodice and facing ( or lining ) pieces with right sides together , place one braid end in the desired strap location between the two fabrics . The basting stitch should align with the garment 's seamline . Make sure the braid 's right side is against the garment right side , so that when the strap opens out , the braid is not upside down . Sew the strap in place . Repeat for the second strap , checking that it is arranged symmetrically to the first strap . <p> The braided strap 's flat end is sandwiched between the back bodice and the facing 's right sides . <p> 5 . Secure the other end . Try on the garment , pull the unsewn strap ends to the front , and place a pin in the strap at the desired length . Stitch the- straps between the bodice front and facing ( or lining ) pieces , as described in step 4 . Trim any excess braided strap , and finish the garment as instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your straps with a simple , decorative buckle . While these 1/2-inch-long by 1-inch-wide rectangular buckles are not functional in this design , they certainly add an interesting touch to tops and dresses alike . <p> These straps are made of 1-inch-wide black elastic trim for a fitted and comfortable look . <p> - <p> 1. - Determine the strap length. - Measure the distance from the front bodice 's top right edge ( in the location you plan to insert the strap ) to the back bodice 's top right edge . Repeat for the left side . Add at least 10 inches to the larger measurement . Multiply this number by 2 to determine how much elastic yardage is necessary . <p> 2. - Prepare the pieces. - Cut the elastic in half to make a left and a right strap . Determine the material 's right side if the front and back differ . To make a strap , wrap one elastic end around the bottom buckle bar , with wrong sides together , so about 3-1/2 inches sit on the buckle 's front side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut the back elastic piece 2-3/4 inches below the buckle 's bottom bar . ( Note that this length may be adjusted as desired , as long as there is enough elastic to spare . ) Repeat with the second strap half . <p> Wrap one elastic piece around the buckle 's bottom bar . Then , cut the back length to 2-3/4 inches . <p> - <p> 3 . Stitch the lower section . Using a zipper foot , stitch the elastic layers together as close to the buckle as possible . Repeat for the second piece . <p> Since the buckle prong has no function , feel free to remove it with pliers if you prefer . <p> 4 . Attach the top elastic . Thread the remaining elastic through the top buckle bar , with wrong sides together , so the pieces overlap by 1/2 inch . Stitch as close to the buckle bar as possible . <p> A zipper foot makes it easy to stitch close to the buckle bar . <p> 5 . Attach the straps to the garment front . With right sides together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap location . Align its end with the fabric cut edge , then pin or baste in place . Repeat for the second strap . Lay the front facing or lining over the strap , with its right side against the garment right side . Sew the facing seam with a 5/8-inch-wide seam allowance , catching the strap ends in the seam . <p> Secure the strap end closest to the buckle between the bodice front and front facing ( or lining ) pieces . <p> 6. - Secure the other end . Try on the garment , pull the unsewn strap ends to the back , and place a pin in the straps at the desired length . Trim any excess elastic 5/8 inch below this measurement to allow for the seam allowance . Stitch the- straps between the bodice back and facing ( or lining ) pieces , as described in step 5 . Finish the rest of the garment as instructed . <p> 7 . Finish the edge . Depending on the strap elastic you choose , it might be necessary to cut the front raw edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . <p> Trim the elastic at a 45-degree angle to prevent it from fraying . <h> III . Criss-Cross Back <p> Shift the interest to the back with this bold criss-cross strap technique . All you need is a few fabric strips to create this stunning design . <p> These 1/2-inch-wide angled strips are sure to add a " wow factor " to your garment . <p> 1 . Determine the strap length . Measure the distance from the front of one shoulder to the back of the opposite shoulder where you plan to place the straps . Add at least 3 inches to this measurement and multiply the final number by 2 . Repeat on the opposite side . <p> 2 . Prepare the strips . To create the -+-inch-wide straps , cut two 1-1/2-inch-wide fabric strips the length of the numbers you determined in step 1 . <p> Although you can make each strap separately , it 's easier to work on at least two at a time . <p> 3 . Fold and press . For each fabric strip , fold one long edge to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the opposite edge . <p> Use a seam gauge to create even folds . <p> 4 . Stitch in place . Fold each strip lengthwise , with wrong sides together , aligning the folded edges . Press , then edgestitch the two folds together . Cut each of the two long strips in half , creating four straps . <p> Stitch along the two folded edges . <p> 5 . Position the straps in back . Try on the bodice and- mark the desired strap placement with tailor 's chalk . ( Note that the straps shown above are spaced 3/4 inch apart . ) Next , orient the garment 's back bodice and facing ( or lining ) pieces with right sides together and place the strap ends in the desired locations between the two fabrics . The strap ends should extend slightly beyond the fabric edges at an angle . Be sure the strap seams are oriented on the desired sides . Sew around the entire back bodice with a 5/8-inch-wide seam allowance , catching the strap ends in the seam . <p> Once the straps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric edge . <p> 6. - Secure the other end . Try on the garment , pull the unsewn strap ends to the front , and place a pin in the straps at the desired length . Trim any excess strap fabric 5/8 inch below this measurement to allow for the seam allowance . Stitch the- straps between the bodice front and facing ( or lining ) pieces , as described in step 5 . Finish the rest of the garment as instructed . <h> IV . Ribbon Casing <p> This strap technique- is a cute way to finish a basic garment . Just add an armhole curve to a rectangular pattern piece and create the casing . <p> 1 . Create the pattern . Begin with a rectangular pattern piece . The length is determined by how long you want the garment to be plus the ribbon 's width and at least 1-3/8 inches for the neckline casing and hem allowance . For the width , measure the body 's front circumference and add as much ease as desired . Then , since the pattern is cut on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , place a bodice front armhole curve from an existing pattern that fits along the rectangle 's top left corner as shown below . Slide the armhole pattern down from the top edge the following distance : the ribbon 's width + 1/8 inch + 1/4 inch . Trace the curve onto the rectangular pattern and extend the curve 's topmost point straight up to meet the rectangle 's top edge . Add the desired seam allowance along the curve . Repeat for the bodice back . <p> Align an armhole curve with the rectangle 's top left corner . Then slide the curve down to account for the casing 's dimensions . <p> 2 . Prepare the pieces . Use the front and back bodice patterns to cut the fabric . Sew the side seams . Then finish the armholes- with a preferred method- before continuing with the following steps . <p> 4 . Create a casing. - Turn the top bodice edge under 1/4 inch to the wrong side and press . Turn the same edge under again the width of your ribbon plus 1/8 inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodice back . <p> Because a 1-inch-wide ribbon was used , the casing is 1-1/8 inches wide . <p> 5 . Insert the ribbon. - Use a safety pin or a bodkin to thread the ribbon through the casing. - Start at the front bodice 's right- side and continue around to the back bodice 's right side . Try on the garment and scrunch the casing along the front and back to create a gathered look as you tie- the bow . Trim any excess ribbon at a 45-degree- angle to prevent fraying . Finally , hem the garment . <p> Insert the ribbon through one bodice casing end and continue around the full garment . <h> Which strap technique are you most interested in trying ?

@@22148961 @2148961/ <p> I recently came into another gift of Fortuny fabric ( you 'll remember the Fortuny shirt and the fabulous Fortuny coat I previously shared ) , and decided to make a frock coat . I wanted an embroidered 18th-century-style coat , but made like a jeans jacket . The good people at Penn &amp; Fletcher in Long Island City , New York , kindly allowed me to make use of their computerized embroidery machines to realize my vision . <p> The first step was to get a working pattern for the coat . I borrowed an 18th-century jacket from Penn &amp; Fletcher , and took a pattern from it . Read more about them here , and here . They had embroidered a set of jackets- for a Broadway production of the play Dangerous Liaisons , and were kind enough to lend them to me . <p> - <p> After creating a series of muslins ( three in all , so for those who want to avoid that step-DO N'T ) , I got a pattern that fit well and was stylistically correct . <p> Then , Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They adjusted their house pattern for the Dangerous Liaisons coat to fit my pattern . They printed out the coat fronts , which allowed me to mark my fabric . <p> - <p> I cut the pattern on the stitching lines , so I could mark the fabric easily . After placing the embroidery pattern onto the fabric , I thread-basted the pattern 's stitching lines onto the fabric . <p> The next step was choosing colors , and stitching out the design . Ernie at Penn &amp; Fletcher put me on the smallest machine and programmed the pocket flap . <p> - <p> This enabled me to sew out the design in variations of my color choices , to see what I liked best . I ran five combinations by changing the threads in the machine . <p> Once I chose the color combination , we moved on to the larger machine to sew the fronts . This machine is programmable , and we threaded it with the five colors I chose . Each color has a needle and- each needle a number , which aids in programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the order in which the design was stitched . There were- several embroidery layers- to the- work , to create the dimensional effects of this pattern . <p> - <p> This printout shows what- was sewn and when , and that I needed to note which needle would be used for each step of the embroidery . Once this was done , we- programmed the needles and mounted the fabric to the frame . <p> - <p> There was tear-away stabilizer in the frame , mounted in the machine . The program sewed out the front line of the jacket , then stopped . That allowed me to place the thread-basted front line of the fabric onto the machine stitching line . The fabric was held to the tear-away stabilizer with double-stick tape . <p> The design stitched out in successive layers . The total stitching time on the machine was- 6 hours for each front ( 12 hours total ) . <p> - <p> This view shows the work before the border is embroidered . <p> The other pieces are stitched on the machine in the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a pair of pocket flaps , as well as a collar flap . <p> All the small pieces-collar , cuffs , and pocket flaps-were finished and waiting ( along with the lining , which is perfect ) for the main event . <p> - <p> - <p> I decided to set the front pocket flaps like upside-down single welt pockets . Since this jacket is unlined , the pocket bags occasionally will be visible . I constructed the pocket so the right side of the fabric showed and used French seams , so the pocket would be finished . <p> The upper portion of the pockets will be covered by the deep front facing . <p> - <p> - <p> I made a single-welt pocket on the body facing for an inside pocket . This finish consists of a deep facing in the front and a half-lining on the back . After the pocket was installed , I sewed the shoulder seams and side seams and finished the raw edge with a turned topstitched edge . <p> The sleeves came next . <p> - <p> I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one operation . Later , I hand-finished the sleeve lining at the armhole , like an old-school tailored lining . <p> After sewing the shoulder and side seams , the collar was installed . The seams were sewn with double topstitching , to mimic jeans construction . <p> - <p> This view shows the work after the sleeve was installed . <p> Once the collar is installed , the sleeves were set . <p> - <p> I installed these with a flat shoulder pad ( 1/4 inch ) , and a flat sleeve head , to give definition , but not height , to the shoulder . <p> - <p> - <p> The final step was installing the front facing and finishing work , such as the hem . . . <p> - <p> - <p> . . . and the lining . The deep facing and lining were sewn to the body at the armholes . To finish , the sleeve linings were fell-stitched to the body lining along the armhole seams . <p> Finishing also included setting jeans buttons and rivets at the pockets . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topstitching at the ends of the vents at the waist was reinforced with rivets , as well . <p> - <p> - <p> Here I am wearing the Fortuny frock coat !

" <p> The direction of a fabric 's yarns presents many design opportunities and can take a garment from " ho-hum everyday " to " absolutely sublime . " <p> by Ann SteevesFrom Threads #131 , pp. 38-43 <p> For many sewing enthusiasts , discussion or thinking about fabric grain is limited mostly to aligning pattern pieces correctly on the lengthwise grain , using the arrows printed on commercial pattern pieces as a guide . We 've had it beaten into us for years , after all . But I 'd like to encourage you to break free from traditional grain rules . The direction of a fabric 's yarns presents many design opportunities and can take a garment from " ho-hum everyday " to " absolutely sublime . " <p> First , study your fabric <p> - <p> - <p> To become a grain rebel , you first need to identify and understand fabric grain ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tug it in all directions to test its stability and stretch . Once you know how different fabrics stretch and drape , you can start playing with grain to make a garment that is truly unique . <p> If you take the time to manipulate grain , you want it to stand out . So look for fabrics with bold texture , like damask , linen , herringbone , or faille . Or opt for a linear print . My absolute favorite fabrics to play with are stripes and plaids . <p> Straight and narrow , no more . Pivoted and turned in unconventional ways , a simple striped fabric adds dimension and shape to- the garment in the photo at right . <p> - <p> - <p> Crash course on grain <p> Grain is the direction of a fabric 's yarns in a woven fabric : lengthwise and crosswise . In knit fabrics , the yarns interloop , so the following do n't apply . <p> LengthwiseLengthwise grain is commonly referred to as " grain " or " straight grain " on commercial patterns . It 's marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction in which the pattern should be placed on the fabric . Lengthwise grain lies parallel to the selvages and has little or no stretch . Therefore , in most garments , lengthwise grain runs perpendicular to the ground . <p> - <p> CrosswiseCrosswise grain , also called " cross-grain , " is made from the yarns woven over and under the lengthwise yarns at a 90-degree angle . Crosswise grain has more stretch than lengthwise grain , thanks to the over/under weaving , which naturally provides less tension . In most garments , crosswise grain runs around the body , parallel to the floor . <p> BiasBias-not technically a grain , refers to any line diagonal to the lengthwise and crosswise grains . " True bias " is a cut made on an angle 45 degrees to the selvage . It has the most stretch and gives fabric a flowing drape over the body . Because of the inherent elasticity of bias , it requires special care in cutting and sewing to utilize the stretch without distorting the fabric . <p> Grain as layout guideline , not gospelWith a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And do n't be bound by the layout outlined in the instruction sheets . Pattern layouts are starting points only . They 're not commandments . <p> I often hang a large swatch of fabric on the bulletin board in my sewing room and turn it several ways while deciding what I want to do with it . When I 'm ready to get adventurous with the grain , I ignore the recommended pattern layout completely . Take my lead and simply experiment . Lay the pattern pieces out on the fabric , and try all sorts of different layouts : <p> Add texture with strips . Place each one on a different grain . Turn the seam allowances out . <p> - <p> - <p> On this princess-seamed jacket ( McCalls 5106 ) , the pocket flaps are turned on the bias , with interfacing added for support . <p> Spin just a few pattern pieces . Go ahead and cut only a few select pieces on different grains . Let 's take , for example , a princess-seamed jacket . Try laying out the front and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains for the side front and side back pieces . This will give you visual interest and can have a slimming effect on many figures . It also adds real " pow " if you 're working with a plaid or a stripe . <p> Focus on center front and back . One of my favorite places to play with grain is at the center front or center back . It 's easy to do . With most patterns , simply ignore the " cut on fold " direction and make a seam at center front or back . ( Do n't forget to add seam allowances . ) Then cut the fabric on the bias for a lovely chevron effect , as in the cream jacket shown here . <p> Slice and dice . Do n't be bound by the pattern shapes . Take a cue from " Cut Up Patterns and Add Seams " in Threads no. 129 . I did . For the cream jacket , I sliced out the top of the front pattern pieces and changed them to a bib-yoke-style front . This completely altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to highlight a contrasting fabric . <p> Eke extra mileage from precious yardage . Playing with grain has a wonderful side effect : Varying the direction of your layout usually saves fabric . Case in point : I recently bought an abstract print silk fabric in Paris . Because it was so dear , I only bought enough for a simple shell . The pattern I decided to use was a bias-cut , cowl-neck top . I did n't have enough fabric to cut the whole top on the bias . But I did have enough to cut the front and cowl on the bias and the back on the straight of grain . Thanks to the overall print of the fabric , it 's impossible for anyone to tell the difference . <p> The creative possibilitiesOnce you break free from conventional grain layouts , you 'll be pleasantly surprised with the design options : <p> Play with stripes . Striped fabrics are a logical place to begin your grain adventures . They lend themselves to great design opportunities . The plainest button-down shirt , for example , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts one front piece on the lengthwise grain and the other on the crosswise grain for a funky , asymmetrical look . <p> Another fun use of stripes is to create a chevron effect along seams , like the blue-and-white halter dress shown at the beginnin of this article . This visual trick allows you to emphasize or disguise figure flaws , create the illusion of a waistline , and create visual " flow " in a garment . <p> Play up stripes at a skirt hem . Cut skinny and wide panels on opposite bias grains . <p> Turn it all on the cross-grain . A linear print or texture often looks quite different when turned 90 degrees . I especially love to cut a basic skirt or pant on the cross-grain to give it a unique look . <p> Build in comfort with bias . With grain , you can manipulate the way fabric drapes or stretches . By cutting the smaller side pieces of the princess-seamed jacket on the bias , I added more ease , which makes the otherwise stiff jacket comfortable to wear . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuations . <p> Small touches , big impact . You need n't use grain differences on major pattern pieces to make a major impact on your garment . Just focus on details and try cutting collar , cuff , or pockets on a different grain . <p> Piece a collar . Add a center-back seam , and cut the pieces on opposite bias grains . <p> - <p> Create a standout shirt binding and cuffs . Cut binding on the bias and cuffs on the cross-grain . <p> - <p> - <p> Most collars and cuffs are cut with the long edges on the lengthwise grain , which can be visually compelling . You can also cut them on the cross-grain to align with the rest of the garment . Or try cutting a collar on the bias , and add a center seam at the center back . The grain will then fall beautifully and draw attention to your face . <p> A favorite touch of mine is to make welt pockets but cut the welt on the bias . Bindings are another way to show off grain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armholes and edges . <p> Matter-of-fact tipsDreaming up all sorts of creative options is great fun . The next step , however , is a bit more practical : construction and fit . Here are some tricks that will help you be successful with your grainy adventures : <p> - <p> Insert playful panels . For an asymmetrical look , add a bias insert to one shoulder . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Pivot a patch pocket . Cut on the bias , it let 's the garment 's vertical stripe shine through . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Set a waistband on edge . Stripes chevron at the side seams . Contrast belt loops complete the look . <p> - <p> Test it first . One of the most vital steps in the designing-with-grain process is tissue-fitting the pattern first to check fit . To do so , just pin the pattern together and try it on . Draw your new grainlines directly on the pattern . It gives immediate feedback on the changes you envision . Adjust as necessary to make the maximum grain impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment out of muslin or other inexpensive fabric that is similar in weight and drape to your fashion fabric . This is the final step to make sure everything is going according to plan . When I cut out my muslin test garment , I mark grainlines on the right sides of each fabric piece in pencil . I also note any changes that need to be made to the pattern directly on the muslin fabric . <p> Mark new grainlines directly on the pattern pieces . After making a muslin test garment , I mark the new grainlines on my pattern pieces using my quilter 's ruler and a bright red marker . This ensures that I wo n't forget and use the original grainline . <p> Match at key points . On the muslin , you 'll also quickly identify where you need to match stripes , plaids , or texture lines . It 's virtually impossible to match stripes at every seam --and really , no one will notice if stripes do n't match under your arm . Just match up stripes or lines at key points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at side seams if possible . <p> Invest in a quilter 's ruler . When you cut on the bias , you need n't always use the 45-degree true bias . You can get interesting effects with a 30-degree bias as well . Buy a quilter 's ruler ( QuiltersRule.com ) so your cuts are exact . Most have 45-degree , 30-degree , and other angles marked , which make easy work of adjusting grainlines . <p> Adjust closures as necessary . You may need to adjust the pattern pieces to accommodate button or zipper closures . In the cream jacket , I realized that using the printed pattern as directed would cause an overlap at the center front and would ruin the line I wanted to achieve . To fix this , I cut a new pattern piece for the right front , eliminating the overlap . I also switched from using buttonholes to bias loops . This allowed me to achieve the pattern matching I desired without the distortion created from buttons and buttonholes . <p> Cut in a single layer . Always unfold your fabric and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . This may take more time , but you 'll be able to see the grain through your tissue pattern . It ensures that the grain is cut exactly as you envision and prevents layout mistakes . <p> Stabilize as necessary . Changing grain usually means troubleshooting stretch . If you decide to cut fabric on the bias , for example , but still would like a stiff , stable collar , you 'll need to compensate with a little fusible or sew-in interfacing cut on the straight grain . <p> Use larger seam allowances to accommodate bias .

Perfect machine stitches interlock smoothly and look the same on both sides of the fabric . If you see small loops on the right or wrong side , the thread tension is n't correct . <p> - <p> The red stitching is the upper thread ; the black is the bobbon thread . The tension is balanced . <p> - <h> A tension precheck <p> A number of factors can throw off thread tension besides the machine 's tension settings . Before trying to adjust the machine settings , take a look at other issues than can throw off the tension : <p> Is the sewing machine needle bent or does it have a burr on the tip ? <p> Is the needle the correct size for the fabric ? <p> Is the machine threaded properly ? Most machines have thread guides , tension disks , a tension regulator , and a bobbin case spring that controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly . Remember , most tension discs close when the presser foot is down , so be sure to thread the machine with a raised foot . A good habit is to put the spool on the machine , and pull out 18 inches of thread . Hold the thread firmly in your nonthreading hand , so you can " snap " the thread into the tension disks ( much like flossing teeth ) . - This ensures the thread is placed correctly in the tension disks . <p> Does the bobbin have the same weight of thread as on the top spool ? Is the thread good quality ? <p> Is the upper- thread catching on the thread notch or on another rough spot on the edge of the thread spool ? <p> Did you drop a metal bobbin on a hard floor ?

Be sure the bobbin thread is threaded through the bobbin spring . Holding the thread , release the bobbin case over a padded surface ( bobbin cases should not be dropped on a hard surface , as- the impact may change how they perform ) .

Not only is quick-lining simple and speedy , it also eliminates the need for interfacing ! <p> Why line , anyway ?

Good habits enhance your results , while bad habits-which may at first seem rewarding-stymie success . In this article from Threads #164 ( December ' 12/January ' 13 ) , we asked our authors to share what they considered to be good habits for a better sewing experience . <p> It 's easy to believe that developing good habits requires herculean efforts . But to replace one behavior with another , you simply need to be aware of how you sew , rather than sewing on auto-pilot . Take small steps ; change one behavior for each new project . Then , continue sewing with the new habit for every subsequent project . Repetition is the key . If you ca n't identify your bad habits easily , below are some that Threads authors have observed , along with their suggestions for better habits that will improve your sewing . <p> Balance Tension Through the Feed Dogs You Go <p> Sewers sometimes drag a garment through the needle and feed dogs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move delicate fabric through the machine without snagging . But it can have the opposite effect and create other problems . Overriding the feed dogs this way can bend or break needles , damage your sewing machine 's timing , and stretch the seam-causing a different kind of puckering . <p> To eliminate puckers the correct way , adjust your machine 's tension setting , and use the correct needle and the correct size thread . Sometimes you do need to taut-sew , but do it the right way : Exert equal pressure on the fabric in both directions ( forward and backward ) , so that the tension against the needle is neutral and so that the feed dogs can still do their job . -Judith Neukam <p> Fit as You Go <p> Waiting until a garment is complete to check the fit often results in extra work , especially if you have to rip out finished seams to correct the fit . <p> It 's very important to try on your garment at certain points during construction to check the fit and refine it . Pin-fitting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of time in the end . -Mary Ray <p> Increase Stitch Length <p> - <p> Many sewers automatically choose a short stitch length for construction seams , but a 2.5-mm-long stitch is too short for garment sewing . When tension is placed on a garment 's cloth , the thread should break ; but with a 2.5-mm stitch length , the cloth will tear around the stitches . It takes longer to sew a seam with short stitches , and they 're also hard to remove . <p> A project can fail from the outset if you do n't consider the characteristics of the fabric you intend to use when selecting a pattern . And the chances of project failure are increased if you choose a challenging design when you 're working with an unfamiliar or difficult fabric . <p> Start on the right foot : Select a fabric that is recommended for the pattern , and select an easy design if you 've chosen a challenging fabric . -Claire Shaeffer <p> Get Comfortable with Hand Sewing <p> Many sewers avoid hand sewing at all costs . But hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and can often give a superior finish to any machine-stitched seam . For example , zippers can be frustrating to install by machine , but they 're comparatively easy to install by hand . <p> Hand-basted seams hold garment sections together better than pins . Your garment fitting will be more successful , and when it 's time to machine-stitch the seam , your stitches will be more accurate , and you wo n't have to pause to remove pins . Also , hand-picked zippers are so easy to install , and they look beautiful . -Susan Khalje <p> Use the right scissors for the task-and keep them sharp ! <p> Economizing on good cutting tools will show in your work . Purchase quality scissors , and have them sharpened frequently . I own several pairs of my favorite scissors , and when one gets dull I send the dull ones for sharpening and pull out a fresh pair . Buy rotary cutter blades in bulk , and change them at the first sign of dullness . Keep an extra rotary cutter handle , and mount dulled blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many sewers pin patterns to fabric incorrectly , usually by pinning sparsely and in random spots . Or they temporarily secure patterns with too few weights and move them to cut another pattern section . With nothing holding the cut fabric to the pattern , the fabric can stretch out of shape . <p> To pin patterns to fabric , always set the pins parallel to the raw edge of the pattern , and pin within the seam allowance . This prevents the pins from marring the fashion fabric . Place pins in every corner of the pattern shape and space them every 4 inches along straight seams . Set pins closer together within tight curves . Leave the pins and pattern pieces in place until the garment pieces are ready to be sewn . -Louise Cutting <p> Leave Your Marks <p> Sewers often remove pattern pieces from cut fabric before transferring the pattern markings , intending to transfer the markings at a later time . This just makes the task more difficult when you return to the project ; garment pieces may shift and warp , and aligning edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is essential to mark all garment pieces before removing them from the cutting table and unpinning the patterns . Get it out of the way so you do n't have to fuss with it later . -Linda Lee <p> Warm Up for Better Performance <p> You would never run a road race without first stretching and warming up your muscles , nor would you sign an important document before scribbling the pen on a scrap of paper . The same goes for sewing . You need to loosen up physically to get the best results , especially with hand sewing . <p> If you are going to hand-sew , loosen up your fingers by practicing the stitches on a sample , or in a place on the garment where they wo n't show . Sample all the stitches you plan to use before sewing them on the garment . Practice makes perfect ! It will eliminate the fear of mistakes , you 'll hone your technique , and you 'll get better results . -Anna Mazur <p> Invest in Quality <p> Economizing on sewing tools and materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrade the quality of the garments you sew . Dull , damaged , or incorrect needles will ruin a good piece of fabric and wear on your sewing machine . Purchasing cheap thread is another example of false economy . <p> Remember that different needles are designed to work best on specific fabrics , and that thread holds your entire project together . Spend money on thread and needles . Buy the correct needles for each fabric you use , and use a fresh needle for every project . Purchase quality thread ; it holds your garments together better , runs through your machine more smoothly , and does n't leave residue in the tension mechanism . -Kenneth D.

One of my students has been working on a very beautiful Valentino-inspired dress " the skirt and bodice are lavender 4-ply silk , and the upper bodice ( the area that covers the shoulders and the upper chest ) is lavender Alencon lace . While the lace is reasonably strong , it still needs support from an underlining . Silk organza is the perfect choice : it 's lightweight yet firm , and nicely stable . And of course its transparency is key , and it really does need to match the skin tone of the wearer . <p> Unfortunately , bleached white and even natural white organza - both of which are easy enough to find - look milky against the skin .

@@22148985 @2148985/ <h> Understanding Underlining <p> Have you ever found a fabric that was the perfect color but too lightweight or drapey for the garment you wanted to make ? Do you avoid some pastel or white fabrics because you know the seams will show through on the right side ? Well , these are just two of a handful of everyday sewing problems that are easily solved with underlining . Read on to find out why and how to add underlining to your toolbox of everyday sewing tricks . <p> Why underline ? <p> This multipurpose technique gives you more control with fabrics and more options for their use . Underlining can : <p> Underlining vs. liningLet 's clear up one point first : lining and underlining a garment are two different procedures , and depending on their purpose , one or both can be used in a single piece of clothing . Usually cut from a slippery fabric , lining is attached only at the garment 's waistband or neck , and sometimes its hem -- otherwise , it hangs free in the garment . It 's generally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment , prevent seams from raveling , reduce wrinkling , help conceal some figure faults , and make a garment easier to slip on and off . <p> Underlining basicsThe steps for applying underlining are the same for every combination of underlining material and fashion fabric . <p> 1 . Cut fashion fabric and underlining from same pattern pieces . 2 . Pin fabric and underlining together down center only , along straight grain . 3 . To adjust for turn of cloth ( amount of space taken up by fabric 's thickness when folded ) along straight grain , place hand over pins , fold fabric over hand ( underlining 's overlap shows amount of adjustment needed for turn of cloth ) , pin fabric and underlining near adjusted edges , and baste . Average turn of cloth will be 1/8 to 1/4 in. ( or more , depending on fabric 's thickness ) . <p> Underlining , on the other hand , is cut from the same pattern pieces as the fashion fabric and is attached before construction begins . Then , as the garment is constructed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . Most often , underlining is cut from fine cotton batiste ( see Sources for underlining fabrics ) , light- to medium-weight cotton broadcloth , or silk organza . But a variety of other materials can also be used to underline a fashion fabric . <p> Jack-of-all-trades- Underlining serves many functions in a garment : It adds stability and strength to lightweight fabrics and reduces wrinkling , enabling you to use a fabric that may be too flimsy by itself for the garment you have in mind . Underlining reduces the transparency of white or pastel fabrics , which prevents seam allowances from showing through . It can eliminate the shadow from a brightly colored blouse tucked into light-colored pants , and it hides panty lines . And underlining stabilizes loosely woven fabrics and conceals hand stitching since it alone , and not the fashion fabric , catches the hand stitches . <p> One last word : interlining- Interlining refers to fabric that 's effectively an underlining whose purpose is to add warmth without bulk and which is applied either to the fashion fabric or the lining , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to fashion fabric , for example , makes a winter coat toasty warm , while cotton flannelette ( or flannel ) interlining blocks the chill in a lightweight spring jacket . <p> When interlining a fitted or semifitted garment , interline the fashion fabric , especially if it needs more body . If the garment is loosely fitted and very full , consider interlining the lining instead , which adds warmth without reducing the fluidity of the fashion fabric . <p> Changing handsThere 's almost no way to prevent underlining from changing a fabric 's hand ( its drape and feel ) and adding body that may or may not be welcome , but you can minimize the change by selecting the right underlining . The choice of a soft cotton batiste , weightier cotton broadcloth , or crisp silk organza to underline silk crepe , for example , depends on how much you want to change the silk 's basic character . The closer the hand of the underlining and fashion fabric match , the less change there 'll be . <p> To get the fashion-fabric hand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual ones . There are no rules about how this works , so the only way to know which underlining fabric to use is to experiment with the different possibilities . <p> Unusual solutions- Here 's a dilemma that may not occur every day , but when it does , an inventive underlining may be the solution , as it was for me : I had a wonderful stretch lace that I wanted to use for a dressy blouse/jacket . To eliminate but still suggest the transparency of lace and also maintain the lace 's stretch , I ended up using a stretchy , nude-color , bathing-suit lining as an underlining . Problem solved . <p> To stabilize a handwoven cotton , I underlined the yardage by fusing a suitable interfacing to it before cutting out the garment pieces . In another case , I came up with an unusual underlining to stabilize the wrong side of a knit fabric : crinkle cotton . The pleated " crinkles " added stretch to the cotton , allowing it to give with the knit . <p> When I want to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress status by adding warmth and stability to the soft , supple fabric , I use flannelette underlining . <p> And when necessary , I always consider using different underlinings in a single garment . In an underlined silk jacket , for example , flannelette might add the right amount of body and stability to the jacket 's fronts and back , but too much in the sleeves . The solution here is to use flannelette for the jacket body and batiste or lightweight broadcloth for the sleeves . <p> Sometimes underlining is n't the answer- Although an extremely useful technique , underlining ca n't always work miracles . An open-weave wool crepe , for example , needed special handling to produce a gored skirt that would cling to the body without show-through at the seams . Underlining would reduce show-through but change the crepe 's hand , while lining the skirt , even with a very lightweight rayon or silk , would hold the skirt slightly away from the body . The solution was to line the skirt with a lightweight rayon knit to reduce transparency while allowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's always tricky to underline is rayon , since even the most well-behaved rayon sags when " hung " on the body . Because this sagging is more obvious over time when the garment is underlined , I do n't underline rayon . <p> How to underlineOnce you 've experimented and found the right underlining fabric for your project , the hard part is over . To apply the underlining to your fashion fabric , begin by thoroughly preshrinking both fabrics . Cut out the underlining and fabric from the same pattern pieces , and trim the underlining along the marked hemline . Pin the underlining to the fashion fabric ; adjust for turn of cloth ( the thickness of the fashion fabric ) along the lengthwise edges ; hand-baste the pieces together ( machine basting causes the fabric to draw up slightly , creating puckers in the completed garment 's seams ; and the method of using dots of glue in the seam allowance to attach the underlining to the fashion fabric is faster but makes seam allowances stiff ) ; and baste along the centers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces are basted together , treat them as a single fabric when constructing the garment . <p> Underline to reduce transparancy and to conceal hand stitching . Tricot bathing-suit lining fabric adds a modesty factor to stretch lace ( left ) . Cotton batiste helps hide hand stitching at hemlines on soft cashmere/camel's-hair wool ( right ) . The delicate cashmere fibers would break at the hem under the fabric 's weight without the underlining to stitch into . <p> Of course , underlining adds steps to making a garment , but the small investment of time pays rich dividends by giving you more options for using your favorite fabrics . Some of my examples may differ from your own everyday sewing situations , but I hope they 'll serve to remind you to consider underlining as a solution the next time a fabric has you stumped . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 15 ) <p> MollieJ writes : I always had trouble with my clothes wrinkling . Well , no more with this technique , and this is one of the positive effects . <p> Posted : 12:57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of cloth , look at the picture on the first page . It shows that the underlining now pushes out from behind the fashion fabric by 1/8 to 1/4 inch after it 's draped over the hand .

This may seem obvious , but it 's surprising how many sewers start with the wrong size , then end up making a lot of adjustments to get a good fit . <p> Measurements are keyWhen choosing a pattern size , you need to know some basic body measurements ( see Personal measurement chart ) . I 'll tell you how to use these measurements in a moment , but first let me explain why you ca n't simply rely on your ready-to-wear size when it comes to choosing patterns . <p> Compare your measurements to those on the back of the pattern envelope . Each pattern company bases sizing on a standard set of body measurements . <p> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is not consistent and most of us fit into a wide range of sizes , depending on the designer or manufacturer . Designers frequently use what 's called vanity sizing , which adds inches to each size . What might have been a size 16 a few years ago , for example , is labeled a size 10 or 12 today . <p> Among the major pattern companies ( see Pattern companies online ) , however , sizing is based on a standard set of body measurements , which are provided on each pattern envelope and at the back of the pattern catalogs . Once you 've determined your pattern size by comparing your measurements with these standards , you can purchase that size for any of the company 's patterns . But because very few figures will match a pattern company 's standard measurements exactly , below are some guidelines for choosing a pattern size . <p> Comparing measurementsFirst if you 're unsure of which size category your body type fits into , such as misses ' , women 's , or petite , check your height and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and compare them to the measurement charts provided on the back of each pattern catalog . Then take your full-bust , high-bust , waist , and hip measurements , and compare them with the standard measurements within that figure category . <p> When you choose a blouse , dress , or jacket pattern , compare your high-bust measurement with the standard bust measurement on the chart to get the best fit in the shoulder area . It 's important to fit the shoulder area first , because this area is harder to alter on a pattern than the bust cup , waist , and hip . <p> When choosing pants and skirt patterns , compare the waist and hip measurements : Your choice will be determined by your hip measurement . If the skirt is full , use your waist measurement to select a pattern size . <p> To fit comfortably , a garment must have ease built into it : Wearing ease is the minimum amount of inches added to a pattern so that you can move in the garment , and design ease is the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ease allowances , found at the back of the pattern catalogs , may vary slightly from company to company and in some cases the ease allowed may affect the size pattern you choose . For example , if a style is loose-fitting with a large amount of ease and you prefer a closer fit , you might decide to choose a smaller size . <p> So get out a tape measure to find your correct size . In most cases , your pattern size will probably be larger than your ready-to-wear size , but when you start with the right number , fitting is so much easier . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 18 ) <p> user-5571820 writes : Older post that came up in my search for more info on pattern sizing , but I found the comments very illuminating . <p> I guess the article is pretty much what one would expect from inside the industry ... a magazine that is dependent on advertising dollars from industry suppliers is n't likely going to do a forthcoming critique on their products .

But , I wanted to get more creative with a wider variety of styles when I found myself with more time to sew . So , I started adding to my collection of patterns . <p> I have to agree with the commenters ... what happened to sizing consistency ! ? Printed pattern measurements on the envelopes are fairly standard from one company to the next , but the actual sizing inside the envelope is all over the place . I have learned to measure the pattern pieces and tissue fit before I put the first pin into the fabric .

Before my pattern is even cut , I will take my measurements , and with a pen or pencil I will draw cutting lines , dividing my plus or minus between how many pieces are along certain line ( for instance my waist is 36 " so if the pattern waist is 34 " at seam lines , and has 4 seams through the bust , I will basically add 1/2 " to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece . If the waist had 4 seams and 2 darts , I would be dividing that 2 " difference by 6 instead of 4 , and adding a third of an inch to each seam and dart ( divide that 1/3rd of an inch by two - small fractions I know , which is why I usually measure in centimetres rather than inhes . But you can eyeball it pretty well ) . My point is , adjust the paper pattern before you cut it out . Posted : 8:57 am on December 29th <p> Darklldo writes : I agree with everyone here .

If they fall in different sizes , keep in mind that the bust measurement is the hardest to alter , so choose what 's closest to your measurement .

@@22148989 @2148989/ <h> Sewing In a Zipper <p> At one time or another , every sewer will probably need to insert a zipper into a garment , and with a little bit of preparation , you 'll be able to do it easily with great results . I 'll show you how to sew in a standard zipper , using both the centered and lapped methods , as well as how to insert the popular invisible zipper that " disappears " into the garment seam . But first , here are some helpful tips regardless of the type of zipper or insertion method you choose . <p> Both standard and invisible zippers come in a variety of lengths . I suggest starting with a zipper that 's slightly longer than the zipper opening on your garment , especially when working with a standard centered or lapped application ( it 's usually easier to shorten a zipper than it is to insert it precisely into a given space ) . For example , if your garment has a waistband , insert a longer-than-needed zipper that extends beyond the waistline seam , stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you attach the waistband . You can cut a zipper at the bottom to shorten it as well ; just be sure to add a new zipper stop by whipstitching over the teeth at the bottom of the zipper , then cutting it 1/2 in. to 1 in. below this new stop . Do n't miss other sewing tips and techniques like this by ordering a subscription of Threads magazine . Print subscriptions come with FREE access to our tablet editions . <p> Interface the zipper areaBefore inserting a zipper , it 's a good idea to add a strip of interfacing along the seam allowance , especially when using a lightweight or unstable fabric , to help support the zipper 's weight and stabilize the fabric . I use a strip of lightweight , fusible interfacing that 's about 1 in. wide and the length of the zipper opening . Fuse the interfacing strip to the zipper-opening seam allowances , extending over the seamline about 3/8 in . For a crisp opening edge , interface only the seam allowances . <p> Machine-baste the zipper tape to both seam allowances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - <p> Draw a chalk guideline on the fabric 3/8 in. from the seamline and topstitch the zipper in place , starting at the bottom and stitching to the top on each side . <p> The centered zipperSew the garment seam , machine-baste the zipper opening 's seam allowances together , and press the seam open . Use a two-step process for this method , machine-basting the zipper tape to the seam allow-ances first , then topstitching the zipper in place from the right side of the garment . For best results , and to avoid rippled edges , topstitch directionally from bottom to top on each side through all thicknesses . Use your machine 's zipper foot , which allows you to stitch close to the zipper teeth , and remove the seamline basting stitches once the zipper is inserted . <p> The lapped zipperSew the garment seam using 5/8-inch seam allowances , basting the zipper opening , and press the seam allowances open . From the wrong side of the garment , place the closed zipper face down over the seam allowances , aligning the right tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipper tape to the seam allowance only , using a 1/4-inch seam allowance , and taking care not to catch fabric from the garment body . Flip the zipper over so it 's right-side up . Sew the unstitched side of the zipper to the remaining seam allowance by stitching directly over the seam basting , or as close as possible to it . Unfold the fabric so the garment is right side up . To topstitch the lap , sew across the bottom of zipper first , pivot and stitch 3/8 inch from the seamline to the top of the zipper . Remove the basting stitches from the seamline . <p> Sew the garment seam , baste the opening seam allowances together , and press them open . Place the closed zipper face down over the seam allowance and align the right tape edge to the right seam allowance edge and sew the two together using a 1/4-inch seam allowance .

Use an invisible zipper foot ( available from your local fabric store or Clotilde , 800-772-2891 ; www.clotilde.com ) that let 's you sew extremely close to the zipper coils , making them invisible from the right side . <p> Insert this zipper before sewing the garment seam .

Stitch as far as the zipper stop will allow you to stitch . <p> Positioning this zipper might be confusing at first . Just remember to always keep the zipper and the garment right sides together with the zipper coils along the seamlines . And position the zipper foot for each side of the zipper so the needle clears the center hole and the coils glide under the groove . <p> Sew the left side of the zipper to the right garment section , top to bottom , until you get to the zipper stop . Align the remaining tape to the left side of the garment and sew in place . Then complete the garment seam . <p> Keep in mind that you can not stitch the seam so it connects smoothly to the zipper stitching without leaving a gap .

By the time I get to that point in construction , I 'm ready to put on my new jacket and sashay out the door . However , I 've found that lining a jacket need not be difficult or time-consuming if it 's inserted with the bagging method , often used by ready-to-wear manufacturers . I arrived at this conclusion after trying all the alternatives , including sewing a lining to a jacket by hand and not lining it at all . The bagging technique eliminates almost all handwork , with the major lining edges joined to the jacket by machine . Although bagging is standard in the industry , I 've tweaked the procedure for the home sewer , and streamlined the steps so you wo n't think twice about inserting a lining . You 'll get great results every time . <p> Sew lining and jacket as usual , with these two exceptions : 1 . On lining , leave opening in one side seam . Machine-baste opening closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baste 1/4 in. from fold . Steam- press lightly . <p> Sew lining to jacket 's front edges and hem <p> 1 . Starting at crease formed by hem fold , and with jacket on top , pin , then sew , jacket to lining along front and neck edges to opposite hem crease. 2 . To sew hem , align serged edges and stitch . <p> Turn Jacket right side out <p> 1 . After removing basting stitches in lining 's side seam , reach through opening , grab back neck area of jacket , pull jacket right side out through opening . 2 . Push up lining at hemline , stitch hem with running stitch , using thread that exactly matches jacket 's color and taking small bites into jacket about 1/4 in. apart . 3 . Slipstitch unsewn bottom of facing . <p> Stitch opening closed <p> Make invisible stitches by starting a stitch directly across from previous stitch , push needle along inside of crease , emerge same side , stitch across . Pull up stitches . <p> Prepare to bag All jackets benefit from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other clothes , drape correctly on the body , and stand up to wear and tear . Any jacket pattern , whether it includes a lining or not , can be used to make a bagged lining . <p> If you 're using a pattern without a lining , it 's easy to make a lining pattern . Keep in mind that the bagging process wo n't work without a back neck facing , which is also a cinch to make a pattern for , as shown in the same drawings . And if you 're one of those people who always needs to shorten or lengthen a jacket 's sleeves or body , alter your pattern before cutting it out , because it 's easier to work with a pattern that has the correct hem and sleeve lengths . <p> The bagging procedure begins only after the jacket and lining have been constructed , but there are a few details to attend to before construction . The first step is to serge-finish the seam allowances of both the jacket and lining hems , side seams , sleeve hems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aligning raw edges is much easier to do when they 're serge-finished , and results in more accurate stitching lines . You wo n't see these seam allowances after the jacket is lined , but you 'll know they 're not raveling during wear ( which many fabrics tend to do ) . I do n't serge the neck edges or armscyes , as they 're mostly cut on the bias and do n't ravel . <p> Since the jacket 's seam allowances will be pressed open , do n't serge any two seam allowances together , as you might be tempted to do , for example , on the center-back seam . If you do n't have a serger , do n't zigzag the edges , as this stitch tends to make the fabric fray more rather than less . Instead , cut cleanly and sew as accurately as possible . <p> Now , construct the jacket , including setting in the sleeves and collar , following the pattern instructions up to hemming and inserting the lining . Attach the sleeve heads and shoulder pads , too . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even and the sleeve lengths are correct . <p> The next step is to create a temporary hem on the jacket . Hand-baste both the entire jacket hem and the sleeve hems 1/4 in. up from the hem 's fold and lightly steam-press the folds . This step will save you time and hassle when sewing the hem in place later on . And , as you 'll see , the hem crease will serve as a stitching guide . <p> Leave an opening in one lining seamComplete the lining , including setting in the sleeves . Lining seams can be serged together in a single pass on the machine , except for one side seam that needs to have an opening through which you 'll turn the jacket right side out later . If your jacket pattern has an underarm side panel , make the opening in the seam that connects the panel to the back . This designated seam needs to be sewn conventionally , so that the seam allowances can be pressed open . The creases of these seam allowances will serve to guide the little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After sewing and pressing all the lining seams , sew the jacket facing to the lining , as per the pattern 's instructions , but leave unsewn the bottom 3 in. of the facing hems . <p> Prepare to sew lining to jacketAt this point you 'll have an assembled lining and a complete jacket shell , which are ready to be joined completely by machine . But first , at each end of the jacket hem , pull out the basting stitches for the depth of the facings , so you can sew the lining 's facing to the jacket 's front . <p> Make a back-facing pattern <p> - <p> If jacket pattern does n't include back facing , which you need for the bagging process to work , align pattern pieces at shoulders . Trace back neck edge and extend front facing to around back . <p> Now , take the time for this next important step : Compare the width of the lining at the hem to the width of the jacket . If they do n't match exactly at the side seams and front edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the lining is too small or taking it in if it 's too large . This precaution eliminates the need to ease a lining that 's too big ( which causes the lining to ripple ) or the opposite problem , to stretch a lining that 's too small to fit the jacket ( which causes the jacket hem to pucker ) . Repeat this step for the sleeves . If your lining and jacket widths are unequal , make sure to cut out the pattern for your next jacket accurately , and sew exactly on the stitching lines . The day I learned these lessons , the quality of my finished garment improved tremendously . <p> Join lining to jacketReady to sew nonstop ? Rev up your machine , and sew the lining to the jacket front and neck edges in one continuous seam . Next , sew the jacket and lining bottom edges together . Here 's the payoff for premeasuring the lining and jacket widths--sewing the hem is a breeze . Keeping right sides together , flip the jacket 's basted hem open , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serged edge of the jacket 's hem to the lining 's serged hem , matching all of the lining 's side seams to the jacket 's corresponding side seams . <p> Pin the entire hemline , and then stitch the two together just inside the serged stitching . Take care not to stretch the pinned fabrics . That 's it ! Now turn the jacket and sew the hem in place . <p> Sleeve hems by machine The last major step is to sew the sleeve lining hems to the jacket 's sleeve hems . You 'll be grateful here that you made the lining widths match those of the jacket . Shove the sleeve lining down the jacket 's sleeve and unfold the hem down and out of the sleeve , then follow the steps shown in the photos above . As was done on the jacket hem , use a running stitch to securely tack the hem of the jacket 's sleeve , remove the basting stitches , and repeat the procedure for the other sleeve . <p> All that remains is to hand-stitch the lining 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lining color , hand-sew with a ladder stitch back and forth between the pressed seamline creases . The seam will be invisible and look like a regular machine-sewn seam . <p> Sew the sleeve hem to the lining <p> With jacket and lining right side out , push sleeve lining down jacket sleeve . Then use one pin to secure jacket sleeve seam to corresponding lining seam . <p> - <p> Turn sleeves wrong side out through side seam opening . <p> Pull sleeves apart , so they 're facing each other , joined by the one pin . <p> - <p> Remove pin , roll lining so wrong side is out and repin . Line up raw edges of jacket and lining sleeve hems , then stitch close to serged edges . Turn back through opening right side out , and press . <p> Now sashay out the door in your newly lined jacket , knowing that you 'd still be sewing it had you not used the bagging method . Might as well head to the fabric store for material to make the next one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to line a jacket .

The good news is that you can easily drape your own skirt and solve this problem . The skirt-draping process starts where the difficulties emanate-with the " hang " of a skirt at the top , which , of course , is your waist , tummy , and hip . I 'll show you how . <p> A skirt is the simplest garment to drape . You 'll need a sewing friend , 3 to 4 yards of light- to medium-weight muslin fabric , and your ability to stand for about 60 minutes . <p> - <p> Fabric held at the waist and falling from the hip is on its way to becoming a skirt . <p> Trade off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes you would with a skirt and your best-fitting foundation garment . The shoes ensure the same posture that you 'll have when you 're dressed in finished garments . <p> If you have a dress form you 've made or bought that matches your size and shape perfectly , you can drape that for an accurate fit as well . But be aware that a dummy may need a slight layer of padding first so you can build in some breathing room ; otherwise , the resulting pattern may be too tight . <p> In the end , you 'll have a basic skirt sloper that can serve as groundwork to design other skirts . This sloper can lead you to A-line , gored , flared , or any other skirt style pattern . And , every skirt you design from this sloper automatically fits and hangs beautifully . <p> Prepare the muslin for the skirt frontWhen you prepare muslin fabric for draping , it is important to cut the fabric straight on the lengthwise grain and keep the waist and hem edges square . Press and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out the size to cut your muslin . <p> Place a pin or otherwise mark a side seam position on your clothes or body so you 're sure to measure to the same side seam location . Measure across your fullest horizontal circumference-either the hip or tummy-from center front to side seam marker . Add 2 to 3 inches to this measurement for ease and seam allowances . Multiply the total by two to establish the width to cut your muslin fabric skirt front . Cut the muslin piece 5 to 6 inches longer than your desired skirt length . Along the lengthwise grain of the fabric , identify and mark the center grainline with a felt pen . <p> Prepare the muslin for the skirt backThe skirt will have a center-back seam , so plan to cut two pieces of fabric after taking and adjusting these measurements : <p> Measure across the fullest part of your hip from center back to side seam just as you did for the skirt front . Add 3 to 4 inches to this measurement for ease , plus 1 inch for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , with each the width calculated above and the same length as the front piece you cut earlier . <p> Baste seams and try on the skirt <p> - <p> We used a plus-size mannequin ( below ) because it has more curves than the plus-size dress form shown above . The mannequin 's hourglass shape serves as a better model for forming darts . <p> Machine-baste the front to the backs along the side seams . Baste the centerback seam , leaving 12 inches open at the top . <p> 1 . Tie narrow elastic comfortably around the waist . Then , with the seam allowances to the outside , pull on the skirt muslin and tuck it under the elastic . 2 . Arrange the fabric with the center-front and center-back lines aligned on your body . Throughout the draping , keep the center lines positioned properly on the body and perpendicular to the floor . 3 . Now stand straight with your weight shared equally on both feet while your sewing friend adjusts the skirt until it hangs evenly . Begin adjusting from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Move the skirt up and down under the elastic until the side seams and the center-front and center-back seams hang perpendicular to the floor . 4 . Once all vertical lines are hanging correctly , make sure the hem is parallel to the floor . Adjust as necessary . 5 . You may notice the fabric above the waist elastic is not even-that 's okay . What 's important is that everything below the waist hangs smoothly and evenly . <p> Baste seams and try on the skirt <p> Smooth wrinkles into darts <p> 1 . When you are satisfied that the skirt hangs perfectly , pin the darts . Lift the waist elastic and pinch out the excess fabric that forms between the hip and the waist . Smooth the fabric across the tummy and hip level . You want the fabric to drape smoothly from the most prominent point of the figure . Typically , I position one dart below the bust point on the front or shoulder blade on the back , then another halfway between the side seam and the first dart . Allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curvaceous figures need more darts than straighter figures . 2 . When pinning each dart , let a 1/4-inch space float between the skirt and body for ease . Keep the dart points above the fullest part of the tummy or hip . 3 . Continue pinning the darts all the way around the skirt . As you work , make sure the skirt remains straight and smooth with side seams perpendicular and the hem parallel to the floor . <p> Smooth wrinkles into darts <p> Tip : Quick way to guesstimate dart amount <p> You can guesstimate the amount of dart control you 'll need in each skirt quadrant by pinching out one large temporary dart right down the center front and center back . The depth of the flap is the approximate amount you 'll pinch out on each side of the center line-divided by however many darts work best for your shape . <p> Shape the side and back seamsAlong the side seam , outline the hip curve with pins , leaving 1/2 to 1 inch of ease on each side . The ease amount is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fuller hip and tummy needs more ease . Remember that you must have enough room to sit without straining seams or creating tight stretch lines . <p> If there is a dip in the back at the center-back seam , you can pin that in as well to shape the seam to an accurate contour of your body . <p> Shape the side seams <p> Mark seams and darts on your muslinIf you have an asymmetrical figure , creating a separate pattern for the right and left sides of the body can be a benefit . However , if your figure is reasonably symmetrical , one side of the muslin is all you need to make a conventional pattern that is cut on the fold of a double layer of fabric . <p> 1 . Mark the hipline and the kneeline at the side seam . 2 . Dot marks around the waist using the elastic as your guide . I like to mark above the elastic . 3 . Using the pins as your guide , mark the darts and seamlines and add the notches . <p> Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a paper patternRemove the muslin . Double-check that all pins have been marked using a felt pen . Remove the pins . An old piece of foamcore under your pattern paper makes recording your marks safe and easy . You wo n't have to worry about marking your table . <p> 1 . Smooth the muslin and square the edges . Use an awl and pin tracing wheel to punch the key points into the paper right through the fabric . 2 . Begin with the center-front and center-back lines . These lines will be your straight-of-grain references . After you 've traced all lines , lift the muslin from the paper . 3 . Use a ruler , L-square , and curve to connect the punched " dots " to finish your pattern . Remember , your sloper does not include seam allowances . Expect to see uneven punched lines . These wo n't provide a good pattern and must be straightened . <p> Convert the fabric to a paper pattern <p> Square corners and even linesBeginning at the center front , draw a straight line connecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Draw the grainline on the skirt front and skirt back parallel to the center lines and perpendicular to the hemline . <p> Tip : Get squareIn finalizing the pattern , use an L-square extensively . Look for L-squares and other patternmaking tools at tailoring-supply outlets or at the bookstores of colleges and universities that teach patternmaking . An alternative to an L-square is a quilting ruler . <p> Finish the patternTo finish the waistline edge , shape the darts by bringing the dart legs together and folding the dart as you would if sewing . Then fold the dart toward the center front . Cut the pattern along the waistline , following the curve of the waist to give your dart the correct shaping at the waistline edge . Remember , there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces with your name , date , waist , and hip measurements . <p> When your sloper pattern does n't look rightWhen you look at the completed flat pattern , it 's interesting to see how your figure emerges . It may not look like the typical commercial pattern for the socalled perfect figure . Do n't be surprised to see your curves sitting higher or lower than the standard . Notice how your waistline is shaped . It 's common to see dipping from back to front and your darts may resemble the shape of a wine glass rather than a straight wedge . All of these nuances in shaping guarantee a finer fit and result in a satisfying sewing experience for you .

Choosing the best method depends on the fabric used and the function of the garment . Finishes can range from beautifully bound seams that make a jacket look as good on the inside as on the outside , to a quick pass with a serger that can trim and bind with thread both seam allowances at the same time . There 's a place for each and everything in between . Seam finishes do n't have to be complicated . They simply have to do the job and , in most cases , the less you do the better . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic finishes " pinking and zigzagging " that are often overlooked or trumped by more elaborate options . <p> Pinking is an easy , clean way to deal with seam allowances on stable , tightly woven fabrics . I especially like to pink seams when using crisp , smooth fabrics like taffeta , for example , because there 's no added bulk from thread or binding and the saw-tooth edge creates less of a " ridge " on the right side when the garment is pressed . With less stable fabrics you can add a row of straight stitches on the seam allowance only for extra security . <p> To pink a seam effectively and painlessly , trim away each seam allowance separately on the very edge taking off just a tiny strip of triangles at the most . This will keep the edges straight and even with less stress on your hand because the shears seem to work better when used just along the edge . For the most painless method , try a pinking blade on your rotary cutter . You can easily cut along the very edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cut along the very edge of the seam allowance with pinking shears . <p> When pinking , take off just a tiny scrap . <p> A rotary cutter equipped with a pinking or scallop blade works great with less stress on your hand . <p> A zigzag stitch is a good alternative if you do n't own a serger or if you just do n't want to rethread for a small project . But , in some cases it 's the better choice because it binds the edge to prevent raveling , but does n't add a lot of thread in the process . <p> To be effective , the zigzag finish needs to be done on the very edge of the fabric as well . Stitch so that the outside points of the zigzag are off of the fabric.I generally use a 3mm stitch width and a 2 mm stitch length , but always test the stitches on a scrap of fabric and adjust accordingly . <p> Sew along the very edge of the fabric so the stitch binds the edge . <p> And remember -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever method you choose , because you ca n't finish a seam completely if you've- crossed it with another seam . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 13 ) <p> HeimMade writes : What is the best way to finish a zipper seam when the rest of the garment has finished French Seams ?

@@22148999 @2148999/ <p> For some people , the idea of sewing silk fabrics is terrifying . Certain silks are more challenging than others , but there is nothing more rewarding than sewing an exquisite garment , using the best fabric and the finest finishing . <p> Before you begin , there are a few things to keep in mind while sewing silks . A simple way to ensure good stitch quality is to adjust the stitch length . For silks , shorten the stitch length to 2mm ; you 'll have fewer puckers . As you sew , hold the fabric both in front of and behind the needle to give the fabric a little tension . Do n't pull the fabric through the machine-just lightly guide it . <p> After you sew any seam , press it flat to meld the stitches before you proceed to the next step . <p> Honing your skills when sewing silk is all about using the right sewing aids and choosing the right techniques for stitching . It 's the difference between homemade and professional . <p> In the photo at left , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update with silk pieced insertions . The pattern is available at SewingWorkshop.com . <p> Fabrics of different weights fabric need different types of seam finishes . <p> - <p> Sewing aids <p> Here are a few extra items that are useful to have on hand when sewing silk . <p> Single-hole throat plate . If the fabric tends to get drawn into the throatplate needle hole , switch to a throat plate with a single small opening . Of course , you ca n't sew a zigzag stitch with this type of throat plate . <p> Fusible web tape . Many silk fabrics tend to slip and slide , so try a product that binds the fabric together before you sew it . Fuse a strip of fusible tape to one side of the fabric , and remove the paper backing to expose a sticky strip that you can fuse to another piece of fabric . This holds the fabric in place for stitching . <p> Pins and needles . I prefer to use IB C glass-head silk pins . Be sure to change your pins often.Start each project with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of the fabric . A universal needle , size 70/10 , is a good starting point . <p> Thread . The right needle and thread combination is essential . I prefer 100-percent-silk thread . The next best choice is pure cotton . Polyester threads tend to pucker . For lightweight and sheer silks , choose a lighter thread , or use a two-ply machine-embroidery cotton thread . <p> Trimming tools . My favorite scissors are Gingher no. 5 . Some silk fabrics are so slippery that you ca n't get a good hold on them-no matter how nice your scissors are . A bird and clamp tool is a device with a clamp on one end that attaches to the edge of a table and another end that pinches the fabric to hold it taut while you are trimming . They are attached to each other with a string and act as a third hand to help you hold your fabric steady . <p> Seam finishesChoosing the right seam finish for silk fabrics takes some experimentation . First , consider the type of silk and the style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is a casual garment , try a quick method that prevents raveling but is n't necessarily couture-looking on the inside . If you have a higher-quality fabric for a more formal garment , try the more polished techniques such as French or Hong Kong seams . Regardless the situation , making seam samples on the fabric that you plan to use will save you time in the long run . <p> French seam . The French seam is a couture seam finish used in high-end clothing and is one of the most beautiful seams for any type of fabric-not just silks . It completely conceals raw edges and is sometimes used on the outside of garments . Since it ultimately has many layers , it is best used with lightweight and sheer silks such as three-ply or four-ply silk or silk crepe , crepe de Chine , charmeuse , chiffon , and georgette . <p> With wrong sides together , sew a 3/8-inch seam . <p> To make a French seam , start by pinning the fabric with the wrong sides together .

Press the seam allowance to one side . This step helps you get a good , crisp edge in the next step . <p> Now , with right sides together , fold the fabric along the seamline over the raw edges and manipulate the fabric between your fingers to bring the well of the seam to the very edge . <p> Fold the fabric with right sides together over the previous seam ( above ) .

This seam is a nice finish to use with sheer chiffons and georgettes-even garments with multiple layers of chiffon . The zigzag stitch allows the fabric to relax and not draw up , which is necessary on bias seams . While this method seems unfinished to persnickety sewers , it is used quite often in expensive designer clothing . <p> To sew a double zigzag seam , first set your sewing machine to a zigzag stitch that is 1.5mm long and 1.5mm wide . You may need to experiment with your stitch settings to get a perfectly flat stitch on this type of fabric . Sew this seam with a 5/8-inch seam allowance . <p> Reset your machine to a wider and longer zigzag stitch-a 2.5mm length and 2.5mm width . Sew a line of stitching right next to the first line inside the seam allowance . <p> Trim close to the stitching . <p> Trim the seam right next to the second row of zigzag stitches . Use the bird clamp for extra support if the fabric is very slinky . That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravel . <p> Turned and stitched . The turned and stitched finish is best used with opaque fabrics such as silk broadcloth , crepe de Chine , charmeuse , and silk crepes . It is used in designer clothing as well as in mid-priced lines . It works on straightcut , bias-cut , and curved seams . <p> Turn under the seam allowance 1/4 inch , and stitch close to the fold . <p> - <p> Row edges are hidden under the seam allowance . <p> Sew your standard seam first with a 5/8-inch seam allowance , and press it open . Then turn under the seam allowance 1/4 inch and edgestitch close to the fold along each side . Be careful to stitch only along the seam allowance and not on the actual garment . Use an edgestitch presser foot to keep the stitches an even distance from the fold .

This is quite an eye-catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bind the edges in an unlined or underlined garment . It 's also an effective seam finish when using a fabric that frays easily . This finish works best on stable silks such as raw silk , matka , silk noil , brocade , damask , and silk tweeds . China silk or other very lightweight silks , even dupioni , are good choices for the wrapped edgings . Double-fold bias tape can also be used . <p> Sew a 5/8-inch seam allowance ( or any seam-allowance width of your choice ) , and press the seam open . Wider seam allowances in this finish are handsome , but plan ahead to allow for them . <p> Next , cut 1-inch-wide bias strips of fabric for the binding . Align the strip with one seam allowance raw edge , and sew a 1/4-inch seam allowance . For precision edges , try a special presser foot designed for sewing 1/4-inch seam allowances . <p> Wrap the strip to the underside of the seam allowance , and pin it in place . Stitch-in-the ditch along the strip seam to finish. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silks , your sewing machine should be in tip-top shape .

" <p> Stitched and pinked . In an effort to clean up all edges , there are times when less is actually the best . Some silk fabrics-such as four-ply silk-are too spongy ( especially the washed variety ) , causing many seam finishes to be too thick or lumpy .

Serging is definitely an option for casual garments as well as those that will be laundered frequently and need a durable finish . It is also suitable for unlined garments . <p> I recommend serging ( aka " overcasting " ) the raw edges of the fabric before sewing the seam .

But put the wrong needle in your machine , or use the wrong needle for your fabric and/or thread , and all heck breaks loose . You can damage your bobbin hook , throw off the machine 's timing , get puckered seams , break or shred thread , punch holes in your fabric , and , at the very least , produce an inferior stitch . Whatever your machine , even the latest computerized model , needle selection can make or break your stitch . <p> At one time , only one type of machine needle was available to home sewers , and the sole choice involved was size . But today , home sewers can choose from a wide variety of needle types in their quest for trouble-free sewing . <p> Several things can determine the type of needle to pick : the fabric you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic or embroidery ) ; or the type of stitch you plan ( for instance , topstitching or hemstitching ) . When you 're doing regular , not decorative , sewing , the type of fabric determines the shape of the needle 's point , and the fabric 's weight determines the needles ' size. - But before deciding on a needle , you first need to know the needle system your machine uses . Unlike commercial machines , which use a variety of needle systems , almost all home-sewing machines use a 130/705H needle system -- designated on the needle case between the needle 's name and size ( other letters indicate needle type , such as M for Microtex or Q for quilting ) . Your machine 's needle system never changes , regardless of the size or type of needle you use . <p> Tension control , stitch length , foot pressure , and other invisible settings on automatic machines are set for medium-weight fabrics , threads , and needles . If you 're a middle-of-the-road sewer , using midweight , woven fabrics , you could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your life . But when you want improved stitch quality , learn which specific needles to use for various jobs . See the box below to understand the build of this tiny , but important tool. - - <p> Anatomy of a needle <p> The key features of a standard machine needle are called out below . Their configuration varies from needle type to type . <p> ShankTop of needle that inserts into machine ; most often has round front and flat back , which seats needle in right position . <p> Front grooveSlit above needle eye , should be large enough to " cradle " thread for smooth stitches . <p> PointNeedle tip that penetrates fabric to pass thread to bobbin-hook and form stitch .

A shorter scarf requires a more perfectly timed machine . <p> EyeHole in end of needle through which thread passes . Needle size and type determine size and shape of eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handSewing-machine manufacturers want their machines to consistently produce a perfect stitch . So the needle 's configuration is engineered to manage thread and fabric to reduce the likelihood of skipped or flawed stitches . Each needle type produces a stitch by using a uniquely designed groove , scarf , eye , and/or point to enable the needle and bobbin hook to meet perfectly ( see the box below ) . For a description of their uses , configuration , and how to troubleshoot them , see Sewing-Machine Needles : An Overview . <p> How a stitch is formed <p> The formation of a stitch begins when the needle penetrates the fabric and descends to its lowest point . <p> The bobbin hook then slides by the needle 's scarf , catching the upper thread , and carries it around the bobbin and bobbin thread . <p> The thread is then pulled up into the fabric , completing the stitch . <p> Choose regular needle size by fabric weightWhen selecting a needle for regular sewing , start with needle size . European needles range in size from 60 to 120 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the eye . American needles are sized from 8 to 19 in an arbitrary numbering system , and paired with corresponding European sizes : for example , 60/8 or 70/10 ; the larger the number , the larger the needle . <p> Determine needle size by fabric weight . Choose a size 60/8 needle for lightweight fabrics similar to georgette or organdy ; a 70/10 or 80/12 needle for medium-weight jersey , Lycra , linen , or calf leather ; a 90/14 and 100/16 for heavy fabrics like jeans , vinyl , upholstery or canvas ; and 110/18 or 120/19 for very heavy fabrics .

@@22149001 @2149001/ <p> As a bridal and eveningwear designer , I often use scallops to add a graceful finish to special-occasion garments . I 've also long seen scallops in couture collections and have recently noticed them in all sorts of ready-to-wear from casual to dressy . <p> Scallops add an elegant , graphic line to a garment , and they are a fabulous finish not only for hemlines but also for necklines and front edges of a garment . <p> I want to explore with you some of the options for successfully adding scallops to a garment and also help you with the logistics of calculating size , marking , facing , and stitching scallops . But first , let 's talk about fabric choices . <p> Fabric considerationsScallops are most effective worked in fabrics that will curve smoothly along well-defined edges and clearly show the apex of two scallops , or angle where they meet . Firmly woven natural-fiber fabrics like cotton , linen , wool crepe , silk shantung , and silk dupioni are excellent choices . Wool crepe and dupioni were paired for the skirt at left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satins , moires , jacquards , and piques may produce less effective results . Because scallops require a lot of meticulous clipping , manipulating , and pressing ( more about that later ) , always test your fabric before cutting out to be sure it will cooperate . The results will be better and the sewing much easier . <p> These sketches offer ideas for using this detail on vertical and horizontal edges . <p> For scallops that are fun and easy to make , consider fabrics that can be cut without fraying and , therefore , do n't have to be faced or finished . For example , edge a plastic-coated canvas raincoat with small , neat , cleanly cut scallops ( see the skethces above ) . Or create an evening skirt with an ethereal effect using layer upon layer of scalloped tulle . In either case , carefully cut the scallops with your sharpest scissors , and always cut from the curve toward the apex . You 'll need to change direction frequently as you cut , but this is the only way to get a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too large because they may have a tendency to droop , unless , of course , they 're at the hemline of a skirt where they have gravity in their favor . <p> Approximate the size and placement <p> - <p> - <p> Plan the placement and proportion of a scalloped edge on a muslin of the garment , roughly sketching the scalloped edge in place . <p> - <p> Begin planning a scalloped edge by making a muslin of the garment and roughly sketching an approximation of the scallops on it ( no serious measuring yet ) . Because there 's a lot of drawing , adjusting , and redrawing the scallops at this stage , a muslin is the perfect laboratory for experimentation . ( You can also work with the pattern itself for this step , but copy it onto pattern paper so you have a full front and back to work with . ) <p> As you plan the scallops on the muslin , keep their overall size in proportion to the garment-not too small or too large nor too shallow or too deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uneven edge . If they 're too deep , they might look like flaps . Because each garment is different , this experimentation on the muslin is a trial-and-error process . <p> In terms of the number of scallops on an edge , I think an odd number-five scallops across the front of a skirt hem , for example-usually produces a more visually pleasing design than an even number . Using an odd number places the deepest part of the scallop 's curve , instead of its apex , at the center of the skirt , which is also more visually pleasing . When scallops are placed along the hemline of a skirt , the bottom of the curve is technically the longest part of the skirt . However , the skirt will often appear shorter because of the areas of the scallops that are cut away . This may not matter in the slightest , but it 's worth noting and considering when designing a scalloped garment . <p> After I draw on , pin , manipulate , and cut the muslin-doing whatever it takes to plan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mirror . Sometimes I even leave it alone for a day or so and check my reaction when I see it again to be sure I 'm pleased with the proportions and placement of the scallops . When I 'm satisfied , I move on to more precise drawing . <p> Get out the rulerHere comes the math part ! But do n't run away ; calculating scallops is not that complicated if you follow these tips . <p> - <p> Calculate the final dimensions of the scallops along the baseline on the muslin that parallels the garment 's edge and runs through the apex of each scallop. - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Refine the curves of the scallops using a round object , such as a coffee can lid or a saucer . <p> - <p> Once the general size and spacing of the scallops is set , you need to accurately calculate the dimensions so the scallops will fit into the allotted space on your pattern . Continuing to work with the muslin , draw a baseline on it from which to calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line connects the apexes . If the scallops are along the bottom of a skirt , the baseline parallels the hemline . If the scallops finish a curved edge , the baseline will curve to echo the garment 's edge . Keep in mind that if the baseline falls inside the garment 's original curved edge ( for example , along the front edge of a bolero jacket ) , some of the original jacket will be cut away when the scallops are formed . This may or may not matter , but be aware of it . <p> Measure the baseline carefully to determine its length . I calculate the spacing in centimeters , using the reverse side of my tape measure , so I do n't have to deal with tiny fractions of inches . For example , dividing 28-3/8 in. into nine scallops is a challenge , but this same distance equals 72cm , which divided by nine is a simple 8cm per scallop . You may need to make minor adjustments to the dimensions of your garment to make your calculations easier . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space 10 scallops along the edge , adjust the original measurement to 50 in . In this case , the calculation and adjustment are so obvious in inches that you do n't need to bother converting to centimeters . When all the calculations are set , refine the curves of the scallops using a compass , saucer , small plate , or even a mug as a guide to redraw them on the muslin . <p> Make a template for easier marking <p> - <p> Make a manila-folder template , and transfer the scallop marks to it using a tracing wheel . Use this firm template to transfer the markings to the fashion fabric . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Transfer the scallops to the fabric using tracing paper and a wheel . Trace carefully around the template so the markings do n't show on the right side of the garment . <p> - <p> A template is the easiest and most accurate way to transfer the scallops to your fabric ( I 'll tell you more about marking in a moment ) . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tissue-paper pattern , but using a template is so much easier . Old manila folders make great templates because they 're sturdy , easy to cut , and can be pieced together to accommodate any length . Use a tracing wheel to transfer the scallops to the folder . You do n't need tracing paper because the spikes of the wheel will perforate the folder 's heavy paper . Cut out carefully along the perforations . The cut edge is the stitching line , and you do n't need to add a seam allowance on the template . <p> Freezer paper also works well for making templates . You can iron the freezer paper directly onto the wrong side of your fabric using a cool temperature ; then use the cut edge as your stitching guide with no further marking . <p> What about facings ? Scalloped edges can be bound , but the binding will crease at the apex of the scallop . And narrowly hemming scallops is difficult , to say the least . So the best way to clean-finish a scalloped edge ( short of clean-cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a facing-either a partial facing or a full facing , which serves the dual purpose of a lining . <p> For a partial facing , make a pattern using your template as a guide . The depth of the facing should be enough to clear the apex by at least 1 in. , but not so wide that it droops . Be sure to mark a grainline on this pattern that corresponds with the grainline on your garment pattern , because if the two are not cut on the same grain , the scalloped edge could pull and be difficult to press . <p> Cut the facing from your fashion fabric , or use a compatible fabric with the same care requirements . The fabric you choose for the facing can work to enhance the look of the finished garment . For example , if you want a firm finish on your scalloped edge , use silk organza or a crisp cotton ; for a softer finish , use China silk . Whichever fabric you choose , be sure to preshrink it . Finish the straight edge of the facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-overcasting , or serging , whichever is least visible through the fashion fabric . <p> Full facings are the best finishing solution in many cases because they eliminate the need for hemming a partial facing and hand-stitching that in place . Lightweight fabrics can be self-faced or a compatible , lightweight facing can be used when the fashion fabric is heavy . Be sure to align all edges perfectly when sewing a full facing to the garment so that the facing/ lining does n't bag . <p> When you 've determined the type of facing to use , transfer the scalloped stitching-line markings to the wrong side of the facing or to the wrong side of the garment . You do n't need to mark both . I think it 's a little easier to mark the garment , but if you mark the facing , it will lessen the possibility of the marks showing through to the garment 's right side . Use tracing paper and a tracing wheel to mark , carefully guiding the wheel against the edge of the manila template . <p> Strategies for special scallops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow strip of bias-cut tricot , like Seams Great ( available from Clotilde ; 800-772-2891 ) . Clip sharply into the apex and along the curve . Turn tricot in , and topstitch in place . Make a shallow cut at the apex , as necessary . <p> Piped scallops : Use short sections of piping that overlap at each apex . <p> Upward-facing scallops : Be sure that they 're not too deep , or they 'll fall forward . Use a very lightweight interfacing to stabilize them , and favor the facing when pressing . <p> Scallops and lace : Fine laces often have beautifully scalloped edges that are wonderfully regular . You can overhang a scalloped lace border over a straight edge ( align the apex of the scallops along the edge ) , or shape the fabric to form a scalloped underlay . <p> To join the lace and fashion fabric without an additional facing , staystitch the fabric along the seamline , clip the seam allowance , and turn it toward the right side of the garment . Press well and hand-stitch in place along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace by hand with a fell stitch or a tiny machine zigzag . Press the lace-trimmed border face down on a thick towel . <p> Special scallops deserve special treatments . From left , scallops on knit fabric , piped scallops on dupioni silk , and scalloped lace at an edge . <p> Sewing , pressing , and clippingWhen the marking is complete , carefully align the garment and facing , right sides together , and sew along the scalloped stitching line . If you 're using a freezer-paper template ironed to the garment 's wrong side , just align the facing and sew along the cut edge of the paper ( the paper tears away when you 're done ) . Use a small stitch length ( about 2mm ) , which is especially important if your fabric is loosely woven . Small stitches are also the key to forming a sharp , well-defined angle at each apex . And they help stabilize the fabric once the scallops are clipped and turned . After stitching , trim away the excess fabric to a 1/4- to 3/8-in. seam allowance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , from the inside before turning them right side out . Then press seams open . <p> - <p> Now you 're ready to " sandwich-press " ( press as you 've stitched ) the two layers , which firms up the stitching line . Then , before turning the scallops right side out , try to work the point of your iron gently and patiently into the curved seams of the scallops , without distorting the edges . Next press the seam allowances open . I do n't like the little corners that form when a curved seam has been clipped and then pressed . The fabric inevitably weakens where it has been clipped and caves in , spoiling the curve . However , by setting the curve first by pressing before clipping it , you lessen this tendency . You wo n't be able to do this on really small scallops , but if the scallops are large enough , and especially if they 're in a prominent place on the garment , it 's well worth the effort . <p> Generous clipping is necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stitched , begin by clipping deeply at the apex and then around the curves , staggering the clips on the layers when the scallops are in a prominent area or if the fabric is sheer . <p> - <p> Roll the seamline just to the inside of the garment as you give it a final press . The scallops will curve beautifully along the edge without a visible seamline . <p> - <p> After pressing , start clipping the seam allowances of a scallop at its apex , cutting carefully and as deeply as possible ) . If you do n't clip right up to the stitching line , the scallop will never lie flat once turned but will always pucker at the apex . Clip the seam allowances of the curves generously . They 'll be encased and protected from abrasion and strain and are unlikely to weaken . If the scallops are in a particularly prominent place , such as a neckline , you might want to clip each layer of the seam allowance separately , staggering the placement of the clips . Press the scallops again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls just to the inside of the garment . <p> It 's impossible to understitch the scallops by machine , but understitching by hand can be done carefully using a tiny backstitch to join the seam allowance to the facing . Be careful not to catch the fashion fabric . Topstitching can also be used to help define the edge of the scallops , but carefully hand-baste the layers together first to prevent distortion or shifting as you stitch . <p> If you need to tack the facing to the garment , stitch as carefully and invisibly as possible using a tiny catchstitch that 's hidden between the facing and fashion fabric so that there 's no visible thread to snag . The catchstitch also evenly distributes the facing 's weight against the garment. - <p> A catchstitch secures the facing to the garment . <p> - <p> A fell stitch holds the lace in place . <p> - <p> It 's time to put some scallops on your sewing menu . I think you 'll find them fun to sew and just as fun to wear .

For the best results , I use 100-percent linen , but other all-natural fiber fabrics work also . However , fabrics made of synthetic fibers such as polyester do n't  retain the same crisp design definition you get with linen . Even after my linen garments have been laundered many times , the hemstitching holes remain distinct , the pattern is still well-defined , and the facing has n't  raveled . <p> I often prepare the fabric by spray-starching the hemstitch area before pressing and sewing . Lightweight , tear-away stabilizer is essential for supporting some fabrics , but not for others ; experiment to find the best results for the fabric and stitch you 're using . <p> Use embroidery threadAs the threaded wing needle spreads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes open . I use a 40-weight rayon embroidery thread for the needle with a lightweight bobbin thread . You might want to experiment with various thread weights to see what works best for the fabric you are using and the effect you want . The color of the needle thread should come close to the fabric color ; I think a slightly darker shade of thread blends better than a lighter one . If your holes are n't  well-defined when you stitch , use two layers of stabilizer . <p> Find a stitch that perforates and bindsLook for a stitch with these two characteristics : the needle penetrates the fabric in the same place more than once as it sews ; and the stitch has enough width to prevent the unfinished facing edge from raveling . <p> Examples of standard stitches with these characteristics are a honeycomb , blanket , or decorative daisy chain . Several utility stitches have these characteristics , and when their stitch width and length are adjusted , they create a handsome hemstitch . Utility stitches can be adapted for hemstitching , and typically there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many decorative stitches sewn with a regular needle , which can be used in a similar manner , I find this finish to be tastefully restrained . It makes an excellent companion for subtle beaded embellishment and renders beautifully in crisp silksbut it is equally suitable for casual clothing and accessories , as well as for home-dTcor items . I cant find a better way to decoratively attach a facing to a garment with such a delicate and durable finish . <p> Hemstitching : then and nowHistorically , hemstitching was an involved process of pulling out threads parallel to the hemline and then hand-sewing the hem in a manner that grouped the remaining vertical threads to create perforations in the fabric . <p> Nowadays , hemstitching is easy to do by machine using a wing needle , which has two finlike projections along its shaft , and an appropriate multistep stitch . <p> How to secure a facing with hemstitching Demonstrated here on a neckline is the process for securing a facing with wing needle stitching . You can also use this technique to secure a folded-back hem allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish its edges , just stitch it to the edge of your garment as you would normally attach a facing . Trim the seam allowance to 1/8 inch . Press the facing flat , then turn it to the inside of the garment and roll the seam slightly inward as you press it again . <p> 2 . Prepare your sewing machine with a wing needle , embroidery thread in the needle , and lightweight thread in the bobbin ; select an appropriate stitch such as any of the ones shown below . Position the garment face up in the machine ; if needed , slide lightweight tear-away stabilizer under the facing . Start sewing at the shoulder seam and stitch an even distance from the edge around the neckline until your stitches meet . ( If you wish , first mark a stitching guideline on the right side of the garment . ) <p> 3 . Gently tear away the stabilizer and press the neckline .

One edge at a time , fold back the allowance ( unless the corner is already faced ) , and hemstitch from one adjacent edge to the next adjacent edge . This technique works only on outside corners . <p> The stitching can echo the corner . If the corner is not faced , fold back the allowances and miter them . Hemstitch , pivoting at the corner . This works on outside and inside corners . <p> Before pivoting the hemstitching at a corner , experiment sewing corners with the stitch you are using to decide how you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetrical , navigating your corner may be as simple as pivoting with the needle down on the outside point of the corner . <p> But if your stitch is n't symmetrical , the direction you sew , the point in the pattern at which you pivot , and the direction you turn the fabric can change the way the corner looks . With wider stitches , the best results may occur if you hemstitch one edge at a time , break the stitching at the corner , turn the fabric , and abut the end of the next row of stitches against the side of the previous row . The example above at right shows some of the possible effects . If the stitch you 're using includes a motif , such as a daisy chain , be sure to identify the exact stitch with which the motif ends and pivot at that point . <p> Depending on your stitch pattern , it is often possible to hand-crank the needle and coax the fabric so the needle aligns with previous stitches to make a beautifully engineered corner . <p> Almost any hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hemstitch .

@@22149004 @2149004/ <h> Simple Fixes and Mending Techniques <p> For people who love clothing and textiles , few things are more disheartening than to discover that a favorite garment needs to be mended . And if you are n't sure how to make the necessary repairs , those pieces- serve as a silent reproach as they pile up in the closet corners. - <p> Mending is often associated with a bygone era , an old-fashioned activity for people who had limited access to manufactured goods , lived through the Great Depression , or made do with wartime rations . With the accessibility of inexpensive fashion , mending fell out of practice . The current shift in economic realities and concerns over global sustainability may have caused you to reflect on a time when consumers made , purchased , and wore high-quality cloth-and knew how to care for them. - <p> Mending is remarkably easy , surprisingly quick , and extraordinarily gratifying . Learning how to evaluate a damaged area and becoming familiar with the basic techniques are all that 's needed to get started . By mending treasured garments , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sufficiency , and do your part in leaving a smaller footprint on the planet . Now that 's cutting edge ! <p> To mend- or not to mendWhen evaluating garment damage , first determine whether mending is possible and if it will save the garment . <p> Can it be fixed ? A mend may be possible if the damage is to elements of a garment 's construction , such as released seams or darts , loose buttons , worn buttonholes , loose beads or sequins , tired elastic , a broken zipper , a fallen hem or cuff . Mending also is possible if the damage is to hidden elements , such as shabby lining , a hole in an inside pocket , under a button , or in a sock . <p> A mend may not be possible if the damage involves the textile itself , such as rips and tears or insect damage in the body of the cloth , deterioration , shattering , or loss . Shattered silk is nearly , if not completely , impossible to mend . <p> - <p> Is it worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether a repair is worth performing . Ask yourself the following questions : <p> How extensive is the damage ? <p> What is the garment 's value ? <p> Does the garment fit and/or will it fit after it 's mended ? <p> Will the garment be worn after it is mended ? <p> Will it be outgrown soon , or can it be handed down ? <p> What is the garment 's overall condition ? <p> Does it have more wear in it ? <p> Will the mend cause further damage ? <p> Can it be mended inconspicuously ? <p> Is the garment a collectible or an heirloom that should be retired and carefully stored away ? <p> Best practices for lasting results <p> Follow these general guidelines to help you to properly repair and care for your garments . <p> Always carefully launder or dry clean a garment before mending-handling a soiled garment can permanently work the soil into the fibers . Also , most mends involve the use of an iron , and a hot iron will set a stain . <p> Use a thread or yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensures an invisible and balanced mend. - <p> Choose a patching fabric that is equal to or lighter in weight than the garment being repaired . The repair fabric should not fight or overwhelm the original fabric or it can cause more damage later . <p> Ensure accuracy by basting the reinforcing fabric to the garment before beginning with the repair . <p> Always test adhesive mending products on a small , - inconspicuous area of the garment before using . They can react with textiles , causing permanent damage , including discoloration and accelerated decay. - <p> Hand stitches are sometimes preferable to machine sewing .

Today 's fabrics are so beautiful in and of themselves , a simple edge is all they need . With these techniques you can eliminate the traditional facings on the armhole edges of sleeveless garments and still have beautifully finished results .

Plus , I 'll show you a great tip for reinforcing buttonholes and buttons . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabric that 's slightly shorter than the length of the circumference of the armhole plus a seam allowance at each end . It should be 1 to 1 -+ inches wide plus twice the width of your seam allowance . Sew the strip right sides together at the ends . Fold in half with wrong sides together and press . Sew it to the armhole , right sides together . Trim and grade the seam . Press to the inside and tack in place at the shoulder and side seams by hand or by stitching in the ditch at the seamlines . <p> There 's no need to sew the facing completely in place , simply tack it to the shoulder and side seams . <h> Baby Hem <p> This is a fool-proof way of doing a narrow machine hem . I bless the day that I learned it because it 's useful for so many things . <p> - <p> To finish an armhole , press in the edge along the seamline and sew close to the fold . <p> Fold the edge in again and sew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two rows of stitching on the wrong side , but only one on the right side of your garment . <p> PAGES <h> Scalloped Edging <p> This is a great way to finish the opening and bottom hem edges of a garment , too . I used the decorative scallop stitch on my Bernina . Most machines have a similar stitch . First I- sewed and finished- the shoulder and side seams . <p> - <p> There 's no need to weigh a beautiful airy fabric down with facings and hems when you can take advantage of one of your machine 's decorative stitches . <p> - <p> Pin strips of stabilizer to the wrong side of the garment . I used a water soluble stabilizer to keep my top at light as possible . You could use a lightweight tear-away product as well , put some of that will always remain under your stitches . <p> - <p> Sew along the armhole seamline using your programmed stitch .

Let me answer a couple of your questions . First , you do n't necessarily have to sew the bias together initially at the ends , you can sew it around the armhole and then connect it . But you should seam the ends and press that seam open , instead of overlappying them , in order to create a smooth line at the underarm . Next -- yes if you follow my directions you will be taking in the armhole slightly . It 's such a small amount , however , that it probably wo n't make a difference . But , if you 're concerned , make the first fold 1/2 in. from the outer edge . The second turn of fabric should be about 1/8 in. and that gives you the full seam allowance .

@@22149006 @2149006/ <h> Understanding Thread Tension <p> Learn how to use the tension devices on your sewing machine and how to thread for proper tension . <p> Karen Meyer <p> Karen Meyer <p> Karen Meyer <p> Learn how to use the tension devices on your sewing machine and how to thread for proper tension . <p> Photo : Karen Meyer <p> by Claire Shaefferexcerpted from Threads #78 , pp. 39-41 <p> Many sewers avoid the tension dials on their machines like the plague , certain they 'll only make matters worse if they make adjustments . In fact , there 's nothing very mysterious about setting and adjusting thread tensions on your sewing machine , whatever its make and model . What 's potentially more confusing is that many apparently tension-related problems are caused by factors other than misadjusted tension dials . Let 's look closely at how to identify and correct " tension " problems , both with and without touching the tension settings . <p> Click to EnlargeYou ca n't get proper tension without correct threading . All machines have basically the four tension devices shown here- thread guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bobbin-case spring for bobbin thread- which ensure that the same amount of thread flows simultaneously from the needle and the bobbin , producing a symmetrical stitch . <p> Meet your tension toolsIn order to form a row of stitches that looks the same on both sides of the fabric , the same amount of thread needs to flow from the spool and the bobbin simultaneously . This is accomplished by running the threads through various tension devices , including the thread guides , tension discs , and tension regulator on the machine head for the upper thread(s) , and the bobbin-case spring for the bobbin thread ( see " Tension devices and proper threading " -right ) . Some machines also include a small hole in the bobbin-case finger , through which to feed the bobbin thread to increase the tension for improved stitch definition when topstitching , satin-stitching , and embroidering , without touching your tension settings . <p> The tension discs and tension regulator together are called the tension assembly . The tension discs squeeze the thread as it passes between them , while the tension regulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older ma- chines there are only two tension discs , controlled by a screw or knob . On newer models there are three discs controlled by a dial or key pad on the front of the machine , which can regulate two threads at once . <p> In either case , the tension regulator is elementary : When adjusted to a higher number ( turned clockwise ) , the discs move closer together , increasing the amount of pressure . Turned to a lower number ( counterclockwise ) , the discs move apart , decreasing the pressure . Using a thicker thread without resetting the dial will increase the pressure and cause the upper thread flow to decrease , unless you 've got a newer machine that makes automatic upper-tension adjustments . Since the bobbin tension is not self-adjusting , the lower tension may need to be adjusted manually to match . <p> In addition to guiding the thread along its path , each thread guide exerts a small amount of resistance on the thread , adding to the tension from the discs to achieve balanced tension . Bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The flat bobbin-case spring exerts pressure on the thread as it comes out of the bobbin case . The amount of pressure is regulated by a small screw at the rear of the spring . Both the spring and screw are easy to locate when the machine has a separate bobbin case . When the machine has a drop-in bobbin with a built-in bobbin case , locating the tension screw can be more challenging . Both types are shown in the drawings below . In either case , to increase the resistance , use a small screwdriver to turn the screw clockwise ( to a higher number ) or counterclockwise ( to a lower number ) . Turn the screw in small increments and never more than a quarter-turn between tests . This helps you keep track of how much you 're changing your settings and reduces the risk of losing this very small screw . <p> The bobbin-spring screw regulates bobbin-thread tension , whether your bobbin is a separate , drop-in unit ( left ) or is built into the machine ( right ) . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be increased when thicker threads are run under the bobbin spring . To eliminate the need to fiddle with the bobbin-case screw , many sewers ( myself included ) have two bobbin cases : one set for general sewing and the other for adjusting to less frequently used threads . <p> Recognizing balanced tensionsWhen the tensions are balanced , the stitched line looks good on both sides of the fabric , as shown in the top drawing at right , and the seam is at its strongest and most elastic . The easiest way to spot unbalanced tension is to look for visible knots or loops at the end of each stitch . When the bobbin thread shows on the right side , the needle tension is too tight or the bobbin thread , too loose , as shown in the middle drawing at right . When the needle thread shows on the wrong side , the needle tension is too loose or the bobbin thread , too tight , as shown in the bottom drawing at right . Of course , if you 're sewing on very thin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the tension is balanced , simply because the fabric is so thin . <p> When upper and lower thread tensions are balanced , knot between top and bottom threads is hidden between fabric layers ( top ) . When lower tension is too loose ( or upper tension is too tight ) , knot is visible on right side ( left ) . When upper tension is too loose ( or lower tension is too tight ) , knot is visible on wrong side ( right ) . <p> Tensions can still need adjustment even if they 're balanced . If both tensions are too tight , the seam may pucker , or break easily when stretched ( test this on the more stretchy crossgrain , with at least a 6-in. seam ) . If both are too loose , the seam will gap when pressed open , exposing the threads between the sections . <p> How to adjust tension There are two types of tension adjustments , a basic adjustment for everyday sewing ( this is what your repair person does when adjusting tension , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary when you change thread types or sizes , fabrics , and stitching operations . <p> To make a basic adjustment , select contrasting colors of a thread in the brand , size , and fiber you use most frequently . Use one color to fill the bobbin , with the machine set on medium speed to reduce the risk of stretching the thread . Insert a new needle in the size you use most frequently and thread the machine , using all the thread guides on the machine head , but skip threading the eye on the bobbin-case finger if you have that feature . <p> Set the stitch length for 2 mm ( 12 sts/in. ) or for the length you expect to use most frequently . Set the upper-tension regulator at the middle of its range ( on most machines , this is 4 or 5 ) , and stitch a test seam on two layers of lightweight muslin , then examine the stitches . If necessary , use a magnifier to see the stitches clearly . If the tension is n't perfect , fix it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows on the upper layer , and looser if the needle thread shows on the underlayer . Make another test seam , and examine the stitches , repeating until the stitch is balanced . <p> Once your stitching is balanced , start a tension log in your sewing-machine manual , indicating the thread brand , size , and type , as well as the number on the upper-tension regulator that produced a balanced stitch . Then draw a picture showing the position of the bobbin screw , like the example below , to use as a reference if you need to record a change in bobbin settings for special threads . <p> - <p> To record the bobbin tension for future reference , make note of the bobbin-screw position , including reference to thread opening or open side of bobbin case , as shown . <p> To make a temporary tension adjustment , select the threads for the needle and bobbin , then fill the bobbin and thread the machine . Make a test seam on the fabric that you plan to sew , examine the stitches , then see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . <p> Whenever you switch from your standard sewing thread to another thread , first thread your sewing machine and test your setup to see if you can get away with a tension-dial-only , temporary adjustment . If that does n't work , get out your second bobbin case , and start moving the screw in quarter-turns to loosen or tighten it , as your sample dictates . Typically , when you use a lighter-than-normal thread for both needle and bobbin , the tensions will stay balanced , even though they 're both lighter . This is often just what you need to avoid puckering lightweight fabrics , so no adjustment may be necessary . A heavier thread in top and bottom will increase both tensions , and you 'll probably need to set a lighter tension to accommodate heavier fabrics . <p> Do n't touch that dial ! So many things can affect the tension that it 's worthwhile to run through the following checklist in the order given before you reach for the tension regulator : <p> Incorrectly threaded machine : Incorrect threading is responsible for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use all thread guides ? Did you thread with the presser foot down , thus keeping the thread from slipping fully between tension discs ? Is thread unwinding freely from the spool , or catching on the spool 's slash ? Are you using a bobbin as a spool ( which can interfere with the thread flow ) ? Is the bobbin inserted correctly ? <p> Incorrectly filled bobbin : Remove any thread on the bobbin be-fore you wind on new thread . Wind the bobbin following the machine instructions , so it 's evenly wound at the proper tension . Remove any thread from the outside of the bobbin . Wind at a consistent , slow or medium speed , especially with polyester and nylon threads , to keep them from stretching ; they relax in your seam , causing puckers . <p> Dirty machine : Lint and thread ends lodged between the tension discs , under the throat plate , or around the bobbin case and bobbin , increase the resistance and restrict the thread flow . " Floss " between the tension discs with a lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thread ends and lint . <p> Damaged machine parts : Bent needles and bobbins , and rough or damaged surfaces on the needle eyes , thread guides , tension discs , take-up lever , throat plate , presser foot , bobbin case , and in the bobbin area can all cause problems . If you drop a metal bobbin on a hard floor , throw it away , even if it looks fine ; the smallest damage can distort tension . Avoid damage to the bobbin-tension spring by cutting the thread close to the case before removing the bobbin . Raise the presser foot before removing thread from the upper tension . <p> Needles , threads , and fabrics : Different thread sizes and types on top and in the bobbin can throw off basic tension settings . A needle that 's too large or small for the thread can also unbalance your stitches , because the size of the hole adds to or reduces the total top tension .

@@22149007 @2149007/ <p> Sewers I meet through my seminars always tell me they ca n't get their set-in sleeves to fit . They 're too small , too tight , do n't allow mobility ... Having compared the sleeves and armholes provided in current commercial patterns to those typically used in ready-to-wear , I 'm not surprised . I 've found that almost all ready-to-wear jackets and blouses have lower armholes and wider sleeves than the typical pattern for a similar garment . It 's also common for patterns to be wider across the back than comparable ready-to-wear in the same size . But such observations ca n't do more than point the struggling fitter in the general direction of a cure . The most useful place to start solving a sleeve-fitting problem , is with a bit of " research " shopping-try on as many similar garments as necessary until you find one that fits the way you want only in the sleeves and shoulders . Do n't look for a garment that fits everywhere-you may not find it-you 're just looking for the sleeves and shoulders . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime fitting aid . <p> Do n't measure yourself , measure what fitsI 've met hundreds of women who can tell me their measurements , but do n't know the measurements of garments that fit them the way they like . I propose the following radical but practical notion : It 's more useful for a sewer to know what works for her than to know what her own measurements are . ( Sleeves are not the only garment details for which this idea is useful . ) Once you 've located your Holy Grail set-in sleeve or sleeves ( a jacket sleeve and a blouse sleeve cover the set-in territory for me ) , all you need to do is measure it carefully in the relevant areas ( including the garment 's upper back , which controls the freedom of movement ) , then make sure that all your future garments with similar sleeves have the same measurements . <p> The drawings at the bottom of p. 55 ( Threads #107 ) - show what to measure on the garment , and the drawings on pp. 56-57 show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pattern armholes , and pattern backs to match your ideal . <p> If you discover that your pattern is more than an inch or so off from your measured ideal , use a closer size-this method is not meant for resizing a whole pattern . Otherwise , as far as all standard set-in sleeve styles go , it 's really that simple . Good hunting ! <p> Measure your garmentThe text and drawings that follow explain what to measure on your garment . <p> On the sleeve <p> 1 . Cap line circumference : Measure around the sleeve horizontally at the underarm level . <p> 2 . Cap height : Measure from the cap line vertically to the top of the armhole . <p> On the body <p> 3 . Armhole : Measure the arm-hole seamline . ( This is optional ; use it only for comparison when trying on garments and to see how close your starting pattern is to your ideal . ) <p> 4 . Shoulder width : Measure the back horizontally from the end of the shoulder seam to the opposite end . Divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 5 . Upper back width : Measure the back horizontally from armhole to armhole , about 8 inches down from the shoulder . Divide the measure in half , then compare it to the pattern . <p> 6 . Back width : Measure the back horizontally from underarm to underarm . Divide the measure in half , then compare it to the pattern . <p> Correct your patternNow that you 've measured your garment , you can now use these measurements to alter your pattern sleeves , pattern armholes , and pattern backs to match your ideal . <p> The sleeve cap heightBefore you begin , find the ease allowance in your original pattern by subtracting the length of the sleeve cap seamline from the length of the total armhole seamline . All diagrams are without seam allowances . <p> Slash the sleeve cap horizontally above the notches . Spread or overlap the pieces by the amount needed to make the cap height match the measured garment cap height . Blend the curve across the gap or overlap to create a smooth seamline . Measure the corrected seamline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armhole by raising or lowering the underarm seamline by the same amount you add to or subtract from the sleeve cap height . <p> 1 . Measure and mark the amount of your alteration on the side seam . Find the section of a designer 's curve that matches the armhole curve at the underarm . <p> 2 . Slide the designer 's curve down , without pivoting , to reposition the armhole shape at the marked point on the side seam . Draw the new seamline . <p> 3 . Use other sections of the designer 's curve as a guide to blend the new seamline upward into the existing seamline . <p> 4 . Check that the new armhole seamline length equals the new sleeve cap seamline length minus the original ease allowance . <p> The backCompare all three garment back measurements with your pattern ; alter all three areas with a single adjustment . <p> To make the back uniformly wider or narrower : Slash the pattern vertically from the midpoint of the shoulder seamline to the hemline . Spread or overlap the pieces . Blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then alter the front shoulder seamline to the same length by extending or reducing it at the armhole . <p> To make the back progressively wider or narrower : Slash the pattern vertically from the midpoint of the shoulder seamline to the hemline . Pivot the side-back piece from the shoulder or hemline as needed to adjust the width of the opposite edge . If pivoting from the hemline , blend the shoulder seamline across the gap or overlap , and then alter the front shoulder seamline to the same length by extending or reducing it at the armhole . <p> To make the back selectively wider or narrower : Use or create a seam at the center back or use a princess seam to subtract or add width selectively across the back but not at the shoulder or the hemline . <p> The sleeve cap lineBefore you begin , measure the width of the sleeve on the hemline . <p> 1 .

Draw a straight hemline across the spread ( or overlapped ) sections . <p> For a two-piece sleeve , slash each outer section on the cap line , leaving a hinge at the outside edge , and pivot the lower portion to abut the inner section at the bottom edge .

Also , I think part of the problem home sewers have with sleeve fitting is the poorly drafted commercial patterns ( I am referring to the ' big 4 ' here only ) . Generally they have very balanced sleeves - front and back sleeve cap matches . There is also way way too much ease in the sleeve cap on these patterns . <p> RTW may allow more movement with the lower armholes , but they also generally fit rather poorly .

Now I do n't have to figure out the recipe . Since many asked about pressing , perhaps using half Elmer 's Glue half water , might be what you 'd like . I have used it for Halloween masks . You scrunch up your fabric or manipulate it as desired and let it dry and it becomes like stiff paper . It can be pressed like paper if desired and sewed . Then after the event , a vinegar rinse turns the glue all wet and easily washed out . You can make your own glue from milk if needed . Many recipes are online .

Fold the hem width to a scant 1/4 inch and sew along the hem 's top edge simultaneously . It helps to fold the hem in 2-inch to 3-inch increments to eliminate the need for pinning .

This week , the brief was to create a special evening look suitable for a Broadway premiere , specifically the premiere of Finding Neverland . The show has been running for a while , so its hypothetical opening night was a thin pretext for making a fancy dress , but it was more than sufficient to inspire the youthful designers . <p> The bigger issue for them was that this was another partner challenge . The pairs were established through a random draw from the dreaded button bag . The pairs came out as follows : Maya and Peytie , Zach and Samantha , Jaxson and Bridget , and Matt and Zachary . The partners seemed generally pleased with each other and were poised to get started when a twist was announced : They had five hours to complete their look , they could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to make it all possible , each pair would have the guidance and assistance of a special guest--a Project Runway alum . The kids could n't have been more excited . It was adorable to see them fan-girling and -boying at the prospect of working with their designer idols . <p> Peytie and Maya were paired with Fabio Costa ( Season 10 ) . Matt and Zach worked with Amanda Valentine ( Seasons 11 and 13 ) . Zach and Samantha were assigned to Samantha Black ( Season 11 ) , and Jaxson and Bridget got Sonjia Williams ( Season 10 ) . Somehow , each pair felt they had gotten the perfect adult helper , so everyone was happy and energized . <p> The design process went well for three of the teams , but Bridget and Jaxson were devastated by a poor critique from mentor Tim Gunn . They 'd chosen an unattractive palette of dark red and peachy pink . They made another false start or two , with Bridget having a small meltdown . Sonjia gave her a no-nonsense reality check : Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jaxson finally settled on a design and a textile , they came up with a very interesting look . <h> The winners : <p> Peytie 's and Maya 's romper under a long , flowing skirt .

The girls had started out with a white organza skirt over the cut-velvet boy-short romper , but took Tim 's criticism seriously and rethought this design , replacing the white skirt with a black one . <h> The losers : <p> Matt 's and Zachary 's red gown with drapes and cutouts . The boys had big ideas for a glamorous gown , and worked well together , but the final product was ill-fitting and overdesigned .

I think we 'll see more of him in some other context . . . red carpet commentary , perhaps ? <h> The remaining looks : <p> Samantha 's and Zach 's jumpsuit with cape . This outfit was striking . Kelly called it " modern medieval magic , " and all the judges felt it hit a sweet spot between old Hollywood glamour and modernity .

@@22149015 @2149015/ <h> The Merits of a Basic Fitting Pattern <p> When I started out as a custom dressmaker , I needed a way to simplify the fitting process . So I turned to patternmaking , where I learned how to draft basic fitting patterns , called slopers , and create different styles of garments from them . I was excited about using slopers to make my own patterns , as designers do . But since my students work with commercial patterns , I wondered if I could use what I 'd learned from making slopers to speed up the alteration process . The clear connection I finally saw between a sloper and any existing garment pattern surprised me with the speed and elegance it offered as an alteration technique ( whether your garment or figure is simple or complex ) , and with how much it clarified the entire fitting process . But to make sense of it , you need to know more about slopers . <p> Sloper : a " second skin " <p> A sloper fits the figure it was drafted for with only the minimum room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without design , or style , easeor seam allowances . It 's the most snugly fitted garment you 'll ever wear , and as such , is almost like a pattern for your skin . In fact , the skintight cloth covers of commercial dress forms are made from slopers , drafted from the measurements of the so-called " ideal " figure the garment industry aims to fit . <p> If you 've ever fitted a pattern company 's basic bodice and skirt to yourself , you 've taken another route to getting a sloper : remove the seam allowances from the altered pattern and there 's your sloper . ( You 've also discovered exactly how you differ from the company 's " ideal " figure , represented by their basic . ) A complete sloper , from which a patternmaker can draft almost any style of garment , includes a darted bodice front and back , a straight skirt , and a set-in sleeve . <p> Of course , many garments do n't resemble slopers at all , once design ease and fashion details are added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders ( as do most " tops " ) will match the sloper they were drafted from more or less exactly in the shoulder area ( allowing for current trends in shoulder width and pads ) . Likewise , most well-fitted " bottoms " match their " parent " skirt sloper in the waist and high hip . <p> It 's important to understand that no matter how you get a custom-fitted sloper ( whether you alter a company 's basic fitting pattern , drape or draft your own , or have a computer generate a fitted pattern from your measurements ) , once you try it on and perfect it , your sloper is a record of what fits you . Any path to this destination should result in the same basic outline and amount of dart shaping . <p> The chief use of the sloper is in flat-pattern design , where the idea is that every pattern properly made from it will fit the figure the sloper fits . But having such an accurate , tangible record of your own shape can be a powerful fitting tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have a sloper that fits , you 've already solved your most important and most complex fitting problems . Why should you have to re-solve these problems each time you alter a pattern ? <p> Your sloper is a two-dimensional dress formI think of a sloper as a flat dress form , cut into front and back pieces . Lay your pattern on your " flat form , " and you can see immediately whether the pattern will fit you because you can see how and where it fits the sloper , and where it does n't . You 'll almost certainly have to redistribute the sloper 's dart shaping to line up with the pattern 's ( see What you need to know about pivoting darts below ) , but once that 's done , it 's easy to see the variance between the two shapes , even if you do n't yet know how to fix it . <p> What you need to know about pivoting darts <p> Darts reduce width and length wherever you do n't need it ( at the sides of the bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've provided the extra length required to fit across a " bump " such as bust , tummy , rear , hip , or shoulder blade . The accumulated size ( measured by the angle of each dart opening ) of all the darts pointing to a single bump represents the total extra width and length that bump requires for coverage . This amount is called " dart control , " and in many slopers it 's gathered into one big dart for each bump , as shown in drawing at far left below . <p> Fortunately , you can divide that one dart into two or more smaller darts without changing the total dart control , as long as their combined angles equal the total dart-control angle . Further , the position of the darts does n't matter . Provided they all point toward the apex of the bump , the dart legs can be pivoted to end in any surrounding seam , as in the examples of altered slopers above , all of which have the same amount of dart control . In patterns , all or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in gathers , pleats , or ease at any surrounding seam , or left unstitched . The unstitched portions can also be pivoted around the bump , resulting in longer seams ( and loose wrinkles ) at shoulder , armscye , side , or waist , wherever the designer positions it . <p> Finally , dart control in a sloper extends to the apex of the bump it fits ( for example , a bodice sloper 's bust point ) , which makes pivoting easy . When converted to garment darts , the dart 's point is shifted from the apex by at least 1/2 in. to smooth the fabric at the apex . <p> To pivot darts , trace the sloper onto tissue paper , then adjust the tissue copy . Slash from the seam edge where you want to position the new dart to the dart apex , leaving a small paper hinge at the apex . Pivot the existing dart closed until the new dart opens up sufficiently . Notice how pivoting changes the angle of the sloper side seam , relative to the center front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sloper over any commercial pattern , it 's difficult to see the relationship between them until the dart control on the sloper has been divided and pivoted to match the way it was positioned on the garment by the designer . After aligning the front and back centers on your pattern and sloper , the next step is to pivot the control so the side seams are parallel ( but not necessarily aligned ) . But where to put the new dart(s) ? <p> Obviously , if the pattern has any visible darts or gathers , slash your sloper tracing parallel to them but pointing to its apex , then distribute as much control to that section of the sloper as you need to align the side seams . If you ca n't see the dart control , it 's been left unstitched , so look for lengthened shoulders and armscyes , unshaped waists and/or side seams , and ( on jackets ) eased roll lines , all common places for unstitched dart control . These features are also clues that some control has been positioned here , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In either case , slash and pivot your sloper tracing ( as described in the drawings above ) in the unstitched , dart-controlled areas just described , as you would for visible darts , until the side seams are parallel . Even if your dart-control total is different from the pattern 's , as long as you 've distributed yours in approximately the same directions away from the apex , you 're ready to match slopers when the sides are parallel , as in Step 2 and Step 3 . <p> See Step 1 ( below ) for a simple example of sloper/pattern alignment using a pattern shaped much like the sloper . Start with a commercial pattern that matches your measurements as closely as possible at the shoulders if it 's a top , or at the hips if it 's a bottom ( though the technique works equally well if the pattern is sized very differently from the sloper ) . <p> Step 1 : Align/assess sloper and pattern <p> All outlines are without seam allowances , and alignment process is same for front and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace pattern along seamlines only ) . 2 . Trace sloper onto separate tissue . 3 . Position sloper tissue over pattern with centers aligned , then slide sloper up or down until shoulders match at neckline . Start with back , then work on front . 4 . Pivot and distribute dart control ( see sidebar on p. 50 ) as necessary to make side seams parallel and align dart placement . Comments below reflect author 's judgment of commercial pattern at each seam , based on comparison with her sloper : <p> Work with the back first , positioning the back pattern over the back sloper and aligning the two center-back lines . Imagine you 're pulling a garment on over your head : keeping the center backs aligned , slide the pattern until the sloper 's shoulder contacts the stitching line of the pattern 's shoulder . The sloper represents you , and the pattern parts not covered up by your sloper show the design ease . Is there enough ( or too much ) design ease at the waist ? the hips ? across the bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicating the pattern is too small there ? Are the shoulder seams a different length and at a different angle than your shoulders ? How far below your own underarm is that armscye supposed to fall ? <p> If you were using the sloper that this pattern was drafted from instead of your own , of course , there 'd be no such questions . You 'd see exactly the amount of design ease the designer intended at every seam , and how ( and where ) he or she had repositioned the dart shaping that 's built into every sloper for the female figure . The exact relationship between the outlines of the sloper and pattern at every point is the record of the designer 's idea of a good fit for that garment . <p> From this relationship comes the idea that it makes sense to alter a pattern company 's basic fitting shell before trying to alter individual patterns from it . If a company 's patterns were all drafted from the same sloper , once you knew how to make that sloper fit you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's patterns and it would fit you the same way it fit the sloper . Well , this implies that you should adjust the basic fitting pattern from every company whose patterns you want to make . But not all companies publish one . Worse , not all patterns from companies that do publish one are drafted from that same sloper , and there 's no way to tell which are n't ! Happily , there 's a simpler way . <p> Introducing " Match the Slopers " To make the process I 'll describe easier to visualize , start by imagining an ideal world in which every pattern comes with an outline of the sloper it evolved from drawn right on the pattern , aligned at center back and shoulders as described in the " 2-D dress-form " example above . Next , imagine laying your own sloper over the " ideal " one , also aligned at center back and shoulders . <p> Now , what if you simply cut apart the pattern and shifted the pieces so the outline of its sloper exactly matched yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without changing the design ease the unaltered pattern had to start with . <p> I 've actually traced an " ideal " sloper onto a commercial pattern derived from it ( see Step 2 below ) . It turns out that with nothing more than a few horizontal and vertical tucks and/or slashes , it 's easy to make one sloper 's outline match the other 's . Once I did it , the resulting garment fit ! <p> Step 2 : " Match the slopers " by adjusting yours <p> Process is same for front and back : adjust horizontals first , then verticals by folding or slashing and spreading your sloper to fit pattern outline with your preferred amounts of wearing and design ease at each seam . Fold over thin ruler to help start folds . Use repositionable glue stick to bond sloper tissue to pattern after matching . <p> Horizontals Adjustments should be made horizontally and evenly across pattern , except at shoulders , where alteration will be slanted : Check/adjust armscye . Check/adjust waistline . Check/adjust shoulder slope . <p> VerticalsAdjustments can be angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Check/adjust width from CB to neckline at shoulder . Check/adjust width from neckline at shoulder to shoulder point . Check/adjust width from shoulder point to side seam . <p> I 've found that the easiest and most controllable way to do this in practice is simply the opposite of what I just described : first tuck and/or slash your sloper to make it fit the ideal one , adhere it to the pattern underneath ( repositionable glue stick is perfect for the job ) , slash completely across the pattern beneath each horizontal and vertical sloper tuck or slash , then return your sloper to its original shape , taking the pattern with it . It 's just that easy , and the step-by-step examples in Step 2 and Step 3 walk you through the process on a simple pattern . I 'll cover more complex examples in a future article . <p> Step 3 : Return sloper to original shape <p> Front ( left ) Make sure sloper tissue is firmly bonded to pattern tissue on either side of all folds , wedges , and slashes , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be handy surface for securing adjusted final pattern ( use glue stick ) , after returning sloper to its original position . <p> True all changed seamlines , averaging between new and old lines when different . Reposition all dart points at least 1/2 in. from apexes . <p> So , where 's the sloper in the pattern ? Of course , there is not a sloper drawn on your patterns , and this is no doubt only one of the objections spinning in your head , as they were in mine when this idea first dawned on me . Now that I 've worked with the method a while , I 'm even more convinced of its usefulness , especially if you 've been unhappy with more traditional pattern-alteration methods . But I have to remind myself that I 'm an experienced patternmaker , as I try to explain to other sewers how this can work . Fortunately , I 've been pleased with how easily many beginners have taken to the process after a brief orientation . Here 's how to see that imaginary sloper : <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern is design ease someone else 's idea of how much extra room the garment should have in relation to the body inside it for this particular style , and where this room should be placed . So , rather than drawing or even imagining some precise , ideal sloper , all you need to do is reshape your sloper in relation to the pattern until you feel that the garment will have the right ease in the right places . You can use measurements given on the pattern envelope , on charts of standard ease allowances ( like those in the pattern catalogs ) , the illustration on the pattern envelope , and your own judgment and experience in equal measure as you determine the appropriate ease . You 'll be refining whatever you decide at the muslin stage , anyway , so you do n't need to get bogged down with ultraprecision at this point . <p> In fact , being able to see , at every point along every seam , the exact difference between your sloper ( whose fit you know is correct , if skintight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make more immediate , precise , and intuitive decisions about how you want each garment to fit ( more like your sloper , or more like the designer intended ? ) , with less experience , than just about any other alteration technique . The feeling of control and understanding is great ! <p> Start , as in the directions in Step 1 by aligning the pattern and sloper ( with darts repositioned as described ) along center back and center front , then at the shoulders . Simply mark how much ease you 'd like at each point listed . <p> Where 's the bust point ? As you reshape your sloper , you do n't need to make any effort to align your bust point with the " ideal " one . Ignoring how it will temporarily move as you contract or expand the sloper , simply leave the point where it is on your sloper this reflects your figure , so why change it ? To adapt the carefully fitted dart control on your sloper to the new pattern , be sure the sloper 's control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. , the darts are in about the same places ) , leaving each dart 's angle and starting point as you 've fitted them on the sloper . <p> Among the important questions your sloper has already answered , after all , is how much dart control you need and where it should point . Now you 're simply adapting the pattern to reflect this information , and all that 's required at this stage is to correct the differences in length and width that a bust variance between sloper and pattern represents . As you can see in the examples above , matching slopers even ensures that the front and back side seams match after you 've adjusted overall lengths , without requiring a single measurement or dart adjustment .

@@22149020 @2149020/ <p> Perfectly rendered hand-quilting stitches have been admired and envied since the beginning of quilt making . Quilters view beautifully hand-stitched quilts with reverence , and often whisper , " Look at those stitches ! " Yet , many quilters avoid hand-quilting because they 're unhappy with their results . Skipped or uneven stitches , visible knots , and puckered fabrics are just a few of the potential pitfalls . Others include uneven , " pin-prick " stitches , which catch only a few threads on the back of the quilt and can easily pull out , and large stitches that can snag and break . <p> Consistent hand-quilting stitches will enhance a quilt 's beauty and help it last a lifetime . <p> - <p> When executed correctly , hand-sewn quilt stitches are the same length on both the front and back of the quilt , and the spaces between them are all identical . Ideally , the smaller the stitch , the better ; however , evenness and consistency of the stitches are more important than stitch size . And once this method becomes familiar , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfied with your hand-stitching , follow along for an in-depth look at a hand-quilting method I call the hybrid rocking-stitch . With lots of practice , it produces consistently excellent results . <p> Batting forms the center of the quilt " sandwich , " and there are many types , from cotton , polyester , silk , and wool to blends . Experiment to find the type that works best for you ( see Choosing the right batting ) . <p> The best thread to use is one made for quilting ; it 's slightly thicker , stronger and longer-wearing than regular sewing thread . Of course , if you 're making a purely decorative quilt , choose any thread you like . <p> Needles and thimblesI use a " between " needle for hand-quilting . Its short , thin shaft is easier to direct in and out of the quilt layers than a larger needle . Betweens come in sizes 5 through 12 ( larger numbers designate finer needles ) . Be aware that needle-sizing is n't standard from company to company . I prefer the size 10 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A thimble is vital for my hybrid rocking-stitch , because the eye end of the needle is maneuvered with the tip or side of your middle finger . Many different thimbles are available , but only your finger knows which fits you . <p> A metal thimble provides the best protection . Look for one with deep indentations to hold the needle in place . An open-ended thimble , such as those available from Roxanne Products ( see Quilting- supplies by mail ) , accommodates long fingernails , and reduces perspiration , which is often a problem with traditional thimbles . The thimble I prefer , however , is a leather one . A leather thimble grabs the needle better , giving me more control . It 's also a good choice for beginners . <p> Marking tools and quilt hoopsThe most important quality of a marking tool is its removability . To be sure that what you put on comes off , test your marking method every time you use it . <p> I favor soap slivers , whose marks are completely removable . Be aware , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're difficult to see on light-colored fabrics , and they rub off easily . Use a brand that does n't contain cold cream , which makes the soap too crumbly . Store the soap in your freezer to keep it hard , and use an emery board to sharpen its edges . <p> A hoop or frame maintains proper tension and keeps the quilt layers from shifting and bunching . I prefer a handheld , 11-in. by 17-in . PVC frame for its portability and comfort . It accommodates any size quilt , even king size . I just reposition it as I work . <p> Quilt patternsThe quilt motif you select can help determine how smoothly the quilting process goes . Patterns that involve long , straight lines are easy and quick to quilt , but crooked or uneven stitches are more apparent . Except for overly long stitches , such flaws can be camouflaged if you are using designs with short , curved lines . <p> Balanced stitches are easier to achieve by stitching along the cross-grain or on the bias , because there 's more flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon you can tackle more intricate designs . <p> Basting Basting is essential to keep the grain of the quilt top and backing aligned . If the grain of the two fabrics does not match , quilting will be more difficult , and the fabric is likely to pucker . I use a thin , curved upholstery needle and authentic white basting thread , which is quite thin , breaks easily , and is easy to remove . Using colored thread for basting can cause permanent damage if the dye transfers to the fabric . While some quilters baste with safety pins and quilt basting guns , both leave too much play between quilt layers . Also , safety pins can discolor the fabric , and basting guns may leave holes in the fabric . Baste generously and work in a grid , with stitches no less than 3 in. to 4 in. apart . <p> The hybrid rocking-stitchMy hybrid version of the traditional rocking stitch is unique and allows you to see what you 're doing all the time . You always stitch toward yourself , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the normal rocking stitch . Securing the quilt quite loosely in the frame allows you to manipulate the fabric into tiny " pleats " as you pick up stitches on the needle . To produce this stitch , follow these steps : <p> - <p> A. Gently pierce the quilt . <p> 1 . Wearing a thimble on your middle finger , lightly place the tip of the needle on the quilt top in a vertical position ( photo A ) . Balance the eye-end of the needle on the thimble . Your thumb should be resting on the quilt in front , but slightly off to one side of the needle , and your hand should look like a relaxed , backward C. Place the middle finger of your other hand underneath the quilt to feel for the needle 's point , and manipulate the fabric . This hand may also help hold your hoop . Gently pierce the quilt until you barely feel the tip of the needle on your middle finger . The moment you feel the needle , stop pushing . <p> 2 . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . Do not push forward . The eye should face away from your body ( photo B ) . At the same time , push the thumb of your thimble hand down and slightly forward on the fabric , away from you ; and push the middle finger of the hand under the quilt up and slightly back , toward you , working together to pinch the fabric into a tiny pleat ( photo C ) . This procedure sets the tip of the needle into the reverse side of the pleat . The bottom finger does n't actually push the needle , only the fabric . The length of the needle that travels beneath the quilt back determines stitch length on the back and the space between stitches on the front . <p> B. Lay the needle parallel with the quilt surface . <p> - <p> C. Pinch the fabric into a tiny pleat . <p> 3 . Now , use the thimble finger to push the needle through the fabric pleat . As soon as you see the tip of the needle come through the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full vertical position to begin the next stitch ( photo D ) . Remember , the size of the quilt stitch is equal to amount of the needle exposed , so do n't push the needle too hard as you guide it through the pleat . Repeat these steps , loading several stitches onto the needle before pulling it through the layers ( photo E ) . <p> D. Return the needle to vertical to begin the next stitch . <p> - <p> E. Repeat these steps , loading several stitches onto the needle before pulling it through the layers . <p> Keep in mind that only your thimble finger guides the needle , and that the thumb of your thimble hand and middle finger of your bottom hand maneuver the fabric . The needle should always be either vertical ( when entering the quilt top ) or horizontal ( when pushing through the fabric pleat ) . Proficiency comes with lots of practice .

@@22149022 @2149022/ <p> Four basic types of stabilizersThe four basic types of stabilizers- cut-away , tear-away , heat-away , and wash-away- are defined by the method used to remove them from the fabric once the embroidery is complete . Some stabilizers remain permanently affixed to the fabric , for example , cut-aways and some toppings ( stabilizers used on top of the fabric rather than beneath it ) , while most are temporary and are removed once the embroidery is finished . Stabilizers in various weights , as well as forms-fusible , nonfusible , and adhesive-backed- are available in most categories . There are many Stabilizers available from mail-order sources , and you can also purchase stabilizers at fabric stores , notions departments , and most sewing-machine dealers . <p> - <p> Click to enlargeStabilizers make smooth machine-embroidery possible , but matching stabilizer to fabric is key . Keep several types and products on hand , and make test samples before permanently stitching out a design . <p> The stabilizer you choose will depend on your fabric , the nature of the embroidery design , and the end use . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to relax around the stitching and lie flatter after embroidery , so a tear-away stabilizer would be a good choice . And thin fabrics , knits , or synthetics would do better with a cut-away stabilizer . You also need to consider the stitch density of the design when choosing a weight of stabilizer , regardless of the type of stabilizer you select . The denser the stitch count , the sturdier the stabilizer needs to be . See the Stabilizers at a glance for a capsule comparison chart . <p> Because there are so many stabilizer options , experiment with various products to find the best results for a particular project . Also make test samples with your fabric before the final stitching ; if you do a lot of embroidery , label and keep these samples for future reference . In some cases , you 'll get the best results by using several layers of the same stabilizer or more than one type of stabilizer in the same project . And , finally , bear in mind that some fabrics and embroidery designs are simply not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fact . <p> - <p> When embroidering on knits , use a permanent cut-away stabilizer ( at left ) to keep the fabric smooth during stitching and prevent stretching during wear . Tear-away stabilizers ( at right ) may not offer as much support . <p> - <p> For fabrics like leather or velvet that could be permanently marked by hooping , use an adhesive-backed cut- or tear-away stabilizer , like Sulky 's Sticky tear-away . Hoop the stabilizer , remove the paper , stick the fabric to the stabilizer , and stitch . <p> Cut-away stabilizers- Cut-aways are permanent stabilizers that remain on the fabric and keep it stable during and after embroidery . They 're a good choice for knit fabrics , because they prevent the designs from stretching out with frequent wearing and washing . I also recommend using a cut-away stabilizer on loosely woven fabrics and on projects to be framed , where visibility of the stabilizer is not an issue . <p> Cut-aways are available in heavy to light weights , and in black as well as white . Choose a lightweight cut-away ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for designs with light stitch density and a heavier stabilizer ( like Sulky Cut-Away Plus ) for dense embroidery designs , or use more than one layer of a light- to medium-weight product with the latter . If you 're stitching on a fabric that will easily crush or otherwise be marked by the embroidery hoop , like velvet or leather ( see the photo at right ) , hoop the stabilizer only , then spray it lightly with a temporary fabric adhesive , and position the fabric on the hooped stabilizer . For fabrics that wo n't be marred by needles or pins , whether hooped conventionally or as just described above , baste or pin the fabric securely in place so it wo n't shift while stitching , keeping the pins out of the design area . ( You may also find basting or pinning helpful when working with tear-away stabilizers . ) <p> To remove a cut-away stabilizer , first rough-cut the excess stabilizer from the fabric . Then , using sharp embroidery scissors , trim close to the stitching . <p> - <p> Multiple stabilizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) stabilizes a soft rayon for wing-needle stitching , but is removed it before hooping the fabric with a sewn-in tear-away ( bottom ) to stitch a digitized design . <p> Tear-away stabilizers- Tear-aways are temporary stabilizers that are generally easy to remove , but be careful to do so without pulling or stretching the fabric . Some of these products tear more easily than others , so check this when testing a stabilizer . Also keep in mind that some may tear more readily in one direction than another , so check " tearability " in all directions , as well . A product like Pellon 's Stitch ' N Tear , a medium-weight tear-away that I especially like for linear wing-needle embroidery , pulls cleanly away from the stitching in all directions . When a fabric or project requires strong support and you want to use a tear-away , use several layers of a light- to mid-weight stabilizer , rather than one heavy product , then gently remove the layers individually . And when using a nonfusible stabilizer , I suggest spraying one side with a temporary fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hold the fabric securely in place . <p> Some tear-aways , called toppings , are intended for use on top of , rather than beneath , the fabric in order to prevent stitches from getting lost in a dense nap or pile . Permanent , plastic-like film tear-aways that come in colors ( like Dry Cover-Up from Hoop-It-All ) keep the fabric from showing through the embroidery . <p> Iron-on , fusible tear-aways make it easier to keep the fabric and stabilizer on-grain during hooping without stretching or distorting the fabric . And they prevent any grain shifting that may occur during stitching , especially when stitching a large area . But avoid using an iron-on for tightly packed rows of stitches , because it will be difficult to remove . <p> - <p> Make your own fabric with decorative threads and yarns , by sewing them randomly or in a pattern onto a heat-away stabilizer . <p> Heat-away stabilizers- Choose a heat-away stabilizer when the fabric is too delicate for a tear-away , too sheer for a cut-away , or is n't washable , or when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edge . There are two types of heat-away stabilizers : woven ( for example , Sulky 's Heat-Away ) and plastic-like film ( for instance , America Sews Clear ' N Melt ) . The woven stabilizer turns brown and flakes when heated with an iron , and the flakes can be gently brushed away . Be cautious when using woven heat-aways because the chemical that causes the stabilizer to crumble when heated is water-soluble , so if you use a steam iron to remove the stabilizer , the steam will dissolve the chemical and allow it to transfer to the fabric and even the ironing surface , which may , in turn , crumble when heated . So here 's how to thoroughly remove this type of heat-away from a project and keep the ironing surface clean : Split a sheet of two-ply paper towel and lay the fabric between the plies . Press with a dry iron until the stabilizer is a light toast color . Then place all three layers in a plastic bag and roll the bag rapidly between your hands to crumble the stabilizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes , use a toothbrush to get rid of any stubborn pieces left on the fabric , and throw the bag away . <p> The second type of heat-away stabilizer , plastic-like film , which I refer to as a heat-and-melt , is used mainly as a topping to prevent stitches from getting lost in a dense nap or pile . It remains under the stitching , continuing to support it during washings . The excess stabilizer around the stitches disappears when heat is applied . To do so , use a hot dry iron to remove it , just touching the surface , trying not to slide across the film . Wipe away any beads of stabilizer from the iron 's soleplate with a paper towel or scrap of fabric . <p> - <p> Use a film-like , water-soluble stabilizer when embroidering lace designs . Hoop the stabilizer with the fabric and baste around the design area for extra support . <p> Wash-away stabilizers- Wash-away stabilizers are designed to dissolve when wet and come in several forms : plastic-like film and soluble paper , both of which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed or sprayed on the fabric and allowed to dry . <p> In addition to their regular use , providing support beneath the fabric , some of the film wash-aways , like similar heat-and-melt-aways , can be used on top of the fabric to keep the embroidery stitches from sinking into a nap or pile . Because a wash-away will dissolve under the stitches when washed , heat-and-melt-aways or colored tear-aways , like Dry Cover-Up , are better choices if you need continued support during washing and wearing . <p> There are also adhesive-backed film wash-aways ( see the left photo on the facing page ) and heavier film wash-aways ( like Pfaff-distributed Romeo and Sulky 's Ultra Solvy ) , which are great for embroidering lace and Richelieu , or cutwork , designs . <p> Use wash-away stabilizers for free-motion and programmed-stitch embroidery , especially with fabrics that are difficult to mark , because you can draw your design on the stabilizer with a fine-point marking pen to use as a stitching guide . Not all wash-aways require the same water temperature for removal , so be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may mean several rinsings ) so there 's no residue left to make your fabric stiff . Many of the film-like stabilizers get crisp when exposed to the air ( I 'll talk about storage in a moment ) , so I like to let them " dry " a bit so I can then easily tear away any large amounts of excess stabilizer before washing the fabric . <p> Water-soluble paper stabilizers- ( like LJ Designs Design Plus ) that dissolve in water are great for creating mesh-like fabric and embellishing soft , delicate fabrics , because the paper does n't permeate and stiffen the fabric if not thoroughly rinsed out . Brush-on liquid wash-aways ( like **26;732;TOOLONG Perfect Sew ) also work well on delicate fabrics , and sometimes I use a combination of a brush-on stabilizer to stiffen the fabric first , and a hoopable water-soluble stabilizer . But be careful not to make your fabric too stiff , because it can become brittle and crack when stitched . <p> A spray-on stabilizer , like Sullivan 's Fabric Stabilizer , makes the fabric firmer than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the iron as starch tends to do . Heirloom-sewing expert Mimi Turner , of South Carolina , suggests you spray one side of the fabric heavily , then press from the other side so the stabilizer is thoroughly pressed into the fabric . <p> Stabilizers at a glance <p> - <p> Used for : <p> Best used on : <p> Comes in : <p> Removal : <p> Cut-away stabilizers <p> Permanent support <p> Knits , loosely wovens <p> Light to heavy weights <p> Not removed , except for cutting away excess <p> Tear-away stabilizers <p> Temporary support <p> Firmly woven , natural-fiber fabrics <p> Light to heavy weights ; fusible and nonfusible <p> Torn away , but not always completely removable , depending on brand and stitch pattern <p> Store stabilizers carefullyMany stabilizers look alike , so keep them in the original packaging or in clearly marked bags- or , if you 're not that organized , label the stabilizer itself . Many manufacturers package stabilizers on rolls cut in convenient widths to accommodate various hoop sizes . Keep a tag inside the roll with identifying information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , its use , and where it was purchased . Heat-and-melt and wash-away film stabilizers should be stored in Ziploc bags because they tend to stiffen with continued exposure to the air . <p> I hope this article clarifies many of your stabilizer questions . These tools can be the key to successful embroidery , so sorting through the options is well worth the effort . 4378 @qwx204378 4375 @qwx204375 <p> ThomasGops writes : In diet continue with the protein rich diet and foods like cereals , lentils , tofu , peas , fresh cheese , soya , sugar and rice .

Back then , I fantasized about being a woman from the ' 30s wearing all of the fabulous clothing that my favorite old Hollywood actresses wore . Inspired by my grandmother 's dropped-waist dresses from the early ' 20s , I soon started making my own dress patterns from paper bags . As an adult , I finally discovered some real vintage patterns at a garage sale , and I 've been hooked ever since . <p> Today , with the help of the Internet and the popularity of all things vintage , it 's easier than ever to acquire vintage patterns . There are tons of Web sites devoted entirely to the buying and selling of original and reproduction vintage patterns ( replicas of vintage patterns , some of which offer clarified instructions or patterns graded into multiple sizes ) . <p> Sewing with the real-deal pattern in its original form is a wonderful experience and a fun way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . However , vintage patterns can be intimidating . Aside from their fragile envelopes and delicate pattern tissue , they look and read much differently from the commercial patterns we 're used to today . <p> Here , I 'll explain the major differences and show you techniques that will help you easily navigate the world of vintage patterns . Once you know what to expect , and with some practice , you 'll be able to pick up any old pattern that you like and create a fabulous garment from the past . <p> Vintage speak : a glossary of terms <p> Vintage patterns come with vintage terminology , not all of which may be familiar . Here are some of the terms you might encounter . <p> Continuous lap : A strip of fabric cut on the straight grain and used to face edges of an opening or slit in a garment . <p> Jabot : A ruffle or cravat-like accent attached to the front of a dress or blouse . <p> Lapped seam : A seam in which one seam allowance edge is lapped over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pintuck : Very small tucks stitched just a pin 's width from the fold to slightly shape a garment piece . In the late 1920s , a series of pin tucks were often applied across the natural waistline of a frock for shaping and detail . <p> Plaits : An array of narrow ( known today as " knife " ) pleats often applied at the hem of a dress , the ends of sleeves , or around the neck opening . <p> Shirring : Three or more rows of gathers made by small running stitches in parallel lines . The rows are spaced as desired . <p> Slide fastener : The original term for zippers . <p> True bias : Fabric that is cut at a precise 45-degree angle to the fabric grainline . <p> Toile : The French term for fabric pattern . Originally pertained to the muslin test garment . <p> Created from a 1933 vintage pattern ( Butterick Starred Pattern 5156 , A Katharine Hepburn Frock ) , this jacket and dress exemplify the head-turning beauty to be had in vintage designs . This design was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film Christopher Strong . <p> - <p> Patterns today vs. yesterdayPart of what makes vintage patterns thrilling to work with is that they 're so different ( for a decade by decade overview , see the description below ) . Of course , when working with something that 's unfamiliar , challenges are bound to arise . Read on for more important details to know about before you get started with any vintage pattern . <p> 1920s-By the late 1920s , women were wearing trousers and short skirts for the first time . The McCall Pattern Company began the trend of beautiful , full-color fashion renderings on their pattern envelopes . <p> 1930s-During the Depression , more women than ever sewed garments at home . Patterns were designed to use up every inch of fabric possible . American screen actresses like Bette Davis greatly influenced the fashions . <p> 1940s-Marked by the onset of World War II , fabric goods were limited by U.S. Government mandates . Trouser styles were slimmed down with no cuffs to conserve fabric . To help save paper , pattern companies reissued their patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cuffs reemerged , as did silk and wool goods by the yard . <p> 1950s-This was a time of decadence as reflected in the Parisian-influenced fashions , which used many yards of fabric that were manufactured in larger widths than ever before . Sewing for the home flourished . Vogue implemented a special line of patterns highlighting big designer names such as Jacques Heim , Elsa Schiaparelli , and Christian Dior . <p> Pattern envelope information-The first place that you will find some differences is right on the pattern envelope . Here , aside from the beautiful artwork and lithographs of the garments , you will find a variety of information , such as yardage charts and instruction . <p> One area in particular that can be confusing is the yardage recommendations . The reason is that before the mid-1950s , fabrics were available in narrower widths than those of our contemporary fabrics . Back in the day , fabric was rationed to be affordable , so fabric cuts of 36 or 39 inches wide ( rather than today 's 45- to 60-inch widths ) were commonplace . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shop for fabric . <p> Pattern format-You 'll also discover that the format of pre-1950s vintage patterns varies from the preprinted tissue sheets we know today . With vintage patterns , the tissue paper pieces come pre-cut and devoid of any printing . Only McCall featured the " Printo Gravure " pattern ( the earliest printed pattern ) in the early 1920s . Instead of printing , machine-made perforations , consisting of circles , squares , and triangles , were used to indicate information like the straight of grain line , marking symbols , and notches . Making it even more confusing , the meaning of these perforations also varied from company to company . Often , not even the maker 's name or pattern number is included on each piece . Rather , you 'll find them marked with a perforated number or letter corresponding to a diagram . I recommend labelling the pieces on your traced off version to avoid any mix-ups . <p> To help you figure out these sometimes elusive marks and to get you familiar with the types you 'll encounter , here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles lined up in pairs with a few inches between them typically indicate the grainline . Large circles alone typically indicate stop-stitching points , button positions , center fronts , or seam allowances with a let-out . <p> Small , individual circles around the edges of the pattern indicate the seam allowance , and small circles in a series of two or three close together indicate matching points . <p> Two small circles placed a small distance apart indicate buttonhole placement and length . <p> Square perforations , prevalent in Vogue patterns , typically refer to the placement of buttonholes . <p> Triangular perforations , also found often in Vogue patterns , indicate where to match one part of a pattern piece to another . <p> Pattern instruction-In the earliest commercial patterns , very little instruction was included because it was assumed that the majority of women knew how to sew most any garment . Starting in the mid-1920s , pattern companies began printing more detailed instructions , layout diagrams , and schematics of the pieces on a separate sheet . Depending on how old your pattern is , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you may need to look to the Web or to sewing manuals for guidance . <p> Depending on the company and the year of manufacture , seam allowances may be 3/8,1/2 , 3/4 or 5/8 inch . Rather than being standard , seam allowances were set by each pattern manufacturer . For example , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Butterick Publishing Company patterns had 3/4-inch seam allowances at some edges , and a standard 3/8-inch allowance on all the remaining edges . It was n't until the early 1940s that the company established a standard uniform seam allowance of 5/8 inch . <p> Sizing standards-When addressing size , the first thing you 'll note is that vintage patterns come one size per envelope . This means you 'll often need to grade a pattern you like to your size . <p> Next , the sizing standards ( the set of body measurements ) that were once used are not the same standards used today . For example , a pattern in size 18 from before the late 1950s was made to fit a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low hip ( taken 7 inches below the natural waistline ) . Generally , today 's pattern size 18 has been made to fit a 40-inch bust , 32-inch waist , and 42-inch low hip . So , when choosing a size , be sure to look at the measurements on the envelope rather than going by the given size . <p> - <p> - A cut-away shoulder and detachable scarf make this jacket pattern a star . <p> - <p> Fitting issues-Not only were women built differently in the past , but garments were made to fit closer to the body than they are today . This varied ease and fit may require you to make some alterations . <p> In particular , a surprising amount of ease is often found at the bustline , even for sizes smaller than B cup . Especially with pre-1940s McCall patterns , the placement of the bust dart is also quite high . By lowering the bust dart , however , you can eliminate any extra ease here . <p> Another common area of adjustment is in the long rise of trouser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be as much as 1-1/2 inches of additional length built into the rise that does n't fit with today 's style or taste . You may also need to adjust the ease of set-in sleeve styles at the armscye and the shoulder , as it can be restricting . <p> Although some of these vintage pattern quirks can be frustrating , knowing about them ahead of time let 's you focus on what is an otherwise truly rewarding experience . <p> How to handle a vintage patternNow that you know the ins and outs of vintage patterns , here 's how to get the best results : <p> Always trace off the pattern-Because of their delicate nature , it is imperative that you make a copy of your pattern to work from . To remove the factory folds for ease of tracing , gently press each pattern piece on a low heat , dry iron setting . Then , lightly trace each piece onto your pattern paper using a pencil , or a pen that will not bleed through . Be sure to transfer all markings , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notches . I also find it helpful to number the pieces and check to make sure you 're not missing any . <p> Make a muslin to fit-When working with any pattern , it 's always a good idea to make a muslin to ensure a good fit . Considering all of the fitting and sizing differences in vintage patterns , it 's even more important . Aside from adjusting the fit , a muslin let 's you take a practice run at figuring out how the sometimes complicated pattern shapes go together , and at using vintage techniques with which you may not be familiar . <p> Embrace vintage sewing techniques-The old saying , " When in Rome , do as the Romans do " goes for vintage patterns , too . Although they require more time and effort than some of our modern methods , in some cases using the vintage sewing techniques your pattern intended can yield you a better-looking , more authentic garment . Here are a few old-time methods to embrace : <p> Bias bindings . Since linings were rare , rayon bias bindings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding was used in lightweight fabrics and a single fold bias binding for heavier fabrics . Photo : Deana Tierney . <p> - <p> Bound buttonholes . Bound buttonholes were the prevalent method for creating buttonholes in vintage clothing . The edges of the buttonholes are finished with a stitched-on fabric or leather binding to create a beautiful garment detail. - <p> - <p> - <p> Tailor 's tacks . Long before tracing wheels and carbon dressmaker 's paper , the traditional method of transferring markings from the pattern piece onto the fabric was with tailor 's tacks . In light of the unique symbols and perforations in vintage patterns , I find that tailor 's tacks work best at transferring the markings accurately . <p> - <p> - <p> Pattern in actionTo take you step-by-step through some of the common techniques that show up in vintage patterns , we chose this stunning Butterick Starred Pattern 5156 , A Katharine Hepburn Frock , designed in 1933 . This design was modeled after an actual garment worn by Katharine Hepburn in the film Christopher Strong . <p> Get in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designed to allow for ease in taking a garment on and off , were predominantly made of buttons , snaps , and hooks . Although the zipper was developed by the early 1930s , it did n't become widely available to home sewers until after World War II . <p> Here 's how to install a continuous lap placket closure , as seen in the Butterick Starred Pattern 5156 ( above ) : <p> 1 . Stitch the left side seam leaving an opening between markings for the placket . Press the stitched section of the side seam open . Clip to the stitching through the seam allowances at each end of the opening . Cut a strip of self or lighter weight fabric on grain . In this case , the strip is 2-1/8 inch wide and 1 inch longer than two times the opening length . <p> 2 . With right sides together , stitch the strip to the unfinished opening edges , making sure to position the strip ends at the bottom of the opening . <p> 3 . Wrap the raw edge over the seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garment opening . <p> 4 . Close the middle of the opening ( generally at the natural waistline ) with a hook and bar and the remainder of the opening with snaps . <p> Add a gusset for range of motion-A gusset is a design element located at the underarm of a garment that enables the wearer to completely move her arm . <p> Here 's how to apply a gusset at the underam of a kimono-sleeve-style jacket , as seen in the Butterick Starred Pattern 5156 ( above ) : <p> 1 . After stitching the side seam of the bodice and the underarm sleeve seam , slash the inner points at the underarm to about 3 inches into the garment to create the gusset opening . Then , overcast the edges . <p> 2 . Turn under the gusset opening edges along the marks and baste . Baste the edges of the gusset to the opening matching the perforated marks . <p> 3 . Edge stitch around the gusset , trim the seam allowances to 3/8 inch , and overcast . <p> Go for old-school hems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage pattern instructions . Here 's how to put them to work in your garment : <p> Bias facing . Bias facings provide a narrow finish to neck or armhole edges . To create a bias facing , cut a bias strip about 1-1/2 inches wide and , with right sides together , sew one edge to the garment opening . Make slashes in the curved edges so the material does n't pull . Turn the strip to the inside so the facing strip does n't show on the outside , then turn under the raw edge of the strip and whipstitch on the strip edge , catching the garment occasionally . <p> Rayon seam binding tape . Seam binding tape and rayon seam tape were used to finish the raw edges of hems on sleeves , jackets , trousers , and skirts before there were serging machines . <p> The tape is lapped over the raw edge , and machine-stitched along the top edge of the hem . The hem is then turned up , pressed , and hand-stitched through the tape to the garment . <p> Magazine extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds owns the vintage pattern Web site EvaDress.com , which sells original and reproduction vintage patterns . <p> SubscriberinNYC writes : The declaration in the article that " women were built differently in the past " is rather silly , and made me guffaw out loud !

And to brocadegoddess - thank you for your comment ! <p> Of course , foundation garments changed throughout history to accommodate the fashions that were popular . Before the 1920s , corsets cinched the waist and emphasized the bust ; in the 1920s , corsets and long line girdles flattened the bust and de-emphasized the waist by smoothing the waist and hips , as a straight line was more desirable ( in addition , the 1920s was the first time suspenders were attached to girdles and corsets to attach to and hold up stockings .

Although I 'm quite familiar with using vintage patterns already there were a couple tid bits I had n't thought of before . And this will be uber helpful to those starting out ! <p> I 'd like to point out one prissy detail though . The reason that some of the proportions of vintage patterns/garments are different from those of today has to do with undergarments , not the way women were built . Humans have been built the same way for about 2 million years now . What was different in the fashion periods up to the 60s were foundation garments - pretty much all women wore them . These modify the body 's natural shape and did different things to it depending on the time period . 1920s foundation garments were geared towards creating the boyishly streamlined and angular silhouette then popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating curves and hourglass figures . <p> So a note to people venturing into vintage patterns : do n't expect it to look *exactly* like the envelope/illustration unless you 're willing to wear foundation garments similar to those of the period , or at least those that will create a similar effect . <p> This does n't mean it wo n't still look fabulous , it just may not have exactly the same silhouette .

A separating zipper for a jacket requires that you remove the top stop and take off old slider and put new one on . Test before putting the top stop back on .

Doing so allows the fabric 's main feature-its wales-to balance the pattern 's design . Since corduroys vary so widely in weight , be sure to choose one that 's appropriate for the garment and the amount of ease you want . Soft , fine-wale corduroys work well for dresses , vests , blouses , and softer skirts . For skirts , jackets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 wales/in . And for coats and other outerwear , jumbo- or wide-wale corduroys are great . <p> Since corduroy is a napped fabric-one whose pile looks different ( that is , reflects light differently ) when viewed from various positions-you 'll need additional fabric to follow a napped layout , with all the pattern pieces lying in the same direction , as discussed below in Nap layout is essential . I suggest purchasing an extra yard of fabric to allow for shrinkage , nap layout , stitch testing , and creative ideas ( like trying out some bias-cut pieces ) . <p> Ready the corduroy before cuttingIf you 're planning to wash the garment after sewing , always preshrink the fabric ( plus any lining , zipper , interfacing , or underlining ) before cutting . If you plan to dry-clean the completed garment , you may still want to prewash the uncut fabric for a softer , cushier texture . <p> Plan for a good fit-If a corduroy garment binds or fits too tightly , the fabric will show stress wrinkles , often at the upper sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttonholes . Avoid premature wear by adjusting the pattern 's fit , adding enough wearing ease to prevent binding . <p> Establish the grainlines-Before cutting the pattern , check the fabric 's grain by pulling a crossgrain thread and cutting along the line created . Place the fabric on a large table or cutting mat . If the crosswise and lengthwise grains are n't at right angles , pin the selvage and the cut edge square , then steam the fabric with a hot iron held just above it , gently urging the wrinkles in the fabric to flatten . This works quickly to straighten most corduroys . <p> Use " low-impact " pressing onlyWhether you 're preparing the fabric for cutting or maintaining a finished garment , press corduroy as little as possible . Allowing the weight of the iron to rest on a napped fabric can permanently crush it . Corduroys shed most wrinkles if they 're left to hang for a day or two , or you can steam just above the surface . <p> During the construction of the garment , try a few " low-impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply only the tip of the iron where it 's needed , lifting and lowering the iron in an up-and-down motion . To meld stitches after sewing a seamline , lay the seam on a thick towel ( fluff the towel in the dryer if it flattens ) , and steam-press lightly along the stitching line so the tip of the iron barely covers the stitches and the body of the iron lies in the seam allowance . To press open a seam , lay it over a towel on a shaped surface ( such as the edge of a sleeve board turned on its side ) , and touch just the tip of the iron to the stitching line . Avoid pressing seam-allowance edges into the garment , because they 'll leave an impression on the right side . <p> Nap layout is essentialBefore cutting out a garment , decide which way you want the fabric 's nap to run . First determine the direction of the nap by stroking the nap parallel to the selvage . The pile feels smooth when you brush in the same direction as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the nap running up the fabric , the corduroy looks darker ; with the nap running down , it looks lighter and shinier ( if you have trouble determining the direction of the nap , try draping the fabric around your shoulders and see which side looks darker ) . Skirts and pants wear better with the nap running down , which makes the seat area less likely to shine . Coats , jackets , and blouses look richer with the nap running up . Whichever nap direction you choose , cut the pattern following a nap layout , that is , with the tops of all pattern pieces ( except those placed on the crossgrain or bias ) toward the same end of the fabric . <p> Most wide-wale corduroys look best when handled like a striped design and the wales are matched . A good guideline is to match wales 1/4 in. or wider and to match corduroys with alternating thick and thin wales . To avoid fabric shifting when cutting a wide-wale corduroy , place it in a single layer , wrong side up . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrong sides together . <p> Check your fabric to see if pins leave marks ; if so , pin in the seam allowance or use weights to anchor during cutting . Avoid marking corduroy with a tracing wheel , which can leave a permanent imprint . Instead , mark with chalk , temporary marking pens , tailors ' tacks , or thread tracing . <p> Corduroy : the inside storyTo construct the inside of a corduroy garment successfully , you 'll need a few techniques that are different from what you might choose for another fabric . <p> Do n't use fusible interfacing , since fusing will crush corduroy 's nap . Instead , use a sew-in interfacing that attaches to adjacent seams . <p> - <p> Photo : Karen Morris <p> - <p> Consider lightweight facings . For professional-looking results on a more fitted garment , you may want to replace corduroy facings with a lighter-weight fabric , such as a fine cotton . This reduces bulk inside the fitted jacket at right . Be sure to prewash the fabric as you did the corduroy . A coordinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment while eliminating a layer of the bulkier corduroy . It also allows you to apply fusible interfacing to the facings , if desired . <p> Opt for a full lining . A full lining makes many corduroy garments more comfortable and easier to slip on . Since a lining eliminates many facings ( such as on a vest ) as well as the need to finish seam allowances , you may find it 's the easiest way to polish the inside of the garment . <p> Tricks to sewing corduroyAlthough most corduroys are easy to sew , they require special care to prevent the layers from creeping during stitching and to reduce bulk where several layers join . A plain , pressed-open seam works best with corduroy fabrics , and there are a few special tips for creating flawless , flat results . Start with a Universal H needle ( from size 70/10 for lightweight to size 100/16 for heavyweight corduroy ) and long-staple polyester , cotton , or cotton-wrapped polyester thread . <p> Test-stitch on a two-layer swatch-Begin by sewing a test seam with two pieces of fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fabric weight , from 2mm ( 12 to 14 sts/in. ) for lightweight corduroy to 3mm ( 8 sts/in. ) for heavier ones . Loosen the upper tension slightly , and lighten the pressure on the presser foot , if it 's adjustable on your machine . Hold the fabric taut while stitching , and always sew in the direction of the nap . A roller or even-feed foot helps the top layer feed the same as the bottom . Every inch or two , stop sewing ( with the needle down ) to raise and lower the presser foot , which relaxes the fabric and reduces creeping . <p> Examine the stitching line . It should be smooth and without puckers , and the two layers should come out even at the end . If your underlayer creeps during stitching or if the seam puckers , experiment with the options above to remedy the problem . <p> On long vertical seams that are prone to creeping , I sometimes hand-baste the seam before stitching , using a brightly colored rayon thread that will be easy to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a seam , which adds bulk , I like to start and finish seams in corduroy garments by sewing tiny stitches ( about 20 sts/in. ) for the first and last 1/2 in. , which allows the seam to be pressed perfectly flat . <p> Eliminate unnecessary bulk-Since the pile on corduroy can result in bulky areas where several layers of fabric join , it 's important to reduce bulk at these points . Do so by trimming and grading seam allowances after you stitch and press , and by trimming the corners of seam allowances where two seams cross . Clip curved seams as little as possible , staggering the clips so they 're not opposite each other and clipping at an angle to reduce raveling . <p> - <p> Shave off extra bulk on any seam allowance to be enclosed inside the garment , like at a jacket 's neck and front edges . A hair clipper , used carefully , removes just the nap and gives a flatter finish . Photo : Karen Morris . <p> - <p> In areas to be enclosed by a facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile from the seam allowances after stitching , as shown at right . I 've used an electric hair clipper with good results . But since it can slip and bite into the main fabric , it 's a good idea to protect the outer layer with sheets of paper under the seam allowances while clipping . <p> Wherever many layers meet you 'll have problems with bulk if you 're making a heavyweight corduroy jacket or coat . For example , in the lower front corner where the front facing overlaps the lower hem , you can easily reduce the bulk by mitering the corner . This quick process will produce a smooth , flat finish . Mitering works well with a hem and facing of both even and uneven widths . <p> To miter a corner , first fold the hem and facing into normal position , and mark the points where they intersect with chalk or a water-soluble marker and the outer corner with a pin , as shown at far left . Right sides together , match the chalk marks and sew from the marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving a narrow seam allowance ( you can shave off the seam-allowance pile , as shown above , if desired ) , clip the point , and press open . When you turn the point to the outside , you 've made a perfect mitered corner , as shown on the facing page at bottom right . <p> Mitering a corner reduces the bulk of many layers of corduroy , and works with hems of uneven widths . Fold hems in and mark where they intersect ( left ) . After stitching ( right ) , the mitered corner lies smooth and flat . <p> Polish the finishing details-Since the cut edges of corduroy will continue to ravel and fray as a garment is washed , you 'll need to add a sturdy finish to the seam allowances on unlined garments . Finish straight seams after pressing them open . Finish curved seams after stitching , before clipping and pressing them open . My favorite seam treatment is the Hong Kong finish , sewn with bias tape or rayon seam tape . <p> Topstitching looks great on corduroy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bolder line of stitching , use a topstitching thread or two strands of regular thread with a needle one size larger than that used to construct the garment , and a stitch length of 3.5 to 4mm ( 6 sts/in . ) . Always pretest any topstitching , pockets , buttonholes , and other treatments on swatches before applying them to your actual garment . <p> In areas where you do n't want topstitching , corduroy looks great with an invisible hem . My favorite technique is to finish the raw edge with zigzagging or a two-thread overcasting stitch on the serger , then sew the hem by hand using the blind-hemming stitch , as shown in the drawing below . The stitches float between the hem and the garment , so the edge of the hem does not press into the garment and make an impression on the right side . <p> A final note on garment careTo prevent fading and maintain the bright colors of corduroy garments , turn them inside out before laundering in cold water . Remove the garment from the dryer while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams to relax wrinkles . To revive the nap , steam with an iron or hang the garment in a steamy bathroom , allowing it to dry completely before wearing . Alternatively , try brushing against the nap with another piece of corduroy fabric . To prevent hanger marks on skirts and pants , sew seam-tape hanger loops into the waistband . <p> Once you try some of these techniques , you 'll discover that corduroy is a pleasure to sew on .

This makes every subsequent step more accurate . <p> Photo : Ann Steeves <p> As you know from reading this blog , I enjoy quick projects . But now that the holidays are over , I can take my time and make something bigger . After reading Amber Eden 's letter about Slow Sewing in No. 135 of our sister publication , Threads , I was inspired . I decided to slow down and make something whose instructions do n't begin with , " Start with a rectangle X inches by Y inches . " I decided to make a jacket . <p> I love jackets .

This means that I spread my fabric out in one layer and cut each piece twice .

Cut Your Fabric , Lining , and InterfacingI cut all my garment elements ( fabric , lining , and interfacing ) in one session so I have them all ready to go and in one place . Once that 's all done , it 's off to the sewing room ! <p> Cut all of your fabric first so you are prepared to start sewing . <p> Make the Lining First " Huh ? " you might say , " Make the lining first ? " That 's right . Contrary to what the standard pattern instructions say , I always make the lining first . The reason for this is two-fold . First , the lining can act as a muslin : If you need to make any fitting tweaks , you can catch them before you assemble your garment shell . Second - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order - by making the lining first , I avoid " project fatigue " . You know that feeling ?

Making the lining first avoids that fate . <p> Assemble the LiningApply the interfacing to the facings and then stitch the lining pieces together . Here are a couple of hints that I use . On a princess-line garment , staystitch the back and/or front pieces as indicated in the instructions . But before pinning the back to the side back , clip to the staystitching at about 1-inch intervals . This will help you accurately distribute the stretch , and you can always clip more if you need it . <p> Start by applying interfacing to the facing pieces that will be joined to the lining . <p> - <p> When making a jacket , clip to the staystiching first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sew the back and side-back pieces together first , then I sew the front and side-front pieces together .

@@22149033 @2149033/ <p> When starting a new sewing project , - a lot of us select the pattern , then the fabric , and finally , find a spool of thread that precisely matches the chosen fabric color . Where 's the fun in that ? The truth is , there are hundreds of thread types that could elevate a project to the next level . Some thread types that are widely available and worth considering include : variegated cotton , multicolor rayon , metallic , holoshimmer metallic , glow-in-the-dark , and invisible . Below , I 'll discuss these varieties and provide some tips for using them on your next project . <h> 1 . Variegated cotton thread <p> Variegated cotton thread is nearly identical- to- traditional cotton sewing thread . The only difference is that its color changes every few inches . This enables you to create unique , colorful- designs on a variety of projects with little effort . While- this thread type- can be used- on multicolored fabric , it- shows up- best on contrasting solid-colored fabric . <h> 2 . Multicolor rayon thread <p> This thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it may look similar , multicolor rayon thread- is smoother and more lustrous than variegated cotton thread . It is also stronger than cotton and silk threads of the same weight . It does n't require any special tools or machine adjustments to make- gorgeous designs such as the one- shown below . <h> 3 . Metallic thread <p> Add- glitz to any- project with this- strong , lustrous thread . <p> Metallic thread is extremely smooth , strong , and pliable . It is easy to use and provides a great accent to- any- decorative design . For best results , slightly loosen the- top thread tension , use a lightweight thread in the bobbin , and avoid creating small stitches . <h> 4 . Holoshimmer metallic thread <p> Holoshimmer metallic thread has similar properties to metallic thread . However , its makeup is slightly different . Whereas most- threads are- produced- by twisting two fibers together , holoshimmer thread is composed of a thin , flat , ribbon-like foil- that is laminated with polyester to create this- stunning reflective effect . To- properly sew with this thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly lower the top thread tension , use a lightweight thread in the bobbin , and avoid creating small stitches . <p> The- eye-catching sparkle from this decorative stitch is sure to- brighten any design . <h> 5 . Glow-in-the-dark thread <p> In addition to- animating Halloween costumes , this product is great for accenting- decorative pillows , promotional items , and exercise apparel . <p> This 100-percent polyester glow-in-the-dark- thread can be a fun- add-on to any project . Depending on the manufacturer , this thread 's glow can last for up to 20 minutes after the lights are turned off . Better yet , no special sewing tools are required . Just be sure to use a cool iron , if needed , to prevent the thread from melting . <h> 6 . Invisible thread <p> Invisible thread resembles fine fishing line and is available in nylon and polyester varieties . The polyester option is recommended , however , because it can withstand higher iron and dryer settings . <p> If you are having a hard time finding thread that matches multiple fabric colors , invisible thread is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things easier . The clear option is for light-colored fabrics , while the smoke color is meant for use with dark-colored fabrics . For best sewing results , place the invisible thread spool in the vertical spool pin and loosen the- top thread tension . You also can use invisible thread in the bobbin if you wind it slowly . Be sure to loosen the bobbin's- tension as well .

But there are so many stitches to choose from , it 's hard to know which stitch to use on which fabric or when not to serge at all . Some of these questions can be answered by learning the standard serger stitches and their attributes . <p> Be aware that not all sergers can make every stitch , so check the machine 's manual to see what it can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure the model you choose has the stitches you want . <p> To decide whether to use your serger instead of a conventional machine , it 's important first to understand the difference in these two types of stitches : On a serger , the looper threads are looped and interlaced-in effect , knitted-with the needle thread(s) ; on a standard machine , the bobbin thread locks with the needle thread. - <p> Next think about your fabric , how you 'll use it , and how often you 'll wash it . Will it be a knit you 'll wash frequently ? A woven destined for sportswear and a one-season life span ? Or a sheer , crinkled fabric for a loose-fitting garment ? In all these cases , the serger is the way to go for seaming and edge-finishing . But if you 're making a straight wool skirt or a linen blazer , serging the seams will yield bulky lines rather than the smoothness of pressed-open seams . And if you plan to line your garment , finishing edges with the serger is a waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selecting a serger stitch <p> When you do opt for a serged seam or edge-finish , choose the stitch that matches the needs of your garment . Keep in mind that a serger stitch with fewer threads can have a lot of strength and stretch . Stitches with more threads tend to be bulkier rather than stronger , though there are exceptions , like the superstretch , three-thread wrapped stitch . And stitches incorporating the chainstitch make a stable , nonstretchy seam . <p> As a rule , use a narrow stitch with fewer threads for lightweight fabrics , wrapped stitches for maximum stretch on knit seams , overlock stitches for standard seams on knits and wovens , and wider overlock stitches with the most threads for ravelly or bulky fabrics . Flatlock stitches are wonderful for sportswear that needs to be comfy on the inside , and rolled-hem stitches finish delicate sheers beautifully . Thread tensions may need adjustment depending on the particular fabric and for flatlock and wrapped stitches . <p> To reduce the bulkiness of serged seams that use a lot of thread , use a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sample first . If the stitches are too far apart , the resulting seam may not be strong enough , especially on loosely woven fabrics. - <p> On many machines , for two- and three-thread stitches , you can choose between using the left needle for a wide stitch , the right for a narrow stitch , or using the machine 's rolled-hem function to produce a very narrow stitch ( see the photo at left ) . And do n't forget embellishment : Take advantage of the fact that a serger 's loopers do n't pierce the fabric , meaning you can use heavier , decorative thread in one or both loopers to turn a seam or edge-finish into a design element . <p> The names of the stitches may be confusing at first , and may vary slightly from manual to manual , but all relate to how the stitches are formed . Two-thread stitches are generally called overedge , or overcast , because the threads do n't interlace at the needle . Three- , four- , and five- thread stitches are referred to as overlocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knot at the needle line . And when the looper thread completely encircles the edge of the fabric on some two- and three-thread stitches , the stitches are called wrapped . <p> Once you become familiar with the wide variety of stitches offered on sergers , you 'll develop a sense of when to use a stitch . Then use them often so your garments will look better and last longer . Here are just a few of your options . <p> Two-thread **25;760;TOOLONG : Special chain needle interacts with separate forward chain looper .

@@22149038 @2149038/ <p> In honor of the late Charles Kleibacker , here is another article from the pages of Threads about this masterful designer . <p> by David Page Coffinexcerpted from Threads #99 , p. 71 <p> Last summer , I spent a fascinating weekend in Columbus , Ohio , visiting designer , educator , and costume collector Charles Kleibacker . On the second floor of his garment- and memorabilia-packed townhouse , we cleared a small work space , and I settled in behind the camera to record an extraordinary and all-too-fleeting demonstration : the distillation of more than 30 years of professional experience in the creation of couture-quality , bias-cut garments . Drawing from an apparently endless series of overstuffed garment racks , Charles led me through the discoveries and techniques that formed the cornerstones of his technical career , encompassing both the behavior of fabric cut on the bias and the core procedures that he and his workroom staff employed to control and exploit it to such expressive and practical ends . In the following collection of photos and commentary , I 'll share with you what I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not symmetrical.No matter how balanced or similar the vertical and horizontal threads look on any fabric , they always drape differently because they were each subjected to different tensions during the weaving process . To demonstrate the effect of this difference on bias draping , Charles pins a single piece of muslin on true bias ( the 45-degree diagonal ) to the center front of a dress form . As a result , one side hangs from the lengthwise grain , and the other hangs from the crosswise grain . You can see how the folds on each side of center front fall differently . For Kleibacker , if the object is symmetrical bias draping , a center-front seam is needed to create identical draped folds on both halves ( he omits a center-front seam only if he wants to create an asymmetrical bias garment ) . The process starts with draping in muslin on one side of the form only , up to the central seam . This half-muslin is traced and duplicated to create a wearable muslin for fine-tuning on a live model before creating a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two layers of fashion fabric , pinned face to face , and thus mirrored for perfect symmetry . <p> A muslin square pinned to a dress form shows the drape of a true bias . <p> A center-front seam on bias-cut fabric allows identical drape . <p> Lesson 2 - Pin and slip-baste from the garment 's right side.Right-side pinning ensures absolute accuracy , as all seams are prepared and can hang just as they will when worn . Careful pinning distributes ease and allows precise matching of design lines . Once pinned , Kleibacker slip-bastes seams by hand and then permanently machine-stitches them from the wrong side . Slip-bastings are removed before the seam is pressed . <p> Garments are pinned from the right side to ensure accuracy . <p> In the sleeveless muslin prototype for this garment , you can clearly see the painstakingly pinned easing typical of a draped , bias-cut Kleibacker garment beneath the bustline seam and the neckline , which has been simply pinched on the right-hand side to show the exact amount of excess length . The eased fabric is not steamed flat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie perfectly smooth in the fashion fabric . <p> Typical easing on a Kleibacker neckline is painstakingly pinned . <p> Kleibacker is particularly fastidious about easing away any hint of gaping in a neckline . He recommends that this be done to improve patterns that do n't include it . Here , on his 1970s designer pattern for a wrapped dress , he has added both a seam and easing to the left-hand bodice to eliminate the gaping in the unaltered right-hand neckline . <p> A seam and easing eliminates gaping on the left side of the dress . <p> Lesson 3 - Fabrics cut on the bias either have " drag " or " lift . " <p> Fabrics such as crOpe , jersey , and charmeuse are among the fabrics that can be said to " drag " or " drip " on the bias . Fabrics such as taffeta , chiffon , broadcloth , and organza float or " lift " on the bias . Either type can be adapted to create a beautiful garment , but drag is better suited to revealing the form underneath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesson 4 - Ease a neckline by pinning it to a length of seam tape . No matter how plunging the necklines on his dresses , Charles always wanted to be sure the wearer would be comfortable in the dress without the neckline gaping . The technique for easing away a gaping neckline is tedious but not especially challenging . It requires the seam allowance of the neckline to be used as a hand-overcast self-facing ( so the neckline edge is a fold , not a seam ) with the fabric eased into thin , stable rayon seam tape . To determine the length of the tape , pinch the excess fabric at the neckline into a small fold , measure the adjusted neckline , and then mask this measurement on the tape . Pin the tape at each end of the neckline , and ease the fabric to the tape with closely spaced pins . <p> The neckline is eased into measured seam tape . <p> First , pin to ease the excess into the seam tape . <p> Next , make a row of tiny , permanent running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a very short needle and a single strand of size-A , matching silk thread . <p> Then , use a short needle to sew the excess to the seam tape . <p> Carefully press from the inside of the garment to render the easing invisible . <p> Press from the wrong side for a smooth surface . <p> Properly pressed ease is invisible . <p> Seam tape also prevents stretching . <p> In the Kleibacker studio , all neckline ( and top back edges to many designs ) were eased with seam tape to reinforce them and prevent any possibility of stretching . For the muslin , the seamline at the bust was eased differently . Here , a tiny hand-sewn running stitch was made both at the seamline and just above it in the seam allowance . These two threads were pulled to the desired measurement . The fabric was carefully pressed on the wrong side and then pinned to the corresponding seamline for slip-basting . <p> To Slip-Baste A Right-Side Pinned Seam <p> After carefully pinning any seam from the RS to establish its position or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle through the bottom layer , using a running stitch that comes up into the edge-fold of the top layer . <p> When ready to sew , turn garment inside out , and unfold the seam allowance . Then machine-stitch on top of the slip-basting . Slip-bastings must be removed before you press the seams . <p> Lesson 5 - Baste some bias seams before cutting , and stretch them while machine-stitching . <p> After transferring the seamlines from the pattern to the layers of fabric positioned right sides together as described in lesson 1 , the bias seams were always hand-basted while still flat on the cutting table and before the pieces were cut because bias edges tend to stretch once cut . Certain bias seams , typically center-front and center-back seams , edges of sashes and bands , and the narrow cording often called " spaghetti straps " were also stretched during the machine-stitching process , ensuring the seams would never break . ( Bias seams joining asymmetrical pieces were usually not stretched . ) To allow for this intense stretching , such seams must first be hand-basted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , start at the seam end with a knot , baste about 6 inches , and cut the thread . Then , without knotting the end , baste another 6 inches , overlapping the last few stitches of the preceding basting . Repeat about every 6 inches , tightly securing the basting at the very end . To make spaghetti straps , cut true bias strips 3/4 inch wide , fold them in half lengthwise , hand-baste with overlapping running stitches , and then stretch as strongly as possibly while machine-stitching along the center of the strip . Turn without trimming the seam allowances , allowing them to fill the turned tube . For maximum skinniness , stretch the straps on the ironing board , pinning the ends . Steam heavily by holding the iron closely above them , restretch , and let them dry . <p> Sew short overlapping lengths of basting stitches before stretching fabric , and stretch the strap while machine-stitching . <p> Stretch the strap while machine-stitching . <p> Charles Kleibacker stretches a bias band after it has been machine-stitched to make sure it shows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ) <p> elkhornkate writes : Regarding #4 - where can you GET rayon seam tape ? it seems to be no longer available .

Although the zippers are functional ( they can be opened and closed ) , none of these zipper installations are garment openings . The zippers were installed over slot seams , as described in the article. - <p> You can add a zipper where there was n't one before by creating a new seamline , as well . To do it , draw a straight line on the pattern where you want to position the zipper . Cut the pattern along the line and add a 5/8-inch seam allowance to each side when cutting the fabric . Then , install an exposed zipper. -

@@22149042 @2149042/ <h> Working with Embellished Fabrics , Part I <p> I 've had a piece of beautifully embellished silk chiffon for a while . A recent studio re-organization turned it up , and I think it 's time to work with it . It 's very heavily decorated with glass seed and bugle beads , metallic thread embroidery , and sequins . The ornamentation is so thick that you really have to search to see any of the chiffon underlay . This fantastic material inspires a tutorial about working with extremely embellished fabric . I 'll take you through the process as I create a garment . <p> I 'm going to break this project down into two sections . Part 2 will be covered in another post . Here , in Part 1 , I 'm going to explain how to : <p> 1 . Check the fabric to make sure the embellishments are securely sewn on2 . Attach an underlining3 . Remove the beads from the seam allowances of the side seams4 . Deal with the darts5 . Sew and catch-stitch the side seams6 . Prepare the lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design and the fabric . I am going to keep the design simple " a straight skirt ( very slightly pegged at the hem ) , without a waistband , underlined with silk organza and lined with silk charmeuse . There 's about a yard of fabric . At 45 inches wide , it 's not wide enough to go around me , ( especially considering seam allowances ) . As the embellishments are symmetrical from side to side , I cut it down the middle ( parallel to the selvedges ) and create two identical pieces which I 'll use horizontally . <p> - <p> Cut it down the middle ( parallel to the selvedges ) . <p> - <p> - <p> Create two identical pieces which I 'll use horizontally <p> With a minimal hem ( I 'll add a facing ) and a simple treatment at the waistline , I 'll end up with a skirt that 's about 22 inches long . It wo n't be the longest skirt in the world , but there 's a lot going on embellishment-wise , so less is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the way , use your oldest scissors for this sort of cutting job " inevitably you will be cutting through beads . <p> 1 . Check embellished fabric carefully after you have cut out pattern pieces . Embellishments are typically applied with a tambour hook " and while that allows the embellisher to work at great speed , applying a tremendous number of beads quickly and easily ( once adept at the technique ) , it 's a bit of a liability . The embellishments are applied with a chain stitch , so once a thread is pulled , it can keep on pulling , removing the beads as it goes . Stabilize threads that have worked their way loose ( a little dab of tacky glue on the reverse side works well , as do a few stitches in place ) . It might be necessary to do some filling in , so save any loose embellishments . <p> 2 . Keep your pattern as simple as possible and eliminate any seams that you can . I 've got a good straight skirt pattern , so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using carbon paper to trace the stitching lines , the darts , the waistline and the hemline .

The zipper will go along the left side seam instead of down the center back . <p> Pin the organza to the chiffon as carefully and symmetrically as possible . Steam the layers ( from the silk organza side ) to help mesh them , and do a fair amount of basting and internal tacking to keep the layers together . The embellished fabric is really heavy , and you do n't want it to sag , either now or later . Keep it in line by joining it to the well-behaved organza . <p> - <p> - <p> 3 . Before the side seams can be sewn , the glass beads need to be cleared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( those can stay ) , metallic thread embroidery ( that can stay ) , seed beads ( those have to go ) and bugle beads ( those also have to go ) . <p> Pin through the fashion fabric/organza unit on the wrong side , right along the seamline . <p> - <p> - <p> Then , working from the right side and using the pins as a guide , you can see where beads have to be removed . <p> - <p> - <p> Work carefully , though , cutting only through the threads that hold the beads on , not through the underlying fabric . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> The seam allowance is now free of beads . <p> - <p> - <p> Go back to working on the wrong side of the fabric : Peel back the organza a little bit , and dab glue over the loose threads wherever beads were removed ; use a really tacky , quick-drying fabric glue . <p> - <p> - <p> Once that 's dried , smooth the organza back into place and baste the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> - <p> There should n't be any beads in the seam allowance ; if any were overlooked , remove them . <p> 4 . Now it 's time to deal with the darts .

The stitches ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fabric ( which is a good thing ! ) , but they can be seen on the underside . <p> - <p> The stitches ( and the new seam ) are pretty invisible from the right side of the fabric . <p> - <p> - <p> They can be seen on the underside . <p> - <p> It 's is a good idea to do this sort of shaping on a ham , as it sort of mimics the contours of the body . <p> It is n't necessary for shaping to be right over the darts ; it just needs to be in the same general area , and eliminate the same amount of excess from the embellished fabric as from the darts . <p> 5 . Now it 's time for the side seams . Thoroughly pin the side seams , taking care to line up the patterns in the embellishments perfectly . <p> - <p> - <p> Use fork pins " they do a superb job of keeping the two layers ( four layers , really , counting the organza ) from shifting as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stitching line , right alongside the beads that are still in the body of the fabric . <p> I often sew these sorts of seams twice ( stitching very slowly ) , just to make sure the stitching is good and tight . The loft of the fabric ( because of all the embellishments ) can make a tight seam a little challenging . Stitch very slowly " my theory is that by stitching slowly , the needle can sort of slide down alongside any beads that it encounters . If you stitch quickly , the needle can hit any errant beads directly " you 'll break beads , you 'll break needles , you 'll put holes in the underlying fabric ... so go slowly . <p> A few steps to finish up the side seams : Press them thoroughly , and catch-stitch the seam allowances to the silk organza underlining . This will keep them nice and flat . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Go back to secure the beads right along the seamlines , adding a few here and there to fill in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be filled in. - <p> - <p> Before . <p> - <p> - <p> After . <p> - <p> Now that it 's sewn together , I 'm really glad I went to the trouble of basting the embellished fabric so thoroughly to the silk organza " fabrics that are heavily ornamented with glass beads ( like this one ) get very heavy , and they need support . <p> 6 . Sew the silk charmeuse lining together ; there 's nothing tricky about that . Sew the darts and keep the left side seam open to accommodate the zipper. 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 13 ) <p> robinmckinney writes : Could I eliminate the center back seam on a wedding dress that has a train ?

@@22149043 @2149043/ <p> If you do n't want to embroider by hand but ca n't resist all those incredible decorative threads and ribbons that wo n't fit through a sewing-machine needle , why not try bobbin work ? It 's an old technique that you can use on garments as well as soft home furnishings , but it takes on a new dimension with all the wonderful threads available today . <p> - <p> Bobbin work adds surface texture and highlights the quilting on a vest with random rows of silk ribbon and varied weights of thread . <p> Essentially bobbin work amounts to sewing upside down-the decorative thread goes in the bobbin , and you sew from the wrong side- therefore the embellishment thread does n't need to go through the needle . You can use various types of stitches-straight , programmed , and free-motion-but , whatever your stitch choice , there are things to consider to get the desired effects . I 'll show you this easy technique and introduce you to threads you 've probably never considered using in the sewing machine . <p> You can use threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads and ribbons that can be used for bobbin work , and you 'll find some of them in craft stores , yarn shops , and your local fabric store . I group bobbin-work threads into four categories : decorative sergers threads ; needlepoint , cross stitch , and embroidery threads ; knitting yarns and crochet threads ; and craft and miscellaneous threads . <p> Knitting yarns and crochet threads include those like DMC pearl cotton and Cordonnet , and Knit-Cro Sheen and Cro-Sheen from Coats &amp; Clark . And craft and miscellaneous threads include such things as the designer threads from Threadline and fine novelty yarns from On the Surface . <p> What about the needle thread ? Before I address preparing your machine 's bobbin for this technique , I 'll mention additional factors that will make doing bobbin work more fun and give you the best results : <p> First , keep in mind that the needle thread will show a little on the right side ( remember , you 're stitching from the wrong side ) , since it will anchor and " couch " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of needle thread that works with the thread you 're using in the bobbin . Regular sewing thread is fine to use , or choose a thin , decorative thread , like a metallic , to add a bit of sparkle to your embroidery . You can also use monofilament thread in the needle , which is strong and invisible . It 's available in a clear color to use with light- to medium-colored bobbin threads , or in a smoke color to use with darker threads . Select a sewing-machine needle that 's appropriate for the thread you choose . <p> Consider the presser foot , too . For straight-stitching , use an all-purpose foot ; for free-motion stitching , a darning foot ; and for programmed stitches , an embroidery foot . <p> Configuration of a stitch : By sewing with fabric 's right side face down ( photo ) , the decorative bobbin thread shows on the right side . The needle thread can either match the bobbin thread-in this case , silk ribbon-or contrast with it for effect ( drawing ) . <p> Fabric and stabilizersI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including knits , velvets , and sheers , and in most cases , it 's necessary to use a stabilizer to prevent puckering . There 's not space in this article to fully cover stabilizers but I 'll give you an overview of the four types I use : tear-aways , water-soluble and liquid stabilizers , fusible stabilizers , and batting ( I do n't use heat-aways because they 're hard to remove entirely from stitched threads ) . <p> Tear-away stabilizers come in different weights , provide a sturdy backing , and generally can be easily removed from the stitched area . With elaborate stitch patterns , however , you may not be able to remove all the tear-away , and it will be visible on the wrong side . <p> Water-soluble and liquid stabilizers can be washed out after you have finished stitching , so be sure the fabric you use them on is washable . <p> Fusible stabilizers are permanent and generally add bulk to the fabric . Therefore , I do n't recommend them for garments , but they 're suitable for projects like place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be used as a permanent stabilizer . It gives a quilted effect and adds substantial body to the fabric to support the stitches . <p> To decide which stabilizer is best for the fabric and thread you 're using , do some bobbin-work stitches on a 12-in. test square of fabric with the stabilizer in place . <p> It 's a matter of tensionUsing thicker threads in the bobbin may require that you loosen the bobbin tension of your machine in order for the thread to flow easily through the hole in the needle plate . I 'll talk about that in a moment , but first , let me explain how machine tension in general affects the appearance of a stitch . The tension discs at the top of the machine are responsible for controlling the amount of drag placed on the needle thread . Similarly , the bobbin tension is responsible for how easily the thread flows from the bobbin case . If either tension is too tight , there is more resistance on the thread , which will affect the look of the stitch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bobbin tension is too loose , the stitches will be uneven . <p> Basic utility and built-in programmed stitches can look like hand embroidery ( above ) . Straight machine stitches take on a new life ( below ) , when sewn with heavy or novelty threads and silk ribbons in the bobbin . <p> It 's always wise to check the tension with every new thread you use by making a test sample on your chosen fabric . If the bobbin thread loops to the top of the fabric , the top tension may be too tight or the bobbin thread too loose , and the reverse may be true if the top thread pulls tightly to the fabric 's wrong side . You can also check the bobbin tension by pulling up a length of thread from the opening on the bobbin . For normal tension , it should pull out easily , but not too freely . <p> Two types of bobbinsThere are many makes and models of sewing machines , but only two types of bobbins : drop-in bobbins that fit into a built-in bobbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into a removable bobbin case that 's inserted into the machine from the front or the side . In order to adjust the bobbin tension for bobbin work on a top-loading bobbin , you may need to remove the cover plate and unscrew the bobbin case . Some machine manuals have instructions for adjusting this type of bobbin tension , but if you 're unsure how to make this adjustment , simply bypass the tension springs in the bobbin case and let the thread flow directly through the hole on the throat plate . If you have questions about your particular model , check with your dealer . <p> If your machine has a front- or side-loading bobbin , you 'll need to loosen the tiny screw on the bobbin case by turning it slightly to the left . Then , of course , you 'll need to bring the tension back for regular sewing . For this reason , I suggest getting a second bobbin case to use exclusively for bobbin work . <p> You may need to adjust the upper tension as well .

And remember to return it to its normal setting for regular sewing . <p> Winding the bobbinDecorative threads and ribbons that ca n't fit through the needle wo n't pass easily through a machine 's bobbin-winder tension points either . But you can still wind the bobbin on the machine : Start by feeding the thread end through the hole at the top of the bobbin , from the inside out , leaving a 1-in. to 2-in. tail of thread , and make three or four complete wraps around the bobbin by hand . Place the bobbin on the winding pin , click it in place , and trim the thread tail so it 's flush with the top of the bobbin . Then , place the thread spool on a pencil , pinch the thread between your thumb and forefinger to give it a little tension , and press the foot pedal slowly to engage the bobbin winder . You may need to guide the thread up and down the bobbin so that it fills evenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bobbin or it wo n't fit into the bobbin case . For ribbons and threads on a skein , start the process in the same way , but feed them over your fingers , being careful to keep ribbons flat and untwisted as they wrap around the bobbin . <p> Should the feed dogs be up or down ? You can use heavy threads and ribbons successfully in the bobbin with the feed dogs engaged as for regular sewing . And you can put the dogs down for free-motion stitching . <p> With feed dogs up , you can sew regular straight stitches , utility stitches , and programmed decorative stitches . For example , you can finish a garment using a simple straight stitch to achieve the look of elegant topstitching . Use a longer stitch length ( about 3mm ) to showcase the thread . And for more creative effects , loosen the bobbin tension as far as possible , and the thread will weave loosely back and forth , producing a lacy , free-form stitching line . Utility stitches take on a new dimension when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , looks more intricate . If you 're using programmed stitch patterns , stick to those with simple outlines . The more intricate patterns , or those that include satin stitches or tight reverse stitching , can cause puckering and/or create little tunnels under the stitching . Whatever stitch you choose , always experiment on a small square of fabric , since it 's hard to predict the results when using unconventional threads in the bobbin . <p> Free-motion stitching is another fun way to do bobbin work . You need to move the fabric along by hand , because the feed dogs are lowered and not there to help , but you can stitch in any direction you want . It 's best to use an embroidery hoop for free-motion work so you can keep the fabric as taught as possible , but some fabrics may require a stabilizer as well . And remember , you 'll mark and stitch on the wrong side of the fabric , so you do n't need to worry about the markings showing on the right side . <p> Starting and stoppingTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the needle thread until the bobbin thread comes to the top . Pull both threads behind the presser foot and stitch , taking several close-together stitches to lock the threads in place . To end a row of stitches , lock it with several close-together stitches , raise the needle , and pull the fabric back . Leave at least a 6-in. tail of bobbin thread , and , using a small hand-sewing tapestry needle , pull the bobbin thread to the fabric 's wrong side and tie it with the needle thread in one overhand knot . <p> Stitching tips <p> - For large stitching jobs , fill several bobbins at once to keep bobbin-winding interruptions to a minimum . - When using yarns and threads from a skein , first wind them onto a spool , using the E-Z Winder tool . - A drop of fray-retardant solvent , like Fray Check , prevents heavy , multi-strand threads from unraveling. - When loosening the tension screw on a removable bobbin case , work over a piece of soft fabric to prevent losing the screw if it accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbin work by making an evening bag : Cut a rectangle of fabric ( we chose silk dupioni ) , about 9-1/2 in. by 17 in . Baste a layer of medium-weight stabilizer to the fabric 's wrong side , divide the fabric in thirds , and stitch rows of bobbin work horizontally across one outer third . Cut a similar rectangle of lining , and stitch the two , right sides together , leaving an opening on one edge . Turn to the right side , hand-stitch the opening closed , and press . Fold into thirds with the stitched section on top to form the flap , and machine-stitch the outer edges of the center and bottom thirds . <p> Once you try bobbin work , you 'll love the surprising results . It 's a fun way to embellish by machine , and it looks like you did it by hand . 4378 @qwx204378 4376 @qwx204376 <p> Dominikafanya writes : Lovely ! I will definitely try this soon .

@@22149047 @2149047/ <p> Place two identically sized fabrics one on top of the other , then roll , bend , or fold them . The top layer appears shorter than the bottom layer and once identical edges no longer match . This is because of the turn-of-cloth- simply put , an outer curved layer is slightly longer than an inner curved layer . To compensate for the curve , you need to adjust the size of the fabric layers before you start sewing . I 'll show you how to determine the amount of extra fabric needed to keep your edges matching and where to add it . <p> Beautifully fine-tuned lapel edges rely on adequate turn-of-cloth . <p> In sewing , many parts of a garment can be influenced by the turn-of-cloth- center front edges , cuffs , pocket flaps , to name a few- but it 's most obvious in rolled collars and lapels , so those are the examples I 'll use to explain how the turn-of-cloth works . <p> Every fabric has different turn-of-cloth requirements . The heavier the fabric , the more turn-of-cloth is required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for turn-of-cloth based on the fabric you 're using . Once you 've applied turn-of-cloth considerations , see how this simple effort pays off . <p> Why does it matter ? On a beautifully sewn collar and lapel , the enclosed edges turn neatly under to the wrong side , and the seam is not visible from the " public side " ( the side that shows when the garment is worn ) . If the turn-of-cloth is n't taken into consideration , the upper collar and lapel area of the front facing " steal " some fabric from the under collar and lapel , causing the seams to curl back to the public side . <p> When the layers are adjusted for the fabric 's turn , the underlayer edge stays behind the outer edge . The sample at left shows layers meeting equally on the edge . The sample at right shows a longer fuchsia layer favoring what will become the " public " side . <p> Do n't depend on patterns to supply the turn-of-clothOn blouses and dresses with a rolled collar , commercial patterns generally have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar . Turn-of-cloth is not taken into consideration . Even though patterns for tailored jackets and coats often have separate pattern pieces providing extra turn-of-cloth fabric for upper and under collars , it 's often not enough nor in the right places . <p> Some commercial patterns have a turn-of-cloth allowance built into their patterns , but make sure it 's enough for the fabric you 're using . <p> Most commercial patterns also do n't provide turn-of-cloth fabric at the center back of the upper collar , where it is needed most . Shawl collars are notorious for this problem . Facing pattern pieces on tailored jackets and coats generally have some turn-of-cloth built in such as the lapel pattern shown at left , but you need to make sure it 's enough for the fabric you 're using . <p> Fabric choice makes a differenceEven the best patternmakers can not predict what weight fabric you 'll use for the pattern . While you 're checking for the right turn-of-cloth , you can also find other pattern errors . I 've actually found patterns with smaller upper-collar patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sewing disappointments . <p> Understanding turn-of-cloth , checking the pattern , and knowing how to adjust it for your particular fabric will improve the quality of your fashion sewing . <p> Begin by determining fabric amountsHeavier fabric requires more fabric for the turn-of-cloth . <p> Let your fabric tell you how much is enough . Cut two equal rectangles of your fabric approximately the width of the collar at the center back and interface as you will the collar . Pin the layers together along one edge as shown below . Then roll them over your hand and measure the difference that occurs between the free edges . This is the amount needed for the correct turn-of-cloth for this specific fabric . Add this amount to the center back on the upper collar and at the center back of the neckline edge , tapering to zero at the front ends . On light- to medium-weight fabric , 1/8 inch difference between the upper and under collars is usually enough to ensure the enclosed seams stay turned under . <p> These two fabrics are the same size , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difference is the turn-of-cloth and the amount to trim from the underlayer . <p> Adjust the pattern for turn-of-clothFind the extra cloth your fabric needs by trimming the underlayer- here are two ways : <p> 1 . Cut the amount off the pattern . ( If your pattern has an upper and under collar , cut two upper-collar pieces . ) Use a rotary cutter with a gridded see-through ruler to trim 1/8 inch off three outside edges of one collar piece . Use this smaller piece as the under-collar pattern . <p> 2 . Cut the amount off the fabric . Use the upper-collar pattern piece to cut both the upper and under collars . Hold a see-through ruler 1/8 inch inside the cutting lines on the three outside edges and trim along the fabric edges . Do not reduce the neck edge . <p> Stitch a collarAllow the feed dogs to ease the turn-of-cloth along the edges . <p> First , pin the edges as shown in the photos below , then stitch with the upper collar on the bottom to allow the feed dogs to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed , disengage it since it works against you . Begin stitching at the neck edge , across the short end to the corner , easing the excess fabric as you sew . To keep the corners accurate and symmetrical , stitch off the end . Then stitch the other short end using the same principles , starting this time at the outer edge and stitching to the neck edge . <p> Align the center backs and pin together . Do not use any more pins . Let the feed dogs control the ease . Start at one end of the long outside edge and stitch to the other . Note : When applying the collar to the neck edge , I stitch directionally . But on the outside edges of the collar , it 's more important to stitch with the larger piece against the feed dogs than to stitch directionally . <p> With right sides together and the under collar on top , match and pin the neck edge together . <p> Force the outside edges to match on the short end and pin . Notice the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners : Set the stitch length to 1.5mm , and stitch on top of the previous stitching for 1/2 inch on either side of the corner .

Note how the points of the collar turn up . This ensures that the points will turn down when you are wearing the garment . <p> Press the seams open , grade , and turn the collar right side out . With the under collar facing up , steam the seams and mold the edges with your fingers so the seam is visible .

Baste the neck edges together . When applying the collar to the garment , use the outside edge as a guide for sewing . This collar application ensures that the seams will stay hidden . What a simple way to get a professional look ! <p> Professional tip : Use a narrower seam allowanceI usually reduce seam allowances on enclosed seams and neck edges to 3/8 inch wide . This reduced seam allowance makes it easier to match the neckline and collar stitching lines without clipping into the neckline seam allowances . I can stitch faster and more accurately , as well as eliminate grading ( trimming seam allowances to stagger the raw edge ) entirely for lightweight fabrics and grade only one seam allowance for medium- to heavier-weight fabrics . <p> This is how I adjust for the 3/8-inch seam allowance and provide for turn-of-cloth all in one operation . <p> Trace the upper collar to make a new under-collar pattern . Then remove 1/4 inch from the outside and the neck edges . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three outside edges . Remove 1/4 inch from the neck edge . <p> Cut the upper and under collars from your fabric . <p> Check your work . Place the under collar on top of the upper collar with neck edges matching . Observe the difference . The upper collar should be 1/8 inch larger on the outside edges . <p> Modify facing on lapelsThe same principles apply for front facings when lapels turn back . The facing needs to be larger than the front pattern piece . <p> Check the pattern by matching the collar termination point and the break point ( the top button ) of the facing and the front . There should be close to 1/8 inch difference at the corner of the lapel , tapering to zero at both the break point and collar termination point . If there is n't , add the required amount to your pattern as shown . <p> The corner of the lapel is just like the corner of a collar , so apply the facing in the same manner . Remember that the public side is the facing side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button down . This facing is applied in two steps : From the break point down , stitch with the front against the feed dogs .

It 's fun for everyone in the class to see how things are worked out . My student Cheryl Marsh tackled something interesting just the other day , and I 'd like to share it with you . <p> - <p> Cheryl was inspired by a dress designed by Oscar de la Renta with- a- standard application of quilting ; hand-finishing the seams on the inside , a hand-picked zipper , applied trim , and pleated silk oganza panels , which are the stars of this tutorial . <p> She needed to make six pleated panels of various sizes : the front yoke , the two back yokes , two short sleeves , and a long horizontal panel for the bottom of the skirt . We calculated roughly how much silk organza she 'd need for each panel , and she got to work . While the pleats we created were slightly bigger than those in the original dress , we liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did a quick sample , and we were happy with the result . We did need to figure out the best way to produce the pleats , and here 's what we did : <p> Fortunately , Cheryl brought a 20-inch by 30-inch blocking board to class . It had a sturdy padded surface with a clearly marked 1-inch grid , perfect for aligning and pinning the pleats in place . ( She bought it at one of the chain stores for about $30 ) . <p> - <p> Begin by pinning all four sides of an organza strip to the blocking board , aligning the raw edges along the printed grid . <p> - <p> - <p> Next , chalk the foldlines . She used a Chakoner for this . <p> - <p> - <p> There are lots of similar markers around , but I find this type disturbs the fabric the least . We simply wanted to skim over it , leaving a narrow chalk line behind . <p> We chose to use white chalk because we were worried any other color might leave a residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing in our sample . <p> - <p> Since chalk tends to rub off quickly , we hand-basted the chalked lines . <p> Then , we carefully pinned the pleats and sewed them by machine . <p> Clearly , they needed to be pressed , and we did n't want them pressed to one side , as it would have revealed the machine stitching . Instead , we wanted the seamlines centered out of sight on the underside of each pleat . <p> It 's impossible to do that without some sort of a tool , so we made a template to slip into each tunnel as it was being oriented and pressed . We tried a strip of thick paper cut from a manila folder , buy it got flimsy quickly . Cheryl dashed off to the store , bought a thin plastic mat , and used her rotary cutter to cut a strip of plastic the width of each pleat tunnel . <p> - <p> She even managed to cut the plastic so that there was a line down the center to serve as a pleat pressing guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleat . <p> Once the pressing was done , it was back to the blocking board for a little more work . <p> - <p> Each pleated panel was pulled taut on the blocking board , firmly pinned , carefully aligned , spritzed with water , and left to dry . <p> - <p> Once dry , the panels were unpinned and muslin pattern pieces put on top . <p> As the panels are sheer , we could n't risk any carbon marks showing , so we knew we 'd have to mark the stitching lines another way . As shown below , its clear that the seam allowances were trimmed off the muslin pieces . The stitching lines defined the edges. - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Next , we thread-basted around each muslin section easily , marking the stitching lines onto each pleated panel <p> All in all , it was n't a quick process , but the results are lovely , and now the panels are ready to be sewn to the body of the dress . <p> My thanks to Cheryl for her hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fellow student Susan Shildmyer for the photographs . <p> Has your sewing been inspired by couture designers , techniques , or elements ? If so , which designers have had the most influence on your sewing ? What couture elements have you tried to re-create ? <p> EmilyBint writes : The result looks quite impressive . I ca n't even imagine how much work you 've done to achieve it . And the couture dress looks very elegant . Great choice .

It 's more difficult to press the satin because you ca n't see when the pleat is centered over the seam to press it , but it 's do-able .

@@22149053 @2149053/ <h> Armani Jackets : The Inside Story <p> Just as contemporary chefs are lightening up classic recipes , modern couture 's most celebrated tailor , Giorgio Armani , is continually reinventing the traditional techniques of his craft . I 've closely examined Armani jackets over the years , and I 've discovered many techniques that we home sewers can adapt . In the April/May 1999 issue of Threads ( #82 ) , I explored a few current Armani styles that could be emulated with commercial patterns . But virtually all of my favorite Armani-inspired construction techniques can be applied to any jacket pattern you think worthy of a technical upgrade . <p> Armani 's results using home-sewing interfacings ? Sure . There 's not much difference between what sewers can get and what 's used in the factories ; the key is knowing how to apply it and where . <p> In this article , I 'll describe interfacing approaches for the entire jacket and then go layer by layer through an Armani shoulder and sleeve structure . Combined with your usual techniques in the rest of the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern tailoring project . Feel free to borrow , adapt , and rethink them in the best tradition of Armani and his countless imitators . And I encourage you to take any opportunity that presents itself to examine and appreciate a real Armani garment . In an upcoming article , I 'll focus on design details and finishing techniques I 've gleaned from studying recent Armani creations . <p> Here 's a typical jacket pattern , showing where an Armani Original jacket is generally interfaced . Details on suitable products for each area are provided in the article text . <p> Jacket front- The entire jacket front is fused , whether or not it has a collar . The interfacing extends into the seam allowances . My interfacing choices for the jacket front include Satin Weave , Textured Weft , Flex Weave , and SofKnit , all distributed by HTC . Satin Weave , which looks like the interfacing used in Armani jackets , is designed for lightly structured tailored garments ; it works well with crepes or spongy textures and adheres to gabardines without bubbling . Textured Weft is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance with drape and will not flatten fabrics with texture . Flex Weave , which also resembles the interfacing used by Armani , is soft , drapey , and flexible . SofKnit is a lightweight , all-bias fusible tricot . I used it on the jacket shown at right . I 'll call this body-weight interfacing- whatever type you choose . <p> Lapels- As I 'll describe below , I use an interfacing method on notched and shawl lapels that 's not derived from an Armani technique , but it works well to add ( and keep ) a bit of soft shaping to the roll of a lapel . Called a lapel wedge , it gently forces the lapel to roll back smoothly and curve inward at the lapel point . I trace the shape from the pattern in the lapel area , between the roll line and the seam allowances , as you can see in the drawing above . Use a lighter interfacing than your body-weight choice , such as So Sheer , Flex Weave , or Fusi-Knit , and cut the lengthwise grain along the roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side panel extends only to the side seam , interface the entire piece as you did the front . If the side panel eliminates a side seam and extends to the back , interface 4 to 6 in. below the armscye with the same interfacing used for the front . <p> Facings and upper collar- The facings and upper collar are fused with the same interfacing , which can be body weight or lighter . For instance , use Satin Weave for the garment front and SofKnit for facings and upper collar . <p> Under collars- Armani uses a separate stand and collar for his under collars , as shown , and described in detail in the April/May 1999 issue of Threads ( #82 ) . Interface the under collar on the bias , with the stand on the straight grain . Use body-weight interfacing or heavier . For instance , if you interfaced the jacket front , facings , and upper collar with SofKnit , choose Satin Weave , Textured Weft or Flex Weave for the under collar and stand . <p> Back- On the back , Armani uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and camouflage the shoulder pad . To get similar results , use a lightweight interfacing that does not leave a ridge . Pellon 's Sof-Shape works well here ; it 's soft and blends with the fabric , adding no bulk . Cut the interfacing on the same grain as the jacket.Hems- Interface hems at front , back , side , back/side panel , and sleeves using a 2-in. -wide strip of light interfacing like Sof-Shape or SofKnit , cut on the crossgrain . Position the strips so 1/2 in. extends beyond the hem fold , forming a soft edge . <p> The sleeve header is made from ordinary polyester fleece . The pattern comes from tracing the cap of your sleeve pattern . <p> Sleeves- One of the inner secrets of the fabulous look of an Armani sleeve is his brilliant take on a sleeve header . This shaped piece of light quilting fleece fills in the seam allowance , supports the sleeve , and camouflages the shoulder pad . The header/support is cut 2-1/4 in. wide in the shape of the sleeve cap , following the ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained below . <p> I 'll also describe the front shield piece in detail below ; like the sleeve header , it 's a nonfusible . I use a supple woven hymo or hair canvas , which can be cut on the straight grain or on the bias if the hymo seems stiff , softening the effect and allowing the shield to meld with the drape of the fabric . <p> Fusing tipsPreshrink the interfacing before fusing to prevent the front from shrinking by dipping it into hot tap water and hanging it to air-dry . You can also position the interfacing on the fashion fabric and steam it before fusing , holding the iron 1 to 2 in. above ; the interfacing will visibly grow smaller . <p> Armani uses many different interfacings on his garments , so you 'll want to have a selection on hand to consider , too . After the jacket is cut , assemble your scraps to test which interfacing is best for your fabric . Using a press cloth , test each interfacing for temperature , steam , and timing . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows a ridge . <p> Fuse carefully and completely . I get the best results using a press . With an iron , fuse from the center , fanning outward , overlapping the iron . Keep the iron moving using a lifting movement . <p> - <p> Shape your lapels with a clever pressing technique : Let the lapel fall off the pressing surface , and fuse the interfacing to it in narrow sections as you move it back to the flat surface , forcing it to roll . <p> The lapel wedgeThis technique originated with a Los Angeles tailor who specializes in making elegant custom suits for women , and it beautifully replicates the soft rolled lapel achieved by hours of hand pad stitching . <p> Mark rows 1/4 in. apart and parallel to the roll line on the lapel interfacing , using an air-erasable dressmaker 's pen or lightly with a soft lead pencil . Fuse one row at a time , starting at the roll line , pressing over the edge of a sleeve board to build in a curved shape . <p> When finished , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it air-dry . The straight-grain edge on the lapel wedge stabilizes the roll line . <p> Stabilize the front edgesTo help create a flat , stable front edge , Armani jacket fronts usually have a 1/2-in. strip of lightweight , firmly woven , straight-grain cotton fabric ( not tape ) caught in the seam as the front edge is sewn . Machine-baste the strip so it 's centered over the seamline , stitching just to the outside of the seam , without stretching . Catch the strip in the seam as the facing is attached . On notched-collar jackets , apply the strip along the front edge , ending 1 in. from the top corner ( see the drawing on the facing page ) . Clip the strip at the roll line so that it can turn . On collarless jackets , staystitch the jacket neck edges first , and stabilize the back neck separately by basting 1/4-in. cotton twill tape in the seam . Tape the fronts from shoulder to hem , all before attaching the shield , but after fusing the lapel wedge , if there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Armani sleeve : first , no ease across the top of the sleeve for 2 in. either side of the shoulder seam ( this is why I indicated specific ease points earlier on ) , and second , in this uneased area , the sleeve/body seam is pressed open . Together these innovations make a smooth , natural sleeve silhouette . Armani uses a 1/2-in. seam allowance on his sleeves , and I heartily recommend that you do the same . A narrower seam makes a big difference when easing , and 1/2 in. is wide enough to support the sleeve cap . <p> Support and shape the armhole with 1/4-in. tape , stretched slightly as it 's applied , as shown at left . Add a strip of 1/2-in. cotton at the cap ( black strip at right ) to pad the shoulder seam overlapping it on the 1/4-in. tape at the ease points . <p> The first step is to tape the armhole in the seam allowance . Use cotton or cotton/linen tailor 's tape , 1/4 in. wide . Press the tape in a curve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stitch the tape 1/4 in. from the edge , from the top ease point in front , under the armhole , to the top ease point in back . Pull slightly as you sew , using a light touch . The purpose is to draw up the body of the garment very slightly so it hugs the figure . <p> Stitch a 1/2-in. strip of cotton broadcloth across the top of the sleeve in the same line of stitching as the tape , just covering the tape ends . This creates a light padding at the cap of the sleeve . <p> Next ease-stitch the sleeve cap using three rows of machine basting , two close together inside the seamline and a third row a fat 1/8 in. outside the seamline , between each pair of ease points . Pin in the sleeve , matching at the shoulder , ease points , and underarm . The outside basting line will give you much more control as you distribute the ease . Wrap threads around the pin at one ease point at the start , and at the other point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouette , press the armhole seam allowances open about 4 in. at the shoulder seam . <p> As you stitch the sleeve in place , be sure to stitch with the garment uppermost for approximately 4 in. across the top of the sleeve from front to back ease points . Then switch to stitching with the sleeve side up around the rest of the sleeve . This is an old tailor 's trick that helps ensure a perfectly straight stitch along the top of the armhole . <p> Press next . This is the secret to getting your sleeve to sing . I 'm sure that in the factory , there are special pressing devices to yield a flawless sleeve cap quickly and easily . At home , a ham , sleeve board , clapper , iron , perseverance , and ingenuity are essential tools . Start by pressing flat around the seam allowances , as it was sewn . With some fabrics , this sets the ease and not much more pressing is necessary . Clip the armhole at the top ease points , and press open this 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to get the sleeve to look flawless . <p> Adding the shield and sleeve headerOnce you 've set in the sleeve , you 're ready to apply Armani 's signature shoulder shaper , the shield . Armani uses a generic woven hymo cut on the straight of grain . I prefer a super lightweight hair canvas cut on the bias . I insert the shield and the sleeve header- which fills in the sleeve cap- at the same time after the sleeve is sewn and pressed . <p> - <p> Shape the shoulder with a free-floating canvas panel called a shield , made from traditional , nonfusible hair canvas or hymo , and secured only at the roll line with hand stitches , as shown , and machine-stitched at the armhole seam allowance when the sleeve header is attached . <p> The shield is cut following the jacket front pattern in the shoulder area , including seam allowances at the armhole and shoulder edges . If your pattern has a dart in the upper front where the shield will go , make a duplicate pattern of the shield area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . Lay the shield pattern piece over the original front , and mark 1/2 in. from roll line or front edge . Transfer the grainline to a new piece , or adapt it to the bias if desired . <p> The shield 's outer edge is attached to the front at the armhole seam allowance at the same time that the sleeve header is joined to the seam allowances on the sleeve side . At the shield 's front/roll-line edge , lap a 1-1/4-in. strip of bias rayon lining and straight-stitch it to the shield at 7/8 in . Trim the hair canvas at 3/4 in. , so only the lining layer is caught in the seam . Then stitch the other edge of the lining fabric to the roll line by hand , as shown in the photo at left . On collarless jackets , cut the lining strip the same grain and shape as the front , and stitch as you sew the facing . Neither the shoulder seam nor the lower edge on the shield is stitched ; the shield floats , held in place only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armani jacket I examined , the shield and header were machine sewn to the armhole seam allowances . I tried both hand-sewing and machine-stitching very carefully along the first stitching line , and I had better results with machine stitching . Stretch the fleece header and the shield slightly in the direction it will lay , so the armhole cups and keeps its shape . Press again ; this is the final sleeve pressing . <p> Making your own shoulder padsThe Armani shoulder pad is as distinctive as the rest of his garments , and I 've never seen anything exactly like it for sale to sewers . I combined several commercial shoulder pads to get the effect I wanted : an invisible support for the sleeve that adds height and fills in the sleeve cap ( see Mimic an Armani shoulder pad ... , below ) . <p> I could n't find a commercial shoulder pad that mimicked the Armani original , so I made one . I used parts from commercially available pads , similar , I 'm sure , to ones you can find at any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pad 1 and more substantial than pad 2 . <p> Once it 's made , hand-stitch the crosswise seam of the pad to the armhole seam allowance for about 4 in. at the top of the sleeve . The back edge of the pad is also stitched with a few machine stitches to the seam allowance on the facing after the lining is sewn . At the neck edge , the pad is joined to the seam allowance of the shoulder seam with a 1/2-in. by 2-in. strip of lining and a few machine stitches . This provides a bit of play while holding it securely , without interfering with the movement of the shield . Like most of Armani 's construction ideas , it 's ingenious and quite copy-able . <p> Marcy Tilton wrote about Armani 's patternmaking in Threads #82 .

@@22149054 @2149054/ <p> The bias is spoken of in hushed , reverential terms in the fashion world . Only a few designers ever master the bias cut , and very few home sewers dare to take the plunge . But by choosing a stable fabric and a simple pattern ( a combination I call my " bias training wheels " ) , and by following a few step-by-step guidelines , you can be assured of success with bias-cut garments . <p> Straight grain vs. biasThe bias runs at an angle to the straight and crossgrains , with the true bias running at an exact 45-degree angle <p> Add drape to fabric by cutting it on the bias . If you start with a stripe , you can also create beautiful chevron effects at seams . Above , bias binding adds a contrasting detail at the neck edge ; you can also use a corded piping . Photo : Laura White . <p> - <p> Grain refers to the straight and crosswise direction of the yarns making up a woven fabric , with bias running at any angle to the straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these grains , as shown in the drawing above . Garments cut on the bias appear softer and more fluid , have more stretch , and are more supple than those cut on the lengthwise or crosswise grain . The fabric also appears " thinner " than the same fabric cut on the straight grain . <p> Bias garments need more fabric than the same garment on the straight grain , and are best cut one layer at a time so the grain does n't distort . Working on the bias requires a bit more time , a careful selection of fabric , as well as some alternate fitting and sewing techniques , which I 'll explain in detail . <p> I suggest starting with a simple top or a sleeveless tank or shell . Cutting the top on the bias instantly makes the shape more fluid and gives the fabric a more interesting character . Use a pattern you 've sewn before , or make it up quickly in muslin to test the fit before you begin . <p> Safe fabric choices for biasBegin at the fabric store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the diagonal to get a feel for the way the fabric responds and feels on the bias . Compare different fibers , weights , and textures . Notice how much the fabrics stretch on the bias , how a plain weave takes on a new texture , a twill weave loses its definition , and plaids and stripes become diagonal lines . <p> For your first few bias-cut tops , pick user-friendly , natural-fiber fabrics with " tooth " ( the layers tend to grab each other ) , like cotton , linen , silk broadcloth , or wool challis . I look for fabrics with a plain weave and minimal texture , and I love the effect of stripes cut on the bias . Beginners , however , should choose a narrow , 1/4-in. or smaller stripe so it does n't have to be matched . <p> The short list of fabrics to avoid for bias includes most rayons ( stretches like crazy ) , silkies and polyester ( slippery and hard to handle ) , twills ( lose definition ) , and fabrics that are heavy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crepe de chine , charmeuse , and georgette are beautiful on the bias , but these hard-to-handle fabrics are n't a good place to begin . Move up to silky fabrics once you 've conquered the stable ones . <p> Adapt a pattern for biasYou may find a pattern for a bias top , but it 's easy to convert a straight-grain pattern for a simple V- or round-neck top from straight of grain to bias . Choose a sleeveless top , or one with a cap or extended sleeve , drop sleeve , or classic set-in sleeve . Depending on the fabric you choose , you may want to add center-front and -back seams . <p> Alter the pattern so it 's the length you want and large enough to fit you at the bust and hip , including ease . One of the secrets for making bias tops that you 'll love to wear is allowing plenty of ease , since bias continues to stretch , becoming longer and narrower when worn . Remember the actress Jean Harlow and her white satin gown that fit like wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , add an extra 1/2 to 1 in. of ease at each cutting line . You 'll also increase the width of each seam allowance , which I 'll discuss in a moment . <p> Tissue-fit the pattern ( pin the pieces together and try it on ) to check the fit , and make any necessary changes . If you 're large-busted , I suggest adding a bust dart either at the armhole or the side seam for a smoother fit . <p> So you 'll be able to cut the fabric in a single layer and place stripes where you want them , make full pattern pieces for bias-cut garments by eliminating foldlines and/or making separate left- and right-body and front- and back-sleeve pattern pieces . Use the main pattern pieces only and eliminate facings , since piping or binding works better than facings to finish edges ( facings tend to " fight " with the outer layer of a bias garment ) . <p> Change straight of grain to bias <p> Here 's an easy way to re-mark the grainline on a pattern piece.The diagonal fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line perpendicular to grainline.2 . Fold tissue so two lines align.3 . Mark along diagonal fold for new bias grainline . Fold and draw lines in both directions . <p> Working with a " full " pattern means making separate pattern pieces for front- and back-sleeve or right- and left-body sections . Or , for a garment without center-front and -back seams , eliminate foldlines and make a pattern of the full garment section . Notice the extra-wide seam allowances , needed since bias edges relax and open up . <p> Change straight-grain markings to bias markings with a 45-degree ruler ( available from quilt- or art-supplystores ) . Or fold the pattern to draw the new lines , as shown in the drawing above . <p> Yardage and layoutWhen buying fabric , I " guesstimate " the amounts I 'll need for bias garments by allowing 1 yd. of fabric for each major pattern piece . This means that a long tunic top with sleeves may require as much as 4 yd. of fabric . <p> After adjusting the pattern , however , you can use a gridded cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The amount you 'll need depends on the width of the fabric , the fabric design or repeat , and the size of the pattern pieces . Piecing may be necessary if the fabric is narrow or the pattern pieces are large . <p> For a balanced garment , I usually cut the pattern on a single layer of fabric with each pattern piece at a right angle to the next one as I go around the body , as shown in the pattern layout below . I lay all the pieces in one direction , as if the fabric had a nap . If your pattern has center-front and -back seams , and the fabric is wide enough , you may be able to cut two layers at once , angling pattern pieces as before . <p> Sample layout for bias <p> When cutting out a bias garment like a raglan-sleeve top on a single layer of fabric , slant pattern pieces at right angles to each other as you proceed around the body . <p> Center seam or not ? Depending on the fabric you select , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and center back so the garment will hang evenly . On modern wovens , lengthwise threads are stronger and more numerous than crosswise threads . When a full pattern piece is placed on the bias , the lengthwise grain will dominate one side of the garment , and the crossgrain , the other . Unless your fabric is stable , the two sides of the garment may hang differently , with one stretching more than the other , and you may get twisting , rippling , and an uncomfortable tug-of-war . <p> Adding a center seam allows you to slant one side to the right-angle bias and the other side to the left-angle bias , as shown in the pattern layout below , so both side seams will hang the same . This also let 's you create a chevron or diamond effect by matching stripes or plaids along the center seam . I draw a few stripes right on the pattern piece , as shown , to make it easy to match the next piece at the stitching line . <p> Before deciding whether to add a seam , examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if there 's a discernible difference between the strength and number of lengthwise and crosswise threads . If the fabric is stable ( like many linens , cottons , and wools ) , with fairly balanced threads , it 's fine to cut the garment center on the fold . <p> Widen seam allowancesAlthough bias cuts do n't ravel , the fibers on cut edges relax and open up , so even 5/8 in. away from a cut edge is n't an accurate stitching line . To your adjusted pattern pieces , add 1-1/2-in. -wide seam allowances , in addition to the extra ease , on center , side , and shoulder seams . Use 5/8-in. seam allowances at the neck . Always mark stitching lines with thread , tracing paper , or chalk as soon as the fabric is cut , before removing the pattern pieces . <p> Remove excess stretchTo prevent bias-cut garments from continuing to stretch as they 're worn , it helps to press each pattern section to remove some of the stretch before construction . Pressing simulates the effect of gravity and results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when working with silky , gauzy , or loosely woven fabrics . <p> After cutting the fabric and removing the pattern , press each piece firmly , gently , and evenly from top to bottom . Now repin the pattern onto the fabric , adjusting seamlines if the piece has grown smaller . <p> Sewing bias seamsThe key to smooth vertical bias seams that wo n't pop when the garment is worn is to stretch them as you sew , using a 2.5- to 3-mm stitch . The seam will look rippled after stitching but will press out beautifully . You do n't need to stretch as you sew shoulder seams because they 're not cut on the true bias , and so do n't stretch as much . <p> To assemble the garment , sew center seams first , then fit at the side seams by pinning along the stitching line , wrong sides together , and adjust to get the look you want . After the garment is fitted and sewn , trim seam allowances to 3/4 in . Since bias does n't ravel , seam finishes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause rippling and seam show-through . <p> If you need to join a bias edge to a straight-grain edge , sew with the straight grain on top , since it 's more stable . The bias layer will feed in easily , and the straight grain will stay the bias edge . <p> To stabilize buttons and buttonholes on a bias-cut garment , add interfacing behind them . Use a strip of straight-grain interfacing in the direction of the buttonhole to keep it from stretching . <p> To bind a neck , I use bindings 1/4 to 1 in. wide . For a neat binding on a V-neck top , I recommend this : Sew the shoulder seams first , apply the neck binding , then sew the center-front and " back seams after the neck edge is complete . <p> Corded piping likewise stabilizes the neck and armholes and adds a subtle design detail . To pipe a neck , first make sure that the neck is large enough to slip over the head easily . Prepare the front and back separately , before joining shoulder seams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitching every 1/2 in . Serge close to the stitching , which makes it easy to turn and press the edge to the inside . If you do n't have a serger , trim the seam allowance to 1/4 in. , then stitch the shoulder seams and press . <p> I generally use a lightweight , 1/8-in. filler cord to fill the piping . Prepare piping by covering the cord , then baste and stitch the piping to the garment 's edge . <p> Once the neck is finished , you 're ready to try the top on again . Pin the side seams , wrong sides together , and do a final fitting before you sew the seams . <p> Bias garments do n't wrinkle as easily as straight-grain garments do , but they can " grow " on a hanger , so I always store them folded and flat . Once you become confident about basic bias sewing , cutting , and fitting skills , I know that you 'll enjoy expanding your sewing repertoire to include bias garments .

For fabric embellishment , a plain , 2-in. to 4-in. -wide , soft-rubber brayer , as shown in the first photo in this article , works well and is available inexpensively from most art-supply stores ( the rubber type is usually well labeled ; Speedball makes a typical example ) . Avoid hard-rubber and larger brayers , both of which are slightly more difficult to use . <p> By itself , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thickened dye , just as a paint roller will . In fact , small foam paint rollers can also be used on fabric ; they consume a lot of paint but can quickly cover large areas .

To add leaf markings to the bamboo pattern made with brayer No. 1 in the bottom photo on the facing page , a small brayer is held at an angle ( left ) . Roll over a stencil . Acetate makes an easy-to-cut stencil . Loops of thread caught under the stencil add randomly shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively patternsPretextured rollers for creating faux wall finishes are also available from more complete craft and art sources , along with textured brayers in several different patterns for paper crafts . We prefer brayers with simple textural surfaces and usually just texture our own , as shown at bottom right . <p> Its easy to add temporary texture to plain rubber brayers . Try wrapping rubber bands around the roller , varying the spacing to create regular or irregular patterns . String , which will create repeating linear squiggles , sticks easily to a paint-covered brayer . To keep the string on the roller , use only a forward motion when applying additional paint to the brayer . Or scrape paint off the brayer in random or regular patterns using a razor blade or popsicle stick , or a notched adhesive spreader from the hardware store . <p> Once you 're on a roll ( sorry , could n't resist ! ) , you may want to investigate Rollagraph and other stamp rollers , like those at right . Though more like rubber stamps than brayers , these tools roll out color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of these and more supplies can be found at fabric , craft , paint , hardware , and art-supply stores . <p> Basic equipment for brayer painting : A soft-rubber brayer ( available in many widths from most art-supply stores ) , fabric paint as described below , a glass palette for rolling out the paint and loading the brayer ( 1/4-in. plate glass , about 12 in. by 6 in. , with polished edges , and available from any glass shop is ideal ) , and rubber gloves for easy cleanup . <p> " Inking " a brayerBecause of the brayers primary use as a printing tool , coating it with paint , dye , or ink is called inking . You 'll get best results with a thin , even coat of paint on the brayer . The best surface for inking a brayer is a smooth , flat , hard palette that 's about 12 in. by 6 in. and easy to wash , such as a piece of 1/4-in. plate glass ( right ) , Plexiglas , tempered Masonite , or any hard plastic . <p> Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brayer through it vertically and horizontally until there is a thin , even coat of paint on the glass and roller . For best results , roll the brayer in one direction only ; rolling forward rolls ink on , and rolling backward rolls ink off . <p> Clean your brayers and tools with a soft cloth , detergent , and warm water . Textured brayers may need to be scrubbed gently with an old toothbrush to get paint out of recessed areas . To avoid ridges and dents in the rubber , store your brayers by hanging them so the rubber does n't  touch anything . <p> Fabric paints work bestNumerous paints , dyes , and inks are available that will work for printing on fabric with a brayer . However , not all are the proper consistencylike that of mayonnaisefor easy brayer printing right out of the jar . For simplicitys sake , in this article well describe only the use of widely available fabric paints , which are usually the perfect consistency . <p> Paint bonds to the surface of cloth fibers , leaves them feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wash-fast , which usually helps soften the painted fabric ( follow the manufacturer directions for heat setting ) . The stiffness is not as noticeable on heavy fabrics but might be an issue on soft fabrics that need to drape . Our favorite brand is Versatex , which seems to be the softest after heat setting . This paint is made for printing , so its just right for brayer work as it comes from the jar . <p> Even inexpensive acrylic or craft paints have the proper consistency and will work , but these products tend to stiffen fabric a lot when dry . " Fabric medium " can be added to acrylic paints to create a better bond with cloth fibers , soften the effects , and offer laundering stability . <p> Many metallic fabric paints are available as well , but because of the mica particles in these paints , all leave a stiff " hand .

These ideas are , of course , just the beginning ; the list of possibilities is truly endless , and we hope our suggestions will help you see texturing tools everywhere : in your backyard , the woods , the beach , around the house and garage , at hardware and second-hand stores , flea markets , dollar and discount stores , even your local frame store .

@@22149065 @2149065/ <p> Make your way to HeidiKlumIntimates.com immediately and ( for $95 ) you can buy a replica of this week 's winning look . Yes , this was the Heidi Klum-product-placement challenge , in which the designers were charged with creating a lingerie look to be manufactured and sold as part of Heidi 's intimates collection . As might be expected , the women contestants were mostly pleased with the assignment ; the men were , to varying degrees , nonplussed . <p> What was more surprising was how long it took for the contestants to produce these miniature bits of clothing . If you 've ever sewn underwear , you know that it 's much quicker than you 'd think . The seams are very short , the edges are typically finished with sewn-on elastic , and the stretch fabrics make for a forgiving fit . Designing lingerie is probably more difficult , though . <p> In this challenge , the designers were provided with assorted bra styles from the collection to use as the foundation of their own looks , so they did n't even need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to help much , and many of the designers were working up to the last second to send a complete look down the runway . There appeared to be a lot of hand sewing , which suggests that most of these contestants had never attempted to sew lingerie before . <p> No Mood store fabrics this week , by the way . Instead , fabrics and trims were supplied from Heidi 's collection . Has Mood banned Project Runway from the store ? Did Swatch bite Tim in the ankle ? When will we once again see the designers pant and sweat as they drag rolls of fabric to the cutting table ? <h> Heidi 's critique , and The Twist : <p> This week , Heidi accompanied mentor Tim Gunn on his rounds in the workroom and shared her opinions freely , as is her wont . Heidi 's experience as a Victoria 's Secret model prepared her well for this fashion niche " check out her collection and you 'll see that she offers some pretty underpinnings in lovely colors and styles . I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks ; now that I have seen her collection , I understand more where she was coming from in some of her remarks . <p> Workroom " highlights " ( if you can call them that ) : Princess Blakey confesses to knowing nothing about ladies ' lingerie ( quelle surprise ) ; Jake admits to wearing ladies ' lingerie ( as Tim says , TMI ! ) ; Swapnil " prays to 10,000 of his Indian gods " ( at least I think that 's what he said ) ; and Lindsey has a scissors accident and has to run out for stitches and a tetanus shot ( this was an actual disaster , and I hope she incurred no permanent damage ) . <p> After visiting with the designers , Tim and Heidi called them onto the runway , where they discovered a pajama party set-up ... and were informed of a twist : They must design and sew a cover-up for their looks . The good news to counter this bad news was that they had more time , and could stay up all night in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . No one looked too swift upon being awakened by " Grandpa Tim " the following morning . Tim was impeccable , though , in his pajamas and robe with pocket square . <h> Runway day : <p> It was off to the runway , where Heidi greeted the designers with an evil cackle about how she " loves a twist . " This week 's judges were Zac Posen and Nina Garcia , accompanied by guest judge Bella Thorne . If you have n't heard of Thorne , she 's a 17-year-old actress and former Disney property and just about the last person you 'd expect to find judging a lingerie contest on Lifetime . I shudder to think what life is like as a teenage Disney actress , because Bella really seemed to know her way around a thong and balconnette bra . All kidding aside , her comments were smart , and she offered constructive criticism that made sense . <h> The winner : <p> Merline 's black lace strappy bra and boy short-style bottom ( sold as a thong on Heidi 's website ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home hated this look . The bra cups are disproportionately tiny , especially when framed by the straps ; the straps look wonky and uncomfortable ; and the panty is an awkward shape . When Merline was not sent to the green room as " safe , " I was sure she was in the bottom three . She did make a suitable cover-up in black charmeuse , and this elevated the whole look . Viewing the photos after the show , I see more merit in the pieces , but would not have chosen it for the win . The judges , however , found it effortless ( huh ? ! ) , interesting , unusual , sexy and empowering , suitable for layering under a tank top ( if your day job is on a Disney kids ' show , I guess ) , and fashion-forward . <h> The other top two : <p> Swapnil 's " bridal " set , consisting of a white bra with lots of interwoven straps and a coordinating strappy , lacy thong , covered by a white drape . Heidi considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , and more fantasy lingerie than practical " and it made her think of Khaleesi and her dragons from Game of Thrones . Indeed , there is a strong attract/repel element in this look , which struck me as a little odd for bridal undergarments . All this was the result of endless angst about how Swapnil was going to obtain sufficient numbers of white elastic straps to construct the look . <p> Ashley 's lavender , lace-trimmed set with cute gray short robe . I really liked this look : It 's pretty , wearable , somewhat unusual in its use of trim and " framing " ( which seems far less awkward and uncomfortable than Merline 's ) , and sellable . In fact , Ashley talked intelligently about how it 's important to consider a plus-sized customer who will want some support and coverage in a bra , and she designed accordingly . The judges remarked that this was sporty and feminine , sweet , classy , young , sexy , and well-proportioned . <h> The loser : <p> Princess Blakey 's hideous pink set with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is ugly , unwearable , dated , and unflattering to the body . Blake tried to sell this as " sporty meets French , " a puzzling pairing of terms I have yet to figure out in relation to his look . I wo n't even go into the ways in which this did not do justice to the model--the photos speak for themselves . I 'm a little sorry to see Blake go , but this was hands down the worst look , and there was no way to justify keeping him . <h> The other bottom two : <p> Jake 's polka-dot set with double side straps , and " sarong " cover-up . Zac saw no imagination here , and all the judges agreed that the straps were problematic , causing unsightly bulges even on the slender model . It turns out that Heidi sells a polka-dot bra similar to this in her collection , but less fussy and complicated . While I did n't love this , it could have fallen somewhere in the middle , meaning there were other looks I thought were worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sensitive to his model , who did not want to parade around in a thong . The panty he made might not have pleased the judges , but it was kind of him to provide more coverage ( not that his model had anything to worry about ) . <p> Laurie 's fuchsia and navy set with dramatic navy cover-up . Heidi liked the bra with its fuchsia knot at the center , and the color combination was pretty . The panty was deemed too high-waisted and big , too dated , and badly engineered with a center-front seam . The odd elastic straps at the waist were an interesting attempt to relate the bottom to the top , but made the garment difficult to wear under clothing . <h> The remaining looks : <p> Candice 's black mesh set with " garter belt " and black wrap cover-up . Heidi seemed intrigued by this during her workroom critique , warning Candice to be classy , and not too S&amp;M . No whips . This looked unimaginative to me , although Candice was trying to be clever with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic band around the thigh remotely decorative or attractive ? Or comfortable , for that matter ? <p> Edmond 's purple lace set with plum kimono . This was fairly standard , but plausible , and compared to his original look ( which earned him the nickname of " Captain Tacky " from Heidi ) , this is positively sedate and sophisticated . <p> Joseph 's gray and coral look , with coral poncho-type cover-up . Despite Heidi 's warning to avoid a matronly look , Joseph has , once again , turned out an ensemble with very little sex appeal . Not that it 's bad . In fact , it 's one of the more practical sets , and , up close , it seemed to have some nice trim details . Also , Joseph tried to take into account current lingerie styles when planning the style of panty , unlike Laurie and Blake . <p> Kelly 's lavender and yellow set with hooded , leopard-print cover-up . This was my favorite of the episode , and I was shocked that it did n't make the top three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a fresh , pretty , yet sporty look . Her model 's athletic physique was perfect for this style . To me , this was the most innovative look on the runway , and one that might have worked well with the Heidi Klum brand . Kelly was robbed . She should have won ! <p> Lindsey 's blue bra and panty with peach " boyfriend shirt " cover-up . Like Merline 's look , this one seemed visually out of proportion to me : miniature kitten-ears bra over boxy granny-panty bottom . It made her model look flat-chested and hippy--and most women want to avoid that silhouette . In fact , I do n't know how anyone over a double-A cup size could consider wearing this bra . Nonetheless , the garments appeared well made , so Lindsey was justifiably placed in the middle . <p> Before I sign off , I 'd like to applaud the models , who bared nearly all for this challenge . Striding the the catwalk in lingerie is one thing , as is posing for a Victoria 's Secret catalog ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@22149068 @2149068/ <p> Stopping at a thread rack these days is like visiting a candy store-there are so many delicious threads to choose from . All of these choices can be intimidating , even to the seasoned embroiderer . But experimenting with threads can expand your color and texture palettes and add new life to your designs , whether you do free-motion embroidery or use a computerized embroidery machine . Here 's a look at the threads available to the home embroiderer and tips on how to use them successfully . <p> From rayon to neonThread , like fabric , is made from either synthetic or natural fibers , or both , and each has its own appeal . For examples of the threads mentioned here , see Threads types and brands . <p> Rayon thread-This thread is the most popular choice overall because of its attractive high sheen , widespread availability , and consistent trouble-free performance , holding up to high-speed stitching without breaking or fraying . Rayon thread comes in a wide range of solid and variegated colors , as well as in a new " twist " thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a single strand , which adds automatic shading and dimension to flat designs . Most rayon threads are available in a standard 40 wt. and a thicker 30 wt. ( in terms of thread sizing , the higher the number , the finer the thread ) . <p> Polyester embroidery thread-Popular and economical for embroidery , polyester thread provides an effect similar to rayon and comes in various colors . It wo n't shrink , fade , or bleed , so it 's great for children 's clothes . Rayon thread has a slightly higher sheen than polyester thread , but the two are interchangeable and perform similarly without breaking or fraying . When they 're combined in a single design , it 's hard to tell the difference . <p> Cotton embroidery thread-Cotton thread is often overlooked for use in automatic embroidery machines . However , it performs beautifully and has a lovely , soft sheen . It 's available in weights up to a very fine 100 , which is considered heirloom quality . But finer threads tend to be weaker , so 30- or 50-wt. cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger and provides better coverage . <p> Silk thread-Silk absorbs dyes more brilliantly than all other fibers , and is truly the aristocrat of specialty threads . It combines the strength ( but not abrasiveness ) of polyester and the stability of cotton , and sews smoothly without breaking . It has a distinct sheen unmatched by any other thread . Silk threads are available in a wide range of sizes , but the 30 to 50 wts. are the most appropriate for machine embroidery . They are more costly and not as readily available , but well worth considering , especially for embroidering on luxurious fabrics . <p> Silk thread is the top choice when embroidering on silk and other luxurious fabrics . It is made by Janome , Tire , and YLI Kanagawa . <p> Metallic and mylar embroidery threads-Metallic threads are manufactured with a center core that is wrapped with metal foil or thin slivers of metal foil . Color is then applied by adding a polyester film to the foil . The most durable and desirable metallic threads have a coating of rice paper pasted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , preventing the metal from being stripped away . In some threads , the foil may be coated with a silver alloy for added strength , and sometimes the polyester film is applied as an undercoating rather than a topcoating , to keep the color from flaking off . Considering the complexities of manufacturing metallic threads , it 's understandable that some might perform better than others . In fact , no words evoke as much emotion from machine embroiderers as metallic threads . Sewers either love the results these threads provide , or cringe at the thought of using them because they require a little kid-glove treatment , which I 'll discuss in a moment . Experiment to find the metallics that are the most trouble-free in your machine , and you will find they 're well worth using . <p> Glittery mylar threads are made from plies of film layered together , then cut into slices to form a flat filament thread . As with metallics , various aspects of the manufacturing process-for example , the number of plies used , amount of elongation or stretch inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice-affect thread quality . These threads are manufactured to be much stronger than they originally were , but because they tend to break with high-speed sewing , follow the special handling tips below . Mylar threads are available in a wide range of colors as well as holographic hues , which pick up light and color from surrounding objects and add spectacular luminous accents to machine embroidery . <p> Special-effect embroidery thread-There are numerous special-effect threads , from a fuzzy acrylic/wool-based variety , which creates an old-fashioned crewel-like effect , to fluorescent neon threads . Some threads change colors when exposed to sunlight , and others glow in the dark . If you have performance problems with any of these threads , follow the special handling techniques discussed next . <p> Special handling tipsSome embroidery threads have a reputation for being difficult to work with . Breakage during stitching is a common problem , and it 's tempting to blame the thread . But , more likely , a few slight adjustments to your sewing machine can make a big difference . Of course , sewing machines vary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . <p> First , let 's talk about tension . Whenever you try a new thread , check your machine 's upper tension by sewing a 3-in. -long row of zigzag stitches on a scrap of the same fabric you plan to embroider , stabilizing and hooping it properly ( for details on stabilizing and hooping , see Machine Embroidery : A Marriage of Fabric and Design by Lindee Goodall ) . The correct tension for machine embroidery should be slightly unbalanced , with a tighter bobbin tension , so the needle thread only shows on the surface , pulling slightly to the underside . If the needle thread totally covers the bobbin thread on the wrong side , the needle tension is too loose . <p> Improperly balanced tensions can also cause " bird-nesting , " that pile of looped threads that forms under the fabric . If this happens , check to be sure the thread has n't slipped out of the take-up lever guide , check for lint between the tension discs , and clean these discs periodically . Sewing at high speeds can sometimes cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maintain clean upper tension by cutting your thread at the spool , instead of at the needle , when you change colors or complete a stitching sequence , then pull the thread down to remove it . Pulling the thread up can cause frayed ends to catch between the tension discs , possibly producing damage . Since thread continuously passes through the bobbin tension at high speeds , lint can accumulate and cause thread breakage there also , so clean inside and around the bobbin case often . <p> Next , look at your machine 's thread-feeding system . In my experience , there 's no other single variable as critical to successful thread handling as the path the thread takes from spool to needle . If the thread is straight and unobstructed in this path , it 's less likely to misbehave . If you 're having problems , first check the spool pin : Some threads stitch better from a horizontal pin and others from a vertical pin . A horizontal pin may cause thread to spiral as it leaves the end of the spool , causing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin , the thread may slide down the edge of the spool , collect there , and become lodged underneath the end cap . The thread may even backspin , causing loops and uneven tautness . If you ca n't adjust the position of your spool pin , try a device like the ThreadPro or Martha Pullen 's Thread Stand , which guide the thread so it unwinds straight and flat to the needle . I find the ThreadPro useful when embroidering with metallic threads , but it 's also helpful with any sewing and any thread when there 's only a small amount left on a spool . This thread is more tightly wound and may kink as it unwinds . <p> Consider the direction in which the thread winds off the spool as well . For better stitching , cross-wound spools should feed off the top , and straight-wound spools should feed off the side . Also , some threads behave better when they unwind from the back of the spool , others from the front . If you 're having difficulty , try removing the thread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbin threads especially designed for machine embroidery are strong enough to withstand the stress of high-speed stitching , yet fine enough to keep densely embroidered designs supple . There are several types of bobbin threads , so I suggest keeping a variety of weights on hand because there is no single all-purpose bobbin thread that works equally well with all specialty embroidery threads . Generally speaking , it 's best to pair a needle thread with a bobbin thread of similar weight and fiber content . <p> The fineness of these bobbin threads means more thread can be wound on the bobbin . Brands on the market include Madeira Bobbinfil , Mettler Metrolene , Sulky Bobbin Thread , and YLI Lingerie/Bobbin Thread . <p> Use the right needleFortunately , needle manufacturers have designed needles specifically for embroidery thread , some with specialized eyes that eliminate stripping or splitting the thread as it passes through them . Machine-embroidery needles by Schmetz or Madeira have slightly rounded points to avoid damage to rayon threads . Topstitching needles can also be used with most embroidery threads . And Sullivan 's Metafil , Madeira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , designed for metallic embroidery thread , have an elongated eye and a special shaft to reduce friction . <p> Choose the needle size according to the weight of your fabric . An improperly sized needle or an old or nicked needle can cause thread to fray and break . Remember to replace needles often ( I change mine after every five hours of sewing time ) . <p> You may come across recommendations to use a silicone- or Teflon-based thread lubricant , which coats the thread to make it smooth and flexible , reducing friction and fraying and helping the thread glide easily through the needle . These products can work well , but before using any of them , be sure to check your machine manual . Some manufacturers clearly state that lubricants should not be used with their machines . <p> Armed with these tips , you can be confident when using these wonderful specialty threads .

I admit I was a little nervous when I was asked to look through my library for my Top 10 . Top 10 lists , whether they are books , movies , restaurants or what-have-you , are highly subjective . So here , arranged alphabetically by title , is my highly subjective list of 10 books in my sewing room that I can not live without . <p> All About CottonISBN-13 : 978-0-9637612-3-1All About SilkISBN : 0-9637612-0-XAll About WoolISBN-13 : 978-0-9637612-2-4 . Written and illustrated by Julie Parker ( Rain City Publishing ) Okay , I cheated . My first book is a trilogy . But what great reference books these are ! These books , any of which is a great addition to your sewing room , contain clear , concise explanations of the different weaves and types of each fabric . They also come with swatches of the fabric types for quick visual and sensual reference . If you learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't run their hands over a bolt of fabric to get familiar with it ? ) you will love these books . Each book also includes reference charts that indicate the hand , care , and recommended uses for each fabric . <p> Number 9 <p> Bridal Coutureby Susan Khalje ( Krase Publications ) ISBN-13 : 978-0801987571I do n't make bridal gowns , but I do refer to this book frequently when sewing special-occasion fabrics and certain formalwear . Ms. Khalje 's explanations of how to build an inner structure for gowns are excellent . I also refer to the sections on sewing lace frequently . Some of the styles of gowns may seem dated ( my copy of the book is ten years old ) , but the how-to information is invaluable for the formalwear seamster ! Number 8Claire Shaeffer 's Fabric Sewing Guideby Claire Shaeffer ( Krause Publications ) ISBN-13 : 978-0801986284This book , published in 1995 , is still one of my favorite general references on fabric . In addition to en encyclopedic explanation of each fabric 's characteristics , Ms. Shaeffer includes technical information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , recommended stitch types and other construction tidbits . Because this book was published in the mid ' 90s , it does not contain information on newer additions to the fabric world . I understand that an update is in the works . But even in its current edition , it 's an incredibly useful reference . <p> Number 7 <p> Couture Sewing Techniquesby Claire Shaeffer ( Taunton Press ) ISBN 1-56158-497-5Published in 2000 , the spine on my copy is broken from so much use . This book is packed to the gills with information on all manner of couture details . From the basics of underlining to Chanel-style jacket construction , this book is a treasure trove of techniques , written in a very accessible style . You do n't have to be a couture level seamster , nor do you need to be making a couture garment to use the great information in this book ! <p> Number 6 <p> Fast Fitby Sandra Betzina ( Taunton Press ) ISBN 1-56158-649-8This book is chock-a-block full of practical information for fitting almost any body . Ms. Betzina writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease . The first half of this book , which is hardcover with an internal spiral binding for ease of use , covers common fitting issues and fitting basics . The second half has step-by-step instructions on how to adjust patterns to address these issues . The second half is arranged by area of the body , so it 's easy to find the exact modification you need . I keep this book by my cutting table and refer to it constantly . <p> Number 5 <p> Fitting and Pattern Alteration : A Multi-Method Approachby Elizabeth Liechty , Della Pottbert , Judith Rasband ( Fairchild Books &amp; Visuals ) ISBN-13 : 978-0870057755Originally published in 1992 , it is a testament to the quality of information in this book that it is still at the top of many seamsters ' lists for usefulness . What I particularly like about this book is that it shows three different ways to alter patterns : the slash-and-spread method , in which you slash the pattern in the middle and spread ( or pinch ) to adjust fit ; the seam and pivot adjust method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamline , and the muslin , or trial garment method . Between these three methods you are bound to find one that works perfectly for you . And in my experience no one method works for every single alteration , so it 's a bonus to have several in one book . <p> Number 4 <p> Haute Coutureby Harold Koda and Richard Martin ( Harry N. Abrams ) ISBN-13 : 978-0810964969For pure inspiration , I think the books from the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's Costume Institute are among the best . This book , which was published in 1995 , surveys garments from a multitude of designers , which is why I include it here . While it wo n't give you any construction information , it will give you lots of ideas and hours of enjoyment . <p> Number 3 <p> Patternmaking for Fashion Design ( 4th Edition ) by Helen Joseph Armstrong ( Prentiss Hall ) ISBN-13 : 978-0131699939This book , which includes a CD ROM , is a college textbook , used in many of the top fashion schools . Unlike most college textbooks I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations . Okay , I admit , I was a computer science major in college , but still ! I particularly like Ms. Armstrong 's explanation of dart rotation and manipulation . One warning about this book : It 's BIG ( it weighs 5 lbs ) . It has information on pattern making for every area of the body , and it is quite comprehensive . Even if you do n't plan to make your own patterns , I think it 's a valuable resource to understand the workings behind the pattern . <p> Number 2 <p> Shirtmakingby David Page Coffin ( Taunton Press ) ISBN-13 : 978-1-56158-2This book is a great resource for anyone who wants to make a shirt , whether for a man or a woman . Mr. Coffin is a master of shirt design and construction , and his writing style is easy to read . The instructions are accompanied by excellent photographic illustrations .

@@22149072 @2149072/ <p> Have a few fabric scraps lying around ? I mean those little scraps that you 've been saving for years . Well , you were right . There is a good use for them . Almost any fabric or leather can be knotted , rolled , padded , or wrapped into decorative shapes you can use anywhere that you 'd use ordinary beads or buttons . You can string them into necklaces or stitch them , make them hard as rocks or leave them soft , and embellish them all you want with additional stitches , beads , and other surface effects . <p> Making little fabric gems is quick and easy , and you 'll find everything you need around your home : a sturdy needle , scissors , knitting needles or nails , and some white glue .

The only thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work with varying results , so the main thing you need to know about your fabric is whether you like the way it looks when it 's knotted . To see how your fabric will knot , twist a length of it and tie it in an overhand knot . If you 're using a thin piece of fabric and want a larger knot , you 'll need to fold a wider piece or wrap it around some other scrap fabric to add bulk . You do n't have to use a bias strip , but some fabric prints will look more interesting on the bias , and bias strips roll nicely into tubes . Knit fabrics work fine . You can choose to leave raw edges exposed or fold them completely out of sight as shown at right before making your knot . <p> To make beads in graduating sizes , the strip you make your knot from and/or the filling material you use to pad it with has to increase or decrease in thickness to step the beads up or down . Assemble small stacks of filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to make two or more beads in a row of the same size , then change the amount of fabric you use for the next two , and continue making varying sizes until you have the range you want . <p> Folding , knotting , and finishingBelow you 'll find directions for a variety of basic knots , folds , and rolls that you can apply to your fabrics . <p> Basic overhand knot <p> Basic ball knot <p> Braided knot <p> Rolled beads and toggles <p> Single rolled beads and toggles- <p> There 's nothing fancy about the knots . Typically you form them with the same kind of attention to their appearance you 'd apply to a decorative bow , tightening and adjusting them until you like the way they look .

You can also make any of these knots into hard beads by dipping the fabric , before knotting , in a half-cup or so of white glue mixed with water to the consistency of milk . Dip your fabric pieces in the glue mixture until they 're saturated , squeeze them lightly , then knot . After the beads have a chance to dry , drill a hole in them and thread them onto a string . You can also knot or wrap the wet fabrics around a nail or a knitting needle so that the beads are formed with a hole in the middle .

But if your goal is to make beautiful garments with soft , supple embroidery , there 's much more you should know . <p> You can machine-embroider any fabric , including silks and soft wools . But producing exquisite embroidery that is well suited to the fabric , does n't pucker , or change the fabric 's drape , involves the interaction of all the following elements : a machine that 's well-tuned and set at the appropriate needle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct needle and thread for the job , and a good understanding of the fabric you 're embroidering so that it 's properly hooped and stabilized . I 'll examine these essentials , but I want to concentrate on how to choose designs and fabrics that are compatible with each other and tell you what to do when they 're not . <p> What makes a good embroidery design ? There 's more to a good design than subject matter and visual aesthetics . A well-digitized design is made up of a solid framework of stitches forming its outer edge , fill and satin stitches , and underlay stitches if necessary . The design should have a well-planned sewing sequence , with few jump stitches , from one area to another , so there 's less thread-trimming to do . And it should be paired with a suitable fabric that displays it to its best advantage . <p> If you digitize your own designs or have them custom-digitized , you can take into consideration the characteristics of the fabric the design will be sewn on . But when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet , or designs that come with your machine , it 's up to you to match the design with the fabric <p> Consider the fabric 's weight and weaveIt 's important to understand that not every design should be used on every type of fabric , even with the proper stabilizer ( see Are your fabric and design compatible ? ) . A densely stitched design , for example , can put stress on certain fabrics , such as knits and lightweight , loosely woven fabrics , in some cases causing the weave to pull apart . Dense designs may simply be too stiff for a fluid fabric , but can be used successfully on stable , medium- to heavyweight woven fabrics . <p> The threads of coarsely woven fabrics can deflect the machine needle while stitching , producing uneven edges . <p> The same design stitches out cleanly on a more smoothly woven fabric . <p> A small , less densely stitched design may be wrong for a thick pile fabric , such as fleece or terry cloth , because its coverage may be inadequate , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works best on a smooth-surface , plain-weave fabric . And a design with substantial underlay stitches might be a plus on a deep pile fabric to keep the pile from poking through the stitches . Conversely , it may be too dense for a soft knit or drapey woven . <p> In addition to the fabric 's weight and weave , consider the fabric 's color and how you plan to use the fabric . Bold colors or patterns will probably obscure pastel embroidery , and a large , dense floral design on silk velvet , for instance , may work beautifully for a pillow cover but be awkwardly stiff on a long , fluid skirt . In some cases , you can alter the design to make it work ; sometimes the best alternative is to choose a different design . <p> Are your fabric and design compatible ? <p> For a successful marriage of fabric and design , consider carefully the fabric 's characteristics , its intended use , and the details of the design . Ask yourself the following questions , and always make test samples : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fabric ? If so , is this a problem for your project ? <p> How will the fabric 's color , weight , and texture influence the design ? <p> Can you get better results by using a backing or topping ? <p> Will the fabric and design work together if you simply change thread colors ? <p> Can you alter the design to make it work , or is choosing a different design the best alternative ? <p> Stabilizing the fabric : backings and toppings <p> For stitching out a design , you need to hoop wovens and knits smoothly , with neutral tension , and no stretching . Velvet is an exception ( I 'll discuss it in a moment ) . Lycra knits with four-way stretch , however , need to be stretched in the hoop ( and backed with a cutaway stabilizer ) in the same direction and amount they 'll stretch on the body when worn . Otherwise , the garment will not stretch on the body , causing undo stress on the design and fabric . <p> Different fabrics require different preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of open space . To hoop , stretch the knit as it 's worn on the body ( left ) . The design will appear puckered when the fabric is relaxed ( middle ) but will stretch over the body when worn ( right ) . Photos : Mary Ray . <p> You may also need to stabilize the fabric by hooping it with a backing . Most embroidery-stitch designers recommend always using a backing , but very stable and tightly woven fabrics ( such as organza or terry-cloth toweling ) may not need backing at all , depending on the design . <p> Backings come in a variety of weights and types cutaway , tearaway , heat-disintegrating , or water-soluble ( see Backings and toppings ) . A backing should always be hooped beneath the fabric unless hooping will cause permanent marks , as it would on velvet or Ultrasuede . In that case , use a sticky backing in the hoop , and adhere the fabric to it . Or hoop a tearaway backing , and adhere the fabric with a temporary spray adhesive like Sulky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics and designs without a lot of fill areas . As a general rule , use cutaway backings with all knits and with wovens on which you 'll embroider a design with a large stitch count and large fill areas , especially if it has a running-stitch outline . <p> Toppings are not hooped but rather placed on top of the hooped fabric to compress or mat down nap or pile and to improve the resolution of stitches by keeping them from sinking into the fabric . Toppings also improve color coverage when the thread color contrasts greatly with that of the fabric . They can also add artistic effects or three-dimensional and raised effects . Toppings are torn away around the completed design . <p> Backings and topings <p> Hooping a backing beneath the fabric and/or laying a topping over the hooped fabric can help stabilize and prepare the fabric for embroidery . Select the backing or topping to coordinate with the fabric or design used . <p> Common backings <p> * Nonwoven tearaways ( Sulky Stiffy , Tear-Easy , Totally Stable ) ; can use on most fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheer , Cut-Away Plus ) ; use on knits and lightweight wovens * Sticky backings ( Sulky Sticky ; Stick-It-All from Hoop-It-All ) ; use on fabrics that can not be hooped , such as velvet , Ultrasuede , and leather * Meltaways , burnaways , washaways ( Solvy ; Sulky Heat-Away ; Stick-dsolv from Hoop-It-All ) ; use on sheer and lightweight fabrics and for cutwork designs <p> Common toppings <p> * Water-soluble films ( Solvy , Stick-dsolv ) ; use on textured knits and on top of other stitching* CoverUp from Hoop-It-All ( available in colors ) ; use on fabrics with high-contrast colors * LamT , or mylar ; use to create shimmering effect through embroidery . <p> A word about stock designs <p> Stock designs are those available from your machine manufacturer or from independent design companies and formatted for your machine . You can also find an abundance of stock designs available free on the Internet . Professional design companies have experienced , knowledgeable staffs who spend a lot of time creating and testing their designs so you 'll get excellent results when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with free designs . <p> All stock designs are created for what I call average fabric conditions . This means the fabric on which the design works best is a solid-color broadcloth that 's hooped on-grain and is light or neutral in color . If you stitch out stock designs on fabrics that vary from this norm , you may run into some problems , even with perfectly good designs , and you 'll need to make some adjustments to your fabric to get good results . I 'll talk about that in a moment , but first let 's look at how to determine whether a design will work well for your fabric . The best way is to do a test run on the actual fabric or one that 's very similar . Watch as the design stitches out to observe how the underlay is produced , where the jumps are , and the direction of the fill stitching . <p> If you see that the design is not stitching out to meet your expectations , what do you do ? You could edit the design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ability with the programs permit . Or you could contact the company from which you purchased the design and have it edited ( for a fee ) or have a new design custom-digitized . But keep in mind , if you have a design digitized for a specific fabric , it may not work well on other fabrics . <p> Another solution to this problem is to make your fabric as " average " as possible by using backings and toppings so the fabric is compatible with the stock design . Below are common problems embroiderers encounter ; some are solved by and some are caused by using or misusing backings and toppings . <p> Troubleshooting : puckering and distortionThe most frequent complaints I hear from machine embroiderers involve puckering , poor fabric coverage or poor registration . Puckering and distortion can occur if a design is too dense for the fabric . For example , if a design has lots of full-coverage fill areas with layers of blended stitches on top , it may not be the best choice for knits or lightweight , drapey fabrics . Knits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit along its horizontal axis and cause the knit to open up , creating wavy , puckered embroidery . Most puckering problems can be eliminated by adding a backing . But do you really want to take a fabric with a soft , drapey hand and create a stiff , poster-board effect on part of it ? The design in question may be perfectly suitable for more stable fabric , but for a lightweight fabric or one with a loose , unstable weave , use a design with fewer fill and satin stitches . <p> In addition to choosing a design that 's too dense for your fabric 's weight and/or weave , there are other reasons your embroidery might pucker : Fabric that 's stretched too tightly when hooped will relax when unhooped . Overly tight machine tensions ( see Needles , threads , and tension ) can also cause puckering . To test your tension balance , sew a 1-in. -tall block letter H , using a bright color in the needle and white in the bobbin . Check the wrong side after stitching . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight or your top thread is too loose , or both . If you see a bobbin thread column about one-third the width of your satin-stitch column , your tensions are balanced . But before you rush to adjust your tensions ( some machines have automatic tensions ) , check the threading . Because rayon thread is slippery , it can jump out of the take-up lever causing tension problems . Therefore rethread the upper thread path , and check the bobbin to be sure it 's threaded correctly , too . <p> Needles , threads , and tension <p> Start with a new needle that 's the right type and size for your fabric and thread . A needle that 's wrong or damaged can cause excessive thread shredding or fabric damage . <p> If you vary the thread from 40-weight embroidery thread , test the design before stitching it out on your garment . <p> Remember , too , that thread breaks may be caused by old thread ( store in a dust-free container away from strong light and heat sources ) or overly tight tension , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight can stretch the thread and distort the fabric and design . Know your machine 's tension settings : Some machines control needle tension automatically ; others require a dial setting . <p> Poor fabric coverage <p> Poor fabric coverage may be the result of the fabric color or texture , thread choice , enlarging the design , or even personal preference . For example , a stock design with creamy yellow daffodils composed of longer satin stitches will probably not work well on plush forest-green terry-cloth toweling unless it is specifically digitized for terry cloth . If this is the case , the design would have a grid of underlay stitches to mat down the terry loops and maybe some zigzag underlay to keep the top satin stitches lofty and prevent the terry cloth 's color from peeking through and the stitches from being lost in the pile . <p> To counteract poor coverage , consider using a topping like CoverUp , which comes in colors . The correct color can neutralize the effects of colored or printed fabrics and hold the pile of a fabric in check all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthens the stitches and increases the spacing between them ( lowering the stitch density ) . These designs will not cover fabric as well as their unscaled counterparts . If your customizing software only elongates the stitches and spreads out the rows , try using gold lamT as a topping . The spaces created from lengthening the stitches will have the shimmering lamT peeking through , and you may even create a more interesting effect than the original design . <p> Personal preference also influences what you think about fabric coverage . Too many embroiderers expect total coverage of any fabric , regardless of thread-color choices . This results in stiff embroidery , which professional embroiderers and digitizers consider to be of poor quality and which will probably result in other problems , such as puckering , thread breaks , or even fabric damage . <p> Misalignment problemsPoor registration ( gapping or misaligned outlines ) can result from using a tearaway backing with a design that has large fill areas . These designs can break down a tearaway and compromise stability before the outline has been completely sewn . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remedy the problem . <p> Overly tight tensions can also cause poor registration . In this case , you may need to loosen both your bobbin and upper thread tensions to correct it . The threads of a coarsely woven fabric may cause what might appear to be poor registration : The fabric fibers can deflect the needle to one side of the fabric threads , causing uneven edges . For clean-edged results , choose a stable , smooth-finish fabric . <p> With careful use of high-quality designs and thoughtful fabric choices , you can ensure good results and have more fun at your embroidery machine . <p> Lindee Goodall of Tucson , Arizona , is the president of Cactus Punch Designs and teaches classes on machine embroidery at shows around the country .

Everyday garments , however , do n't need to be boned , because they hang from the shoulders or waist and depend on gravity to keep them looking right . But I 've nonetheless found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment are indispensable , for example , for helping a seam , skirt yoke , oversized waistband , square neckline , or decorative fold stay put . Boning in these places is n't stiff or uncomfortable ( I use flexible metal boning that 's lightweight and has nonpoking metal tips ) , and it 's easy to install , with a few ground rules in mind . I 'll give you some examples of places I 've found boning effective , and then show you how to add it to a garment . <p> Where to bone and whyA well-fitting garment is designed to not only look good but also assure the wearer that it is n't riding up or slipping down as she moves . For example , the fabric of a fitted skirt with a high-yoked waistband tends to ride up at the hips , choosing the path of least resistance , and moving toward the smaller waist circumference and away from the hips . At the same time , the section of waistband above the waist wants to collapse or slip down . Boning the waistband solves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boning include necklines , side seams , and midriffs . Square necklines are notorious for gaping , especially when they span much of the chest . A length of boning , placed horizontally along the base of the square , keeps the edge straight and close to the body . Necklines that form a wide V often sprout drag lines along the edge , and if the garment has sleeves , arm movement intensifies the problem . But all these problems are easily fixed with small vertical sections of boning . <p> I also often use bones to straighten side seams on a bodice , even if the garment is n't strapless . The bones serve to counteract gravity , and keep a bodice made with a soft , drapey fabric from sagging . And if the garment happens to be a one-shoulder dress , side-seam bones will even out the tension produced by one side being supported and the other left to fend for itself . <p> For bodices with a V-shaped waist , bones are invaluable . Three pieces of boning radiating from the base of the V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hips , and the vertical style of a nicely formed V. <p> For a skirt on a wedding or party dress that gathers fabric to the back- or that sculpts folds in back or front- boning sewn to an underskirt maintains the skirt 's graceful folds . The wearer can move about freely without worrying that her carefully arranged folds are shifting or riding up . The draped fabric is invisibly tacked to the boning casing along the seamlines on both sides of the hips . <p> Boning hidden inside these garments helps maintain their shape ( photo : Sloan Howard ) . The jacket ( Vogue 2355 ) has bones at the waist to support the soft , drapey fabric ; the top ( Burda 2964 ) has a horizontal bone at the base of the square neckline to keep it from gaping ; and the pants ' waistband , ( adapted from Vogue 2355 's skirt waistband ) is boned to keep its high waist upright . <p> There are many more places to use boning : in bodices that lace up the back ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-up collar that 's reluctant to behave ; and in contour fabric belts and handbags . The blouse , pants , and jacket shown here use bones in the shaped waistband , around the jacket 's waistline , and at the blouse 's neckline to add structure to soft , drapey fabrics . When considering places for boning , keep in mind that the bones will only be effective in fitted areas close to the body , sort of like an external skeleton . <p> - <p> On fabrics where the boning might show through to the right side , buffer it with a layer of flannel . Underline an entire garment section with flannel , or stitch a piece of flannel a little larger than the bone to a silk-organza underlining , as shown in this sample . <p> Luckily , boning can often be added after the garment is complete and you notice something sagging or puckering . Just stitch on a casing , and slip in the appropriate-sized bone . <p> All bones are not equalMy favorite type of boning is made from 1/4-in. -wide spiral steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible . When properly placed , they 're undetectable on the garment 's right side and are comfortable to wear . You 'll want to have the right size bone handy . They 're sold by the piece and come in 1/2-in. increments from 1/2 in. to 17 in. ( for sources , see Spiral-steel boning by mail ) . I usually keep a variety of sizes on hand . <p> When you want extremely short pieces of boning- for use in a stand-up collar , for example- it 's fine to use polypropylene boning instead of spiral-steel boning , since not much strength is needed . This type of boning comes packaged in a coil ; you can straighten it out with a little heat from your iron and easily cut it to length , rounding the ends . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Spiral-steel bones are lightweight and strong , and flex with the body .

Take care to not make the channels too loose or too narrow- 3/8 in. wide for 1/4-in. boning is about right . Sew the machine-stitched channels by hand over seam allowances or by hand or machine onto an underlining . <p> Installing boning <p> Sew a 3/8-in. channel for 1/4-in. bone from silk organza . <p> - <p> Stitch it to the underlining or over a seam allowance along the same stitching lines as the channel , sewing across one end . <p> Complete the garment . Insert the boning after construction , and hand-stitch openings closed . <p> - <p> Boning in the side seams of a skirt underlining provides the perfect anchor for free-form folds on the hip . <p> If you decide you need a bone after the garment is constructed , of course , you 'll need to sew the channel into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ahead and determined the location of your bones , sew the channels to the underlining , but leave one end open and the bones out while sewing the garment- it 'll be much easier to work with- and put them in for fitting . After the garment is complete , close the channel 's open end with hand stitches . <p> Use tiny bones to smooth out puckers- even after construction . The shoulder on this beaded dress insisted on collapsing after it was constructed . Two small bones , positioned in casings hand-stitched to the lining , corrected the problem . <p> Invisible from the outsideNo one needs to know there 's boning in your garment . When the bone is positioned over a seam allowance , the casing usually adds enough opacity to keep it from showing on the outside . If your garment fabric is lightweight , or you want a bone where there 's no seam allowance , keep the bones from showing on the outside by putting a layer of flannel ( pinked to soften the edges ) between the fabric and the channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the bone from showing without having to layer an entire section with heavy flannel . Be sure to make a test sample first , since this technique works only when the fashion fabric is moderately opaque- there should n't be any discernable color difference where the flannel is applied . Textured fabric like boucle or dimensional lace will naturally conceal boning . <p> After your boned garment is complete , use care when pressing it . If you press directly over the boning , you 'll run the risk of making an imprint of it on the right side of the garment , even if you use a pressing cloth . Instead , press boned areas face down into a soft surface like flannel or a terry cloth towel . <p> Now that you know how easy and useful it is to add boning to your garments , use it freely for adding structure to the soft , drapey fabric of fitted garments or in areas that want to head in a direction the opposite of what you 've got in mind . So use your imagination and ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down . <p> EmilyBint writes : I had a loose chambray dress that looked kinda off a bit and when I tried the boning technique it turned out great .

Quite a few readers e-mailed me to ask about tutorials for the embellishments on the hats featured in the article , and we 've been offering a series of posts here on the Threads blog . <p> This post covers how to create the elegant and intriguing feathers that John applies to some of his hats . They are made with fabric and flexible wire - these feathers are easy to curl and gently twist into interesting shapes . John paints his feathers to give them a very realistic look . <p> John says that you can use a variety of fabrics to make the feathers . He suggests muslin or silk , but says you could use just about any fabric as long as it 's stiffened some way in order to prevent fraying . He sizes fabric with Aleene 's Stiffen Quick . <p> In the past he has used fabrics like doe suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about any fabric that happens to be in the hat .

@@22149079 @2149079/ <h> Cut Up Your Patterns and Add Seams <p> When I 've spent time fitting a pattern and love the results , I 'm not going to waste time looking for a new pattern . Instead , I add seams to the original and redesign the way it looks . <p> Anyone can rework favorite patterns by adding seams . The possibilities are endless , and you do n't need a degree in pattern drafting for success . I 'll show you step-by-step how to do this , but first , take a look at the photos of my wardrobe below , - while I explain simple ways to add style lines , develop surface design , and create details on patterns you already know and love . ( Most of- the jackets started as the same pattern : Butterick 5941 . ) <p> - <p> Insert elements into seams . These sleeves were divided into five sections with a shaped fabric fin inserted between each section . Divide almost any pattern section into more pieces , then add piping , fringe , or bead trim , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The author 's design ) . <p> - <p> Combine fabrics . Divide a pattern and cut each section from a different fabric . This is an excellent way to use leftover fabrics and coordinate a new garment with others already in your wardrobe . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Accent a precious fabric . When I could n't follow the fabric 's straight grain on a narrow silk , I cut each pattern piece on the correct grain from a lightweight knit fusible interfacing and fused these to the wrong side of the silk . Curves like this may require using staystitching and clipping to fit the shapes together smoothly . ( Butterick 5941 ) <p> - <p> Add a peplum. - Cut off the jacket pattern at the waistline . Cut a strip of the fabric the depth and length of the peplum with pleats added at the side seams and back . Piece if needed . ( Butterick 5941 ) - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Add seams for economy . Leather jackets have more seam detail because of skin sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams help fit the pattern pieces on skins . ( Butterick 5941 ) <p> Add a ruffle . Cut the jacket pattern 3 or 4 inches below the waist and the sleeves just below the elbow . Add a doubled bias ruffle for a stylish , soft blouse . ( Butterick 5941 ) <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Adding seams offers a benefit beyond style that I 'll just mention here . Every seam provides an opportunity to fine-tune the fit of a garment . For example , you can add or subtract small increments of fabric in the vertical seams of a jacket or skirt or pants to enlarge or reduce the circumference . You can also make slight changes in the shape of a seam to nip in a waist or expand a bustline , as just two possibilities . Tiny 1/4-inch changes in eight seams around a garment amounts to 2 inches . <p> When you have problems achieving a good fit , adding seams often provides a viable solution . But for the most fun , change your patterns for style in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the designer . <p> 1 . Make a plan . Use a photocopy machine to copy and enlarge the schematic drawings from the pattern instruction sheet .

Position the pattern pieces on pattern paper over a piece of foamcore and trace the seamlines with a needle tracing wheel . <p> - <p> 2b .

After tracing , remove the tissue pattern and draw over all the pricks with a marker . <p> - <p> - <p> 3a . Make new pattern sections . Follow your planning sketches to draw the new seamlines on the traced pattern pieces . <p> 3b . Place hash marks across the new seamlines to indicate notches .

This wo n't change the fit or shape of the garment , only the lines .

@@22149080 @2149080/ <h> Making Sense of Pattern Grading <h> Pattern Grading 101 <p> The term pattern grading may initially conjure up visions of complicated measurements and fancy rulers , but once the basic concept is understood , the actual process of grading is easy , especially using the method I outline here . This means that you-the home sewer , custom dressmaker , or independent designer-can do just as good a job as Vogue , Burda , Calvin , or Donna . <p> Why grade ? The purpose of grading is to proportionally increase or decrease the size of a pattern , while maintaining shape , fit , balance , and scale of style details ( dress , original design ) . <p> I 'll explain the thought process behind grading and touch upon the three different methods used in the industry today . Then I 'll take you step-by-step through a simple cut-and-spread grading method and provide the measurements and formulas you 'll need to get started . So whether you want to take a beloved pattern up ( or down ) a size or two or you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important tool . Once you understand it , you 'll be able to take your sewing to the next level . <p> The basic conceptHistorically , the science of grading went hand-in-hand with the advent of commercial patterns and the mass-production of pattern-built clothing some 150 years ago . To properly fit a pattern to a range of sizes , each pattern piece needed to be graded , or systematically increased or decreased . Today , pattern companies and apparel manufacturers take a middle-sized pattern ( typically a size 12 ) and grade it up for larger sizes and grade it down for smaller sizes ( see One pattern , three sizes ) . <p> - <p> One pattern , three sizes <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> A base size 12 pattern ( left ) can be graded up to a size 16 ( center ) - using the cut-and-spread method , and similarly graded down to a size 6 ( right ) - by cutting and overlapping along specified cut lines . <p> Methods of gradingThere are three basic methods of grading : cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one method is technically superior and all are equally capable of producing a correct grade . <p> Cut-and-spread method : The easiest method , which is the basis of the other two methods , is to cut the pattern and spread the pieces by a specific amount to grade up , or overlap them to grade down . No special training or tools are required-just scissors , a pencil , tape , and a ruler that breaks 1 in. down to 1/64 . <p> Pattern shifting : Pattern shifting is the process of increasing the overall dimensions of a pattern by moving it a measured distance up and down and left and right , ( using a specially designed ruler ) and redrawing the outline , to produce the same results as the cut-and-spread method . <p> The most recent development , computer grading , is the fastest method , but tends to be an investment only larger manufacturers can afford . However , sophisticated home computer software is becoming affordable. - <p> - <p> Grading vs. alteration : What 's the difference ? Grading is used to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sizes . Alteration is used to make a particular size conform to an individual 's personal figure challenges . <p> - <p> It 's important to remember that grading only makes a shape larger or smaller and is n't intended to change a shape . Grading also reflects the fact that individuals of different sizes are proportionately different , not uniformly different . When we grade up or down , we do n't merely make everything equally larger or smaller . Instead , we take into account that different body parts increase at different and proportional amounts . <p> Pattern vs. body measurementsThe first step in any grading exercise is to accurately measure your base pattern . Sometimes you can find the key measurements you need ( bust , waist , and hip ) on the pattern envelope . Or you can measure the pattern itself . <p> To determine the actual measurements of the sewn garment rather than the size of the paper pattern , keep two things in mind when measuring a pattern . First , account for all design details . If a garment has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dart area when you measure the waist ; similarly , omit the volume given to pleats and gathers . Second , measure the pattern from seamline to seamline , not cutting line to cutting line. - Once you 've gleaned the key measurements from the pattern , you can address the basic grading dilemma-the difference between the pattern measurements and body measurements . To establish your body 's bust , waist , and hip measurements , you can measure yourself or refer to the Quick reference for cut-and-spread pattern grading . To measure yourself , wear undergarments that fit well , and hold a measuring tape snugly ( but not tightly ) around your waist , the fullest part of your bust , and at hip level ( 9 in. below the waist ) . Before you record your measurements , be sure to add the amount of ease the pattern includes ( or the ease yo 'd prefer for that style of garment ) . <p> Establish the gradeOnce you have the bust , waist , and hip measurements from both the pattern and your body , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I grade up if the pattern is too small ? Or , if it 's too big , then how much do I grade down ? " To establish the overall grade , or the total amount needed to make the pattern larger or smaller , simply calculate the difference between the pattern and the body measurements . There are two types of overall grades : an even grade and an uneven grade . <p> An even grade means that the bust , waist , and hip measurements change the same amount from one size to another . For example , if a pattern measures 35-27-37 and the body measures 37-29-39 , then the difference between each measurement is 2 in. and the overall grade is an even 2 in . Sizes of commercial patterns and apparel always follow an even grade . <p> Four ways to address an uneven gradeWhen you have an even grade , the process of grading is straightforward . Home sewers and dressmakers often , however , encounter uneven grades , when , for example , a dress needs to be graded up 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip . If the grade is uneven , there are four ways to use grading to alter the pattern : <p> 1 . If the grade is uneven and you 're sizing up , then you can use an even grade equal to the value of the largest measurement difference . If you 're sizing down , then use an even grade equal to the value of the smallest difference . This will get the pattern close to the general size you need , then you can make minor adjustments as needed . <p> 2 . My favorite method allows for a more exact fit and is the best way to address fit problems for pear- or triangle-shaped women . Just separate the pattern at the waist , and grade the top and bottom individually . Then rejoin the pattern , and blend the new lines at the waistline . <p> 3 . You can address an uneven grade based solely on the difference between the bust measurement of the pattern and the body . Because the bust is the hardest part of the body to fit , many patternmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter as necessary at the waist and hip . <p> 4 . This method is specific to a common grading challenge that occurs when a body has changed in width or height , but not both . With a client who 's gained weight , for example , just grade for circumference and forget about grading for length . Or for a teenage daughter who 's grown 6 in. taller but has n't filled out otherwise , ignore circumference and only grade for length . <p> If the differences between these measurements are n't equal , then it 's an uneven grade . This changes the shape of a garment , as well as its size , so strictly speaking , uneven grading is n't really grading . " Uneven grade " is synonymous with " pattern alteration . " An even grade is the type of grade I will discuss because it 's straightforward and easy to understand . Once you master the even grade , applying the methods to the uneven grade is the next step . See Four ways to address an uneven grade for more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have an even grade , the actual mechanics of cut-and-spread grading are easy ( see The cut-and-spread method for detailed instructions ) . Basically , you will use your measurements to do some easy calculations , create the cut lines on your pattern , then spread/overlap at each cut line the calculated amount . I 've listed the necessary formulas in the grading chart , as well as pre-calculated values ( no math needed ) for three different overall grades ( 1 in. , 1-1/2 in. , and 2 in . ) . <p> The cut-and-spread method can even be used when grading large amounts up or down , for example a size 4 to a size 18 . The large gaps at the cut lines do tend to be a little awkward , so I recommend grading incrementally instead ( first grade the size 4 to a size 12 and then the size 12 to a size 18 ) . <p> Insider tip ( industry secrets and know-how ) There are no standard sizes in the garment or pattern industry . Each manufacturer sets its own base pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Size-to-size grades for patterns or garments usually differ within a company 's product line . Smaller grades , 3/4 or 1 in. , are associated with smaller numerical pattern or garment sizes . That is , a size 4 may only be graded down 3/4 in. to produce a size 2 . Intermediate grades , 1-1/2 or 2 in. , are typical of middle numerical sizes . Larger grades , 3 in. or more , separate larger sizes . This is why one company 's size 8 can be different from another 's ( i.e. , different base pattern measures ) and why the difference between a size 8 and 10 vary from one company to the next ( i.e. , different grading rules ) . <p> Take it to the next levelWhen you first try grading , start with a basic bodice front and back , skirt front and back , and sleeve , then graduate to more complicated designs . Remember that any pattern , no matter how " designed , " is based on one or more of the five basic pieces . Even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the strapless bodice pattern over the basic bodice pattern and transfer the cut lines . A dress is simply a bodice joined to a skirt , so the cut lines and spread/overlap amounts remain the same . Just match up the vertical lines on the bodice with those on the skirt . <p> Grading can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be . So when you first approach any pattern , always start with these basics . Figure out your needs as a sewer , dressmaker , or designer ; then map out your course , and grade , one step at a time . <p> Terry Horlamus is founding director of Seattle 's New York Fashion Academy and teaches grading , pattern design , illustration , sewing , and construction . <p> I am a professional patternmaker . I have been creating designs and patterns for a variety of items for women , men , and children since 1990 . I just created a discussion list on LinkedIn for Patternmakers and Graders .

For maximum gathers , set the differential to the highest number , the needle tensions to 6 or 7 , and to the longest stitch length .

Rolled and narrow hem stitching looks the best for this technique . Set the differential dial to the lowest number and watch the fabric stretch and furl as it feeds through the machine . <p> TIP : If the stitch is not catching the fabric 's edge , this is due to the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cut . Prior to serging , press a 1/2 inch hem , serge along the fold , and trim away the excess . <p> 3 . Serging corners <p> For an outside corner , serge one or two stitches past the end of the corner , raise the presser foot and gently pull the thread tail off the stitch finger . Turn the corner and put the edge of the fabric right up to the needles . Pull up on the threads above the tension to get rid of any " thread slack , " lower the foot and serge the next side . <p> The inside corner is stitched by straightening the corner . Make a 1/4 inch clip diagonally into the corner . Straighten the inside corner as you skim the fabric edge . <p> - <p> 4 . Serging Curves <p> An outside curve is hard to pivot around because the long presser foot holds the fabric .

The demand among quilters for exactitude arises from their desire to quilt designs that complement the symmetry in the precision-pieced quilt tops that are so popular today . <p> - <p> With the patchwork 's seamlines as the only quilting guide , the author dispensed with marking " The Perfect Existential Object " ( 69 by 70 in. , 1997 ) and quilted freehand instead . <p> But this insistence on precision quilting has n't always been the case .

And instead of casting their quilting stitches in a subordinate role to the patchwork , these quilters were likely to go their own way with tiny stitches meandering across the quilt top , heedless of its patterns , freehand-quilting everything from simple outlines and floral shapes to large-scale borders and overall fan patterns . I 've always liked the beauty and spontaneity of their quilting , so after years of meticulously marking and stitching symmetrical designs , I decided to give freehand quilting a try . <p> One step at a timeEven though I had plenty of seams in my piecework to use as guideposts , the idea of quilting with no marks to follow was more intimidating than I expected .

Do the same on the other end of the bar , and continue quilting . When the quilt has been rolled up 3 to 4 ft. , it will become difficult to reach in far enough to reclamp the bars . At this point remove the pinned bars and replace them with the two 4-ft. bars . <p> Expanding my horizonsReturning to my tale of freehand quilting , once I was comfortable quilting small areas confined by nearby seamlines , I was ready to embark on a larger expanse with a crosshatch pattern . Still " fenced in " by the piecework 's seamlines , I established a diagonal line by starting at one corner of the block and pointing my needle at the opposite corner . But to make sure my eye did n't stray as I traversed the distance , I marked the desired path with a few pins so that I 'd have something to aim my needle at . As hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably seemed to wander , but after a while I came to prefer this organic effect . And I knew I did n't have to work at achieving this look because it was going to happen anyway . <p> The stitching logistics I arrived at were simple : after covering the area with lines going in one direction , I was able to stitch a second set of diagonals in the other direction without any pinned guideposts . The spacing between the lines had already been established by the first set of diagonals , so I only needed to make sure my needle was perpendicular to the previous line , which was only an inch or so away . <p> Feathers and fans- Floral motifs and feathers were next , but I still had to ease into them , marking one row of feathers , shown in quilting pattern 4 in Quilt these designs freehand , or floral patterns that I could then follow in subsequent rows . Eventually I graduated to freehand fans , pattern 5 , consisting of concentric arcs across the entire quilt top without regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th-century quilts made throughout the South . I learned to work the way old-time quilters did , quilting one row of freehand arcs around the edge of the quilt about one needle length apart ( I use a no. 9 between needle ) , then building more rows of concentric arcs , as shown on the facing page . <p> Finally fearless , freehandDispensing with markings altogether , I finally got up the courage to put a quilt in the frame , with no patterns and no plan . All I had in mind was the idea of an abstract , Amish-style quilt with large areas of solid color that needed close quilting . Working from the edges into the middle , I started with the loosely arranged , large zigzags on the purple borders , then decided to try the basket weave in the navy area . Once I accepted the inevitable variations as part of the effect in the basket weave , the rest was easy . <p> Irregularities in complex , geometric quilting designs are n't noticeable at first glance , as can be seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy area . " Pumpkin seeds " in the small red squares and wide echo stitching in the turquoise squares serve as traditional Amish-style block fillers . <p> - <p> Two horizontal parallel lines stitched first down the center of the feather pattern were the only " markings " for quilting . Freehand clamshells " grow " as they progress sideways on the quilt . <p> - <p> The quilt 's title , " The Perfect Existential Object , " is handwritten on the tan block . <p> Next , I quilted a row of fans in the plum border area , " hanging diamonds " in the brown area and a row of unmarked feathers below the hanging diamonds . I decided to treat the diamond strip up the middle with classic Amish-style " pumpkin seed " shapes in the red diamonds and wide double-outline quilting in the turquoise triangles . The clamshells , which I worked from the quilt 's right side inward , appear to expand uniformly , which would have been quite a feat if I 'd done it on purpose , but the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-circles I stitched . The medium-sized blocks throughout the top ended up with an assortment of odd designs as I started to run out of ideas for block fillers . ( For a book with abundant filler ideas and other quilting designs , see Resources . ) <p> What to expectTry as you will , freehand quilting will never be as precise as marked stitches , but that 's part of its charm . Having tried a fair amount of freehand quilting , I 've come to see some of the underlying principles of this approach : First , the larger and more interconnected the stitching design , the more irregularities it will have . Second , the more your quilting designs are related to the seamline intersections and angles they create in the quilt , the easier it is to control the direction of your stitches . In turn , this means you can quilt freehand and still respect the symmetry of the piecework design since you always have checkpoints for your eye and needle . Third , if you truly want to keep lines as straight and parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending points . <p> Finally , the less geometric the shape of the quilted design , the more accepting your eye will be . Flowers , feathers , leaves , and any pictorial designs or organic shapes will look as elegant or polished freehand as they would carefully marked on the quilt top . <p> To mark or not to mark ? - One advantage of marking a quilt is predictability and visual order , so when these factors are important , or when precise symmetry is desirable , marking is the way to go . But whenever I want a looser , more spontaneous visual impact , I freehand-quilt everything I can . <p> To me the appeal of freehand quilting is that it prolongs the fun part-designing and figuring out what you 're going to do next . Thus the moment of creation lasts throughout the entire quilting process .

Aspiring seamstresses want to know what features to look for , but we 've found that everyone has different needs and preferences . <p> I asked the Threads staff about their experiences with their first sewing machines , posing the following questions : <p> Think back to your first sewing machine . What feature did you most appreciate ? What feature did you wish the machine had ? Was there a feature that you thought you 'd love , and ended up not using much or even disliking ? <p> With our combined 300-plus years of sewing ( yes , it 's true ! ) , we all had different stories to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme in all our answers was " simplicity and reliability . " None of us felt the call of dozens of fancy stitch patterns , and we all valued machines that felt user-friendly and trustworthy . <p> Read on for some verbatims , and to find out which features we longed for in our early days of sewing-and in some cases still long for ! Although the machines we praise are no longer being manufactured , the qualities that we love(d) about them can be found in many new machines . <h> Buttonhole-stitch envy <p> " The feature I always wished the machine had was an easy buttonhole maker . Making buttonholes required using the zigzag stitch on my mom 's machine , or hooking up a clunky and finicky attachment on Grandma 's machine . Both were Singer machines . I have inherited an old Singer Slant-o-matic like Mom 's , which- does not have a buttonhole maker , either . I use the zigzag stitch . I should be an expert by now ! <p> - " The feature I like on this old Slant-o-Matic is the collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make different types of stitches . I know , I am living in the Dark Ages . Today 's computerized machines have millions of stitches and lots of other bells and whistles . But I 'll take my old reliable over them any day . " <p> - <h> Chainstitch and bobbin-winding <p> " I bought my first machine in about 1965 or 1966 . It was a Singer Touch and Sew , and I think it was model 626 . It had seven specialty push-button stitches including standard zig-zag . ( Push button was the new thing at the time . Up until then you had to use cams for specialty stitches. ) - It also stitched a fabulous chain stitch that was easy to set up . The chain stitch was fantastic for any time stitches would ultimately be removed , for example when basting a muslin together . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> " The thing I loved most about that machine and wish I had today was that you wound the bobbin within the bobbin case . When the bobbin ran out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle threaded . You just pushed a button and hit the foot pedal and the bobbin was wound . You pushed the button again and returned to your sewing. - <p> - " What I like best about my new machine that I wish that machine had is the automatic thread cutter . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's the best new invention out there ! " <h> Easy portability <p> " I learned to sew on my mother 's early-1960s Singer machine ( the " Rocketeer " ) , which was a big , solid , flat-bed machine . As a teen , I never bothered to read the manual or figure out most of its features-it always felt like a bit of a monster. - <p> - <p> " When I bought my own first machine , many years later , I purchased a very basic mechanical machine , the Brother Pacesetter 1000 . It offers about 13 stitches , including a four-step buttonhole . I 'm not sure there 's a machine as bare-bones as this one nowadays . However , I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not too big or heavy , so it 's easy to carry when I go to a sewing class , or pitch in at the dance studio doing last-minute costume alterations . The stitch quality is excellent , and the stitch-width adjustment dial makes it easy to place the needle in just about any position , so top- and edgestitching evenly is simple . The only features I missed were a one-step , auto-size buttonhole stitch , and a needle-up/needle-down feature , so the machine would always stop with the needle down . <p> " Recently , I lost my newer , fancier machine in a serious flood . The PS 1000 has once again become my go-to sewing machine . It continues to behave well-but now that I 'm older , I wish for an automatic needle-threader ! " <h> Strong , yet sensitive <p> " My first sewing machine-a Janome Memory Craft 3000 , which is still the machine I use-purchased about 17 years ago , 100 percent fulfilled my expectations and needs at the time . I was sewing mostly Renaissance-faire costumes from mid- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother ( who purchased it for me to defend her old Singer from my handwheel-reversing propensities and super-thick sewing projects ) that the machine would easily stitch through at least six layers of heavy denim without complaining . And he proved it with a demonstration . When seams can be three of four layers thick , and intersections are like road speed-bumps , you need that kind of capability . <p> " And now that sewing silk is my favorite thing to do , I 'm pleased that the machine also handles extremely lightweight fabrics beautifully . If you 're considering a new sewing machine , or a first sewing machine , be strategic . Think about the kind of sewing you 're most likely to do and look for features that will make it easier . Think about the problems or limitations of your current machine and look for features that will solve them . Bells and whistles are nice , but solid basic functions are imperative . My old Janome has dozens of decorative stitches that I hardly ever use , and an automatic/sensor buttonholer that sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my staples ) ; although I like having those capabilities just in case , and I know that buttonhole feature works incredibly well . " <h> Classic reliability <p> " My first machine ( a Singer Featherweight ) came when I was nine . It had a straight stitch only and could sew reverse . It wound bobbins and had a nice little package of specialty presser feet and a wonderful sewing book that I memorized . I used everything this machine had to offer : the seam gauge , stitch length adjustment , the presser foot presser adapter , and the light . It did n't do much but it did everything I needed and I sewed on it for decades . As I look back , I think having a limited machine like this made me a better sewer . I could n't depend on fancy stitches or sewing machine features to do the work for me . As a result , I have a good grasp of sewing . I also knew my machine very well and it was never in the shop .... not once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of use <p> " I 've only ever had one machine and it 's very basic ( a Bernina 1010 ) . However , I actually appreciate its simplicity and the fact that it is so easy to use . My favorite feature is the thread cutter , since I pretty much always forget my scissors at the ironing board when I return to my machine . As for the features I wish I had , I would say a self threader , a one-step buttonhole option , and a variety of specialty stitches , since I enjoy crazy quilting . " <p> Photo : Dana Finkle , Threads Assistant Editor <h> Controlled sewing <p> " My first sewing machine was a green metal Singer , and I remember the machine was SO heavy . Even as a teenager , I found it very difficult to carry . It had a lock-on cover with a handle , and almost every time I used it , I would bruise my shins carrying it to and from the closet . <p> " The machine had a few problems that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jammed , so I could not release the needle when I wound bobbins . I would always remove the needle to wind a bobbin , for fear of breaking the needle at high speed . The foot pedal just buzzed loudly when pressed . It would never start stitching until I manually gave the hand wheel a turn , and then it would take off , vroom . For years , to achieve any precise seams and to edgestitch , I would manually turn the hand wheel , stitch by stitch . <p> " Today , I 'm lucky to have several sewing machines . The features I value the most probably relate to my early sewing experiences , and they are simple concepts found on most models . I love speed control . You can control the speed by foot pressure , but being able to set it on the machine as well has saved me from many mishaps . The needle-down feature is also on my list of favorite features . I value being able to control the placement of the needle , without constantly reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of modern machines that I thought I would be crazy about , but have realized I could take or leave . Auto-thread snipping keeps your work area clear of thread bits , but most auto-snipping machines leave an inch or two of thread that you have to go back and snip anyway . The next contemporary feature I do n't seek out is a lightweight model . I thought I would be enthralled by an easy-to-carry machine , but now that I have a designated sewing space " and a rolling cart for travel - I better appreciate the solidity of a metal sewing machine .

I have an old Bernina 930 which does have a tailor tack stitch but it makes a continuous line of loops rather like a fringing stitch whereas as the Singer makes three loops on top of one another and moves on without stitching then stitches three more loops and so on . I have several machines now as I just ca n't bear to pass them on when I trade up and each one has a feature that the next one does n't . I recently purchased a Janome Gem 760P a lightweight machine to take to classes and I am really impressed as even though it is a lightweight machine it sews through denim and really thick stuff and then straight to fine sheer fabrics with no problems .

Along with good lighting a good view of the sewing area is important . If possible test the sewing machine before buying it : different machines have different shape foot pedals and it can make a difference when sewing . I prefer the low , wide pedals to the taller , narrower kind . As sewinglamb mentioned , the size of the harp space really matters . It can be difficult to sew around a large garment when the space between the needle and the motor is too tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine did not have that and I learned to put the cuff up by the needle instead , which was annoying . Does the machine start smoothly ( I have used some that stalled and lurched ) Good buttonholes are important ( my Singer , from 1968 , has an attachment that works well ) One feature not yet mentioned is an overedging stitch and foot . I use that combination almost as much as straight stitch . Being able to reverse at the end of the seam is very helpful . Can the user change feet or needles conveniently ? A good dealership can make a huge difference when the machine needs service . My most recent purchase was an embroidery type sewing machine . I did n't think I needed the embroidery feature , but the lights , view of the sewing area , foot control , ease of changing stitches , thread tension and balance control made it worth the price .

Trimming is a highly personal part of any garment . It takes a plain jacket , in this case , and turns it into a statement that reflects the wearer . I find that it 's not unusual for me to spend more time and money on trims than I do on the garment itself . Just as this jacket has been an exercise in Slow Sewing , so has it been an exercise in Particular Trimming . I wanted something that was unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that I could n't find back at home . I was on business in New York , so I decided to take some free time to visit three trimming stores : M&amp;J Trims , Pacific Trims , and Ginsburg Trims .

It 's packed to the 30-foot-high ceiling with just about any and every trim you could want . Pacific Trims , located at 313 West 37th Street , has a large assortment of handbag hardware , ribbon and chain trims , zippers , grommets , buckles , and just about anything else you need to complete your project . Both of these stores had some great possibilities , but nothing that really spoke to me . Finally , I walked into Ginsburg Trims , located at 242 West 38th Street .

After spending time with one of the staff there , I 'd found several choices . I narrowed it down to two finalists . One was a leather braided piping with both suede finish and metallic leather . The other was a 1/4-inch-wide ivory patent-leather strap . Both of them looked good with the jacket , but they looked even better together ! I decided to take them both home and work some magic . <p> Here are some trim possibilities : Patent leather or braided piping ? Or how about both ? <p> Transition is KeyOnce I got my trims home , I threw them on my jacket and let them sit there for a while . I 'd look at them and think about how I wanted to apply them . I had already made the decision to pair them together , but I was n't entirely satisfied with the way they looked laid bare on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tweed to the leather . I thought about possibilities , like a complimentary fabric or silk organza . After more thought , I decided the best transition was the fabric itself . I cut test strips of the fabric , each 1 1/4 inches wide . The first I cut on the bias , the second on the cross-grain , and the final on the lengthwise grain . I wanted to test how each one would look with a fringed edge . I quickly eliminated the bias and the cross-grain strips ; neither produced the kind of result I was looking for . The lengthwise strip , though , was perfect . It fringed exactly the way I envisioned , and it integrated the colors in the leather with the fibers in the jacket . <p> I cut fabric strips on various grains to experiment with fringing options . <p> Go for the Layered LookTo make this trim my own , I decided to layer both trims on the backing fabric . The only other question I had was whether to center the leathers in the wool strip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like piping . I made two small test pieces to see which I liked best . <p> Make test pieces to try out different types of trim before deciding . <p> In the end , I preferred the centered application , with fringe on both sides of the leathers . I basted the braided piping to the wool strip first , then I stitched the patent strapping over it , securing both to the backing . This gave me a whole new look . <p> These are my three trims , joined to create one fabulous , custom trim . <p> Attach the TrimOnce the trim was prepared , I attached it to the outside of my jacket using a prickstitch , similar to the way you hand-insert a zipper . This allowed me to place my trim precisely . I mitered the corners to achieve a smooth look . Once the trim was attached , I created the fringe by pulling threads . <p> Create a fringe look by pulling threads . <p> - <p> The final jacket almost looks like a whole new garment ! <p> Some Helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me choose my trim . Hopefully they 'll be useful to you , too . <p> 1 . Watch your proportions . Too large a trim will overpower a garment . Too small a trim will be lost . <p> 2 . Bring your garment with you when trim shopping . By having the whole garment rather than just a swatch of fabric , you 'll get an exact idea of how a trim will look . Sometimes you are n't able to complete the garment before shopping for the trim : for instance when you 're buying piping to put on a jacket edge . In that case , complete the garment to the point just before you apply the trim , and bring it with you . <p> 3 . Avoid home-dec trims . That 's not a hard and fast rule , but I have found that , unless you have something completely unique , home-dec trims ( especially rayon gimp or passementerie trims ) are readily identifiable as such . Here 's a true story : I once sat next to a lady who was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmed with the exact same braid that trimmed the sofa on which we were seated ! <p> 4 . Do n't be afraid to mix and match ! Just as I did here , you can combine trims to create a whole new look . Most designers do n't use ready-to-sew trims . By combining trims , you create a look that is uniquely yours .

The techniques I used to put together the little jacket at right are an attractive combination of these qualities . They 're useful on any type of sheer or very lightweight fabric , they stabilize any edge they 're applied to , and they 're easy to do . <p> Preparation for my seam and edge techniques is a little different from what you may be used to . To begin , mark the seamlines and hemlines on your tissue pattern if they are not marked . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trace all the marked lines onto the fabric using dressmaker 's carbon paper and a tracing wheel ; do not cut out any pattern pieces until you staystitch the seamlines as explained in Step 1 , below . <p> To minimize puckering , switch to a single-needle throat plate-if possible on your machine-for all straight staystitching on seams and edges . Just remember to switch back to the zigzag plate when needed . Choose thread to match or contrast your fabric as you wish , and use the same color for basting and final sewing . Always complete seams before finishing hems and edges . <p> In the photos below , I 'll walk you step-by-step through my processes , and introduce you to my secret clean-up weapon : an as-cheap-as-possible electric men 's razor , invaluable for whisker-free edges , and available in most drugstores ( sweater defuzzers or fabric shavers are too powerful ) . If you come up with any interesting applications of these techniques , by all means let us all know . <p> Satin-stitched seams <p> 1 . Pin the marked but uncut fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as closely as possible . Staystitch through the fabric and stabilizer along all seamlines using a 2mm/14spi ( stitches per inch ) stitch length , for this and all subsequent straight stitching . <p> 2 . Tear away the tissue paper and cut out the garment pieces on the marked cutting lines . To form a seam , overlap the joining edges , matching seamlines exactly and pin-basting on the seamline as shown . Sew the seam . <p> 3 . Fold over and press one seam allowance exactly on the seamline , covering the stitching ( left ) . Sew the seam again ( right ) , stitching 1/16 inch from the fold , holding the folded allowance in place and catching both the folded allowance and the unfolded allowance underneath . Repeat , folding the other seam allowance in the opposite direction and stitching 1/16 inch from the fold on this side . <p> 4 . Set your machine for a satin stitch that 's wide enough to cover the rows of straight stitching-3 to 4mm wide should work . Change the throat plate if necessary . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the seam from the right side . Loosen the top tension slightly for a cleaner satin stitch . <p> 5 . Trim away both seam allowances as close as possible to the satin stitching . Folding each seam to expose the trimmed edges , shave away any untrimmed thread whiskers using an electric razor . <p> Couched , hemstitched edges <p> 1 . Using a 2mm/14spi stitch length and a tissue paper underlay , staystitch the traced hemline . Set your machine for a 1 to 1.5mm zigzag and length of 2.5 to 3mm . Lay a length of any weight pearl cotton ( color-matched to the other thread ) exactly over the staystitched hemline and zigzag over it . <p> 2 . Install a wing needle , and set your machine to a blanket stitch ( see drawing at right ) , with a width of 2mm and length of 3mm . Using a good-quality rayon or polyester embroidery thread , blanket-stitch over the couched pearl cotton , forming mock hemstitching holes ( above ) . <p> 3 . Trim the hem allowance as close as possible ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've used a polyester fabric , you can clean-cut the allowance using a heated stencil cutter , as shown . Be sure to choose a rayon embroidery thread , since it has a higher melting temperature than polyester , so the fabric will melt away before the thread is damaged . <p> Kenneth D.

Posted : 8:02 am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your intention is to buy one for your own personal fitting only , then I suggest you always go for one size smaller than you currently are , then you have to pad the body form up to fit your body . To do that , you make a pattern then a toile which fits EXACTLY your personal measurements , and pad the body form to these adjustments . Hey presto there you have it . This is the way we were taught at my fashion course at Art College . I 've never bought a dress form as nothing I 've ever seen has come anywhere close to the professional ones ( Stockman ) we used at college . Anything polyester and ' adjustable ' is useless and a waste of money . One good one is a sound investment - and one which I wish I 'd made in the 60's.

I think they underestimate him because of his lack of skill , but the underdog has prevailed on more than one occasion . It definitely was a challenge as you had to work with someone else 's vision and try to make your vision coincide with theirs . To be quite honest it was a little unfair but it is a show and they have to come up with a new spin . The judges decisions this season are surprisingly unexpected .

Anyway , I loved all those hats , and was so interested in what Philip Treacy was going to say and feel about setting all those hat creations free into the hands of virtual beginners , and whether or not they lived up to the beauty of them .

I thought very few of the garments had even the slightest correlation with the hat they were meant to reference , including the winner . The judges all praised Michael C. for bringing in an iridescent sheen to tie the hat to the outfit , but to me that was the only commonality . The colors of the dress and hat together were so off-putting that I could n't believe the judges praised the combination , and the shape of the hat was n't echoed anywhere in the garment . <p> A lot of comments get made about the wearability of the outfits presented by the designers , but in this case I think the challenge was all about theatricality and artistic statement . The hats are obviously over the top , meant to be perceived as ' wearable art ' for only the most select situation - in a runway show to add drama , or worn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to see ' art to wear ' to match the hats . <p> It seems to me elementary design class that when you are supposed to relate one thing to another you find the thing they have in common - Peach was given a confection of feathers , and could have come up with something light and airy , something with a circular movement to it , similar to the movement in the hat . Mondo was given one of the more wearable hats , and that spiralling motion could have been really played with in his garment , but instead he sent out an outfit that had absolutely nothing to do with the hat . Color choice was mystifying to me , as well . . . <p> Same thing with Ivy - what the heck does that outfit have to do with the hat she had , either in color , design , or texture ? The hats are so theatrical that the designers ' first instinct should n't have been to calm the hat 's impact down , but to play off of it ( especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. was one of the only designers to see that he could echo the opening on his hat , and I thought the most successful designer was the much reviled Gretchen , who thoroughly tied her entire look together , and even made something wearable .

It was also the theatrical runway version of an outfit that could be wearable when brought to market . <p> Posted : 9:09 am on August 23rd <p> Soli writes : Full disclosure ; I am NOT a Phillip Treacy fan .

A lot of the featured headgear was the sort of weird stuff you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Andy and Ivy 's instincts were spot on , going for a suited look . I did like Christopher 's main piece , although I think it might have been more successful if he 'd gone for a ' 47 New Look vibe or contrasted the coat with a skinny skirt . I could see the pirate connotation . I like Valerie 's ensemble , but did n't get the zippers . Yes , the zipper in the back was somewhat functional , but they just did n't strike me as being beautiful as a decorative element . Peach - more of the same little dress . When is she getting Auf 'd ? She could have had so much fun coming up with some sort of voluminous extravaganza to set off that hat . *grumble* Do n't get me started on her one trick .

Not so much for the skirt . I loved Michael C 's dress and am glad he won with it . I can see that , sans hat , at a country club or yacht club summer gala . I do n't think that the losing designers had anything constructive to say . The only thing I 've noticed about the episodes now showing them gabbing in the green room while waiting for the judges to talk to best/worst is that they 're always wrong in picking the winner . Kristen . She really seemed to go for a Japanese deconstructionist vibe in all her entries and this one really failed her .

I understand that matching too much is dull--that goes without saying--but the scorn with which the phrase is uttered seems out of proportion with the actual crime . I guess it 's this season 's " dubious taste level . " It 's all much too subtle for me : Why , for example , was Gretchen 's outfit not " matchy-matchy , " even though all the colors and textures seem to have been taken directly from the hat , and Kristen 's model 's blue toenails were " too matchy-matchy , " when I do n't see any blue elsewhere in the ensemble .

But none of the fitting benefits are possible if the form you 're using does n't  mirror , with reasonable accuracy , your body shape and posture . <p> The shape of your shoulders , the position and angle of your neck and the unique distribution of your body weight are issues far more important than questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist , and do n't  fit snugly .

And , you can accomplish this for about $15 . <p> Dress-form making is fun and fast , and will improve your fitting results like nothing else . <p> Gear upIf you can , recruit two helpers : One cuts the tape into suitable strip sizes ; the other applies the tape . Use old scissors , as the tape adhesive gums them up , and precut 4-inch to 6-inch strips and longer strips for the waist and crossing the heart . You will need two to three 60-yard rolls of 2-inch duct tape . The brand makes a difference , because some tape shrinks over time and change the size of your dress form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Duck Tape . <p> The form does n't have to look like a tin man .

Protect the neck area with plastic wrap if the T-shirt does n't  cover it . Tape the edges at the neckline and armholes similar to those youd want on a fitted bodice , giving your form a neck . When the first layer is complete , wrap twice more , first vertically , then again horizontally , further compressing the waistline to fit each layer more closely , and smoothing over any wrinkles this causes with more tape . <p> Cover areas that the T-shirt does n't with plastic wrap before taping . <p> The form is wrapped thre times , but you can change to colorful duct tape for the last layer . <p> We used Totally Tie-Dye from Duck Tape for the final layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When finished , but before removing the form , have the " wrappee " bend slightly sideways to reveal her waistline , and mark it ( and any other points you want identified ) with permanent marker .

Carefully step out of the form . <p> Stand and deliverCut along the horizontal line at hip level to establish a base line .

Stuff and tape over the armholes and neck , and solidly stuff the entire form to support it . Use a fiberfill intended for toys or pillows .

One thing we were told was not to stand with our knees locked because that can lead to problems some have already mentioned . One of the participants unfortunately had the habit of standing with one hip thrown out and when it came time to learn to use our forms ( included in the program ) she was very unhappy that her form mirrored her bad posture . An advantage I see to this method is that if you lose weight you can shave off whatever foam is necessary to adjust the form to your new " you " . We wore a good bra not a wornout one . Of course if you gain weight : - ( you can always pad out the form . I 'm going to have to measure my form and me to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a commercial form . If the shoulder to bust measurement is too different , it is very difficult to rectify . When I studied Fashion Design , one of the classes required that we buy a form and pad it to fit ourselves . I bought an 18 and only after doing all the work to make the cover did I find out that this measurement was way off . I should have bought a 14 and although it would have meant more stuffing at least it would have fit . What I finally wound up doing was putting the cover on my P/P form and stuffing that out to fit the cover . That is when I recovered my good bra and reverted to using it normally . Beverly A.

With the help of my husband , I tape-fitted a large plastic bag to cover my torso and neck . We then covered it with gauze-and-plaster bandages used for setting broken bones . ( Purchased at a surgical supply store . ) They were easy to use - dip in a pan of water for a few seconds and then apply . We applied the strips in a similar way to the duct tape described here , going diagonally from under-bust to shoulder , horizontally around waist and hips , etc . Then let the plaster set . This was the hard part as the plaster gets hot as it sets . I stood in front of a fan ! We cut the mold down both sides under the arms using a thin saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back would have cracked the plaster getting it off . I pulled the plastic bag out of the mold ( comes out easily ) and filled some of the rough places on the inside with some more plaster to smooth it out . We then duct taped the sides of the mold together , trimmed the bottom and arm openings flat , put cardboard ovals in the arm openings and plywood in the bottom , secured with more tape . Then we mixed up the two-part polyurethane filler and quickly poured it in the neck opening . It expands into the whole form and out the top . After it set , we trimmed off the excess foam with a saw , opened the mold and removed the foam form . It needed a little sanding . We then mounted it on an old music stand base , attaching it to the plywood bottom . The stand is adjustable and is set to my height . I made a cotton/spandex cover for it with center front and back seams that I lined up with the centers of the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a pin cushion to mount on top of the neck which covers the raw foam . I can pin into it as the foam holds pins quite well . I gained some weight and all I had to do was remove the cover and pad the form a bit with batting . I can also put a bra on it for further shaping . It 's wonderful for fitting ; it shows how my shoulders slope ( slightly different from each other ! ) , it shows how garments gap at the back of my neck . It 's great for pin-fitting patterns as I can pin them right to the form , lining them up with the center lines . It was well worth the effort .

The winner would also win $20,000 . This week , each designer had to choose a finish ( velvet , matte , bright , or crystal ) and were given the makeup to complete their look . With two days for the challenge , of course there was an added twist . The designers were asked to create a second ready-to-wear look . <p> There was less drama than usual this week . Gretchen was unhappy with Michael 's color choice , but in the end Gretchen found herself in the top three , while Michael was left to talk his way out of elimination . Ivy had trouble fitting her model , and generally floundered throughout the challenge . Valerie also had some trouble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's garments were well constructed , even if he missed the mark , and so he was safe .

One of her earlier comments " it 's disappointing that craftmanship is n't as widely acknowledged as I had hoped " .

Ivy 's couture dress , particularly the bodice , was a nightmare - it looked like she glued random pieces of fabric on it . The day look managed to look a model look fat .

I did n't much care for Christopher 's design , as the organza around the hips seemed too springy , rather than draping gracefully . Andy 's was just too costumey in my opinion , his need to reference Asian elements outweighing his taste . Valarie is repeating the same basic piece over and over again , the torso hugging dress/jacket with the curved piecing over the hips meeting in the back , and if that 's all she knows how to do or insists on making that her signature , I do n't think she 'll be around much longer .

@@22149097 @2149097/ <p> Pins may be the tiniest of sewing tools , but they take on big , important jobs . They hold pattern pieces in place , anchor seam allowances as you sew , fit fabric on the body , and secure all sorts of squirmy trims , delicate sequins , and miniscule beads . If , like many of us , you take for granted the pins that pepper your pincushion , I urge you to take a good hard look-from head to point-at each of those little bits of metal . There are many , many pins on the market-some are quite unusual and wonderful . What is the reason for all of these choices ? One pin ca n't successfully tackle all fabrics and sewing tasks . Simply stated , different jobs require different pins . <p> Any pin is just the sum of its partsThe seemingly endless variety of straight pins can be daunting , unless you break each pin down into its five main components : head , point , thickness , length , and metal content . Just figure out what your needs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pin with those qualities . <p> From left to right : Flat ; pearlized plastic , plastic flower-head , ball-shaped plastic ; glass ( yellow and blue ) ; and metal ( brass and silver ) . <p> - <p> WARNING : Some plastic pin heads can melt under a hot iron and adhere to the fabric . <p> HeadThe head is the most recognizable part of a straight pin . What it is made of dictates if it can be pressed , and the shape determines when you should use it in the construction process . <p> Flat Also called " no head , " this pin may be pressed with a hot iron . It 's also good for handwork , as thread does n't get caught on it . A flat head can be difficult to see on busy or textured fabrics , however . <p> Plastic Ball-shaped plastic heads come in different sizes and colors , and may be pearlized . Wide , flower-shaped plastic heads are the easiest to spot , and because they are flat , they come in handy when you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . They are also a good choice for lace , eyelet , and loose weaves , as the large heads wo n't slip through the holes in the fabric . <p> Glass This small , ball-shaped head is fairly easy to see , and wo n't melt when touched with an iron . <p> Metal Metal balls are n't common , but they can be pressed with an iron without fear of melting . <p> Tip : Use only the best-toss the rest . If a pin becomes bent , dull , or rusted , do n't hesitate to throw it out . A less-than-perfect 1- pin can wreak havoc on your $10- , $20- , or $40-a-yard fabric . <p> PointThe points of pins should slide cleanly into fabric without causing snags or unsightly holes . Different fabrics require different types of points . <p> Sharp These all-purpose points are a fine choice for loosely woven , medium-weeight , and heavy-weight fabrics . <p> Extra-sharp More defined and tapered , this point passes cleanly through delicate fabrics . <p> Ball point Created especially-and only-for knits , this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric and does n't pierce or pull the yarns . <p> LengthSome sewing projects require long pins , other ventures may do better with short , stubby pins . Pin length used to be listed on packages as sizes ( size 12 = 3/4 inch long , etc. ) , but most pin manufacturers now just list the actual lengths . <p> Dressmaker/all-purpose If in doubt , reach for this medium- length ( 1-1/16- to 1-1/2-inch ) pin . It is appropriate for all sorts of garment sewing . <p> Quilting Made especially for pinning through many layers of fabric and batting , this 1-1/2- to 2-inch pin is also garment-friendly , as its long length hardly ever slips out of place . <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> ThicknessTo avoid marring fabric with pin holes , choose the thinnest pin to accomplish the task at hand . Unfortunately , we discovered that the naming convention , as it relates to actual diameters , is n't consistent among manufacturers . So the best thing to do is roll a pin between your fingers to gauge its actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and .7mm or .8mm . <p> .4mm The thinnest traditional pin we found was a .4mm " Patchwork Pin ( Fine ) " by Clover . It passes beautifully through the finest of sheers . <p> .5mm Called " extra-fine , " " super-fine , " " silk , " or " satin , " these .5mm pins are recommended for fine , lightweight fabrics , including some sheers . <p> .6mm Most all-purpose pins are labeled " fine , " and are best paired with medium-weight fabrics . <p> .7mm or .8mm Although harder to find , these diameters are great for thicker fabrics like heavy wools , denim , and quilted layers . But they do leave large holes in their wake. - <p> Metal contentA pin 's content is important , especially if you are allergic to certain metals . There are six types : stainless steel , nickel-plated steel , nickel-plated brass , brass , and chrome-plated steel , which is the strongest option . If you are n't sure of the metal , test it with a magnet ; stainless steel and brass pins wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only nickel-plated brass passed . To test the rust-resistance of various metal types , we spritzed each pin with salt water . The results were surprising , as nickel-plated and chrome-plated steel should only rust if the plating is damaged ; stainless steel should offer the best resistance . Brass tarnishes , but any residue washes out . <p> Skirt Also known as a kilt pin , this decorative pin holds skirts and kilts closed . <p> Button The bump in this pin holds delicate , nonwashable buttons temporarily in place . <p> Curved The bend makes basting quilts easy , and ensures that the layers never shift . <p> Traditional These pins can be used for sewing , quilting , and crafts . <p> Pincushion Gallery <p> Why the tomato ? According to folklore , placing a tomato on the mantle of a new home guaranteed prosperity and repelled evil spirits .

@@22149104 @2149104/ <p> Almost every sewer has a favorite style of elastic waistband or is looking for the perfect one . I 've experimented with various techniques over the years and have found a few I like a lot , but I wanted to find out the favorite waistbands of some of my sewing colleagues . I 've also discovered some great designer approaches to this that are worth trying in your own garments . <p> All elastic waistbands fall essentially into two categories -- those in which the elastic is inserted into a stitched-down casing and those in which the elastic is sewn directly to the fabric . Whichever method you select , the overriding issue is comfort . For me , the narrower the elastic , the less aware I am of something around my waist . But others prefer the firmer feel of a wider elastic . And although most of us wear something over an elastic waistband that hides it , some of the designer techniques I want to share are pretty enough to leave uncovered . <p> The sewing professionals ' favorite techniquesSan Francisco sewing luminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her elastic waistbands , choosing a width compatible with her fabric type . This mesh-like elastic , which comes 3/4 in. to 1-1/2 in. wide , is available in white only and is sold by the yard off the roll ( see Waistband supplies by mail ) . She cuts the elastic based on her waist measurement minus 4 in. and feeds it through a casing using a safety pin . Next she uses a 75/11HS ballpoint needle to sew several parallel rows of topstitching through the fabric casing and elastic . What looks like separate rows of elastic fed through several casings is actually one complete band that does not roll , crush , or curl . <p> The pull-on waistband that sewing expert Marcy Tilton , of Takilma , Ore. , favors is twist-proof and can be used with knit ribbing , knits cut on the crossgrain , or lightweight wovens cut on the straight or cross grain . Instead of being a folded-over and stitched-down casing , this separate waistband does n't add bulk at the waist , but slips easily over the hips . <p> Marcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts it 1-1/2 in. to 2-1/2 in. smaller than the waist measurement . Sometimes she topstitches several rows through the waistband , stretching as she sews . Because topstitching tends to stretch the elastic so the overall finished waist measurement is a little larger , plan ahead and fit the elastic more snugly , or about 1-1/2 in. smaller than your waist . <p> Sewing teacher and designer Lyla Messinger , of LJ Designs in Reno , Nev. , uses another favorite sew-through method , which gives the stitched look found in popular ready-to-wear . Lyla uses 1-1/4-in . Sew-Through elastic from the garment industry that " recovers " after it has been stitched through . She recommends cutting the elastic from 2 in. to 7 in. smaller than your waist measurement ( 4 in. is a good starting point ) , then attaching it to the garment . <p> Nowadays , I do n't like to feel anything around my waist , so I use a simple casing method with no topstitching and with narrow elastic . I cut 1/2-in. -wide Stretchrite Non-roll elastic 5 in. smaller than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like narrow or wider elastic , the no-roll variety , no matter what width , lives up to its name . And as far as I 'm concerned , the bodkin is the only tool to use to feed the elastic through the casing ( see Waistband supplies by mail ) . <p> Designer waistbandsIt 's always fun to see what designers are doing to make their garments a cut above average ready- to-wear . Even something as simple as an elastic waistband often gets special treatment in their hands . <p> Noted Japanese fashion and textile designer Junichi Arai developed a waistband for his loose-fitting gardener-style pants that uses three casings , with the center one left empty . As a result , these pants are extremely comfortable because you do n't really notice the 1/4-in . Polyester Braid elastic used in the top and bottom rows around your waist . And the empty center casing prevents the complete waistband from rolling over . This is a waistband that just relaxes and fits whatever your waist shape is . <p> Los Angeles designer Peter Cohen specializes in clean-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to the beauty of his details on pull-on pants and skirts , he generally uses buttery soft silk charmeuse as the casing . As an interesting alternative to silk charmeuse , you can use silk satin ribbon for the casing . This ribbon is available in several widths and colors and is not as fussy to work with as the charmeuse because both edges are finished . Ban-rol elastic works well in this casing . <p> From the design firm Anne Klein II comes a technique that combines 1/2-in . Non-roll elastic with a drawstring for a waistband on a pair of pants that 's both comfortable and attractive . In this method , a 2-1/4-in. turndown at the waist is divided into two 3/4-in. casings . The top casing , left empty , forms a lettuce heading . The bottom casing is filled in back with elastic that extends 4 in. beyond each side seam and attaches to fabric tubes that serve as drawstrings that tie at the front waist . <p> The most exquisite elastic waistband treatment I 've ever seen comes from New York designer Andra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingerie . For her pajama bottoms , she stitches delicate silk ribbon over 1/2-in . Polyester Braid elastic in the casing , which produces a ruffled effect and keeps the elastic from twisting . The construction of this delicate waistband takes lots of practice to perfect even for expert sewers , but the results are stunning . You can use various widths of silk ribbon , but the 7mm width is the easiest to work with when first trying this technique . Adjust the width and length of the serpentine stitch on your sewing machine to correspond to the width of the ribbon , and keep the stitching from straying over the ribbon 's edges . <p> Because elastic waistbands are great for comfort and you now have a number of techniques to choose from , why not try them all ? You ca n't have too many skirts or pants with waistbands that are both comfortable and good-looking . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 6 ) <p> betty246 writes : Fantastic article . Thank you !

My student , Norma Loehr , decided to make a strapless dress using a charming little Burda design ( 03-2010-107 ) in one of my favorite fabrics " an inky navy blue silk/wool jacquard . <p> Clearly , it needed boning , but it also needed support over the bust that was n't quite as structured .

I figured she 'd come back with a roll of the flimsy stuff that 's usually sold , but to my surprise ( and delight ) , she came back with a yard of 1-in. wide horsehair " just enough for what I had in mind . <p> I should mention that I figured the treatment would be of particular interest to Norma who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now distilled her knowledge into her all-new book , Demystifying Bra Fitting and Construction.For those of you who are interested , her company is called Orange Lingerie. - <p> But I digress ... back to the work in progress. - <p> Here , you can see the basting thread outlining the different sections of the bodice . It was used to join the underlining " two layers of silk organza in this case " to the fashion fabric . <p> There 's lots going on inside : traditional spiral steel boning , including some that spans two garment sections ; silk organza selvages used as stay tape along the top edge , and the horsehair use to support the bra cups that is visible , too . <p> - <p> A closer look at the stay tape . The top edge- was machine stay " stitched , and the stay tape is hand basted along that line , following the curve of the bodice 's top edge . <p> The boning channels were formed by simply stitching parallel lines- through the two organza layers used as underlining . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance we made a tiny slit in the top layer of the organza below the seam allowance , right along the- seam line , then we cut tiny slits in the seam allowances , - slid the boning through it .

And the closer it is to the fashion fabric , the more effective it is . <p> Here is the boning , including the piece that spans two sections . <p> - <p> I cut the horsehair into 6 pieces " 3 per side .

I made a simple top , with a very snug fit and did elastic casings in the neck , hem and short sleeves so it would stay put once it was on . I slipped it on over the finished DTD , and then pinned on black twill tape to mark the center lines , waist , etc .

@@22149113 @2149113/ <h> Tapering or Widening Pants <p> I need to taper the leg width of a pants pattern that fits well otherwise . Is this more complicated than just trimming down the leg seams ? Do I reduce front and back equally ? -Judi Davies , Ellkford , BC , CanadaKaren Howland replies : If you simply taper the seams on an existing pants pattern or on ready-to-wear pants , you 'll typically find that there 's still more fabric below the seat and under the belly than you want . Here 's how to take out part of the width from the side and inseams and part from within the pattern , in both front and back . <p> Start by noting the widths you want at hem and knee levels , then measure the distance from hem to knee line . Fold both front and back patterns in half lengthwise , matching the inseams and outseams . This establishes the creaseline and center on each piece , which should be parallel to the grainline . Correct the grainline if it is n't . <p> Unfold and cut both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-front pattern first . To make sure the hem allowance fits inside the tapered leg , fold the pattern on the hemline before marking and trimming . Refold the pattern piece on the center line , measure the total hem width you want , subtract 1 in. , then divide the number by 4 , and mark along the hem from the fold toward the seams . For example , if you want a 17-in. opening , subtract 1 from 17 to get 16 in. , then divide 16 by 4 . Do the same thing at the knee using the knee width you want ( minus 1 in. , then divided by 4 ) , then connect the marks from hem to knee , add seam allowances , and cut away the excess . <p> Now , repeat the entire process for the lower-back pattern piece , this time adding 1 in. to the knee and hem widths before dividing by 4 . Adding and subtracting 1 in. ensures that the pattern follows the usual ready-to-wear practice of making backs wider than fronts ( which improves the hang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 : <p> Step 1:Divide front and back at knee <p> Step 2:Alter lower pieces <p> The only exception to this procedure is if your figure is so flat in front that you do n't need a front waistline dart . If this is the case , do n't separate the front pant pattern at the knee , just alter to the knee as described above , then true the inner and outer seamlines from the crotch level down to meet the knee . Split the back at the knee and alter as described below , checking the front crotch curve against the altered back to see if it needs any additional truing . <p> Next , we 'll reattach the upper patterns to their respective lower parts , starting with the fronts . Align the creaselines of the upper and lower sections . <p> The top will extend beyond the corrected seamlines on both in- and outseams , and we 'll correct each side separately , starting with the outseam . First , slash the upper pattern along the creaseline from the knee to just below the waistline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the creaseline slash , leaving a little uncut section at the dart point to pivot with . <p> If the front or back darts are n't centered over the creaseline ( the back darts probably wo n't be ) , just angle the slashline(s) from the knee level to the dart . Because this is a temporary alteration line , it does n't matter if it 's not perfectly on grain . <p> Keeping the inseam/crotch side of the pattern stationary to maintain the grainline , pivot the outseam section so it overlaps the center line by half the excess width at the knee , then slide the top pattern upward slightly so that the outseam stays the same length , as shown at center above . Notice that pivoting opens the dart at the waist . This wider dart builds a portion of the tapering into the actual shape of the pattern piece , causing the pants to angle inward from the belly to the ankle when viewed from the side . Trim away the other half of the excess at the outseam after truing that seamline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outseam . <p> Now for the inseam . Slash ( or fold a tuck ) from the center of the unshifted knee line to the crotch seam until the excess width at the inseam lines up with the corrected inseam below . Notice that this straightens out the crotch curve , which you 'll want to clip opposite the slash to allow it to spread . This is an inevitable result of tapering the legs using any method . For instance , if you had just tapered the entire inseam front and back , the crotch curve would need to be trued back to a smooth curve , which flattens it similarly . <p> Tapering Pants : Steps 3 and 4 <p> Step 3 : Alter upper piecesFront only is shown ; alter back same way . <p> Step 4:True crotch curveTapered seams create a bump in crotch curve , which needs to be trued .. <p> Repeat this process for the back pattern , which may require more or less tapering based on how much rear fullness is built into the pattern already , or because of other alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help the pants to cup under the rear , reducing fullness in proportion to the amount you taper the legs . <p> To increase the width of the leg , do the same thing in the other direction , expanding the lower leg , then spreading the upper pieces to match . This reduces the dart widths and increases the crotch seam curve , appropriate for pants with straighter , looser legs . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 9 ) <p> Imallwett writes : So one more time .

Determine how much you want to remove from the total hem circumference , and remove an equal amount from the side seams and inseams to make this reduction .

It 's a little hard to see exactly what the final silhouette will look like , because you 'll have bulky seam allowances in the way , but you should be able to tell if the alteration causes fit issues at the upper part of the pants . You may not be able to make an extreme adjustment ( e.g. , no skinny jeans from palazzo pants ! ) , but a couple of inches should work fine .

@@22149115 @2149115/ <p> Eyelet is everywhere this season ! Eyelets of all types made a huge splash on runways for spring , and they are going strong well into summer . You can find eyelets in all sorts of fabricactions , from crisp cottons to soft rayons to sensual velvets ! And as a sewer , you can make all sorts of gorgeous garments from this airy delight . But there are a few tricks that will make handling eyelet even easier.Interfacing " because of the open-stitched nature of eyelet , I avoid using any fusible interfacings on it . Instead , I use silk organza in a color close to that of my eyelet fabric . It does n't have to match exactly . If you prefer , you can use organza in a shade that matches your skin tone instead . You can find silk organza in a rainbow of colors at most fabric stores and Web sites . Baste the organza to the facings , collars , and any other piece that needs it by using a long hand or machine stitch within the seam allowances . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be well worth it ! <p> Seam Finishes " Because eyelet has holes that allow you to see through the fabric , how you finish your seams can make a big difference in the final look of the garment . Seam finishes I like include : serging the seam ( bottom left photo ) , sewing the seam with a regular sewing machine ( bottom right photo ) and then serging the raw edges and a Hong-Kong finish using bias tape or organza ( third photo below ) . All of these will give a clean , non-bulky , professional finish . <p> A serged seam provides a clean-finished edge . <p> You can sew the seam using a regular sewing machine , then serge-finish the seam allowances . <p> Underline for Modesty or Contrast " Part of the fun of eyelet is the peek-a-boo quality . But some eyelets can be more " boo " than " peek " . In those cases , I underline my eyelet . Underlining simply involves cutting a duplicate of your pattern piece in a lining or other fabric . Once cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the right side of the underlining fabric against the wrong side of the eyelet . Then treat the basted pieces as one and sew as usual . <p> Underlining has several built-in advantages . First , it hides all seam finishes , so you do n't have to fret over them as much ( though it 's always nice to do them as a point of pride ) . If your goal is modesty , underlining , using a fabric that is close to your skin tone , gives the illusion of skin underneath , without any embarassing consequences . Finally , you can use your underlining to add an accent of color to the eyelet . Take for instance , a black eyelet underlined with hot pink , chartreuse , or even animal print fabric . Suddenly , you 've changed the whole nature of the fabric , and given yourself a designer touch for a fraction of the cost ! <p> This black eyelet underlined with pink stands out . <p> Eyelet is a fun , fashionable fabric . Let your imagination run a little bit , and it becomes even more fabulous !

I set the stitch length the same as the hand stitch I plan to use . I pull the machine stitches a few at a time just before handsewing and follow the holes left behind . Or , I leave the stitches in place until I finish my handwork . The machine stitches work as a guide for different hand stitches , such as a blanket stitch , topstitch , or herringbone stitch . With this method , I always get perfectly spaced hand stitching . Janice Engle , Aurora , Illinois <p> 2 . Easy Tailor 's TacksI use an alternative version of tailor 's tacks that holds the threads in place more securely than traditional methods .

The threads mark clear positions for my sewing that I can see from both sides . Laurie Wilcox , Palm Desert , California <p> 3 . Two Safety Pins Are Better Than OneWhen I pull elastic or cording through a casing , I use a safety pin to help guide it .

Betty Bolden , Bolton , Connecticut <p> 4 . Make a Button Shank From ThreadTo use a flat button on thick fabric , make a button shank from thread . Begin by threading a needle with a double strand of thread ; knot the thread ends . Take a stitch on the right side of the fabric , at the button placement mark . This hides the knot under the button . Take a stitch through the button as you typically would , but do n't pull the thread tight . Next , choose a spacer to ensure there is ample space between the fabric and the button . For thin fabrics , use a straight pin or toothpick . For thicker fabrics , use a heavy darning needle , bobby pin , chopstick , or thin pen . Insert the spacer under the button , between the holes , and then tug slightly on the sewing needle to tighten the thread and secure the spacer . Continue sewing the button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely ( with the needle on the wrong side of the fabric ) , remove the spacer and hold the button away from the fabric , keeping the stitches taut . Then , bring the needle up between the fabric and the button . Wind the thread around the stitches until you 've created a sturdy shank . If you want to give it a more finished look , particularly when you 've used a large spacer , make closely spaced blanket stitches around the threads instead of simply winding the thread around the shank . When you 've finished , secure the thread close to the shank . Jennifer Lobb , Nanaimo , British Columbia , Canada <p> 5 . Extreme MakeoversShop resale or consignment stores for used men 's shirts .

Time got away from me , and I realized I had to leave my sewing room for an appointment . I did n't want the marks to disappear while I was gone , so I applied a strip of Scotch Magic Tape over each mark . When I returned to my sewing room the next afternoon , I was thrilled to find every mark as bright as it had been the day before , and the tape pulled off without leaving any residue .

Crochet Hook to Remove BastingI have found that using a crochet hook works great to remove basting threads , ease stitching threads , and to open seams .

@@22149119 @2149119/ <h> Not Your Ordinary T-Shirt <p> Although the word T-shirt may conjure up images of men 's cotton/poly underwear , the customized version you can sew has its roots in the finest ready-to-wear , where a price tag of $100 and even $200 is n't uncommon . And if a T-shirt is well made and beautifully shaped , it can be the glue that holds your wardrobe together , worn just as easily with a suit as with jeans . <p> When you sew your own versatile T-shirts , you can refine the fit , alter necklines and shaping to flatter your figure , use beautiful fabrics , and add fine details . Fitting and adjusting are easy when you follow a few simple guidelines . <p> A word about fabricsTo sew a T-shirt that looks like better ready-to-wear , you 'll need to seek out fine-quality knit fabrics . Since knits do n't have much bolt appeal , keep an eye out for especially nice ones ; they 're among the few fabrics I stockpile . And take a look at ready-made garments that you like for shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made T-shirts from many knit fabrics , including cotton , wool , velour , cashmere , panne velvet , Lycra blends , and fleece . Do n't worry if you do n't have access to the matching ribbings and trims that manufacturers have made to their specifications . A narrow , self-fabric , bound neck edge gives a fine finish to a shirt of this quality. - <p> - <p> For fall T-shirts , shift to slightly heftier knits , like those in this collection made from wool jersey , velour , sweater knits , and thermal cottons . <p> - <p> I 'll discuss a few techniques I use to control stretch and get smooth hems and edges . Test each fabric you sew and keep a record of what worked for future reference . If you make a few T-shirts each season , you 'll have a collection of tops and a few refined patterns to use and wear again and again . And you can endlessly vary style , sleeve length , and neckline . <p> Start with a good patternBegin with a pattern whose basic measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shirt , or go shopping with a tape measure and try on garments , noting the key measurements , plus design and construction ideas , of items you like . Note especially the shape and length of the body ; amount of ease across the bust and hip ; neck shape and width ; shoulder width ; and armhole depth . With this information , you can select and customize a pattern for the fit and details you want . <p> Some help with pattern sizing-When sewing with patterns from some American companies , like Vogue , McCall 's , Butterick , and Simplicity , use your high bust measurement ( above the bust at the underarm , straight around the back ) when selecting pattern size . These companies tend to include extra ease across the upper body , and it 's harder to alter the neck , shoulders , and upper chest than to add ease at the side seams of a smaller pattern to fit the bust and hip . Use your full bust and hip measurements when adjusting the pattern . <p> When sewing Burda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , use your full bust measurement to determine your size . <p> First , adjust for fitFitting the pattern takes a little time and fussing , and you 'll continue to refine it as you sew . To adjust the fit , I combine flat pattern measuring with tissue- and pin-fitting , and make a series of changes to improve the pattern , which I 'll discuss below . <p> Start with the flat pattern-You 'll use the pattern to determine the amount of ease it includes , whether you need to alter it to fit , and to compare one pattern to another . Most important at this stage is that the pattern is big enough to fit around you . ( To be sure when cutting out the garment , allow 1-in. allowances at the side seams . Otherwise , use 5/8-in. seam allowances and 2-in. hems . ) <p> If you want the pattern to fit the way the designer intended , you 'll need to include the same amount of ease . Calculate the ease intended for the garment style by measuring the pattern from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bust and hip , then compare the total measurement with that on the back of the pattern envelope for the size you 're using . For example , if your pattern measures 34-1/2 in. at the bust , and the measurement for that size is 32-1/2 in. , the pattern includes 2 in. of ease . So you 'll add 2 in. of ease to your full bust measurement , then add to the side seams to produce that measurement . If you need to lengthen or shorten the body , sleeve , or armhole , make these changes now . To learn more about a new pattern , I find it helpful to compare it to a favorite one with a similar amount of ease . <p> Next , tissue-fit your pattern-Tissue-fitting the pattern pieces , like pin-fitting a garment during construction , is a try-on-again , take-off-again procedure that helps you visualize the finished garment on your body and further refine the shape before you begin to sew . <p> Refine a neckline you like-You can alter the neck of a T-shirt to flatter your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit under another garment . It 's fine to adjust the front , back , and shoulder areas independently , but the final front and back must meet at the shoulder . Once you have a neckline shape you like , it 's easy to superimpose it on other patterns. - - - - - You have many options for neck shaping . If your face is very round , you may prefer the contrast of a V-neck ; if you have an angular face , a round neck might be a good choice ( many women can wear both ) . If you want a V-neck , mark the depth of the V while tissue-fitting , and convert to a V as shown in Drawing #1 . <p> I 've found that raising the back neck improves many patterns , and also helps camouflage a round back . I frequently raise the back neck and lower the front neck . Work in small increments to find the most flattering neck width for your face and body . If a neckline is a bit too wide after the garment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck binding . <p> For a smooth shoulder-Determine your best shoulder width by measuring favorite garments and adjusting during tissue- and pin-fitting ( adjust the pattern as well ) . Multisized Burda patterns tend to have broad shoulders , so I use a size or two smaller for the armscye than for the body of the garment . <p> You 'll get a better fit across the shoulders if the back-shoulder seam is 1/4 in. longer than the front . Compare the two lengths , and add at the armhole seam. - - - A pleasing armhole depth-The depth of the armhole helps determine the proportion of a garment , as well as how it will fit beneath a jacket . In today 's clothes , armhole depth ranges from 8 to 11 in. , from a high , set-in sleeve to a deeply dropped one . To determine a pattern 's armhole depth , measure in a straight line from the shoulder tip to the underarm . If you 're petite or small boned , pare down the depth of the armhole , as shown in Drawing #2 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulder width ( Click to Enlarge ) Many patterns benefit from raising back neck and lowering front neck . Adjust width of neck and width of shoulder as desired , but make back shoulder 1/4 in. longer than front , then ease during stitching . <p> To shape V-neck , use curve stick to connect shoulder seam to point of V. <p> - <p> Drawing 2 : Balance front- and back-armhole depth ( Click to Enlarge ) Check pattern . If front- and back-armhole depth are same , balance armhole by adding to back , trimming from front , and moving shoulder mark as shown . If entire armhole is too deep for petite or small-boned figure , pleat out excess on back , front , and sleeve as shown . <p> Tricks to refine shapingOnce the pattern fits and you 've determined the best length , neckline , and armhole depth , the next step is to refine the pattern 's shape . These changes may seem subtle , but they make a big difference in the look of the finished garment . <p> Lengthen the front for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front than in back , so making a garment front 1/2 in. longer gives a smoother fit . Add the 1/2 in. at the bust , as shown in Drawing #4 . For a full bust , also add width at the bust by curving the side seam out 3/4 in. , tapering to zero above and below . When sewing , ease the front to the back in the bust area . <p> Balance the armhole-To balance the armhole means to adjust the pattern so the back armhole is 1/2 in. deeper than the front , solving the problem of garments that ride toward the back . Though Burda and some small companies add this refinement to their patterns , many others do n't . <p> It 's easy to check a pattern for balance and correct an unbalanced armhole . Place the front and back armhole side by side , as shown in Drawing #2 . If they 're the same , add 1/4 in. to the back-shoulder seam , and trim 1/4 in. from the front . Make the same change to the facings or sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the shoulder dot is dead center , move it 1/2 in. toward the front to position more ease at the back where it 's needed . <p> Refine the body shape-I find that a subtle hourglass shape or a tapered wedge that narrows at the hip is more flattering to the body than the straight boxy cut found in most ready-made T-shirts and patterns . Experiment to see which shapes you like best . I prefer to adjust the body shape during construction , when I can see how the fabric drapes on the body , and then transfer changes to the pattern for future reference , as shown in Drawing #3 . <p> The hourglass shape , curved to echo the shape of the bust , waist , and hip , is flattering for hourglass , pear-shaped , and rectangular figures . I like this curvy shape on short tops that end at the high hip . But it 's not so becoming to a figure that 's wedge-shaped or very straight and angular . <p> A tapered-wedge T-shirt shape is narrower at the hip or hem than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim-line pants and skirts . In an oversized shirt with adequate ease at the hip ( at least 2 in. ) , this shape flatters most figures , especially wedge-shaped and straight , angular figures . Shoulder pads make the shape more flattering for hourglass and pear shapes . <p> The standard T-shirt 's straight , boxy cut adds bulk , and works best for fluid fabrics or cropped looks . I frequently adapt purchased boxy T-shirts for a more pleasing shape . <p> Regardless of body shape , I suggest creating a slight curve at the lower hem by adding 1/2 in. at the center front and back , tapering to zero at the side seams . This makes a softer , more flattering line that follows body contours . <p> Drawing 3 : Reshape side seams and remove excess fullness ( Click to Enlarge ) Reshape front and back side seams for more flattering fit . For wedge shape ( left side ) , taper from underarm to hip measurement , plus 2 in. ease . For hourglass shape ( right side ) , taper in at waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across front on dropped-shoulder styles , redraw armhole on pattern front only and scoop out excess - <p> No more boxy sleeves-Eliminate some of the fullness across the chest on dropped-shoulder styles by reshaping the pattern where the arm joins the body , on the pattern front only . During tissue-fitting , make a mark 3/8 to 1 in. from the cutting line ( see Drawing #3 ) , and redraw the line. - - Drawing 4 : Refine body and sleeve shape <p> I find that the wrist on patterns is often too wide , especially in larger sizes . I prefer a close-fitting wrist , since knits stretch . Measure the width of your wrist and upper forearm ; my ideal amount of ease is about 1 in. at the wrist and practically zero at the upper forearm . <p> If the sleeve seam is a boxy straight line , use a curved ruler to add subtle shape , as shown in Drawing #4 , when you adjust the sleeve width . ( I use a Fairgate Vary Form Curve Rule , available online from www.artstuff.net . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror the garment shape . If you 'd like a clean-finished , roll-up sleeve , add a 5-in. hem facing , as shown . <p> T-shirt construction tipsPreshrink and press fabrics before cutting , using the method you 'll use for the finished garment . Garments are usually cut on the lengthwise grain ( follow a rib of the knit as a grainline ) , but you may occasionally prefer a fabric 's design or stripe on the crossgrain , which is fine if the fabric has enough stretch going around the body . Since many knits have a subtle directional shading ( they 're knitted from one end to the other ) , use a " with-nap " layout whenever possible . <p> No fancy seams needed-You do n't need a serger to make beautifully constructed knits ; since knit fabrics do n't ravel , a plain raw or pinked edge works fine . I prefer a straight stitch and a standard 2.5-mm stitch length ; for very stretchy knits , use the smallest baby zigzag stitch , which will " read " as a straight stitch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus . Apply pressure on the back of the presser foot or push down on the fabric behind the foot , stitch 1 to 2 in. , then release ; repeat along the length of the seam . With a bit of practice , you 'll maintain an even tension throughout . <p> A mock flat-felled seam is perfect for holding seams flat , like at the shoulder and for dropped or raglan sleeve seams . Stitch a standard seam , press it open , then press it to one side . Trim the underlayer , if bulk is a problem , and topstitch from the right side . <p> A size 12/80 universal needle ( tapered , with a rounded point ) and good-quality , all-polyester thread work well for most light- to medium-weight knits . If you get skipped stitches on synthetics , " power " knits with Lycra , or very fine knits , try using a ballpoint needle ( with a more rounded point ) , apply needle lubricant ( like Sewer 's Aid , available from Nancy 's Notions ( www.nancysnotions.com ) along the spool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often use double needles for topstitching hems ; my favorite is a 4-mm-wide 12/80 universal . <p> For smooth hems and stable seams-Before assembling your T-shirt , prepare the hems by pressing them into place ; I use an oaktag template as a guide . Next , apply a narrow crossgrain strip of soft , all-bias knit fusible interfacing ( like SofKnit from HTC ) in hems to reduce rippling ( it 's easier to add now while the garment is flat ) . <p> To sew and stabilize the shoulder at the same time , stitch the shoulder seam with the back side up , adding a strip of clear , unstretched elastic on top . Press the seam without touching the elastic , which will melt . <p> Tips for a neat , round neck-I prefer a self-fabric , bound neck edge 1/2 to 1 in. wide , as shown on the shirts on this page . A crossgrain strip of fabric works well for a single-layer , wrap-around binding on medium-weight to thick fabrics , and for a double-layer French binding on lightweight knits . Since each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a smooth finish . It should pull the neck edge in and lie flat against the body without puckering . Before cutting the band , try on the shirt . Nothing more will be done to the cut edge of the fabric on the neck before it 's bound , so you can see whether the neckline needs to be drawn in , which is simple to do with the binding . <p> To calculate the width of the band , add three seam-allowance widths plus 1/2 in. ( for the turn of the cloth and extra to catch in the final stitching ) . I find a 3:4 to 7:8 ratio between the length of the binding and neckline generally works well . For example , on a 20-in. -long neckline , I might start with a binding of 15 to 17 in. , depending on the stretchiness of the fabric . Adding 1/4-in. seam allowances , cut the neckband ends on a 45-degree angle to reduce bulk , and stitch the ends to form a circle . <p> To clean-finish the inside of a single-layer neckband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can also pink the band 's remaining raw edge or turn it under before stitching in the ditch to secure . Positioning the band 's seam off-center at the back , divide the neckline and band in quarters , and mark with pins , snips , or chalk . With right sides together , position the band on top of the neckline so the feed dog can help ease in the longer layer and , stretching slightly , stitch the seamlines together , then press . Wrap the binding to the wrong side , press again , and try on the garment to check the neck fit and band width . <p> Drawing 5 : A bound V-neckline <p> ( Click to Enlarge ) To convert a round neckline to a flattering V , mark the desired depth of the V during tissue-fitting , then redraw the neckline as shown in Drawing 1 . <p> To prepare the V area , measure the neck , including the V , along the seamline , and calculate the length and width of the band as for the round neckline . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neckline into quarters and mark . <p> Pin the center-front mark on the band to the V 's point . With the reinforcing stitching ( body side ) up , sew for 2 in. on either side of the V 's point . As you pass the V 's point , shift the bulk around the needle to continue stitching . <p> Sew the rest of the neckband as for a round neck , with the band side up . When the band is complete , shape the V by sewing a tiny dart on the inside of the band , as shown . <p> Binding is constructed as for round neck , except for separate stitching in V area . <p> At this point , you can even out the seam-allowance width , but never grade or clip the seam allowance , which will weaken the seam and cause distortion . To create a similar binding on a V-neckline , follow the steps in A bound V-neckline . <p> On a double-layer binding , cut the binding wider than necessary , since folding and pressing will make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides together , press , and trim it to the length and width needed . After joining the ends at a 45-degree angle , stitch the raw edges to the neckline , as above . The folded edge will wrap to the wrong side and be caught in the ditch-stitching for a clean finish . <p> For T-shirts , I prefer a small , smooth shoulder pad covered with fusible tricot , as explained in More Power Sewing by Sandra Betzina , pp. 30-31 . You can either sew the pads in place by hand or attach them with strips of soft hook-and-loop tape . <p> Finally , I urge you not to think of a T-shirt as a throwaway garment . Fitted and constructed carefully of beautiful fabric , it can be a valued piece in your wardrobe . 4378 @qwx204378 <h> Comments ( 9 ) <p> MBILLC writes : You could do all that sewing .

@@22149121 @2149121/ <h> How to Support a Dramatic Sleeve Cap <p> There are standard shoulder pads and shaped and extended shoulder pads that can provide support in the top of a sleeve , and there are all manner of sleeve heads . However , none of these options was right when it came to supporting the pleated sleeves on a wool jacket created recently by a student in San Diego. - <p> Jeanne Roy was inspired by the Steam Punk overtones of Simplicity 1732 , but wanted to scale things down . She wanted to wear the jacket to work , so she did n't want it to feel " costume-y . " And while it would eventually have a black sheared fur collar and cuffs , it would still work at the office . <p> When she was working on her muslin in advance of the class , Jeanne cut down the sleeve cap considerably but what was left needed more drama . She used a beautifully bodied purple and black wool that she 'd found recently at Mood Fabrics in Los Angeles . While the sleeves were underlined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dramatic contours in place . Jeanne certainly did n't need shoulder pads , and we did n't want to add bulk to the armscye with a traditional sleeve head . <p> Jeanne 's initial fit , with the jacket hand-basted together , let us know that we were on the right track with the proportions of the sleeve cap . <p> - <p> We decided to do some spot interfacing . We used two layers . Thanks to the bodied wool , we did n't need anything to keep the pleats in place . But we did need to keep the area just below them nicely shaped and supported . Enter tricot interfacing , which we fused to the silk organza underlining . <p> - <p> Here 's the entire sleeve . <p> After the interfacing was in place , Jeanne gathered the sleeve cap seam allowance with three rows of machine stitching . One row of stitching was placed on the stitching line , and the other two were sewn in the seam allowance . This drew in the fullness of the sleeve cap . <p> To set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the armscye by machine with two rows of closely spaced stitching ; the overarm section was sewn by hand . <p> - <p> By this point , the sleeve was bulky along the sleeve cap . Orienting those folds and expecting them to stay in place perfectly while being sewn on a machine was too risky. - So Jeanne sewed them by hand using a backstitch , with doubled thread coated with beeswax . <p> - <p> I pushed on the sleeve cap hoping it would spring back into place as soon as I removed my hand . <p> - <p> - <p> It did , thanks to the good-quality fabric , the right proportions of the sleeve cap , and the bit of well-placed interfacing . <p> - <p> - <p> Here 's the sleeve cap . <p> My thanks to fellow student Joanne Alkazin for her photographs . <p> What do you think about this technique for supporting and shaping a sleeve cap ? Do you have any suggestions or tips ? <p> Ziggybug writes : I love the effect . Thank you for great photos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A perfect sleeve adds so much to any garment .
