
 There are flowery tea lights that were once wine glasses , crocheted fabrics that are now wall lights . Old vintage fabric has become a lampshade and old brown wooden furniture has been transformed into a pastel-coloured centrepiece . <p> J'adore La Maison , a small shop in Wickham , is bursting at the seams with remodelled and recycled items . <p> It 's run by Angela Gannaway and Sue Cawte - and they 've fallen in love with the art of upcycling . <p> Recycling is nothing new . For the past decade or so there has been a worldwide focus on trying to re-use and rescue anything before it ends up as landfill . But it can seem harder than ever when we live in a throwaway age where replacement seems easier than repair . <p> But in recent times people have becoming disillusioned with this idea , especially as the state of the economy has meant a lot of belt-tightening . Many have decided to make old objects or furniture into something they love with a lick of paint and a bit of creativity . <p> Angela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : ' Initially , it all started with my sister-in-law coming home from France and saying she had found a lovely clock , but she could n't find it anywhere over here and she felt that someone should make similar things . <p> ' Me and Sue worked together at the time and we thought it was quite a good idea . We started making things at my dad 's place in an old stable , and then we were offered the shop and we thought it would be good on our own , it 's a great location . ' <p> She adds : ' Then we discovered the Annie Sloan paints and we quickly began stocking them , even though we did wonder who would want to buy paint from us ! ' <p> As well as making their own cushions and lampshades , and various objects for the home , Angela and Sue use chalk paint on old furniture . It wo n't need sanding or priming beforehand and the paint will go on surfaces from wood to metal and matt plastic to terracotta . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a month and also hold some in the shop . <p> Angela says : ' We realised we were on to something because they were proving so popular . I think what has happened is that people ca n't afford to move , but they can afford a tin of paint . <p> ' Sometimes you ca n't afford Laura Ashley furniture , but you can get something and do it yourself . I just love the idea that you 're saving chopping down trees to make more furniture . I do n't like places like Ikea because I do n't think the furniture is quality , but doing it yourself can look amazing . ' <p> The courses include interior decorative paint techniques , a memory box workshop , or the ' take a seat ' workshop where you paint a chair they provide . You can learn how to distress , texture , stipple , glaze , decoupage , stencil and gild different surfaces . <p> Angela and Sue even offer free consultations for people 's homes when it comes to re-decorating . But they do believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start making your own objects . <p> Angela explains : ' It 's hard work sometimes . You can pick up things easily though from charity shops , whatever catches your eye . All you need is a tin of paint and a tin of wax . <p> ' You can always be more adventurous than furniture and do your kitchen or something , but you really just need something small to get you started . ' <p> One company that has thought big when it comes to upcycling is Liberty Rose Interiors , set up last year by husband-and-wife team Sally and Jim Tickner . They are now selling to customers in Holland and have interest from Australia . <p> Jim had always worked on re-inventing upholstery for friends and family who asked . But as he works for the fire service , he 'd never taken it too seriously . They even made a Union Flag out of jeans , red velvet and Sally 's wedding dress for their living room wall . <p> Now , the couple bring new life to chairs and sofas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock in their bedroom . At one point , they had 14 sofas in the living room . <p> Sally , 39 , says : ' Last year , we were considering doing something more about the chairs he made , instead of just doing them for us . We started to buy pieces and do it at home , and they 're quite different once they 're finished . <p> ' They 're wacky sorts of designs , and I think Jim finds that more exciting . There 's passion in it , and you would n't find that on the high street . I think when you go into DFS and buy a sofa you only want it for about three years , but upcycling an older sofa can last so much longer . ' <p> Jim uses traditional methods when he upcycles the furniture , which can tend to make it more expensive , but Sally says it 's all worth it . <p> ' It gives the furniture an earthy feel too because you 're taking something someone has thrown away . We try to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . <p> ' We like the fact that there 's an ethical side to it . We 've started doing tables and lampshades too and we 're thinking about how they could all fit together , not just the chairs . It 's a real mix . ' <p> She adds : ' There 's a lot of people who find a cheap table and paint it up quickly , but you 've got to spend time on it if you want to make money . ' <p> Sally believes that the trend of individuals upcycling is becoming more and more popular because of what they see on the TV . She explains : ' They go to car boots and pick something up . A lot of people do it for themselves and a lot of people are doing it for their own home . <p> ' If you want to do it and then sell it , you have to work hard . There are quite a few people who are doing it on eBay , but it 's very competitive . We sold a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Australia . <p> ' But the challenge is that we make them from our lounge and we 're storing some we 've sold in our bedroom at the minute . We 've very much surrounded by it .

I have done a bit of website work , but basically this is my main work now . <p> ' It 's great to do something that you really enjoy and it constantly challenges you . It 's always interesting and I love going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicky will be at the Love Southsea Market in Southsea today with some of her objects , and also sells on folksy.com , a website which offers people the chance to sell what they 've made . <p> She says : ' I have chalk boards made out of old picture frames and I 've got signs too . I also decorate old vintage spoons and flower pots . I always scour charity shops for things , and I love the fact that I can turn that into a business . ' <p> She believes the practise is getting more and more popular because people are tightening their belts , and thinking of alternative solutions to buying : ' You really focus on what you 're spending your money on . If you can personalise something without it costing the earth , in both terms of money and the actual earth , then it 's exciting .

 Sarah Foster <p> No-one could fail to feel sympathy for the campaigner as she explained how she 'd contracted the virus following a blood transfusion in 1971 . <p> Dame Anita had needed the life-saving transfusion following the birth of her daughter , Sam . But unknown to her , the blood being pumped into her body had been infected . <p> Often called the silent killer because of its lack of symptoms , the hepatitis C lay undetected until a routine blood test years later . <p> When the entrepreneur spoke out about her own 35-year battle with the virus in 2004 , Jackie admits a warning bell did begin to ring . <p> She 'd also needed a blood transfusion following complications after giving birth but like many , she put her concerns to the back of her mind . <p> ' When I read about Anita Roddick I can remember having a conversation with my mum and saying " I should get myself tested " , ' says Jackie . <p> ' But I did n't go to get myself tested . I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her sofa fighting back nausea and surrounded by drugs , Jackie looks like she still ca n't quite believe what 's happened to her over the past 12 months . <p> After more than a year of feeling generally unwell , a simple blood test was all it took to reveal a life-changing secret . <p> For almost 30 years , she 'd been blissfully unaware of the fact that the four units of blood she 'd needed when daughter was just a few days old had contained the hepatitis C virus . <p> Despite many hospital admissions and operations since , she simply had n't known that she might be at risk . And when the virus was finally detected , it sparked worry and concern over how much damage had already been caused , and whether any of her family might also have been infected . <p> ' It was a massive shock , ' says Jackie , from Portchester . <p> ' My husband and daughters were devastated . I can cope with what happens to me but I would have felt so awful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Dame Anita , Jackie had received a transfusion before the government began screening blood products for hepatitis C in 1991 . <p> As many as 250,000 people in the UK are thought to have been infected with hepatitis C but fewer than half know about it because they have no symptoms . The blood-borne virus mainly infects the cells of the liver and can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer . <p> For 50-year-old Jackie , the diagnosis came after months of feeling sick and tired . Her GP sent her for blood tests in June 2011 and within a month she 'd been given the shocking news . <p> ' I 've had I do n't know how many blood tests . I 've had my gall bladder out , which is another problem that can occur with hepatitis C. Each time I went into hospital I said " I 'm a bleeder , I haemorrhaged with both my children and had a transfusion with the first " but no-one ever thought to check that out . ' <p> Annaliese was only eight or nine days old when Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transfusion at Portsmouth 's St Mary 's Hospital . While traumatic at the time , she soon recovered and thought no more about it until Dame Anita spoke out . <p> As husband Derek sits by her side , photos of Annaliese and their youngest daughter Laura line the walls . Now doting grandparents to three-year-old Isabelle , it was the thought that any of them might have contracted the virus that upset Jackie the most . <p> Thankfully , tests revealed the hepatitis C had n't been passed on , paving the way for Jackie to concentrate on getting treated . <p> Despite the fact she was diagnosed in July , the hepatitis C unit at Queen Alexandra Hospital was n't up and running at the time . So the Brittons paid privately to see a specialist in London who revealed Jackie already had cirrhosis of the liver . <p> She was put on a drug treatment programme in November but it did n't work . Jackie 's had to wait until this month to start a new triple drug programme . <p> People who 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can apply for compensation via the Skipton Fund . Set up by the Department of Health in 2004 , beneficiaries have to prove they 've not contracted the virus because of drug use , infected tattoo needle or other risk factor . <p> Jackie received a ? 20,000 pay-out , followed by a second payment earlier this year . Now she must hope and wait to see if the new drug works . <p> ' There 's nothing in my power to stop the hepatitis C from getting worse , ' she adds . <p> ' I 've been told the new drugs are only going to give me a 30 per cent chance . If they do n't work all I can do is try and get on another drug trial , but that could be two or three years in the future . Although I 've got damage the rest of my liver is coping well . <p> ' It was just a shame that they had n't thought to check up on a person who got this through no fault of their own . <p> ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even looking for people . They 've given this to me and they 're still not looking . ' <p> The former nursery nurse says joining a support group has helped her understand more about what the future might hold . <p> ' I 'm going to start living life . The money is for luxuries and when I 'm feeling better . They do n't expect you to live that long but I 'm hoping to live as long as I can . <p> ' I 'm one of those people who thinks the glass is half full not half empty . They did n't have the tests then in 1983 and the transfusion saved my life . I ca n't knock that . It was just one of those things . <p> ' The bit that angers me is that once they realised there was a mistake , they did n't come looking for people . There could still be a lot of people in my position who are feeling i 'll and do n't know why . It 's not alright that there 's something inside them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> ' I 'm going to do something positive . I 'm not the only one left alive who has this through a transfusion . <p> ' It was n't self-inflicted . I do n't want to put down people who get it through that route , it 's one of those choices . But I have n't got the choice . It really angers me so now I want to get the word out . ' <p> Jackie 's calling on anyone who suspects that they might have hepatitis C , in particular those who had an NHS blood transfusion pre-1991 , to ask their GP for a test . <p> ' I know some people would rather bury their head in the sand but if you know you had a transfusion then ask to be tested . It 's not going to get better on its own . ' <p> She adds : ' I do feel that I have to say " I 've got it but it 's not my fault " . It 's a defence thing . I was 50 in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> MORE AWARENESS NEEDED <p> While there is no vaccine for hepatitis C , early treatment can clear the virus in around half of patients and ongoing infection can be managed . <p> Charles Gore , the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust , says we 're on course for a 90 per cent cure rate in those who have been diagnosed . <p> But he echoes Jackie Britton 's plea for anyone who suspects they might have hepatitis C to ask for a simple test . And he says GPs must get better at thinking about hep C because too many people go undiagnosed for too long . <p> ' We 've diagnosed significantly less than half of the people who have hepatitis in this country , ' he explains . <p> ' There 's definitely a group out there who 've got this through a blood transfusion . <p> ' The problem comes down to symptoms . Often people do n't have specific symptoms . The symptoms are very difficult to pin down . We really need GPs to be much more aware and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Health did look for those who might have been infected as a result of pre-1991 transfusions in 1995 , but adds that problems with record keeping made it difficult . <p> He believes more awareness of the virus on the part of doctors and patients would see more people diagnosed earlier , giving them a better chance for survival . <p> As well as tranfusions , other risk factors include ; <p> * intravenous drug use <p> * Current/past cocaine sniffing ( sharing notes or straws with a person who is known to have hepatitis C or may have been at risk ) <p> * Blood transfusions or invasive medical or dental procedures in a developing country <p> * **29;265;TOOLONG in unregistered premises or with unsterile equipment or needles that were not new <p> * Regularly shared razors or toothbrushes with a person who is known to have hepatitis C or content to a friend . <h> Holly Willoughby ' 
 Mack <h> When I say ' Lee Mack 's not going out ' , I 'm not just giving you the title of his award-winning sitcom , but also a statement about his hectic schedule . <p> After the BBC cancelled Not Going Out last year , Lee decided to end his two-year hiatus from stand-up and head out on tour . <p> The show , cheekily titled Going Out , sold so well that he extended it , twice . <p> It now runs until November , which leaves the comedian in a bit of a pickle , because the Beeb have changed their minds and commissioned a <p> fourth season of his sitcom . <p> Lee says the new series of Not Going Out is likely to air in October or November , but he ca n't give us any idea of what to expect . <p> ' I wish I could , but I have n't started writing it yet , ' says the 41-year-old with genuine concern in his voice . <p> ' I wish I could tell you what 's going to happen , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got a clue what I 'm going to write about yet . ' <p> When we speak he 's holed-up in a basement hotel room in Edinburgh , en route from consecutive tour nights in Newcastle and Aberdeen , and he 's about to sit down at his laptop to work on the new series . <p> ' We 've just had a mental period of touring , ' explains Lee . ' We managed to cross five borders in 36 hours . ' <p> There 's no doubt life on the road can be gruelling , but it 's especially tough when , like Lee , you 're the one driving . <p> ' I 'm one of those mental people who employs a tour manager and then drives him around , ' laughs the comedian , who 's been transporting his tour manager and support act , Simon Evans , around the UK for three months so far . <p> ' I like to drive . I 'm not a very good passenger , ' he continues . <p> He clearly likes to be in control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tries them out at a fringe theatre , then rewrites every episode . <p> So , what 's it like for Lee to be back on the road after concentrating on TV for so long ? <p> He says : ' It 's like any job ; it 's got good bits and bad bits . <p> ' The good bit about being on tour is not having to deal with as many executives . TV is all about committees and control , whereas stand-up is direct . It 's you and the audience . <p> ' But the good bit about working on TV is it 's more like a nine-to-five job . You 're home every night . <p> ' It 's hard to work out what 's best . I 'm one of life 's moaners : if I 'm on tour I want to be on the telly and if I 'm on telly I want to be out on tour , ' continues Lee huskily . His vocal chords are obviously feeling the strain too . <p> ' The tour 's going really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time I tour I forget how hard it is , ' he continues . <p> ' Before the tour I was telling everyone that arenas are too big for comedy , but now I 'm starting to question that . <p> ' I was talking about it last night . If you tour arenas you only need to do a third of the nights and you 're not away from home as much , ' continues the father of two , who 's clearly missing his wife Tara and young sons Arlo and Louie . <p> ' We 're in the middle of the longest stint at the moment two weeks away from home . <p> ' It 's a bit tough , but everyone has to do it . I 'm glad we 've registered with Skype ( an application which allows you to make free calls over the internet now . ' <p> What makes it harder for Lee is that he had n't planned to spend so much time away from his young family . <p> ' I thought I had a bit of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Just before Christmas the tour sold out , so we added some dates and then they sold out , so we added some more and then the sitcom was commissioned . ' <p> There is no similarity between Not Going Out the sitcom following the jokes , jibes and general misunderstandings of happy-go-lucky Lee ( Mack ) , his best mate Tim ( Tim Vine ) and the object of Lee 's hapless affections , Lucy ( Sally Bretton ) and Lee 's stand-up show Going Out , except that they both feature Lee 's recognisable brand of physical humour . <p> Lee says the tour is just him ' messing about for an-hour-and-a-half ' . <p> ' I 've heard people say that when they come out of one of my shows they ca n't actually remember what I 've said . <p> ' My jokes have no particular point to them , ' says Lee , who knew from an early age what he wanted to do with his life . <p> ' I probably knew when I was about 14 that I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time before I actually did it , ' he remembers . <p> Lee grew up in Southport and Blackburn . His parents were in amateur dramatics , while his great-grandfather was a hit in the variety halls . <p> Lee says this did n't have an effect on him , because he never met great grandad Billy Mack . <p> He says more prominent influences were Eric Morecambe and Stan Laurel . <p> He studied TV and drama at Brunel University in London and worked as a Pontin 's Blue Coat , a stable boy and a fruit-picker . <p> Lee explains : ' I knew I wanted to be a comedian , I just did n't really know what that meant . <p> ' I did n't know how to do it . The circuit was much smaller when I started out , there were not as many clubs up north , not like there are now . At that time you had to live in London . <p> ' So I was in and out of dead-end jobs . Any job where you can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' The worst was apricot picking in Australia . It was particularly hard because you were paid per crate , but the crates were wide and took two days to fill . <p> ' I 've never had a serious job until now . This is the nearest thing to what you would call a career for me , ' continues Lee self-effacingly . <p> After 10 years of waiting , Lee had his first open slot in a comedy club in 1994 . He was still a student at the time , but within 18 months he was doing it for a living . <p> He first became a household name with Bafta award-winning The Sketch Show on ITV1 from 2001 to 2003 . <p> Lee says this show 's appeal lay in the fact that it was a traditional sketch show , which was a rare thing on television then , and is still now . <p> It was so successful that the Americans decided to remake it and unusually , despite Lee being the only remaining original cast member , they decided to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammer to England to film rather than vice versa . <p> ' It was a good experience , ' says Lee , unconvincingly . <p> ' The Americans were a bit different to work with . They all flew to Britain to film it , but they were not too pleased to be here , ' he continues , diplomatically . <p> One person he genuinely enjoyed working with was Bobby Ball , who played his father in the last series of Not Going Out . <p> ' It 's gone full circle , ' says Lee . ' I used to do impressions of him when I was showing off to my mates at school and he ended up playing my dad . He 's a very nice bloke . He 's been through that golden era of comedy . He had 20 million viewers . <p> ' Modern comedians ca n't compare with that . It was a different level of fame for comedians 20 years ago . ' <p> Harry Hill and Ross Noble are other comedians Lee counts as friends . <p> ' Comedians tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explains . <p> ' It goes in phases : you 'll socialise with someone for months , because you 're working with them , and then you wo n't see them for a few years . <p> ' My general rule of thumb is , when my wife is good friends with their wife , we 'll spend more time together . ' <p> Lee also reveals that when comedians get together it 's not the barrel of laughs you might expect . <p> ' When comedians get together with other comedians it 's phenomenally boring , ' he says . <p> ' Of course we have a laugh but we 're likely to get into intense comedy conversations that will leave everyone else completely bored , ' he continues . <p> But Lee 's not going to get much chance to socialise , with comedians or otherwise , any time soon . <p> With the tour , plus writing and producing the new series and working on a pilot for a new BBC variety show , Lee content to a friend . 
 to be with you on home turf <h> ' You become a very popular uncle when you can hand out wristbands , ' says Level 42 frontman Mark King . <p> The 51-year-old singer and bass guitarist with the Isle of Wight 's biggest musical export is looking forward to his first festival appearance on home turf when Level 42 open Bestival on Friday . <p> He says : ' It 's the festival my kids and all my family go to and they 're all looking forward to it . They 're especially looking forward to having a bit of kudos for once with backstage passes . ' <p> When Mark and I talk , he 's just hopped off an aeroplane , mid-way through Level 42 's 30th anniversary tour . <p> ' We had a great show last night in the Isle of Man . I 've never been there before . But it 's one more territory under the belt , I suppose . <p> It 's just like the Isle of Wight really , except the weather 's worse ! ' he exclaims . <p> Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London when he was 19 , but returned home 10 years later , to raise his family . He now lives just outside Sandown with his wife Ria and 13-year-old daughter Marlee . <p> His middle daughter , Jolie , lives in Ryde , while his eldest daughter Florrie lives in Brighton and his son D'Arcy lives in Oxford . <p> Mark 's sisters live on the island too and his younger brother , Nathan ( who now plays in the band ) , lives not too far away in Basingstoke . <p> ' The Isle of Wight is beautiful . It 's the best place to raise a family , ' Mark says enthusiastically . <p> ' When I was spending such a lot of time away on the road with the band , we already had two kids . <p> ' I thought " I 've spent all this time away , it would be great to be around my family again " . <p> ' It was lovely to move them back and we 've been happy here ever since . <p> ' I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic places too . <p> ' America , for instance , is a massive country . It 's got everything deserts , mountains , oceans and lush green lands . But there 's no place like home , ' he continues . <p> Mark 's love for the island is apparent and he says he was delighted to return in the 80s . <p> ' I moved back at the height of the band 's success and it was nice to come home as a bit of a local hero . ' <p> Aside from raising his family and continuing his music career , Mark 's proud of another achievement on the island . <p> ' I opened the first cafe bar on the island , ' he explains . <p> ' It was the first one , ' he repeats excitedly . ' When I moved back there was nothing like that . <p> ' I bought an old jewellers and turned it into something loosely based on an Amsterdam brown cafe . <p> ' It was the first place on the island that women felt they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't have done in a pub back then . ' <p> Mark named the cafe Joe 's ( an amalgamation of his first three children 's names ) but gave it up after 10 years with the arrival of his youngest daughter . It 's now a franchised chain with cafe/bars and restaurants in Newport and Southampton too . <p> Mark 's heart has never been too far from home . Even when Mark and the band were living in and gigging around London , they still returned home to perform on the island . <p> In fact , they signed to Polydor records shortly after a gig in Ryde . <p> Mark remembers : ' We got a gig at La Babalu Club in Ryde airport , where McDonald 's is now in Ryde . <p> ' Polydor sent down an A and R guy and we signed to them shortly afterwards . <p> ' I remember things 30 years ago better than I remember last night , ' he adds , reminiscing . ' That happens as you get older . ' <p> But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever expect to be on the road with an anniversary tour in 30 years ' time ? <p> ' Er , no , ' he answers abruptly . <p> ' We did n't at all . We never even spoke about it . <p> ' When we started out , four lads , best friends , we used to rehearse at the Guildhall School of Music , where Mike ( Lindup was studying . <p> ' We used to talk about our ambitions and say things like " when my ship comes in , I wo n't forget you lads " . <p> ' We did n't realise that was our ship we were already on board the bloody thing ! ' he laughs . <p> ' It was because there were so many other things going on . Phil was a member of M and I did their second album with them . <p> ' We were both involved with Leisure Process with The Human League 's producer . <p> ' Roxy Music were looking for a bass player . <p> ' There was all this stuff floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . We stuck to our guns . <p> ' I do n't know where the time 's gone . I still feel exactly the same . I still love getting on stage and playing . <p> ' We come off stage laughing . I ca n't believe I get paid for this . It 's <p> a great job . <p> ' We 've been through some line-up changes in the band , some people have gone , some people do n't want to live that way . <p> ' None of it 's right , none of it 's wrong . It 's all just the way it is and I would n't change a thing . It 's all got me where I am now and I 'm loving it . ' <p> Mark can reel off an endless list of career highs , including the first time he had a record played on the radio on pirate station Radio <p> Caroline , his first appearance on Top Of The Pops ' the Holy Grail for the music business back then ' , and recording with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one very clear low for him . <p> ' The death of Alan Murphy was about as low as it got , ever . It was just hideous , ' he explains . <p> Alan was the band 's guitarist from 1988 to 1989 , when he died of an AIDS complication . <p> ' No-one knew anything about it , ' remembers Mark . <p> ' In hindsight , he did n't look very well , but it came right out the blue for all of us . <p> ' We had just had the most amazing period out in New Orleans and the Record Company wanted to make a compilation album called Level Best . <p> ' The first we knew of the problem , Alan checked himself into hospital and could n't do the video for Take Care Of Yourself . He called me up and said " can you get by without me ? " . <p> ' It was fine because the idea behind the video was that we would dress up in ridiculous outfits to visually describe each line of the song . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The old man sighs , shuts his eyes and leaves behind another life " . <p> ' Seven days later Alan was dead , ' says Mark solemnly . <p> After 14 studio albums , seven live albums , six compilation albums and 18 Top 40 singles ( including Lessons In Love , Something About You , Leaving Me Now and Running In The Family ) , Level 42 had sold in excess of 30 million albums worldwide , but , in 1994 , they split . <p> ' Whether it was that it was perceived that we had overstayed our welcome , that we were a hangover from the old decade , I do n't know , ' says Mark . <p> ' I thought we were coming up with some good material , but it was not even getting a look in with RCA , they were focused on this new band , Take That , ' he continues , discussing events that led to the band deciding to call it a day . <p> Though the band stopped touring and recording , Mark continued under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the band name and took Level 42 back out on the road again . <p> ' The output is n't like it was back in the day , because there is a lot of living to fit in too , with families et al , ' explains Mark , but he still plans to release new material . <p> Alongside the 30th anniversary box set , released in July , Mark 's working on an EP for later this year . <p> ' We 're going to put together a new six-track EP to support the autumn tour . I 'm calling it the old school project , ' reveals Mark . <p> ' I want us to all go into the studio at the same time and record together . People do n't tend to do that these days , they all have home studios and record separately , send round files and then bolt it all together in their own time . <p> ' I 've got a mobile studio I 'm going to take to the rehearsal rooms in London and I 've got the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being 12 tracks is because , to be honest , I think things are changing with digital downloads . You can cherry pick tracks . <p> ' Albums are just a hangover from when you 'd buy a big vinyl LP and you had to make it 45 minutes because that was the width of the groove . It 's not necessary any more . <p> ' I think you 're better off getting it out faster four or five tracks at a time , when you have them . <p> ' I could be all wrong though , I 'll let you know in October ! ' he says , only half in jest . <p> The band have had a busy 30th anniversary year , so far , having already visited Japan , America , Holland , Germany , Belgium and Switzerland . <p> Aside from opening Bestival next weekend , a date at Portsmouth Guildhall in October will be the closest they get to a home-town show . <p> ' It 's certainly the closest we 'll get to the island on our tour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to play on the island , it 's just that there are not many suitable venues , ' he explains . <p> ' So Portsmouth will be our local gig . We 've had so many great shows there over the years and I 've got some strong memories . <p> ' I suppose it would have been 83 or 84 , we were playing there and I was looking down from the stage and this kid in the front row caught my eye because he was going bananas . I did a double take and realised it was my little brother Nathan , who now plays in the band . <p> ' That kind of thing seems to happen quite a lot . Like how the drummer we 've got now , Pete Ray Biggin , came to replace Gary Husband , who had too many commitments to come out on a world tour . <p> ' Back in February , before the shows started , I was speaking to the guys about a drummer and Nathan said " look at this clip on YouTube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure I know this guy " , so I called him up and asked if he fancied playing some shows for Level 42 . <p> ' I gave him six songs to try and he had no trouble at all . I thought I 'd see how good he was so I gave him some other stuff and , again , he nailed it . <p> ' I said " you really know the material , you 're really good " and he said " do n't you remember me ? When I was 11 , my parents took me along to your 10th anniversary tour and you brought me up on stage and I played three songs with you " . He was this child prodigy drummer , you see . It was a long time ago and it 's really nice the way it 's all worked out both these young Herberts from back then end up in the band . ' <p> The whole band is looking forward to opening Bestival this time next week . <p> Mark says it 's the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' When you 're out on the road , doing your own tour , you and the fans know what to expect . But festivals have such an eclectic mix of people all going to see their favourite bands . You reach so many people , whole new audiences . <p> ' I get a buzz from the thought that there might be kids in the audience that then decide to be in a band . Kids that have an epiphany during our set like Nathan or Pete . That 's cool . <p> ' Bestival is just historically one of the best family festivals , so that 's where you 're likely to see young kids and , to be opening , is even better , ' he continues . <p> ' I do n't know why we 've never been asked to play there before , but I 'm going to pull out all content to a friend . <h> Anthony Rose : 
 As many twinning associations hit milestone anniversaries , KIMBERLEY BARBER takes a look at local links and their relevance to modern-day life . <p> France , Belgium , Germany not the most exciting overseas countries that you can think of . <p> But after the Second World War , building links with these countries was high on the agenda and improving relations was an important part of moving forward , symbolising an idealistic post-war spirit of reconciliation . <p> Many local authorities invested and set up twin towns some , like Portsmouth , have several . <p> In modern times of austerity , with councils cutting back , it 's easy to forget about our foreign neighbours and to write off these important links . <p> However , twinning associations across British towns and cities are still working to forge relationships with their European counterparts in a bid to promote cultural and commercial ties . <p> These associations operate independently from their local authority , meaning they do not receive cash from the public purse , but are instead funded by membership fees and social groups . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to mark its 50th anniversary next year . <p> It has a membership of around 70 and regularly hosts social events and trips over to France . <p> Members do n't have to speak French , or have any connection to the country , they just need a willingness to embrace another culture . <p> The association held its annual dinner at Lysses House Hotel , Fareham last weekend and 55 members and guests attended , including Councillor Marian Ellerton and her husband Peter , who allow the association to use their garden for fundraising events . <p> Association chairman Katrina Trott hailed its success and spoke of its importance . <p> She says : ' It is good now for the same reasons as it was when it was set up 50 years ago . It fosters better understanding and good relations between the two towns . ' <p> Katrina became involved with the association through her role as a councillor , but she enjoyed it so much that she has continued to attend , even though the association no longer receives any cash from the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always very good to welcome our German friends . We welcome them with open arms , like old friends , and they do the same for us . <p> Jean Luckett , secretary of Twinning Association <p> She says her own personal experiences of going on an exchange in 1965 have inspired her to recommend it . She says : ' It was a wonderful opportunity . <p> ' Now it 's a good opportunity to go and stay in people 's homes and get to know them better . There 's lots going on and it 's a great socially . ' <p> And with the recent terrorist attacks in France , she says the association sent condolences to their French counterparts . <p> Katrina explains : ' We told our friends in Vannes that we were thinking of them during the Paris massacre and they appreciated that support . ' <p> Not only is there support between the two groups and trips to each country , there are lots of social events that take place throughout the year , such as quiz nights and social events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association for around 15 years , says the events are also a way to raise funds . <h> Chairwoman Katrina Trott leads the annual dinner of the Vannes Twinning Association held at the Lysses Hotel in Fareham . Picture Ian Hargreaves ( ) <p> ' We 'll be inviting twinning friends from Vannes to come over in September to stay , as usual , in Fareham members ' homes . <p> ' The arrangements for these contacts and trips are all organised by hard-working volunteers and we receive no council funding , so members also organise a number of regular social events so we can host and entertain our French visitors in the same way that they cater for visiting Fareham groups . <p> ' They are well organised and great fun . ' <p> Fareham does not just have links with France it 's also twinned with Pulheim in Germany . <p> The Twinning Association also has around 70 members and it was set up in 1983 . <p> Jean Luckett , the association secretary , says that the group would love to attract some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's certainly lower than it was 10 years ago as it 's quite difficult to attract younger people . ' <p> However she says the group is still very active , meeting up regularly and holding events . <p> She explains : ' When we do meet up with our German friends , we always have a good time . <p> ' People have made some great friendships over the years and they carry them on outside of the association . <p> ' We 've seen different parts of Germany and it is a very good social occasion . <p> ' We keep the association ticking over and we keep bringing people together as it 's always very good to welcome our German friends . <p> ' We welcome them with open arms , like old friends , and they do the same for us . ' <p> However , one group that has not had such a good time is the Portsmouth Duisburg Anglo-German Friends . <p> Portsmouth was twinned with Duisburg in Germany in 1950 but , as interest tailed off , the once-popular group now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Portsmouth , the Duisburg side of the group is still going strong and last August 40 members came over and visited the city . <p> Brian Daugherty , from Southsea , was involved in the group for eight years , but says it had to fold four years ago when it could n't find someone to stand as its chairman . <p> He says : ' I still have details of formal members and I e-mail them and we occasionally meet up . We still have the friendship links and the Duisburg end is really healthy . That 's why we keep it going . ' <p> Brian says that as travel to Germany became easier , interest in the group died off . <p> ' Twinnings came into their own after the Second World War and at that time it was hard to travel around Europe . <p> ' Twinning was something exotic . Most towns have a link to France as French was seen to be the most important language , so associations with Germany began to dwindle . Now it 's just the remnants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duisburg is still pursued civically by Portsmouth City Council and Councillor Lee Mason , who is in charge of resources which cover twinning , says he hopes that the association will eventually recover . <p> ' Although the committee is not strong , there are still links , people still visit and write to each other . ' <p> Even the local authority has begun to widen its horizons and has formed partnerships with Japan , Australia and Israel . <p> Cllr Mason says these links have been vital in attracting tourism to the area and promoting the city 's history . <p> ' They have all come about through our history , ' he says . <p> The Caen link was set up the year after the ferry service started from Portsmouth , the Australian link was set up to honour Henry Ayers , who was born in Portsea and after whom Ayers Rock is named , and the Japanese link was established to honour one of Japan 's greatest naval heroes Heihachiro , who trained in Portsmouth . <p> Cllr Mason says it 's important to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding what has caused conflict in the past . <p> He says : ' It prevents conflicts and trouble . It is very easy to say " they are the enemy " , but when you have broken bread with people from another place , it 's a lot harder to demonise them . <p> * Portsmouth is sister cities with Haifa , in Israel , Portsmouth , in Virginia US , Portsmouth in New Hampshire US , Sydney , in Australia , and Maizuru , in Japan , It also has a friendship link with Zhuhai China . <p> * For a list of Portsmouth groups and links go to portsmouth.gov.uk and search ' twinning ' . <p> WHAT IS A TWIN TOWN ? <p> * A twin town is a town which has established official or social links with another , typically in a different country . <p> * The term ' twin town ' usually refers to a link with a European town or city and the term ' sister city ' refers to links with towns or cities elsewhere in the world .

 Darren Stares at work <p> Portsmouth is preparing to play host to tattoo artists from across the world . RACHEL JONES meets some of the ink masters on the local scene . <p> With bright ink dotting his jeans and shoes , Darren Stares carries the marks of his trade . <p> And so do his clients as they walk around with portraits of Bob Marley , Elvis , Tommy Cooper , Paul Weller and even Victor Meldrew on their bodies . <p> As a top tattoo artist Darren is at the forefront of an industry with an ever changing face . <p> Tattoo parlours have come a long way since the days of back street shops mainly adorning the biceps of burly blokes . <p> ' It 's more popular now than it 's ever been , partly because of the programmes on TV and celebrities like David Beckham having them , ' says Darren . ' And people are thinking about what they want . They want something different and come in with their own ideas a lot more . ' <p> These days traders offering the service have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher end of the market and those with the best drawing and design skills regard themselves as artists . <p> ' There 's more to this than people think , ' says Darren , perhaps because he 's so used to the impressive designs he and his fellow tattoo artists create on people 's bodies . <p> ' There 's no flat surface in this , everyone 's bodies are different and you have to take that into account . I would n't put a straight line down someone 's arm , you have to work with the shape of the muscles . If I 'm putting a dragon on , right down the arm , it still has to work when they bend their arm , almost like it 's moving . <p> ' But it 's all about the shading really . That 's probably the hardest thing to do . A lot of people get a good outline and basic colour but shading is more difficult . ' <p> Darren owns Portsmouth studio , Unique Tattoo , currently in Commercial Road but moving to Winter Road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists from around the world will be showing off their skills at a Tattoo Extravaganza at South Parade Pier on April 16 and 17 . <p> The Southsea venue , once home to a tattoo parlour , will play host to award winners from the USA , UK , Austria , France , Germany , Italy , Thailand and Samoa . <p> Hannah Aitchison , a star of the tattoo parlour reality show LA Ink , will be among those showing their skills at the event and Dan Gold , of UK show London Ink , is also confirmed to appear . <p> A look at the participants ' websites shows that visitors are in for a feast of design , from the popular wildlife , Japanese inspired and tribal tattoos to variations of those and more unusual creations . <p> Some of the artists have a very distinctive stamp , like Hannah Aitchison with her vintage pin-up girl designs . <p> The event has been organised by south coast tattoo artists Reno Sammut and Gary Jones . Reno says it 's a big deal for Portsmouth . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 11 years but this is something different . Everyone has been hand-picked . They 're some of the best tattoo artists in the world . ' <p> Darren and Reno also consider themselves to be artists . Occasionally they 've even signed their work . ' Only when the client 's wanted us to though , ' says Reno <p> There are hundreds of designs available for people , ranging from pretty and discreet butterflies to tribal patterns filling whole arms . <p> Some are created using stencils and others are drawn freehand , and the tattooists will work with clients to come up with adaptations and unique designs . Darren is known as a skilful portrait tattooist , but his work incorporates all kinds of designs . He has won awards , including Tattoo Artist of the Year at a top European convention three times . <p> But he warns that standards in the industry vary to a great extent . <p> ' For every good tattooist there are 100 bad ones , I reckon . I think if you took just a medium standard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd wipe out about two-thirds of the shops in the country . ' <p> For Darren , it 's important to be spot on as he 's often in a position of particular responsibility . <p> ' You feel it when people ask for tattoos of their relatives , ' he says . ' I had a guy come in recently who wanted a tattoo of his eight-year-old daughter who had died . It 's good doing something like that for people but you really have to do a good job . ' <p> A tattoo is generally for life so he knows he 'd better get it right . Fortunately Darren 's confident of his skills but he still likes to say modestly ' I 'm the best in my shop ' . <p> PLATINUM TATTOO <p> Reno Sammut showed wisdom when he went for his first tattoo as a teenager . <p> ' I had a ' mum and dad ' one , you have to keep the parents sweet do n't you , ' he laughs . <p> Now in his 40s , Darren is covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Carrey as The Mask on his legs . <p> And as a tattoo artist , he has even worked on himself . The portraits were created by his friend Darren Stares but Reno has inked a few designs on his own legs . <p> ' It 's difficult , because you can stop when it hurts , ' says the owner of Platinum Tattoo in Fareham , Body Images and Body Images 2 in Portsmouth and Body Images USA in Pennsylvania . <p> Reno talks as he happily works on a pink bow design on the leg of 19-year-old Laura Harvey , who says she 's fast becoming a tattoo addict . <p> He says body art really started to become a booming industry in the 90s and it 's showing no sign of slowing down . TV shows like , Miami Ink have maintained its profile and celebs like Cheryl Cole inspire plenty of punters . <p> Reno says about 70 per cent of his clients are now women and when a star of Cheryl 's stature shows off a new design ' everyone wants one ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adaptations or work on unusual designs with Reno . <p> He says a good tattoo artist should have imagination and plenty of knowledge as sometimes customers need advice . ' Sometimes we have young people asking for the teardrops on the face , ' says Reno 's wife Hayley . ' We have to tell them that it can mean someone 's had a prison sentence . They do n't realise that . ' <p> But the question on most people 's lips is ' does it hurt ? ' ' It does , but it 's annoying rather than painful . It 's a light burning sensation . Some people think they 've gone numb after a while , but they have n't , they 've just got used to it . Of course everyone 's pain threshold is different . ' <p> Admiring her new permanent bow , Laura appears to think the discomfort is worth it . <p> TATTOO EXTRAVAGANZA <p> Tattoo Extravaganza runs on April 16 and 17 and will also feature music and entertainment . <p> Money raised from a raffle of artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Help for Heroes charity . <p> Tattoo Extravaganza runs from 11am to 1am on the Saturday and 11am until 8pm on the Sunday . <p> A one day pass is ? 12 on the door and a two-day pass is ? 20 on the door . <p> For more information on the event and advance booking visit <p> TATTOO FACTS <p> The oldest known tattoos were found on the 5000 year old body of a Bronze Age hunter , found between Austria and Italy in 1991 . <p> Many royals throughout history have been tattooed .

Select your tattoo artist carefully . Some are better than others and some specialise in certain areas like portraits . So the kind of tattoo you want may influence your choice . Reno says : ' Go and visit them and have a look at their work . A good tattoo artist wo n't mind having a chat and showing you what they do . ' Also , bear in mind that a tattoo is for life and it 's probably worth paying a bit more . ' It 's up to the customer of course , ' says Darren .

Last year , 92 per cent of youngsters referred to TMSS achieved work or college placements and it 's on track to hit 94 per cent at the end of this year . <p> TMSS only has capacity to take on 75 youngsters , but its contribution undoubtedly makes a dent in the city 's NEET statistics . <p> The number of 16 to 18-year-old NEETs in Portsmouth has steadily risen from 389 in 2007 to 385 , 410 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TMSS manager , says : ' We think creatively around individual young people because mainstream education has not worked for them . <h> Danielle Lander <p> ' Not everyone is academically minded , and schools in Portsmouth do well to reach out to those who prefer vocational subjects , but it is difficult for them to give individual cases 100 per cent of their attention . <p> ' We sit down with the students and draw a line under anything they 've done in the past and give them one last shot of having an education . <p> ' They tell us what their ambitions are , what they enjoy , and we come up with a schedule of work experience , activities and courses that suits them and that will get them either into work or college .

That 's what the TV pictures of Peter Tobin seemed to show when the law caught up with him and the world finally found out he was a murderer . <p> But as Tobin was led away in handcuffs , the footage shows him lashing out at a photographer and it 's the look in his eyes that Cathy Wilson remembers so well . <h> Peter Tobin with his son Daniel <p> She saw the same flash of anger each time he abused her during their turbulent marriage and it still sends a shiver down her spine when she sees it . <p> Yet despite the fact he subjected her to the cruellest physical and mental torture during their three-year relationship , she never once suspected that her husband was a sadistic killer who preyed on vulnerable young women , just like her . <p> ' He was always violent and abusive towards me but I thought he was a wife-beating husband , ' says Cathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife-beating husband , as if it 's nothing , but that 's what I thought he was . I had no idea . ' <p> She adds : ' I do n't regret anything I 've ever done in my life but I have made mistakes and marrying him was a mistake . <p> ' I 'm sickened that he ever touched me . ' <p> As she sits in her kitchen clutching a cup of coffee , the book she 's written about her life sits by her side . Currently sailing up the best-sellers chart it makes for grim reading . <p> In 2006 , Tobin was found guilty of the brutal murder of Polish student Angelika Kluk . By 2009 he 'd also been convicted of killing Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol . <p> Police suspect Tobin who was also jailed in 1994 for the sexual assault of two teenage girls in Leigh Park of many more crimes . <p> Cathy is convinced she 's lucky to be alive following her relationship with Tobin , the father of her son , Daniel . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it was a really difficult life but if you 're strong it 's something you can beat , ' explains the 41-year-old . <p> ' It 's meant to be inspirational .

He was a very clever man and always played a lot of mental games . He made me think I was nothing . As I had no-one to ask questions of I thought nothing of it . You 've got this person that you believe that you love , mind-manipulating you to think that you 're the reason it 's like this . People like him have got a sixth sense to be able to pick out people who are vulnerable . ' <p> For the first time in her life , Cathy 's not vulnerable any more .

' <p> Cathy met Tobin when she was just 16 and within a year they were married and expecting a child .

I think what changed his mind was that I had his son . I think that changed me from a victim to a possession and I think that 's the reason I 'm still here .

Isolated from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finally snapped , telling him she wanted a divorce . His response was to dangle Daniel over the stairs , knowing that Cathy would n't put her child 's life in jeopardy by going through with her threat . <p> ' From that point onwards he followed my everywhere , to the back garden , to the boot of the car , ' remembers Cathy . ' If he went out he took my bank cards and locked me in the house . He did n't leave me alone for a minute . <p> ' When he did leave me this one time I grabbed Daniel 's bag and stuff and ran to the coach station . <p> ' That hour and a half wait was the longest I 've ever spent . I remember thinking " If he comes now and sees I 've disobeyed him , in my heart I know he 's going to kill me " . I really felt it . I was absolutely petrified .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the brutal way he 'd treated her . <p> For the sake of her son , she let Tobin see him even going back to him once when he abducted Daniel and took him back to Scotland . When Tobin settled in the south , Cathy let him see Daniel at the weekends . <p> But all that was to change when he locked two girls in his Leigh Park flat to drug and rape them . Daniel was with him at the time and Cathy believes her son might have been used to lure the girls in , thinking they would be safe there with a young child present . <p> Tobin was sent to prison for 14 years and Cathy refused to let him see Daniel . <p> ' I said to Daniel " Your father is in prison on a drugs-related offence " and as far as I was concerned I could get on with my life . <p> ' The only thing I did was move every six months because he 'd asked for a photograph of Daniel when he was in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would anger him and I was always convinced that he would come after me .

" <p> ' I had a feeling inside of me that I would have offended him so much that he 'd kill me but not anybody else . I had never seen any sign of aggression to anyone else at all , it really was just directed towards me . I could just see him sitting in prison seething , I could feel it in my bones . <p> ' Well he ca n't hurt anyone now . ' <p> Until 2006 , Cathy believed Tobin was still in prison . Although he 'd been released early , he 'd broken the conditions of his probation within days and she assumed he 'd been sent back to serve the remaining years of his sentence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kluk was his next victim . When her body was discovered it was n't long before he was named as a suspect and a phone call alerted Cathy to the fact he was out and on the run . <p> ' My aunt phoned me and I screamed , ' she says .

I went to the police station in Fratton and by then his face was on the front page of The News . I said " I know this is going to sound really stupid but this man is my ex-husband and I think he will be coming to Portsmouth " . ' <p> After he was convicted of Angelika 's murder , police linked him to the deaths of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol in 1991 . Homes that Cathy had lived in with Tobin were soon being searched . And the bodies of both girls were discovered in the garden of his home in Margate with Vicky 's remains found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As details of what had happened started to emerge , Cathy realised Daniel might have been used again as a lure . The sight of his car seat and toys when Tobin picked Dinah and a friend up on the A3 near Liphook had reassured them enough to make them get into the vehicle . And the weekend Tobin abducted Vicky , Daniel had been with him . <p> ' It does n't sicken me that Daniel played in the sandpit , ' adds Cathy . ' I 'm sickened that that 's how his mind worked and he ( Tobin ) did those things . Someone asked me if I felt guilty that the reason he was in Hampshire was because of me and Daniel but he was going to do these things where ever .

 potholes which trapped Pompey fans <h> Adam Webster was the subject of made-up transfer gossip on transfer deadline day Picture : Joe Pepler <h> Neil Allen <p> As Adam Webster looked out the window , he could have been excused for double-checking the surroundings . <p> Pompey 's players were in the throes of the six-hour drive to their Lancaster hotel ahead of the following day 's fixture with Morecambe . <p> That morning , Paul Cook 's chosen 18-man squad had boarded the team coach at their Copnor Road training ground for the arduous M6 trek . <p> Except , according to social media , Webster was not actually present . <p> Instead , we were told by Twitter , he was off to Peterborough . It soon sparked alarm among those enlightened by such secret goings-on . <p> Transfer deadline day hijacked by Sky-sponsored hysteria , ably assisted by a rampant social media . <p> It 's a pothole-ridden environment where any nugget of information can blossom into a fully-fledged fact . <p> Suddenly rumours spouted by Twitter accounts with a picture of an egg are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Webster represented a perfect case in point . <p> At 1.03pm on Monday , Joe Hunt delivered a Twitter claim which ensured the Pompey defender 's future was the most talked about subject among the Fratton faithful , until the legitimate signing of Michael Smith . <p> Hunt , from Copnor , posted : ' Adam Webster to according to my uncle who works in the medical department , not sure on the fee tho ' . <p> A mere three minutes later and he added : ' Was surprised when I saw Webster did n't travel to Morecambe but this must explain it ' . <p> The bonfire had been lit and the billowing smoke blinded many a social media inhabitant . <p> Hunt 's initial Tweet was favourited 15 times and retweeted another eight as word spread of a controversial departure for London Road . <p> In reality , the had dreamt up the rumour for his amusement .

' <p> Hunt was not the lone voice spreading deadline day misinformation . <p> The Fratton end season ticket holder took advantage of a gasping audience thirsty for the transfer lowdown and highlighted social media 's obvious shortcomings . <p> Before the advent of the Webster farce , Tom Nichols was a rumour generated by on Twitter . <p> Posted at on Sunday , it stated : ' Peterborough , Brentford &amp; Portsmouth are all chasing Exeter Tom Nichols .

In that year he was said to be conducting trials with a full-bellied foresail . <p> In 1866 HC Maudsley , in his 47-ton yacht Sphinx , won the cup . She was a steel-framed vessel based closely on the Niobe design . <p> He too had conducted trials with a revolutionary foresail flying from the masthead and using a detachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point in time it 's impossible to be certain but we can be sure that the 1866 victory was considered to be due to the new sail . <p> We can also be sure that the crew of Maudsley 's yacht called it the Sphinxacre . <p> From there it is a short step to our modern usage of spinnaker , the first printed usage of which appeared in the August 1866 edition of Yachting Calendar and Review . <p> What is also clear is the enormous impact of the invention , which spread rapidly throughout the yachting world and is to be seen in all its beauty in modern international racing . <p> The etymology of the word is slightly complicated by an unexplained reference in the log book of the USS Constitution , on July 13 , 1812 : ' At 1am hoisted the mainsail and set the spinnaker . ' <p> Most historians think it must have meant the spanker but it remains a mystery . <p> That curiosity apart , Portsmouth should be proud of the major innovation , which was brought about by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This year sees the sesquicentennial of the Sphinx victory and its record in Yachting Calendar and Review .

 ' Concentrate on what 's in front of you and do the best job you possibly can ' <h> James Martin <h> Chris Broom <p> Last month , on the eve of his starting his first ever live tour , celebrity chef James Martin announced that he was going to leave the hugely successful show Saturday Kitchen at some point in March . <p> While Martin is not the show 's first host Gregg Wallace and Anthony Worrall Thompson came before him he has been getting up early on Saturdays for 10 years and has made the BBC1 programme his own . He has since confirmed that his last show will be screened on March 26 . <p> When Martin spoke with WOW247 late last year about the then-pending tour and his career , he did n't talk about what he was about to do . But perhaps reading between the lines , there 's a hint or two . <p> The chef began his TV career in 1996 , but has never been on the road before . <p> ' This is the first time 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I 've ever done something like this . <p> ' I 've been approached for maybe the past 12 years or so and always turned it down . It was never the right time or right people , but everything seems to click on this one . <h> I wanted to make this tour something fun , make it something informative and give people something they 've never seen before <p> James Martin <p> ' I 've had 20 years of doing this hobby my main job is as a chef . I just kind of dive in and out of the studio . ' <p> The tour has been dubbed Plates , Mates and Automobiles to reflect James 's other great passion cars and will also see him bringing some surprise guests on stage . <p> ' It 'll be exactly what the title of the show suggests . <p> ' There 'll be VTs on the cars to explain a few bits and pieces , and some mates along the way , I 've spoken to a few who are going to be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of fun . <p> ' This is going to be something different from what I 've seen other chefs do , something unique . <p> I wanted to make it something fun , make it something informative and give people something they 've never seen before certainly not from me anyway . ' <p> Can fans of Saturday Kitchen expect it to be like that ? <p> ' It 's not like Saturday Kitchen . Obviously the dishes I 'll be cooking live , there 'll be none of that " and here 's one I did earlier " stuff . <p> ' There 'll be all manner of stuff on this . ' <p> Rather cryptically , he goes on to mention a surprise he 's been working on for the end of the show : ' I 'm in training two hours a day , every day seven days a week for one element of this tour if it all turns into a disaster by December you wo n't see it on the tour , but I am trying to get this element in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The tour is taking in 25 venues across the UK and will finish in Portsmouth . <p> ' You are the last one mainly because it 's local to me , ' says James , who lives near Winchester , ' and I can drive home from there at the end of it . <p> ' I might actually not know what I 'm doing by the time I get to Portsmouth , ' he jokes . <p> ' The idea was to start in the north , start in Glasgow and work south . ' <p> With his home in Hampshire and a plane based at Goodwood aerodrome near Chichester , James is more than familiar with this part of the world . <p> ' I fly over Portsmouth a lot , I fly out of Goodwood and I used to use Spinnaker Tower as a turning point and a reference point . I used to go sailing all round the Solent as well , so I know the area really well . ' <p> Was learning to fly an extension of your love of racing cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was building my new house , I was so peed off with builders coming up to me and saying : " What skirting boards do you want ? " and " What light fittings do you want ? " <p> ' I thought sod this and took my motorhome off to Goodwood and learned to fly . <p> ' And that 's the honest truth . <p> ' I based myself down there and was working from there for pretty much two years while they were building my house . ' <p> And James adds : ' I admire Lord March for what he 's achieved there at Goodwood . <p> ' I 'm a regular there for Revival and the Festival of Speed you never know , there may be a racing driver turn up in Portsmouth . ' <p> Right after James announced he was quitting Saturday Kitchen , rumours appeared in the national press that he was doing so because BBC bosses had blocked him making a move to host Top Gear with his old mate Chris Evans . <p> However , when asked by WOW247 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin was most emphatic in his answer : ' Oh no , no , definitely not . <p> ' I think the cooking has got to be the priority . It 's where it 's going to end and everything else in the middle is " fluffy clouds " as we call it . <p> ' My whole life is surrounded by food , so that takes priority over everything everything else sort of fits in . ' <p> After finishing at catering college James worked in various Michelin-starred restaurants before coming to Chewton Glen in the New Forest as a pastry chef . <p> After two years there he set up the Hotel du Vin in Winchester . <p> He now also has James Martin Manchester , which opened in 2013 . <p> With a popular restaurant bearing his name in the north , a home in the south and a busy TV schedule , how has he managed to fit it all in ? <p> ' Last Saturday I was in at 3am and I got home at 8.30pm in the evening , as we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special . That was a long day though . <p> ' There 's so much going on on that show you just about keep control of it , you 've got to grab it by the horns . If you let it slide it would be a disaster , but it 's like anything live TV is tricky , and with the food and everything else we 've got going on , that makes it more tricky , so you 've got to be really on the ball . <p> ' So on a Saturday , I 'm doing that , and then when I 'm finished with Saturday Kitchen , a lot of the time I 'll get on the train to Manchester and go work in the restaurant . <p> ' I try not to tell people when I 'm going to work in the restaurant , otherwise it creates a bit of mayhem , so what I try to do is keep it quiet , do a night 's service and then I 'll go home . <p> ' I 'm just one of the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else and it is a team , I ca n't do it by myself . <p> ' We recently got into the Sunday Times ' Top 100 restaurants , so ever since then everything 's gone a bit crazy , so I 've got be up there and support them as much as I possibly can . ' <p> But no Michelin star ? <p> ' No , not yet . But that means nothing to me . <p> ' The restaurant last night did 246 covers . For some chefs the star is their priority , but for us , it 's serving our customers . <p> ' If you get the accolade for it , then great . <p> ' It was the customers that put us in the top 100 , so it 's them we want to thank . If it comes , it comes . <p> ' Awards and accolades are one thing , but customers are the priority . ' <p> Our chat ends with asking James about his post-tour plans . From his answer , it 's clear , hindsight is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 20 years and this tour is the biggest thing I 've been involved with in a long time , and next year is next year , and whatever that brings , it brings . <p> ' The main thing is to concentrate on what 's in front of you and do the best job you possibly can .

 with one of the worst weeds of all and says the mowing season has begun <h> Cauliflower Snowball <h> Brian Kidd <p> Q : We have just been allocated an allotment and want to grow cauliflower some which are not too large and ones which can be cut over a long period . What fertiliser is best ? H and LH , Waterlooville . <p> A : Try Snowball . The curds are about the size of a saucer . Sow 12 seeds now and another dozen about four weeks later and continue to sow more each month . But do not sow this variety after May . Cauliflower grows well in firm soil and the best fertiliser is chicken manure pellets . <p> Q : Can you tell me what these roots are ? I have masses of them in my new garden . I have never had a garden before . SL , Wickham . <p> A : These roots are from bindweed , an unwelcome weed . Dig out as much as you can and do n't plant any permanent plants until you get rid of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging , spray the foliage with Roundup and repeat until it has been killed off . Check it is n't coming in from next door too . <p> Q : We bought 12 wonderful orange polyanthus plants last autumn and planted them in a large tub . They have flowered all winter . Can they be split to make more plants ? AL , Havant . <p> A : Wait until they have finished flowering and fork them out . Split them into two plants from each original and screw off all the leaves . Replant in rich soil , enhanced with fish , blood and bone fertiliser and try to keep them in partial shade all summer . Keep moist but do n't drench them . Plant out in October or November . <p> WHAT TO DO THIS WEEK ... <p> It 's more than likely your grass needs cutting . If the grass is wet , drag a stiff broom behind you all over the lawn , this will make the drops of water on the leaves fall on to the ground . Leave it for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and this will transform the garden . The lawn is like an outdoor carpet . If it looks good , the garden is enhanced . Try to cut the lawn regularly this year . Short grass takes less time to cut than long grass . <p> Early carrots can be sown outdoors now . Prepare the ground by digging over the soil but DO N'T put in any manure or compost . Ten days before sowing the seeds , rake in of blood , fish and bone fertiliser and rake it into the soil . Sow early varieties such as Early Nantes and immediately cover the row with insect barrier mesh . Hoops made of plastic water piping two metres long with thin wood pushed into the ends of the piping make a kind of tunnel . Cover the hoops with the insect barrier mesh . This will stop carrot root fly from laying eggs in the rows . Insect barrier mesh is available from Waterlooville Allotments ' Association at the trading hut in Forest End , Waterlooville . It is less than ? 2 a yard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not expensive to join . Open on Saturdays and Sundays , 10am until 11.30am . <p> Plant onion sets now . A lot of gardeners will have done this already . Before planting the sets , put the baby ones into a brown paper bag , add some sulphur dust and shake the bag to cover the sets with the dust . This is a simple way of preventing onion rot . <p> Herbaceous plants are starting to grow and this is the time to divide them and weed the border . After forking through , apply a really good feed such as Vitax Q4 fertiliser using per square yard and fork this in around the plants . <p> Support herbaceous plants in good time . Sprays of hazel pushed in around the outsides of all the clumps will support the new growth . The appearance of the border does n't look good but the plants grow so rapidly in a month 's time the hazel sprays wo n't be seen . If you visit Wisley gardens , you will see the gardeners there have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freesia corms . Plant five around the edge of a pot and push in hazel sprays around the edge of the pot to support the foliage . Just imagine , the perfume in 14 weeks . <p> Sow just 12 seeds of lettuce in the cold greenhouse . Be patient by sowing just one seed in single insert cells . These will be ready to plant outdoors in six weeks . <p> Sow seeds in the same way for Brussels sprouts , choosing early varieities , Please try F1 hybrids if you have not been successful with other types . The F1 hybrid types do n't ' blow ' into open sprouts like the older varieties . <p> Buy seed of curly kale . This is the tastiest winter cabbage and looks good on the dinner plate because it is a lovely dark green , and it 's good for you . Sow the seeds in two weeks . <p> Sow seed of beetroot , just a short row . These can be sown at any time from now until the end of June . <h> Sheffield double decker

By sunrise on January 11 there were many fewer . <p> Jill Jackson was a young girl living at home on the corner of Hyde Park Road and Forbury Street . On the night of January 10 Jill was huddled under the stairs of the house while all around was in flames . The terrific noise of the bombing , crumbling buildings and the terrific noise of glass being blown or sucked out of surrounding buildings was terrifying . <p> Jill says : ' In the morning we opened the front door and a massive bomb crater was right outside . Perhaps her prayers had been answered . ' <p> Jill was nine at the time and attended school part-time . One week it was in the mornings , the following week in the afternoons . The family lived out of suitcases so they were ready and packed for a quick departure if needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , they ran to public shelters if a raid was imminent . Jill was lucky as she was allowed to sleep at her friends and shared the shelter with her . <p> The smell of damp earth and condensation running down the walls is still sharp in her memory . <p> One evening the raiders came and there was no time to get to the shelter so the girls crouched down in a broom cupboard . <p> Jill 's father , Patsy Jackson , remained in bed . ' If Hitler thinks he 's getting me out of my bed at this time of night he 's got another think coming , ' he shouted . He remained in bed , windows or not . <p> Patsy was the manager of the wholesale fish market in Surrey Street , JB Handley &amp; Son . <p> Jill 's older brother had suffered from double pneumonia and pleurisy and nearly lost his life . Through this he was not considered for call-up . He joined the National Fire Service and was in the thick of it on the night of January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling out bodies from around the Guildhall area for some time . <p> A few days after the January 10 wartime blitz , Jill and her mother walked along Commercial Road , or what was left of it . <p> It was difficult walking on the rubble and the pavement and the kerb were indistinguishable . The LDB ( Landport Drapery Bazaar ) had gone but it gladdened residents ' hearts to see Home &amp; Colonial was still trading . <p> For years after the war Jill and her pals used the bombsites as playgrounds .

 an important part of Portsmouth 's history ' <h> John Bramble ( 66 ) , working on a set of seat top rails <h> Stuart Anderson <p> Step on to a modern bus and you 'll get comfort , a smooth ride and maybe even free Wi-fi . <p> But 50 years ago , bus travel was an entirely different experience . <p> Passengers would feel the bumps in the road , smell the engine oil and polished brass and feel the steady vibration as the mechanical beast trundled along its route . <p> Buses , says Phillip Marfleet , have always been far more than just a means of mass transport , bringing people together in more ways than one . <p> Phillip says : ' We live in an age now where most families have cars . But if you go back a few decades their only means of transport was public transport , and that usually meant the bus . ' <p> He says that as bus networks grew , so did Portsmouth because commuters could live farther and farther away . <p> People used to chat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sat next to twice a day for years on end . <p> Phillip says : ' As communities grew up , social networks developed with the buses . You got to know the people you travelled on the bus with every day . <p> ' They 're an important part of Portsmouth 's story because they helped the city grow , but they 're also central to the history of Britain . ' <p> Phillip , 53 , from Clanfield , is the chairman of the City of Portsmouth Preserved Transport Depot ( ) , a charity made up of volunteers dedicated to keeping a fleet of magnificent old buses in working order . <p> There are two groups who meet weekly to work on the buses at a depot in Cranleigh Road , Portchester and at another near Petersfield . <p> Phillip says : ' We 've got about 30 to 40 active volunteers and about 160 overall members who support us financially . <p> ' We 've got a group of mechanics that come down on Monday nights and there 's also a group of non-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be retired people and so on . <p> ' They do everything from cleaning the buses to some pretty major mechanical work . For example , we 've just put a new clutch into one of the buses . There 's really a whole range of works we do to keep the vehicles on the road . ' <p> The vehicles in the group 's care range from a 1903 British Electric twin-deck tramcar , which used to trundle down the Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway , to a double-decker 1966 Leyland bus that 's so tall it would struggle to fit under more than a few modern bridges . <p> Phillip says the tram showed how important the vehicles were to Portsmouth 's development . <p> He says : ' The light railway tram used to run on the tram system that ran from Cosham all the way up to Horndean . <p> ' It was a way of getting out into the country and for the people of Horndean to come in to the town . ' <p> The machines are regularly wheeled out for transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group also has ' running days ' throughout the summer on Sundays , when people can ride the buses along Southsea seafront for free . <p> The biggest event on the group 's calendar is a bus rally at Fort Nelson on Portsdown Hill , which will take place on May 30 this year . <p> Group members also visit schools to show today 's youngsters how their parents and grandparents got around . <p> Phillip says it 's easy to understand why people get nostalgic about old buses . <p> He says : ' It 's interesting when you go into a school and you 're talking to a seven or an eight-year-old who might never have been on a bus . <p> ' The sensation of riding on one , the vibration , the noise , the smell , particularly on some of the older ones , is quite an experience . <p> ' It 's something you 're not going to get if you 're sitting in a two-year-old car with air conditioning and surround sound and all the other gadgets that go with it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't just hear about it .

It 's the same as the old railways , it 's mostly the retired people who keep the private lines going . <p> ' It 's important to keep them preserved . ' <p> But John says there is some hope , as he has taken his grandson along to the group a couple of times and he enjoyed it . <p> ' You never know , he might get hooked on it , ' he says . <p> John has been involved in the group for about 15 years , and worked with other bus groups before that . He spent his career as a mechanic , after doing his apprenticeship as a shipwright at Portsmouth 's dockyards . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , ' he says . <p> John says he prefers the personality of the older buses to the impersonal nature of their modern equivalents . ' I can remember going to school on these old buses , ' he says . ' A proper bus has a platform so you could run along and jump on it . They 're all noise and shakes and vibrations , not like the modern buses that are all quiet . <p> ' Mind you , in those days the upstairs was full of smokers . When I went to work at the dockyard it was all smoke from the old boys coughing their lungs up ! <h> Warning that alien

 Pompey Boys of ' 48 <h> The boys of 1948 <h> Bob Hind <p> A fortnight ago I published a photograph of the Pompey boys ' team that won the Pickford Shield after beating Aldershot 8-1 . <p> I asked if any of the team were still with us . <p> Bill Albury 's wife Mary got in touch to say how pleased they were to read the article . <p> Bill loves thinking over old times and remembers the match clearly . He later played for the full adult side and went from Pompey to Gillingham then Yeovil before managing Waterlooville . <p> Mary tells me she has a season ticket and sits with Joan Philips ( Len 's wife ) . Their son and granddaughter support Pompey as well . <p> They went down to Yeovil to watch the game and were disappointed that they only managed a draw . <p> Another who got in touch was George Warren , who is in the back row second from the left .

 that councils will lose control of all schools <h> Sam Poole <p> There is to be a major shift in the British education system as state schools become academies . <p> The government announced last week that every school which is overseen by its local authority will have those links scrapped within the next two years . <p> In recent years we have seen academies pop up around the country several in Portsmouth . <p> In fact , there are more secondary schools in the country which are now academies , compared to those run by the state . <p> Under-performing schools are frequently forced to become an academy in order to improve . <p> In some cases we have seen substantial improvement . <p> Other schools have chosen to join an academy chain as they recognise the benefits of being an academy and are hungry to have more control over what they do . <p> So what does it actually mean to be an academy ? <p> Well , the school itself has more of a say on how it spends its money . <p> The cash it receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local authority . <p> An academy also has control over the curriculum it teaches and the term times it sets . <p> You could argue that moving away from the state allows more room for manoeuvre . <p> When I was in secondary education in Portsmouth the school I attended was in the process of becoming an academy . By the time I left it was still overseen by Portsmouth City Council . But , I was given a taste of what the school could achieve if it had been an academy . <p> I understand there are schools which are performing at an outstanding level and now have no say on becoming an academy , which is a shame . <p> I feel the public are steadily losing control of what they currently possess .

 Fallon has admitted the gamble to use ' risky ' new engine technology for the navy 's ? fleet of destroyers has backfired . <p> In a letter to the government 's defence committee , the former minister for Portsmouth said a raft of malfunctions and failures had been identified in the Type 45s ' engine and propulsion systems . <h> The lessons of choosing simpler , more robust design architecture and investing in earlier , more comprehensive shore testing have been applied in the Queen Elizabeth Class and Type 26 ( Global Comabt Ship ) propulsion designs <p> Michael Fallon , defence secretary <p> Yet , despite this , the government refused to go back to the drawing board , instead taking a gamble on being able to fix the errors early into the life of the destroyers . <p> Mr Fallon 's letter comes weeks after the MoD revealed in January the fleet of six Portsmouth-based warships would need a major refit on their engines which is expected to run to tens of millions of pounds after a string of power failures . <p> The move to overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the first vessel was commissioned . <p> In his letter to the defence committee , Mr Fallon said the former defence secretary Geoff Hoon had acknowledged at the time that using the new Rolls-Royce gas turbine engine ' presented a greater degree of risk ' than the tried and tested LM2500 engine . <p> He said the first signs of performance and reliability ' shortfalls ' emerged during shore testing in 2005 , but claimed this ' was not unexpected given the novel and complex nature ' of the system . <p> In 2007 , after efforts to sort the errors , the trials of HMS Daring revealed a further crop of ' multi-layered defects ' . <p> Mr Fallon wrote : ' The system did not meet the expected level of reliability and industry identified and implemented improvements in system configuration , tuning and reliability .

All three are among the top 25 most common names in history , but ' Richard ' ( Dick ) has fallen out of the top 100 , while ' Thomas ' and ' Harry ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , following ' Mary ' - of whom more than 4.5 million have been born since 1530 - are ' Elizabeth ' , ' Sarah ' , ' Margaret ' and ' Ann ' , with ' Jane ' , ' Alice ' , ' Ellen ' , ' Annie ' and ' Florence ' comprising the rest of the top 10 . <p> The most popular surname of the past five centuries is ' Smith ' - more than two million since 1530 , followed by ' Jones ' , ' Williams ' , ' Taylor ' , ' Brown ' , ' Davies ' , ' Evans ' , ' Thomas ' , ' Johnson ' and ' Wilson . ' <p> Just sneaking into the Top 100 boys ' names were ' Edgar ' ( 100th ) , ' Cecil ' ( 99th ) and ' Abraham ' ( 98th ) , while for girls it was ' Valerie ' ( 100th ) , ' Amanda ' ( 99th ) and ' Eva ' ( 98th ) . <p> Day , Gibson and Booth were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top 100 surnames of the last 500 years . <p> But as some names become more popular , others fall out of favour , and that is especially the case for female names with none of the historic top 10 female names appearing in the most recent top 10 compiled by the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) . <p> Men 's names have seen much less change , with four of the most popular 10 overall still in today 's top 10 - ' Thomas ' , ' George ' , ' James ' and ' William . ' <p> The most historically popular top names for both genders - John and Mary - have fallen out of the current Top 100 most popular names altogether . The figures show Mary started to decline in the 1920s , while John did n't leave the top 10 until the 1970s . <p> The analysis also highlighted a modern trend for naming boys with abbreviations for some of the more common historical names . For example , the name ' Charles ' - which ranks seventh in history - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfie ' - the twelfth most popular name today - replaces the more traditional ' Alfred ' . <p> But girls ' names seem to be more cyclical in nature , with many historic names making comebacks in recent years . <p> The research showed the most ' yo-yo name ' in terms of popularity was Emma , which was the seventh most popular name in the 1830s , but dropped out of the Top 50 around 1900 . It came from nowhere in the 1970s to reach the second spot , before falling back down to 57th today . <p> Miriam Silverman , Ancestry 's senior content manager , said : " This research shows that names will often drop in and out of favour , and while John and Mary may be the most popular name over the past 500 years , today they do n't even make the Top 100 . <p> " That said , it might not be long until they become popular once more , just like the names Florence and Alice .

 for my charismatic grandad <h> Verity still has vivid memories of her grandad <h> Verity Lush <p> She is a tutor in philosophy , English and maths and has written a book for newly-qualified teachers , plus textbooks and articles for teaching magazines and supplements . <p> Remarkably , it was a year last weekend since my Grandad passed away . <p> Subsequently , I have been besieged by memories this past week . I think about my grandfather every day , and his death had a huge affect on my attitude to life last year . <p> I was watching First Dates on TV last week , and a young man was telling the camera how his father died when he was young . <p> Having been there and experienced that , my ears pricked up , and when he went on to say that his grandad is now his hero , and that he has never let him down , I started thinking about how many young people in the world need their grandparents . <p> Grandparents fit into that slot in our lives , the one that parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply can not fill . <p> And when the unthinkable occurs and one , or perhaps both , of those parents are gone , then it is their own mothers and fathers that take on that huge responsibility . <p> My grandad was always , unstintingly , there for me . Which leads me to think , how incredibly lucky and fortunate am I to have had him for 38 years ? <p> And because he was such a presence , and such a huge inspiration , I am now lucky enough to have been left with a million memories . <p> And surely that is where we all live on eventually : in memory . <p> And I do n't mean the cloudy recalls of times that have passed , or the memories that begin to fade before we 've even really begun to make them . <p> Instead , I mean the kind of memories that are cut in crystal clarity , for my grandad had too much charisma to ever fade to the format of vague recollection . <p> I remember my grandad coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her appearance into the world , and I remember his utter pride and love for both of my girls , always tinged with the melancholy that they should have had had life taken a different turn a grandad , as well as a great-grandad . <p> A couple of times over the years , I even moved in with my grandad , and I think I say with some surety , that there ca n't be many young women who were out-partied by their 90-year-old grandfathers like I was . <p> Friday night card games were the stuff of legend , and rightly so , because if there was ever a man who was never going to give in to the stereotype of a lonely old man , living a lonely old age , then it was grandad Lush . <p> Las Vegas and cruises , card games and horses , braces and smart shirts . Huge hugs and a stubborn nature , a titantic heart and a dapper suit . <p> Tomatoes and cucumbers growing in the greenhouse , chocolate biscuits and Kleenex for Men tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like old-fashioned flash bulbs bursting into colour in my mind . The list could be endless , the memories are myriad , and my love for him is infinite . <p> So , if you are mourning the loss of a parent or a grandparent when you read this and , as you 'll know , that need n't be a recent loss take comfort in the fact that you were lucky enough to have had that person . <p> So many people are n't and so many people do n't appreciate it when they are . <h> Newsletter <p> In

 account of profit amid upheaval <h> Jed Wallace . Picture : Joe Pepler <h> Jordan Cross <p> Managers coming and going followed by their staff and then the inevitable turnover of players . Yet , despite those issues , Pompey yesterday announced an operating profit for a second year . <h> Mark Catlin . Picture : Joe Pepler <p> And that progress was underlined as the Blues ended up in the black for the period until June 30 , 2015 . <p> Scratching the surface of the accounts , which are now registered with Companies House , serves more notice of a club emerging on sure foundations . <p> The operating profit of ? 359,000 and overall profit of ? 2,000 after the second full year of trading since exiting administration is headline news . <p> And , of course , so is the net profit of ? 696,000 on transfer fees , which factors in Jed Wallace 's departure for Wolves . <p> That extinguishes any lingering furore over the ? paid to agents announced at the end of last year , with that figure taken into account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two last season came at a cost , of course . Wages and salaries for the club 's 378 staff ( 39 players , 65 office and football management and 274 casual ) rose from ? to ? . <p> Then there 's the unbudgeted costs of settling contracts for former boss Andy Awford and staff such Paul Hardyman , Alan McLoughlin and Andy Melville . <p> Funding the arrival of the man charged with taking Pompey forward in Paul Cook is factored in but so is the six-figure return generated from staging the Madness concert last June and Pompey Lottery success . All part of the self-generated increased revenues . <p> Negotiations over terminating players ' deals is part of the ' churn ' , too . The club is quietly satisfied with the work done on that front . Catlin points out the bid for progress was made safe in the knowledge there were the means to cover costs . <p> He said : ' It was a big period of upheaval but the club would n't have committed money in other areas if we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're generating . <p> ' The brief we have to deliver is a neutral operating profit and loss . <p> ' Our product is what goes on the pitch .

Special praise goes to our fans who have backed the club through thick and thin . <p> ' We are sound , moving forward and trying to get the money into the right areas .

 The fast-food giant 's Cosham branch is becoming one of the first in the region to start serving guests from their table to avoid the need to wait in a lengthy queue . <p> And the restaurant , on Portsmouth Road , will also be kitted out with automated service kiosks where customers can click to order their meals before having them brought to them . <p> The transformation is part of local McDonald 's franchisee , Grant Copper 's bid to improve the overall customer experience . <p> The change follows a trial of 14 stores at the end of last year which showed table service to be hugely popular amongst customers . <p> Free to use tablets have also been installed in tables , as well as contactless charger ports for Android phones . <p> It 's so that customers can browse their e-mail or check up on Facebook or Twitter while waiting for their food . <p> Mr Copper , who runs 17 McDonald 's restaurants across Portsmouth , West Sussex , Hampshire and the Isle of Wight , explained the reasoning behind the refurbishment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future we are delivering across Portsmouth . <p> ' The first one was launched in Fratton about a month ago and we are here in Cosham . <p> ' It is part of an ongoing roll out .

' <p> There are plans in the pipeline to see this new kind of customer service offered more widely around the city . <p> ' Ocean Retail Park and Commercial Road are the next that need to be done and those will be completed by the end of 2018 . ' McDonald 's UK CEO , Paul Pomroy said : ' We are confident that the investment we are making will bring new and exciting changes to McDonald 's in Portsmouth and across the UK . <p> ' We 've listened to customer feedback and know we need to modernise further to move the McDonald 's experience on . <p> ' Our converted restaurants like this one in Cosham will deliver a fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring we continue to be enjoyed by our customers .

 of tack with the press at crucial moment <h> Paul Cook keeps an eye on his players during the Mansfield match . Picture : Joe Pepler <h> Jordan Cross <p> Noticed anything different about the rhetoric coming out of Fratton Park lately ? <p> There 's been a subtle , yet very marked , effort from Paul Cook to control the messages emanating from Pompey over the past couple of weeks , as the season charges toward what increasingly appears to be a dramatic climax . <p> Do n't think there 's been a media blackout for a second . <p> There 's none of the banning of The News we 've seen under previous regimes , here . Relations are good . <p> Cook sprung something of a surprise a couple of weeks back , though , when he gagged the Pompey players from speaking after the 1-1 draw at Mansfield . <p> With his own head in a spin at the way his men finished the game , the barriers went up for the first time in his tenure with the Blues . <p> That rolled over into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-minute off-the-record briefing . There he outlined frustration at what he perceived were some daft messages emanating from the playing ranks . <p> With there now little margin for error in the bid to get out of the division , the Pompey boss was looking for a renewed sense of focus . <p> ' There 's too much talking going on here , ' was the way he put it . <p> That meant a ban on players speaking and a more considered approach from Cook with what he was saying ahead of a game . <p> Given the Scouser 's frenetic enthusiasm and openness since arriving last summer , it 's a marked departure . Cook conducts his press conferences like you 'd conduct a chat about Pompey down the Shepherds Crook with your mates . <p> That leads to meandering chats on the Blues , management , coaching , signings , rivals , players and just about any other topic vaguely attached to the game . <p> His natural inclination to openly debate a topic was corrected a couple of times last week , however . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County have been erased was kiboshed for fear of lingering on the Exiles loss . <p> In typical Cook fashion , after a lengthy explanation of his thinking he 's now relented and is allowing a sprinkling of experienced players to engage with the media . <p> They offer a safe pair of hands , however , and are more than likely to steer clear of the hyperbole . <p> So do n't expect any further headlines about Pompey winning all of their remaining games in the coming weeks . Such a line was a catalyst for these actions after Michael Smith suggested that could be the case before the Newport loss ... <p> Cook took himself out of the equation after Saturday 's victory over Carlisle , with assistant Leam Richardson conducting press duties . <p> As we 've seen this season , the 49-year-old , who has been great value with the press , is n't a fan of speaking in the immediate aftermath of battle . <p> ' All we do is talk rubbish , ' was his assessment . <p> Cook would never dodge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to look like he was hiding . But weekend success gave Richardson the chance to speak in his more measured manner . <p> So a clear change of tack with the media has been evident . <p> There is an inherent danger in doing so at a critical moment in the campaign , though . <p> A change to focus on the goals ahead can also sometimes be perceived as cracks appearing when the pressure mounts . That 's certainly been the case at Pompey before under previous management . <p> Cook and his team , by their own admission , have found the weight of media attention afforded their side something they 've had to adjust to . <p> When people care about their football club as passionately as they do here , it 's also a reality they accept . <p> What does help is winning games . That puts smiles on faces . <p> A change in approach is the heat getting too much after a defeat . Victories arrive , and the plaudits for being a managerial guru are all yours . <p> " The biggest

 out of Africa <h> Cult status - Cartology <h> Alistair Gibson <p> Chenin blanc has had a somewhat chequered past in South Africa , a little like the wine industry itself in many ways . <p> Widely planted since the mid 17th century in the Western Cape , partly due to its ability to retain acidity even in hot conditions as well as its potential high yields , it became much used as a base for South Africa 's brandy business and was then consigned to bulk wine production . <h> Cornelia White 2013 Swartland <p> However today the region 's producers and now consumers are reassessing this noble grape . <p> Old vineyards are being nurtured once more , winemakers are showing it the respect it deserves and chenin blanc has established itself very much as the signature grape in the current renaissance of South Africa 's wine industry . <p> Chenin blanc has shown itself to be able to produce a wide range of styles ; from unwooded , fresh and crisp through to altogether more serious wines with the ability to age . <p> It can also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

There is some tropical fruit , particularly pineapple , as well as peach , pear and some spice , it has a lovely creamy texture on the palate with good length . Try this with a simple fish dish or even roast chicken . <p> Cornelia White 2013 , Swartland ( M&amp;S ? 10 ) is made by Adi Badenhorst , one of the Cape 's most dynamic winemakers , and is chenin blanc blended with a little grenache blanc , viognier and verdelho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend . <p> He also makes a red under the same label , which while not quite as good , is worth seeking out . If nothing else , tasting a blend of four different white grapes is really unusual , there is lots of juicy peach fruit along with pear and a touch of honey . It 's rich and textured but still fresh and fine . Try this with some slow-roasted pork with fennel seeds for Sunday lunch . <h> Reserve <p> A young winemaking couple , Chris and Suzaan Alheit , who do n't even own a vineyard , make the wine that has perhaps best mirrored the renewed interest in Cape chenin blanc . <p> Their wine Cartology has achieved almost cult-like status in a very short space of time . 2014 , Western Cape ( Waitrose Cellar online ? 29.99 ) is a blend of chenin blanc and a little semillon , sourced from old vineyards throughout the Western Cape , <p> This is complex wine with great balance .

 Copnor would retire from the profession two years later , but at that moment was being lauded in the Fratton Park corridors of power for leading Portsmouth Schools to national glory . <p> ' Jim Smith told us that story about Milan and Harry 's argument , although I 've never found out if it was true , ' reminisced Bryant . <p> ' I 'd like to think it is , Jim was Harry 's assistant at the time and one day repeated it to Louis Bell while in his taxi . I can imagine it was accurate because Redknapp did n't even come to the second leg of the final at Fratton Park ! ' <p> The aforementioned Bell was an under-12s coach at Pompey 's Centre of Excellence and a former St Edmund 's pupil of Bryant . <p> Their paths again crossed more than two decades later when Bell 's son , also called Louis , enrolled at the Arundel Street school . <p> And so began the double act which would , in youth football terms , give Portsmouth its only champions of England . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select from , making it among the smallest authorities in the country . <p> Regardless , their journey took them to the final against Bishop Auckland , with a first leg at Durham City attended by 1,800 . <p> Skipper Tom Roberts netted the only goal of the game and Portsmouth headed into the Fratton Park second leg with a prized lead . <p> Bryant said : ' We 'd actually missed the deadline to register for the competition but still applied . <p> ' Then Bristol dropped out at the last minute and we were in . You could say our name was on the cup ! <p> ' I was retching in the toilets before the game at Bishop Auckland , I was so nervous we were going to get hammered . <p> ' Our team was full of good players , there were no stars . <p> ' Billy Huntley was on the books of Southampton and once told me : " I do n't think I 'm going to get my scholarship , they have got someone better than me " . <p> ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the striker he talked about was Theo Walcott ! <p> ' Jake Thomson was also at Southampton and it was through their links which led to the offer of St Mary 's for our home leg , as Pompey were being difficult ! <p> ' Peter Storrie had told us : " Nobody plays on Fratton Park unless it 's our first team " . So Louis got Jim Smith to have a word and they soon realised the publicity of playing at St Mary 's would n't have been good . We paid all costs , including for the Tannoy and gatemen . <p> ' Around 3,500 fans turned up to cheer us on and the kick-off had to be delayed for 10 minutes to cope . ' <p> According to Bell senior , it was n't only Southampton who offered to stage that second leg , Anfield was also mooted despite Liverpool not even in the final . <p> ' As the first side through , we were given home advantage for the second leg , ' said the ex-taxi driver . <p> ' Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager wanted a favour . <p> ' He called me and said : " Can we swap venues ? We 're supposed to be at Anfield in the first leg but I think we 're going to win it and it would be nice to do it in front of our own fans " . <p> ' I replied : " Hold on a minute , you are n't even in the final " . His reply was : " That 's a formality " . <p> ' Well , Liverpool went on to batter Bishop Auckland only to lose to an 89th-minute goal ! <p> ' Do n't worry , I phoned him back ! ' <p> It was Bell junior who would net the winning goal on that glorious Fratton Park occasion on the evening of April 27 , 2004 . <p> The striker on Pompey 's books latched on to Matt Docherty 's stoppage-time clearance and raced half the length of the pitch to net in front of the Fratton end for an aggregate 2-0 success . <p> Unfortunately for Bell , he was released at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with team-mates Ray Rogers and Roberts . <p> Almost 12 years on and the majority of that triumphant squad no longer play football competitively . <p> There are exceptions , Docherty and Wilson are at Bosham , Roberts turns out for Bemerton Heath Harlequins and Sean Howe is at Fareham Town . <p> Thomson appeared 16 times for Southampton before representing Bournemouth , Torquay and Exeter in the Football League . Today he is with the Hawks . <p> Another who reached the professional ranks was Jason Prior , with AFC Wimbledon . A defensive midfielder and reserve keeper 12 years ago , he has scored 151 goals in 215 games for current club Bognor . <p> As for the much-travelled Bell junior , he is presently with Bosham . <p> ' Not a lot of them are playing any more , some have either jacked it in or are turning out in Saturday football , ' said the 27-year-old . <p> ' Many of us still keep in touch , though . Myself , Matt Docherty and Stephen Horsley help James Wilson run Meon Milton under-sevens . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still remember that ball being cleared and running towards the keeper , who was way back on his line . <p> ' I had ages and looked down the next time I looked up he was right on me , but I scored ! <p> ' We knew each other as kids , had grown up together either on the same side or as opponents , and possessed a real togetherness . <p> ' That is how we won it .

 ' The album is kind of a lost art these days ' <h> Fun Lovin ' Criminals . Picture by Tom Barnes <h> Chris Broom <p> At the height of Britpop , a trio of New Yorkers performed a gleeful on the charts with their infectious blend of rock , hip-hop , funk and anything else that took their fancy . <p> With their hit singles such as Scooby Snacks , King of New York and The Fun Lovin ' Criminal , the Fun Lovin ' Criminals became huge stars on this side of the Atlantic as Europe fell for their charms . <p> To celebrate their debut album Come Find Yourself 's 20th anniversary , the band have been playing a series of shows where they 've played it in full for the first time . <p> And now they 're preparing to headline this weekend 's Summer Show in Portsmouth on Sunday . <p> Frontman Huey Morgan told WOW247 : ' The album is kind of like a lost art these days . When I grew up it was all about albums . You 'd play it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete artistic thought and it 's cool going back to that and finding out who we were 20 years ago , looking again at the material and the tracklisting . <h> Rebellion 's looked at now as a character flaw in a lot of musicians and that 's kind of upsetting <p> Huey Morgan <p> ' It 's funny because Scooby Snacks is the fourth song in the set , Fun Lovin ' Criminals is the first one , so you 're knocking out two of the big singles from that album in the first 20 minutes . <p> ' It 's cool though because people hang out , you know like I would with an old Led Zeppelin record or a Rockpile record where there were album tracks that I really liked , and you can see people waiting for those songs , because they 're like : " Oh that next song , that 's my jam " . <p> ' That 's the cool part about it -- playing it for the people , because the people wanted us to do this . ' <p> The studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , has recently closed . It was the subject of an episode of Foo Fighter star Dave Grohl 's documentary series Sonic Highways . <p> ' It was on Crosby Street in Manhattan , Soho . It was this little street in the middle of nowhere . They had this amazing desk and all this vintage rock gear , but now , it 's gone . <p> ' I 'm sitting in my recording studio right now at the back of my house in Somerset , and I do n't have a big desk , I just have a couple of computers and some microphones , that 's it . <p> ' It 's crazy the way things have changed and grown exponentially over the last few years with the technology . <p> ' When we started 20 years ago we had to synch two two-inch tape machines together to get 96 tracks . It 's kind of cool in a way because everybody can get that kind of feeling , but it is a special feeling walking into a devoted recording studio there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting . ' <p> The Criminals ' genre-blending style was something that came naturally from the city 's musical melting pot . <p> ' We did n't put any kind of boundaries on what we did , we all liked all kinds of music and we kind of assumed that 's what we were going to play . We started writing songs and every one was different . <p> ' When we put that record out , it was n't something that was a sureshot . We produced it ourselves , we wrote it and helped engineer it with Tim Latham who 's now got a couple of Grammys to his name . <p> ' But people were interested in the fact that we were breaking ground and that was something we felt that energy from and that empowered us . ' <p> Hit single Scooby Snacks was also famed for using snatches of dialogue from Quentin Tarantino 's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction , and apparently the director was happy to let his films be used . <p> ' It was pretty easy , ' recalls Huey . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he was a good guy and he got it . <p> ' That was ( multi-instrumentalist ) Fast 's idea and I really understood where he was coming from - the whole idea was , we 're going completely Pulp Fiction on this track . And Quentin understood that . ' <p> While the group rose to festival headline status in the UK and Europe , back home they struggled to make as much impact . One problem was the way American radio stations run to strict formats . <p> ' When Fun Lovin ' Criminal came out , some stations picked up on it because it had that almost House of Pain bop , it was fun , it had a country and western guitar thing going on , stations were saying to the record label : " Why does n't anything else sound like this song ? " <p> There was n't the enthusiasm at the radio stations that there was at the label . <p> " Back in the day I feel like an old man now , I guess I am -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have to get you on the radio and if we do n't get you on the radio , we 'll have to drop you " . That 's the difference now . <p> ' There used to be artist and development . <p> ' They do n't to take the chance and potentially waste money on something new that might not work . <p> ' Rebellion 's looked at now as a character flaw in a lot of musicians and that 's kind of upsetting . ' <p> Come Find Yourself sold 500,000 copies in the US and was certified gold , but as Huey puts it , they had no qualms about following the money to Europe . <p> ' You can tour the US for three months in a van and maybe make or you can headline Reading and Leeds and make ? 500,000 . <p> ' What would you do ? It 's pretty simple , if you 're broke and there 's people across the ocean to play our music to who love it -- screw it , man , let 's do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to making money . <p> ' We did tour America with U2 , they 're really great guys for asking us to do that , and we played for a lot of people and it did well for the record , but you start to see where there are like-minded individuals . ' <p> While the group have got a busy summer lined up , their future beyond that is up in the air . Huey is kept busy by his 6Music and Radio2 shows , and he also became a dad for the second time last year , which has changed his priorities regarding touring . <p> ' It 's kind of difficult , my wife is pretty damn amazing . Leaving your family is a really hard thing to do , when you 're going out on the road , that was difficult for me . <p> ' I 've got a son who 's four-and-a-half now , so I 've done it before , but I did n't like it . <p> ' I 'm doing it this time because it 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a compromise for the fans who put me here in the first place . <p> ' We worked it out so it was easier on my wife than it could have been , but she 's a champ and she said go do it .

 31 times for Pompey , scoring three goals before Bobby Campbells arrival at the club signalled the end of the teenage talents all-too-brief Blues career <h> Jeff Marshman <p> For Steve Berry , though , it was the defining reason behind his unfulfilled Pompey promise . <p> Heralded after an impressive first season in the professional ranks , which saw the teenager play 30 times and score three goals , Berry looked set for a long south-coast stay . <p> But with Frank Burrows shown the door , incoming boss Bobby Campbell had other ideas and failed to see what the fuss surrounding the local lad , who had joined from Gosport Borough , was all about . <p> Given money to spend , Campbell set about building a third-division title-winning side . <p> Emerging talent Berry , who had top-flight scouts watching on with interest the previous season , was written off and forced to lament his misfortune . <p> Bullish Campbell was vindicated by his ability to deliver promotion at the first time of asking , although his sacking less than a season later offered Berry a glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released player but under orders from chairman John Deacon was forced to abide by Campbell 's list of retained players . <p> At the age of 21 , shocked Berry made the step up for first-division football with Sunderland . <p> Ball could only send a regretful telegram after an impressive Mackems debut affirmed his opinion Campbell had erred in not retaining the player . <p> For Berry , though , it was a demonstration of the harsh realities of the game . <p> He said : ' It was frustrating to be cast aside , dispatched to the reserves and not offered any first-team chances . <p> ' As a local lad , I really wanted to stay at Portsmouth and had no intention to leave . But when Bobby Campbell came in , he had his own way of wanting to play , <p> ' There was a job to be done and he did it well , I have to say , bringing the likes of Neil Webb and Mark Hateley to the club . <p> ' I ca n't complain about not playing in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved at all -- that is what was so frustrating . <p> ' Any player will tell you if they feel involved and they have a chance to impress , then a chance will come if they play well enough . <p> ' With Bobby and me it was a case of : " You are not going to play for this club again . I do n't like you , believe in you or see what the fuss is all about " . <p> ' That was tough and the problem with Bobby , for me , was the manner in which he did that . <p> ' He was quite ruthless in the way he treated the young players it was a change in style from the way Frank and his staff worked . ' <p> While Pompey enjoyed a season to remember as Campbell delivered on his bold pre-season promotion prediction , exiled Berry was unable to bring himself to join in the celebrations . <p> The following campaign did not go so well for the Blues , though , with Campbell shown the door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aldershot and with his contract coming to an end , sensed a reprieve under Alan Ball , only for Campbell 's judgement to return to haunt him . <p> ' For the club , the supporters and some of the players I was close to , I was delighted we were promoted , ' said Berry . <p> ' But I would n't hide the fact that , from a personal perspective , I was hacked off not to be celebrating in the same way as the other players . <p> ' I had not contributed at all , which was such a hollow feeling . <p> ' When Bobby was sacked a day before the last game of the following season , I had huge hopes Alan Ball would keep me at the club . <p> ' But of course there was a retained list already drawn up and Alan did n't have the job permanently -- he only had it on a caretaker basis , so I was released . <p> ' My contract was up and there were changes made at the top , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' He said to Alan to go by Bobby 's retained list when he took over for the last game . <p> ' I was on loan at Aldershot at the time so I felt withdrawn from what was going on at Portsmouth . <p> ' But when Alan called me in and told me I was not being retained , I was shocked . <p> ' It was horrible , for a week or two it was a real numb , disappointing feeling . ' <p> Despite strong interest from Southampton , Berry made the trip north to play for Sunderland in the top flight testament to the regard in which he was held in by those who had seen him play . <p> An impressive debut , against Saints , reaffirmed Ball 's belief in the player . <p> Berry said : ' The first telephone call after I played for Sunderland , in fact it was a telegram , was from Alan Ball . <p> ' He said : " Congratulations Steve , you proved everybody wrong and me right . I could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that were going on but best of luck . I am delighted for you . " <p> ' That was a measure of the man , it was fabulous . ' <p> Also fabulous was Berry 's start to life with the Blues as the teenager grasped the opportunity given to him by Burrows at the start of the 1981-82 campaign . <p> Berry said : ' It was a brilliant time for me under Frank , who developed the youth side pretty much from nothing because of the financial problems we 'd had . <p> ' Alongside Alan Knight , who was a couple of years older , I was one of the few local boys who broke through into the first team . <p> ' I was hugely privileged and excited to be told I was going to start the season . <p> ' The first game we ended up drawing 1-1 with Lincoln it was all a blur . <p> ' I was a young player with a lot of old heads in the team , the likes of Steve Aizlewood , Andy Rollings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lot of good players around me who helped to keep me calm and included . <p> ' Frank managed me well and eased me in and out of the team to help me stay fresh . <p> ' He took care of me and supported me . <p> ' Halfway through the season there were a number of clubs who were taking an interest in what I was doing by virtue of the fact I was holding down a first-team place at that age . ' <p> His first league goal did little to dissuade impressed onlookers he was a potential star in the making . <p> Playing against Bristol City , Berry started and finished a move which began in Pompey 's penalty area firing a stunning 35-yard effort into the roof of the net to the delight of the Fratton faithful . <p> He joked : ' A few people have since asked if I actually meant it ! <p> ' When you shoot from that distance , you do n't pick a spot , you just put as much power as you can behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jan Moller , stood at 6ft5in and it flew over his head and into the top corner . <p> ' It was certainly a highlight of my time at Pompey . <p> ' I had scored at home in the League Cup and away at Walsall but that goal was special to me as it was my first at Fratton Park in the league and bit of a spectacular one , which was nice ! ' <p> Sadly for Berry , his Pompey potential was left unfulfilled as he went on to make just one subsitute appearance after his breakthrough season under Burrows . <p> At Sunderland , he played at Wembley in a League Cup final before spells in both Hong Kong and Germany followed in a 25-year career , which ended with a successful player-manager stay at non-league Kettering Town . <p> " For three

Should that happen , it would be the first time in two years that a party has gained a majority , and the first time in 25 years a Conservative administration in Portsmouth has a majority . <p> The Lib Dems will want to bolster their numbers and stop that from happening by adding to their 14 seats on the authority . <p> But it could also be a big night for Labour - who currently have two seats - and Ukip - with four . <p> Reports nationally say Labour are set to lose hundreds of seats across the board . <p> The Greens , the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition will also look to take their first seats . <p> Meanwhile , Portsmouth 's Nelson ward has been billed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election ; following the decision by ex-councillor Ken Ferrett to not stand again . He also quit the Labour Party because of his political differences with national leader Jeremy Corbyn . Labour locally has also seen the departure of Aiden Gray , who quit after revealing on Twitter that the party ' no longer speaks for him . ' <h> The fashion-forward family 
 ' You ca n't build a career out of being a teen idol ' <h> Chris Broom <p> At the end of the 1980s Jason Donovan , Kylie Minogue and the rest of the Stock , Aitken and Waterman stable ruled the chart roost . <p> Jason 's debut album , Ten Good Reasons , was the highest-selling album of 1989 selling a staggering copies in the UK and going five times platinum . ? He was hot off of the back of Neighbours , where he played Scott Robinson opposite his then real-life girlfriend Kylie , who played Charlene Mitchell . The show was at the peak of its popularity , pulling in up to viewers . <p> His debut also held three massive number one singles , Too Many Broken Hearts , Sealed With A Kiss . and the duet with Kylie , Especially For You . <p> Now he 's hit the road to play the whole of his debut album , in order , for the first time . <p> Jason says : ' It was a very successful record that year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made over the past 20 years probably have n't quite hit that mark , <p> ' It seemed like a good concept for a tour , rather than just going out and doing another greatest hits tour . It 's an interesting experience if you 're someone who bought that album , then you 'll probably know those songs back to front . <h> Music definitely puts you in a time and a place , and when those fans hear Too Many Broken Hearts , there 's an emotional connection <p> Jason Donovan <p> ' I think it 's an opportunity to come along and enjoy that whole experience . It keeps me out of trouble and I 've got bills to pay too ! ' <p> When Jason spoke with WOW247 , the tour was yet to start , but he says : ' There are some songs on there that I have n't played live . <p> ' I 'm quite lucky in the sense that while I play some of these songs at festivals , I have a career where I do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just rely on this as my income . <p> ' Now I 'm on the road with Priscilla ( Queen of the Desert ) and I will be right up until I go on the tour with the album . ' <p> ' I 'm lucky to have these songs it was the biggest-selling album of 1989 . Music definitely puts you in a time and a place and when those fans hear Too Many Broken Hearts , there 's an emotional connection that you do n't get with any other creative form really . ' <p> Back in the ' it was Kylie who jumped ship from Neighbours first , and almost immediately began having success with the SAW hit factory . <p> ' I guess I followed in her footsteps , ' recalls Jason . <p> ' I was very keen to pursue my music , but I was someone who did it more as a hobby at that point . <p> ' But watching her and her success , it was hard to not hope that maybe that opportunity could come my way too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' When the opportunity came up to work with Stock , Aitken and Waterman as well , that was sort of the perfect marriage . <p> I was a big fan of Rick Astley 's album and absolutely loved Never Gon na Give You Up and could n't believe my luck when working with SAW became a reality . The melodies , the production , the whole package was like a first class ride . <p> ' And the rest is history . ' <p> In 1989 , Pete Waterman took Jason on his Hitman Roadshow and has said ' Jasonmania ' was a huge phenomenon , with the teen idol their biggest star and the fans ' reaction like nothing he 'd seen before or since . <p> But how did this young performer cope ? Enormously popular , he was seemingly everywhere . <p> ' The teen idol , the whole fame thing , is a by-product of being an entertainer and creative person , <p> ' It was flattering for people to think you 're genetically gifted , but that 's only paper-thin , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of being a teen idol , you build it out of being a good actor and a good singer and building the career in ways that make it interesting , trying to push forward and learn your craft . ' <p> However , his second album Between The Lines , while going platinum , sold far less than his debut . In what turned out to be a savvy move he took the lead role in a revival of Joseph and The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat . At the time , casting a pop star in the lead of a West End musical was an unusual move . <p> ' I think that marketing aspect , I was probably at the forefront . <p> ' I think when Michael Crawford came into Phantom ( of the Opera ) as well , that changed the whole landscape , but for producers of musicals it 's as much about bums on seats as it is about the creative process . You 've got to sell the tickets , so if you can get someone that ticks both those boxes , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a musical star , but it 's been very good to me . ' And he laughs , ' and you can age well in musicals . ' <p> Since then he 's taken leads in several other musicals , including Sweeney Todd , Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The Rocky Horror Show . <p> ' It 's important to be challenged by stuff . <p> ' At the moment I 'm doing Priscilla , which I love , and I really enjoyed doing something like Sweeney Todd that was a big challenge for me . <p> ' Joseph was a period for me where all the cards were stacked in the right way and working with Lloyd Webber , he really pushed up my currency as a credible performer , being at The Palladium , and the whole prestige of that experience . ' <p> Alongside his rise in musical theatre , though , Jason has told how he was beginning to harbour a serious cocaine habit . Things reached a nadir in 1995 when he had a drug-induced seizure at the notorious Viper Rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2000 , and asked if he has any vices these days , he replies : ' I 'm not one of those people that 's gone completely teetotal . <p> ' I still love a drink and a glass of wine , but I think my drug days are pretty much behind me . I do n't need that . That 's a box I 've ticked and I certainly know now what I do n't want to do with my life , that 's for sure . ' <p> So was it one of those things that was best to get out of the way when you were young ? <p> ' Maybe , or not do it all , ' he says with just a hint of regret . <p> ' Look , I 'm still lucky to be working in this business I 'm in my late 40s now , I still enjoy my job , there 's a demand for what I do , and my kids are getting a good education . <p> ' Long may it continue . ' <p> There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of I 'm A Celebrity ... and Strictly Come Dancing , but more recently Jason has taken to trying straight drama on stage . <p> He took the role of speech therapist Lionel Logue to Raymond Coulthard 's stuttering King George VI in The King 's Speech at Chichester Festival Theatre last year , to generally good reviews . <p> ' I really had a good time there -- it 's a great piece of drama and it was well received . <p> ' I would have loved to taken it further and taken it into town ( the West End ) but that 's about demand and supply in terms of what producers think is possible , but I had a lovely time in Chichester . We 'll see about that one , I guess . ' <p> POLICE are appealing 
 man should be Pompey 's player of the season <h> Neil Allen <p> At the searing height of his agony , Michael Doyle 's Pompey performances were propped up by eight painkillers . <p> For around three months the masking tape patch-up involved a prescription of four pills on the Friday , followed by the same amount on the morning of a match . <p> With a broken shin bone and medial collateral ligament damage to his knee , the Blues ' skipper should have been grounded for six weeks at least . <p> Not a chance . <p> Pompey 's medical team had feared the worst when a writhing Doyle 's thrashing fist pummelled the turf during the first half at Northampton Town in December 2015 . <p> An awkward landing at the end of a trademark highly-committed tackle had resulted in the weight of the midfielder 's body shuddering down his left-hand side . <p> Initial concerns from the Blues ' bench centred on a cruciate knee ligament injury , yet remarkably he elected to continue as Paul Cook 's side collected a 2-1 triumph . <p> Doyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently dragged away by physio Sean Duggan during post-match media duties for a thorough prognosis . <p> He still counts himself fortunate the extent of the problem consisted of a fractured a bone in his left shin and damage to his left knee . <p> That moment could well have been season-ending . <p> Despite the 's war wounds , remarkably he has since completed every minute of every League Two match . <p> Granted , Doyle was rested for the FA Cup third round trip to Ipswich Town three weeks later . Yet he returned for the Fratton Park replay and a 2-1 success . <p> The knee was the first to clear up , recovering within a few months , irrespective of the continuing exertions applied by the Irishman 's natural battering-ram approach . <p> Meanwhile , the necessity for painkillers to combat the body 's warning klaxon helped nurture Doyle through his shin distress . <p> Currently , such pills are no longer being consumed , the gnawing discomfort from kicking a ball subsiding . <p> He will wait until the summer to undergo another scan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embracing the natural healing process close-season offers . <p> It 's a tale which beautifully illustrates Doyle . <p> As a man , as a captain , as a footballer , he is an impressive individual . <p> Today readers of The News/Sports Mail will honour Pompey 's player of the season before kick-off against Northampton . <p> They have had their say , the outcome of which will not be revealed until that moment on the Fratton Park turf . Neither will there be spoilers here . <p> However , regardless of that result , in my opinion there can be no more worthy recipient than the former Coventry City player . <p> He has stubbornly led from the midst of the battlefield , shrugging off the annoyances of a broken shin and injured knee to drag the club into the play-offs . <p> Not that Doyle would appreciate any sympathy votes , the opportunity to carry out the job to the best of his abilities is sufficient reward . <p> If anything , his performance ? levels have risen since that Sixfields siren . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust his hand to the skies the swiftest . <p> As ever there were doubters when his prolonged arrival from Sheffield United was secured in July 2015 . <p> In the eyes of some , a 33-year-old with a portfolio detailing more than 550 appearances was far from persuasive . <p> As one supporter put it on The News ' comments section : ' Too old , too small , too slow and we already have an abundance of midfielders . Thankfully we 've only signed this glorified bench warmer for a year ! ' . <p> Within six months , Doyle 's contract had been extended until the summer of 2017 , such had been the brutal strength of his impact . <p> Dovetailing snugly in one of the two holding roles in Cook 's favoured 4-2-3-1 system , the veteran has been one of the most effective and consistent performers . <p> Here is a player with an indefatigable attitude to serving as Pompey 's driving force , delivered with a belligerence to irritate the opposition . <p> He nags , he hassles , he harries , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as his own team . <p> Yet a return of three bookings and a red at Oxford United demonstrates this is no playground bully content to destroy others ' toys . <p> Doyle is no one-dimensional spoiler , as testified by two assists in the 6-0 demolition of York , while a quickly-delivered free-kick to Conor Chaplin produced the Fratton opener against Cambridge United . <p> Meanwhile , that stunning left-foot volley from 30 yards at Accrington will remain long in the memory . <p> As for the 4-1 triumph at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge , it was Doyle 's remarkable intervention which changed the game in the Blues ' favour . A true captain 's innings . <p> Of course , others have also shone this season . Will-o ' -the-wisp Ben Davies that other elder statesman of the squad is deservedly a close second , while Kyle Bennett 's delightful creativity has been pivotal . <p> Christian Burgess and Enda Stevens also take a bow . Magnificent . <p> Yet when Doyle went head-to-head with Wycombe 's Marcus Bean last month , it ignited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 80th minute with a yellow card following an ugly late challenge on the skipper . <p> The tackle inflicted a sizeable gash on Doyle 's left shin , the same shin in which a bone remains broken and should have condemned him to six weeks on the sidelines . <h> FIFA Ethics committee 
 <p> Michael Doyle was today crowned Pompey 's player of the season after edging team-mate Ben Davies to the coveted The News/Sports Mail trophy . <p> The Blues skipper celebrated an impressive first season at Fratton Park with 35 per cent of fans ' votes . <p> In what proved to be a two-horse race , Davies was narrowly behind , with 33 per cent of supporters giving him their backing . <p> The duo have been integral members of Paul Cook 's side since arriving from Sheffield United in the summer . <p> Combative midfielder Doyle , handed the captain 's armband in place of the outgoing Paul Robinson , had featured in all but one of Pompey 's League Two matches heading into today 's finale with champions Northampton . <p> The Irishman also boasted a goal-of-the-season contender , with a spectacular volley at Accrington among his two strikes . <p> And the 's impressive displays this term were rewarded in January when he signed a contract extension to stretch his Fratton Park stay to the summer of 2017 . <p> Former Blades team-mate Davies has also won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attacking full-back had 48 games to his name the same as Doyle before today 's Cobblers clash , with his all-action displays belying his 34 years . <p> Davies remains in talks over a new deal as he looks to extend a one-year stay on the south coast . <p> Defender Christian Burgess was third in the voting with eight per cent . <h> Evacuation efforts continue 
 of Pompey return <h> Jason Pearce lifts the coveted Pompey player of the year trophy for the 2011-12 season Picture : Steve Reid <h> Jeff Marshman <p> Jason Pearce played one season for Pompey , which ended in relegation , before he was hastily sold . <p> At first glance it looks like a familar tale of a money-grabbing mercenary failing to buy into the club 's community ethos while underperforming on the field . <p> But looks can be deceiving -- Pearce was a big Blues success . <p> Just ask the Fratton faithful . <p> The central defender won seven of the nine end-of-season awards available at the climax of the 2011-12 campaign . <p> Those included the club 's prestigious player of the season trophy as he ended a roller-coaster campaign proudly wearing the captain 's armband . <p> Sadly , off-the-field financial turmoil demanded his sale to Leeds as the League Blues battled to stay afloat . <p> Pearce 's Pompey story remains a remarkable one , though . <p> And the 28-year-old , who has just led Wigan back to the Championship , is keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began 18 years ago . <p> ' I am hopeful I will get the opportunity to play for Portsmouth again , ' said Pearce . <p> ' I would love to come back with the club on a good footing and heading in the right direction not going down . <p> ' When it is your hometown club and one you hold very close to your heart , that never changes . <p> ' I have an app on my phone , so all of their results and news comes up straight away . <p> ' I keep them close and wish them all the best in the play-offs hopefully they can get promoted . <p> ' We will see what happens . ' <p> Pearce 's route from Blues youth team to first team was far from straightforward , though , with AFC Bournemouth providing a four-year stepping stone . <p> He said : ' I was at Portsmouth as a schoolboy from the age of 10 . <p> ' As a kid you just want to be a footballer , so to go through the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' I actually got released at 14 but a year later they brought me back . <p> ' Getting my YTS was a massive deal at the time that is the first step on the football ladder . <p> ' Then when I turned pro the club were in the Premier League and Harry Redknapp was manager . <p> ' I remember when I signed my contract , Harry called me into one of the changing rooms and said he had Bournemouth wanting to take me on loan and that it would be a great experience to get out and play some games . <p> ' I listened to him and in the end it turned out to be a permanent move , so I was really grateful . ' <p> As was the case with so many others , Pearce was unable to make the step up from Pompey youth team to first team under Redknapp , with the lower-league Cherries offering him a route into the senior ranks . <p> But with the Blues dropping into the Championship four years later , a reunion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not resist . <p> He said : ' I had a couple of options where I could go but as soon as I knew Portsmouth were interested , I genuinely wanted to make that move happen , <p> ' And I made sure it did in the end , so I was absolutely delighted . <p> ' To get an opportunity to play in the first team as a homegrown player , especially with those fans , was brilliant . <p> ' I did n't feel I had a point to prove , I just wanted to show people at the club what I could do . <p> ' And as with a lot of players who come through the youth system at a club , all of the fans wanted me to do well -- that is the feeling I got as soon as I arrived at Portsmouth . ' <p> A dream return , though , quickly threatened to become a nightmare as Pompey were plunged into administration , with owners Sports Initiatives unable to pay the bills at Fratton Park . <p> Having experienced similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the challenging time ahead . <p> He said : ' Sadly , it is part and parcel of football . <p> ' I had been through adminstration twice with Bournemouth so I knew what that was all about . <p> ' But at the time we had some big hitters who had n't experienced that and did n't want to drop their money . <p> ' For the best of the club , myself and Wardy ( Joel Ward ) were happy to take drops , as we did n't want to see Portsmouth go under . <p> ' We did the best we could to keep them in the league but obviously it was n't to be in the end . ' <p> A 10-point deduction ultimately did for Michael Appleton 's Blues side but only after they had thwarted Southampton 's title challenge , by holding their high-flying neighbours to draws in both south-coast derby fixtures including a 2-2 thriller at St ? Mary 's . <p> For Pearce , that was a highlight of his all-too-brief stay . <p> He said : ' As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the atmosphere that comes with them . <p> ' To play in one was amazing we were actually undefeated in both of our south-coast derbies that year . <p> ' It was a really good achievement from the boys , although it would have been nice to get one over on our rivals . <p> ' I will never forget that game at St Mary 's . <p> ' I am close with David Norris now and we met up the other day and actually spoke about that goal . <p> ' It is fair to say it is one of the highlights of his career it was a great goal . <p> While the club struggled in trying circumstances , Pearce excelled to the point he was handed the captain 's armband when regular skipper Liam Lawrence was loaned to Cardiff in a money-saving move . <p> The coveted Pompey player-of-the-season trophy followed but the financial turmoil surrounding the club brought with it a 10-point deduction and relegation to League One . <p> Pearce said : ' To be made captain was a massive privilege . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to wear the armband I was never going to turn that down . <p> ' It also meant everything to play a whole season for my hometown club . <p> ' And to get rewarded with the fans saying I was the best player was a huge achievement . I will never forget that . <p> ' The only regret I have is the points deduction if we had n't been deducted 10 points we would have stayed up , that 's a fact . <p> ' It 's sad it was purely administration and off-the-field problems that did for us . ' <p> With a summer clear out crucial to keep the club who had been issued a winding up petition by HMRC for more than ? in unpaid taxes -- afloat , Pearce was given no choice but to say an emotional goodbye to the Blues for a second time . <p> While others dug their heels in over unpaid wages , he put the club first and signed for Leeds . <p> Pearce added : ' I signed a three-year deal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the club had to sell me . <p> ' They needed money to keep afloat and to me that was the most important thing . <p> ' To help make sure Portsmouth stayed in existence and carried on going , I had to make the move . ' <p> With the Blues now a club on the up , the Fratton faithful will no doubt be hoping Pearce and Pompey can strike it third-time lucky in the future . <h> Search called off

 hurt never stopped me dreaming <h> MARK ACHESON <p> It might not be quite long enough for a Lightning Seeds lyric , but after 23 years of hurt I 'm more than ready for redemption from play-off pain . <p> Like any Pompey fan of a certain vintage , ahead of the two-leg clash with Plymouth Argyle my mind is going back to the last and , before now , only time we 've made the play-offs . <p> And I hope beyond hope that this time it 'll be a different story to 1993 when a team that just a few weeks earlier had seemed destined for automatic promotion to the infant Premier League instead were brought crashing down to earth by Leicester City ( whatever happened to them ? ) <p> I 'm absolutely confident as Pompey go into the Fratton Park semi-final first leg against Plymouth tonight - far more so than I was when I joined 5,000 or so other fans on the trip to the East Midlands on May 16 , 1993 . <p> We were n't off to Leicester - the old Filbert Street ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead the match against the Foxes was played at the inappropriately City Ground , home of Nottingham Forest . <p> Pompey were only there because of the infamous 4-1 implosion at Sunderland and Swindon 's rolling over that gave West Ham the promotion edge . <h> For all they huffed and puffed , Pompey could n't quite blow the Foxes down <p> To me , it seemed there was as much trepidation as expectation among the travelling fans as the match began . Guy Whittingham seemed slightly less sharp than the razor-like level he 'd been at all season ( albeit Walshie made a dynamic contribution , how on earth the record-breaking 42 league goals haul did n't earn ' Corporal Punishment ' the player of the year award is still beyond me ) but with only four minutes to go , Leicester had n't offered much either and we looked set up for the second leg . <p> Enter substitute Julian Joachim - at a fair rate of knots - and all that was undone in a flash . Joachim , in many ways a player from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore down towards the end at which Pompey 's supporters were massed , defenders trailing in his wake . <p> The result was inevitable , and Pompey faced a 1-0 deficit going into the deciding leg . <p> There were more than 25,000 in Fratton Park that night , and they made a tremendous din . <p> But for all they huffed and puffed , Pompey could n't quite blow the Foxes down . <p> Alan McLoughlin did level the aggregate score shortly after the break , before Ian Ormondroyd equalised with THAT goal . <p> More than two decades on , estimates from those in the ground as to quite how far offside the lanky striker was seem to vary between six feet and six yards . <p> I do n't think we can moan - to me , part of the thrill of football is the ups-and-downs lottery provided by officials who mostly but not always get it right . <p> Pompey will have enjoyed many goals over the years that should not have stood - it 's just a pity that one that went against us came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily knock the stuffing out of Pompey , and the crowd . Before we knew it Steve Thompson had put the visitors ahead and , despite Benny Kristensen 's booming equaliser at the Fratton End 18 minutes from time , the season which for so long had promised so much for Pompey came to a stuttering and sorry stop . <p> Looking back , it seemed somehow written in the stars . Pompey had done so well for most of the campaign that the late downer of failing to seal automatic promotion somehow made us feel on the back foot . <p> Fast forward 23 years , and I 'd say that the atmosphere is altogether rosier . Okay , we did n't get the automatic promotion which many had predicted , but we ended the season with a string of good battling performances ( including that fateful home match against Plymouth which on any other day we would have won ) . <p> So I for one am going into these play-offs in far more optimistic mood than in 1993. <h> 9 comments <p>

Picture : David Pearce <h> Pippa Field <p> Lauren Steadman has medals on the mind as the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games draw ever closer . <p> But the reigning world and European champion admits claiming gold wo n't be as easy as the statistics perhaps suggest . <p> With her third Games on the horizon , the 23-year-old who competed in swimming at the Beijing and London Paralympics is widely tipped to bring home the gold medal after winning the European title for the fourth successive year in May . <p> Add to that the world title she claimed last September and it 's easy to see why the University of Portsmouth graduate is the favourite . <p> But as the excitement continues to bubble , Steadman insists she is determined to succeed to thank those who have helped her on her journey to Rio . <p> ' I 'm definitely excited , ' she said . <p> ' It was really good to get the automatic selection so early on in the season and it 's just a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Rio . <p> ' The Paralympics for me have changed over the course of the three Games . <p> ' I first went when I was 15 so it was very exciting but a bit daunting and then going into London I was a bit more experienced . <p> ' Going into Rio , my priorities have changed because I 'm going in as world number one . <p> ' So it 's a case of trying to stay ahead of the rest of the world to bring home that medal . <p> ' Paratriathlon makes its debut at Rio and if all goes well and we have a successful Team GB , it definitely looks good for the future of the sport . <p> ' I 'd like to think I have moved the standard of the GB women forward . <p> ' The rest of the world sees me as favourite because I have such a lead at the moment but I 'm aware every other girl is trying to beat me so I 'm expecting quite tough competition in Rio . A lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not just me racing as the athlete . <p> ' It would be fantastic to bring home that gold medal , especially a Paralympic medal , for the country . <p> ' I 'm doing it as much for everyone else who has belief in me as myself . ' <p> While Steadman prepares to pull on the Great Britain colours in Brazil in September , another strip she frequently adorns is the purple of her university . <p> Over 60 per cent of gold medallists since 1992 have participated in BUCS sport , with 56 members of Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics competing for Great Britain at the World University Games . <p> And for Steadman , who completed a psychology degree before starting her business masters , the guidance she received from her university and BUCS was pivotal . <p> ' I represented Portsmouth not at triathlon but in cross-country and I did a bit of swimming for them as well , ' she said . <p> ' I think BUCS has a fantastic atmosphere and it 's great to see all the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' I definitely think competing at university has helped me get to the level I am racing at now . <p> ' Racing at university level is just as daunting as racing for your country . <p> ' I 'm always proud to represent Portsmouth and I believe everyone else is when they represent their university .

 France using their three days ' extra rest to take advantage of Ireland 's tiring minds and limbs . <p> It was a similar scenario for England . Seven days on from a final group game where Hodgson had gambled and lost with six changes against Slovakia , they faced an Iceland side with two days ' less preparation time . <p> Taking on a team who have built their Euro success on perspiration over inspiration , the challenge was to tire the opponent and take advantage of the gaps when they appeared . <p> A fourth-minute opener even meant they were given the perfect platform with Iceland forced to open up . That they did , though , with their leveller 34 seconds after the restart . <p> From there , we witnessed the Three Lions ' descent into madness . <p> Heads spun , eyes glazed and frenzied glares were dished out as panic set in . <p> And all of this from players , we are told , operating in the best league in the world every week . <p> That did n't stop the Premier League megastars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorably to its inevitable conclusion . <p> Yes , lump it forward and hope for the best is still alive and well . So the rest of Europe guffawed and gave knowing looks as we found ourselves out of the for the second time in four days . <p> That is where the shift in landscape may just provide the changes the game here needs . <p> Divorcing the EU is set to prompt moves in employment law which are likely to have a big impact on English football . <p> And Pompey chief executive Catlin had some very interesting views on the subject in the Sports Mail last weekend . <p> Under the current system there is freedom of movement to allow EU players to gain deals without a complex work permit process . <p> That , many feel , could now change to reflect the scenario where non-EU players have to play a percentage of their country 's games indexed to their Fifa ranking . <p> A report earlier this year ? indicated 332 players in the top two English leagues and Scottish top flight would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just 23 of the 180 non-British EU players in the Championship would qualify . <p> These figures in the wake of Brexit are being viewed as apocalyptic by many . <p> But maybe it 's this end-of-days scenario which will finally help us change the culture of English football for the best . <h> Newcastle United closing 
 of Pompey 's rich history <h> Pompey legend Alan Knight <h> Neil Allen <p> Jimmy Dickinson 's widow penned a letter of congratulations , while the wife of the late Jack Froggatt phoned to convey gushing praise . <p> The outstanding achievements of their legendary husbands embodied in print for future generations of Pompey supporters to pore over . <p> It has now been 15 years since the launch of Roger Holmes ' highly-regarded Pompey Players 1920-2001 . <p> The hardback book , with its striking white cover , remains an essential reference to the glorious past and is a familiar resident in the homes of many of the Fratton faithful . <p> Holmes ' own Pompey story began in October 1965 , when taken by his dad and two grandfathers to what would be the club 's first-ever encounter with Carlisle . <p> These days the South Stand season-ticket holder sits on the club 's Hall of Fame panel and serves as a committee member of the Pompey Former Players ' Association . <p> His interest in the Blues ' history remains undiminished and this month has signalled his latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56-year-old has painstakingly compiled results , line-ups and abridged match reports for every Pompey game since their August 1920 arrival into the Football League . <p> With individual booklets focusing on each campaign , it 's a collection which spans to the culmination of last season under Paul Cook . <p> For Holmes , the labour of love now sits proudly alongside his other Pompey publications . <p> He said : ' I owe a lot to my grandfather , Gordon . He really sowed the seed and I think would be quite pleased if he saw these , especially the reproduction of those matches in the 1920s and 30s he would often tell me about . <p> ' He was known as Sigger , knew more about football than anyone I have ever met and was really steeped in the club . It is down to him why I have always been interested in Pompey 's history . <p> ' He bought me my first season ticket in 1968 , it cost ? 10 and I wondered where he got the money from ! <p> ' Still , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't do anything about it with him around . <p> ' I knew Montgomery was Pompey 's president before I knew he was something to do with the Second World War and had been told how someone in the crowd once had a go at Billy Haines so he gave the ball to them and said " come on here , you go and show us " . <p> ' My gran would say to my granddad " do n't fill his head with all that rubbish " ! <p> ' And whenever he saw an old player in the stands he used to take me over to speak to him , so I met a lot of them . <p> ' I remember him speaking to this old man stood in a bus queue after a game . We then sat with him during the journey to the Hard . It was Jimmy Easson , one of only eight players to have scored more than 100 league goals for us . <p> ' Even after my granddad died , when I was 12 , I remember recognising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me several times before . " I am an old man now , son " he told me when I went over for a chat . <p> ' Yet from an early age I wondered why there was n't a Pompey book about all these players ? So I decided to start work on one , although after a while stopped when it struck me " who is going to read this ? " <p> ' But by 2001 it was written and in the shops , doing very well , with a print run of 5,000 all sold . Jack Froggatt 's widow phoned to say she could n't put it down . Mrs Dickinson also wrote a letter and I thought " I ca n't do much better than this " . <p> ' So I had written one book on the players now I have produced one on the matches . ' <p> Holmes ' exhaustive research consisted of delving into a vast personal collection of The News and Sports Mail . <p> Such is their number , stretching back to pre-Second World War , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editions of the paper . <p> The facts really have been at his fingertips . <p> Holmes added : ' I have n't had to leave the house to carry out my research , everything is in a room I can just about get into ! <p> ' I have practically every Football Mail since the war . I am probably about 60 missing , which sounds a lot but that is fewer than one a season . <p> ' I also have photocopies of the reports from pre-war editions , obtained through visiting the British Library in London . <p> ' In addition , since the age of 11 I have cut out everything to do with Pompey from The News and Sports Mail and put them into scrapbooks . <p> ' There is a little bit missing in the mid-90s , but from 1971 until the present day I have nearly everything ever written . <p> ' Although , these days I do n't keep them as scrapbooks . Instead , I slip the pages into A5 binders , with each binder covering six months , which saves @ @ @@@14053644 <p> Makarova , ranked 
 Cuts and bumps are all part of growing up <h> Running in the playground has been banned in Cornwall <h> Warren Hayden <p> Primary school outlaws running in the playground ' . This was the headline last week from an article on the Mail Online website . <p> This kind of story seems to be a regular occurrence and it feels I 'm reading them more frequently . <p> I 'm surprised , now we 're into autumn , I have n't seen an article about the great British game of conkers being banned from school playgrounds , another hardy perennial at this time of year . <p> Then we move to Christmas and there will probably be a story about a school banning Christmas in case it offends children and parents who do n't celebrate the Christian festival . <p> Then , if it snows , there will inevitably be a story about snowballs being banned for health and safety reasons . It is all becoming far too predictable . <p> So what about this recent story about running in the playground being outlawed ? Was it true ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears it is . <p> The Cornwall primary school , according to the article , brought in the ban after children often ended up needing first aid . <p> Instead the children were being encouraged to play in sand or join the choir at break time . <p> The article goes on to say parents have condemned the school for using health and safety as an excuse to remove the freedom to spontaneously run in the playground . <p> Since the ban the school has reported a 30 per cent drop in first aid incidents and an 80 per cent drop in bad behaviour . <p> So with these results , surely this is a good thing ? I do n't think so . <p> Thinking back to when I was in my Portsmouth primary school , I remember having a plaster applied to my bloodied and grazed knee because I fell over after running across the playground and losing my footing . <p> I also remember having a bump to my head after my friend and I ran into each other . But these incidents taught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more careful . <p> My daughters sometimes come home from school with exactly the same injuries as I suffered thanks to a fall in the playground or a head bump with a friend and I 'm pretty certain their children will too one day and so will their children . <p> As an adult , running only usually happens as a form of exercise or when you see your train about to leave the station . <p> For children , running is n't a chore and it 's exercise without feeling like it . <p> So I 'll encourage my daughters to run and when they get injured I 'll be there to help and comfort them . But I 'll encourage them to keep running with the advice to look where they are going . <p> Poole bridges the generation gap <p> As an after-school treat , we decided to take the girls to the Pyramids at Southsea . <p> It 's always a pleasure going there , mainly because of the memories it brings back from when I was a child . Most Saturday afternoons in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and green flumes , it still has the klaxon that signals the wave machine is about to kick in , and you still need a pound coin for the lockers . <p> I 've mentioned before in this column about my memories and I 've recalled that my favourite part of the swimming centre was the Sidewinder flume . <p> I 'd visited with the kids a few times in the past few years , but this ' ride ' was never open . I do n't know why . <p> But I was pleased that this time it was , and my daughter Caitlin loved it . <p> And predictably she had more than one go . <p> It is still a place perfect for children to have fun just like it was 20 years ago and I think I still enjoy the place just as much as they do . <h> David Davis 's 
 <p> Since the release of the documentary Blackfish the perils orcas face when held in captivity have become known to millions . <p> The killer whales are creatures who need lots of space . They need to be a part of complex social groups , to be able to hunt , and so , so much more . <p> SeaWorld came under fire as a result of so many people seeing the documentary and lost lots of fans and customers . <p> I could sit here all day and tell you how horrible this poor orca 's life was , how he was trapped in a small pool , how he became depressed and at times aggressive because of stress , and about his collapsed dorsal fin and broken down teeth -- but that does n't matter now . <p> What does is this : the death of Tilikum , who featured in Blackfish , left SeaWorld with no choice but to announce that on the Sunday just gone , they would hold their last ever killer whale show . <p> This is great really it is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of cruelty and captivity for orcas , because it 's not . <p> The shows will end , but SeaWorld has already said they will be replaced by a new experience called Orca Encounter . <p> This new attraction aims to give visitors a more educational experience about orcas and their lives , how they interact with humans , and so on , but will still see the creatures jumping out of the water and responding to trainers . <p> The organisation wants to be able to demonstrate behaviour people would see in the wild with the killer whales , and their abilities as a top predator in the sea . <p> Except we humans would n't see that behaviour would we ? Because in the wild orcas are where they belong , not surrounded by people or tanks . <p> As of today there are 55 orcas in captivity in different parks around the world . Tilikum 's fight is over , but we still have a long way to go . I hope SeaWorld 's end-of-show announcement does n't make anyone think otherwise .
