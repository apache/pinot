In other situations , students simply make a poor decision . Here are some suggestions on how to avoid academic dishonesty : <p> Read the syllabus carefully . Seek clarification from your instructors regarding class policies ; whenever expectations about an assignment are unclear , do not rely on other students for information . <p> Always assume that you are expected to complete assignments independently unless your instructors indicate otherwise . Clarify what is expected of you when you are working on a group project . <p> Do n't wait until the night before to begin an assignment .

Cover your answers and distance yourself from others to reduce the temptation to look . Also , to avoid the impression of cheating , do n't look into your bag or use your cell phone during an exam .

Luther College 's mission statement calls us to " embrace diversity and challenge one another to learn in community , " and to be " enlivened and transformed by encounters with one another , by the exchange of ideas , and by the life of faith and learning . " Alumni , faculty , staff , students and friends of the college are encouraged to express their views , model " good disagreement " and engage in respectful dialogue . <p> Search : <p> October 6 , 2014 <p> In Paideia 111 we just finished a lively discussion of Mary Shelley 's great novel " Frankenstein . " The central question in the course is " What does it mean to be human ? " Shelley 's novel helps us think about that question by asking us to consider in what ways the Creature is human , and it what ways he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Frankenstein " not whether he is human or not ( he is ) , but in what ways does he forego important parts of his humanity , like responsibility and compassion . <p> After Victor Frankenstein creates the Creature , he pretty much leaves him on his own . Worse , he berates the Creature , calling him " Devil " and " Abhorred monster . " Rebuked as well by others , the Creature then kills Frankenstein 's younger brother . When Frankenstein and the Creature meet again , the Creature demands that Frankenstein create a female for him . " I am malicious because I am miserable , " he tells him . " What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate ; I demand a creature of another sex , but as hideous as myself : the gratification is small , but it is all that I can receive , and it shall content me . " The Creature then promises that he and his companion will run off to South America . <p> What would you do if you were Victor Frankenstein ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I posed this question in class and asked the students to write about it . The class was almost equally divided , with 10 students saying they would be willing to create the she-creature ( some with conditions attached ) , and the other eight saying no way ! In our discussion we got at some of the reasons on each side . <p> Those who said yes trusted that the Creature would be true to his word when he said he would take his she-companion to South America where , as one student put it , " He would be out of my hair . " Several felt that Frankenstein owed it to the Creature to create a companion for him , given the miserable and lonely life he 'd given him so far . One student saw the Creature 's violence as persuasive : " He 's already killed once . . . I better give him what he wants . " Most , though , were n't worried about repercussions , especially since most of these students said Frankenstein should create the she-creature without a uterus so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As one student wrote : " Fertility was n't included in the agreement , and after all , the devil is in the details . " <p> Those who said no argued that the risks outweighed the rewards . " Why create a second one that could potentially cause even more problems ? " one student asked . And even if the she-creature were created without a uterus , she would " freak out when she realizes she ca n't bear children . " Several students noted that there was no guarantee the Creature and his new she-creature would even like each other . As one wrote , if the she-Creature is repulsed by the Creature , " he would be more sad and lonely than he was before . " Some students simply said you do n't solve one problem by quite literally creating another . One student challenged the idea the Creature could be trusted , and one even suggested that Frankenstein create the she-creature with a bomb attached to her that would blow up both creatures ! ( Needless to say , this did not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frankenstein started to create a she-creature then aborted her " right in front of the Creature . The Creature exacted his revenge " just how , you can read on your own . <p> This discussion really got students talking and invested in defending and perhaps rethinking their ideas . This is what Paideia can do at its best . We moved from writing to discussion and into analysis , and students will now carry on the conversation in their second paper of the semester . They are to write on " Frankenstein , " developing a thesis either on what they think Mary Shelley sees as an essential human trait in the novel , or on who bears more responsibility for what goes wrong in the story " Victor Frankenstein or his creation . <p> " What does it mean to be human ?

@@1543245 <h> A Brief Introduction to DDD <p> If you 've ever written a program , then unless it was trivial , you also had to debug it . Linux includes several debuggers in their distributions . However , they are all command-line debuggers which are n't very nice to use . Thankfully , the DDD ( DataDisplay Debugger ) is a front-end to all of these debuggers . To use DDD you must compile your code with debug information included . In C++ that means you should include the -g option on the g++ compile command . If you 've never run DDD before , you may have to tell DDD to use the gdb debugger and not the dbx debugger . To do this you type " ddd --gdb " at the command-line prompt . You only have to do this once . Then you can quit DDD and when you run it later it will automatically use the gdb debugger . Subsequently , to run DDD you type " ddd prog " where prog is the name of your program . When you do this , a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows you the source code of the program . You can do the normal things you do in a debugger . You can : <p> Set breakpoints by right clicking on a source line and selecting " Set Breakpoint " . <p> Run your program by selecting Program-&gt;Run ... , which will let you provide command-line arguments to your program . If your program does n't need command-line arguments , or your running your program more than once in the same debugging session , you can click on the Run button in the DDD sub-window that 's shown to the right . This sub-window gives you quick access to commonly used functions . <p> Step over lines of code in your program using the " Program-&gt;Next " menu item . " Next " jumps over function calls . <p> Step into lines of code in your program using the " Program-&gt;Step " menu item . " Step " steps into function calls . <p> Examine the run-time stack and any activation record on the stack using the " Status-&gt;Backtrace ... " menu item . <p> Many other options as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to examine variables . To do this you highlight a variable in your code and click the Display button on the toolbar . The window will split and show the variable at the top of the screen . The split screen can be adjusted by dragging the small square that appears between the code frame and data frame at the far right-handside of the window . If your data contains pointers , you can doubleclick on the pointer to display the data that it points to . <p> Finally , if you are getting a segmentation fault ( a pretty common occurrence ) when running your program , you can just run the program ( no fear of hanging Linux like MS Windows ) in the debugger and it will show you the line that the segfault occurred on . You can use the " Status-&gt;Backtrace ... " menu option to trace back through the run-time stack and examine variables to see what caused the segfault . <h> Debugging Java Programs <p> DDD automatically detects Java programs and serves as a front-end for the jdb debugger , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debug a Java program by typing " ddd file.class " where file.class is the name of your Java class file .

There is no simple formula for determining risk of imminent violence . And it is not the role of faculty , staff , or students to assess risk of violence . It is your role to pay attention to warning signs and to report them to appropriate college staff . However , the presence of any of the following key factors suggests that violence may be imminent and you should report the situation immediately : <p> The person has a major unresolved grievance or grudge and sees no alternatives to resolving it except by violence . <p> The person has made communications suggesting ideas or intent to attack . <p> The person has shown inappropriate interest in attacks , attackers , or weapons . <p> The person has engaged in attack-related behaviors , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing access to potential targets , or rehearsing an attack . <p> The person appears to have the means and ability to carry out an attack plan . <p> The person is experiencing hopelessness , desperation , and despair . <p> The person sees violence as the acceptable , desirable , or only way to solve problems . <p> **This information was drawn from material presented by Gene Deisinger , Ph.D. , Associate Director of Public Safety and Deputy Chief of Police , Iowa State University Police Division , at Luther College on October 29 , 2008. 
@@1543256 <h> Using Python <p> In this lesson we learn about the accumulator pattern for counting things in Python . <p> By using a for loop in our code we can repeat some section of code as often as we like . <p> The general form of a for loop is : <p> for &lt;id&gt; in &lt;seq&gt; : <p> &lt;body&gt; <p> Using a for loop we execute the body of the for loop once for each element of the sequence . The i 'd is assigned to the first element of the sequence the first time the body is executed . Then i 'd is assigned the second element the second time the body is executed , and so on . <p> This example counts using the accumulator pattern . In this pattern we start with a counter equal to zero . In this case the counter is called count . Then each time we find something we want to count we add one more to count . <p> When you see <p> count = count + 1 <p> you should not read it as algebra . Read it from right to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then store the result back in count . <h> Counting in Python <p> In some problems we need to count . Consider this problem . <p> The positive three-digit integer N has a ones digit of 0 . What is the probability that N is divisible by 4 ? Express your answer as a common fraction . <p> To solve this problem we could try the first three digit number ( i.e. 100 ) and find that it is divisble by 4 . Then we could try 110 , 120 , 130 , and so on . Or , we could write some Python code to do this for us . <p> To do this without too much work we will want to use a loop . A loop repeats some Python code for us so we do n't have to keep writing the same thing over and over again . In this case we want to check to see if numbers are divisible by 4 over and over again and we want to count how many are divisible by 4 . <p> We need to know three things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a list of all 3-digit numbers whose ones digit is 0 . This can be done with the range function in Python . If we write range(100,1000,10) we get a list of 100 , 110 , 120 , 130 , ... , 990 . You can try range(100,1000,10) in the Python Shell to see this really works . Lists are powerful structures in Python . We can use lists for all sorts of information . <p> Next , we need to see if a number is divisible by 4 . We can use an if statement to do this . <p> if N % 4 == 0 : <p> count = count + 1 <p> This statement says to add one to count if N is divisible by 4 . A number is divisble by 4 if the remainder after dividing by 4 is zero . N%4==0 asks if dividing N by 4 results in a 0 remainder . <p> Finally , we can write a for loop to use the list to check all the the possible values of N and see if they are divisible by 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This starts us counting so that every time we find another three digit number with a zero ones digit that is divisible by 4 we can add one more to count . After the loop is done , we can print the total we found for count . Notice that indentation makes a difference . The code indented under the for loop is the code that is " in " the for loop . The print statements are " after " the for loop .

How did my professional focus move from there to here ? As I sat down to contemplate that question , I came to the conclusion that it was actually not such a big move , because these " two worlds " are not so very far apart after all . <p> In 2015 I published a monograph titled , " Pragmatic Toleration : The Politics of Religious Heterodoxy in Early Reformation Antwerp , 1515-1555 . " The book was the culmination of research that started 15 years ago on the Reformation in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium . What I discovered as I dug through the archives there , was that religious tolerance and coexistence did n't come about because any ivory-tower intellectuals or wealthy lawyers told people that it should . Rather , I found individual people with different religious beliefs , who learned how to " get along " because they had no choice . The residents of 16th-century Antwerp found themselves in the same place , needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generally coexist with as little disruption to life as possible . And it was in that situation , in every act of individual cooperation , that the seeds of " toleration " were sown . <p> Fast-forward 500 years , and we are still trying to figure out whom we want to live with and whom we ca n't abide . We 've not moved very far on the religious tolerance front either really , although the " enemies " have different names these days , and our purview has broadened . But the questions that we ask ourselves as we decide whom to room with , or whom to date , or which neighborhood to move into , are remarkably analogous to those that early moderns asked as they faced the exact same questions . <p> It is then , perhaps no surprise that Ralston Deffenbaugh will be one of the keynote speakers at Luther College 's Liberating Grace conference ( March 31-April 1 ) , as part of our commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation .

On April 5 , the CEPE will host Social Work professor , Susan Schmidt and human rights lawyer , Yer Vang , to discuss their work here in the Midwest with undocumented , unaccompanied minors traveling from Mexico and Central America . One week later , Dr. Benjamin Stoltenburg , who teaches language and culture classes to asylum seekers in Germany , will give a public lecture about his work .

In our modern world too , we find ourselves surrounded by diversity of all sorts , and hostilities that are sometimes overt and sometimes less easy to detect . And yet the challenges of both worlds remain strikingly similar . As we mark the 500 years that separate us from the people in my book , I wonder how far we have really come in that vast amount of time . Should n't we , by now have developed some new questions to ask regarding our neighbors ? Perhaps our call is not to decide whom we are willing to " tolerate , " but rather , who needs our help and how can we best deliver it ?

" Alumni , faculty , staff , students and friends of the college are encouraged to express their views , model " good disagreement " and engage in respectful dialogue . <p> Search : <p> By Andrew Last <p> March 29 , 2017 <p> My teacher , my mentor , my friend Weston H. Noble passed away in December . Since then tributes celebrating his career and legacy at Luther College have appeared in magazines , journals , newspapers and countless websites . Anyone that knew Mr. Noble also had a favorite musical moment singing Messiah at Luther , hearing the Nordic Choir under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festivals . <p> I , too , have my favorite musical memories of Mr. Noble . I treasure them as priceless possessions that you only bring out and share with your dearest friends . He is without a doubt the greatest choral influence in my life . Therefore , it may surprise you that the remainder of this post will have nothing to do with Weston Noble the musician . <p> Since returning to Luther as a faculty member in the fall of 2012 , my relationship with Mr. Noble changed . He began treating me as a colleague , a friend and his current connection to the Luther music department . I was humbled by this new relationship . Those days when my phone would ring and he 'd say , " I have an idea " were the most thrilling and daunting phone conversations to receive . Thrilling because hearing his voice on the phone immediately transported me back to high school and receiving his recruiting call just as my family would sit down for dinner . Daunting because after a high school choral event on campus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were planning on writing handwritten notes to all two hundred and fifty singers in the choir . " ( hint , hint ) I always did just as he suggested . <p> Yet , this is n't about remembering Mr. Noble for his invaluable leadership at Luther College , his brilliant conducting career or even about his legacy through scholarships , facilities and fundraising campaigns . I want to share some lessons that Mr. Noble taught me over the last couple of years of his life . <p> Humor . This man who truly became a legend in his profession also had an unbelievable quick wit . I 'm reminded of a time that he was recovering in the nursing home . His body was weak and his speech was regaining its fluidity . Yet , his mind was really very good . I had stopped to visit him one day in the afternoon . He was n't able to get out of bed and even propping up his body in bed was not terribly comfortable . Yet , he wanted to have a conversation , not just me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were able to sit him at an angle and have an active conversation . During our visit , a nurse 's aid stopped in to ask if he 'd be interested in a snack . He quietly asked , " What do you have ? " She proceeded to list off items such as yogurt , a banana , applesauce and other healthy items . After not being able to hear her reciting the list twice , I spoke up and said , " I know he loves applesauce . " She smiled and reached for a container of the applesauce and a spoon and placed it on a tray near his bed . His quiet voice asked the nurse 's aid , " do you think you could feed this to me ? " Thinking he was still rather uncomfortable , this kind young woman smiled and said , " absolutely . " She reached for the container and spoon and began scooping out the first bite . Mr. Noble cocked his head toward me and gave me a crooked grin and a wink of the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding letters and cards he 'd received so I questioned why he had asked for this assistance , but that wink and a grin to me quickly reminded me that his sense of humor and devilish charm were just fine . <p> Memory . For those who sang for Mr. Noble , we were constantly aware of his incredible memory . In his older age , he may not always catch your name but he rarely missed a hometown . Up until four months ago , he was able to tell me more about my senior year Nordic Choir tour to Russia than I could possibly recall . When I began my teaching career nearly twenty years back , I learned very quickly the power of recalling the simple facts about students that made them feel oh-so-special . Let 's just say I 'm still a work in progress in this area . Just before Christmas of 2015 , Mr. Noble had a stroke that placed him in urgent care in the hospital . He struggled with his words , recalling words , putting words together and the spoken word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his bedside as he recovered . I visited him Christmas Eve in the afternoon and found him to be awake and alert , but frustrated with communication . I patiently listened , not able to understand most of what he was trying to express . I needed to run some errands , so I left and promised to return later that evening . When I did , I found him sleeping comfortably . I pulled up a chair and began checking email on my phone and finding contentment at just spending time with him that Christmas Eve . After I had been there for almost an hour , I heard this familiar voice clear as day speaking , " Weston Noble was born in 1922 in the town of Riceville , Iowa . " I looked over at the bed and here was Mr. Noble deep in sleep reciting his biography as clear as day . Not a struggle for words , not a struggle for memory , not a struggle for clarity . He continued for about sixty seconds before waking himself . He looked at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello " or maybe " Merry Christmas " and the best he could do was stutter incoherently . It did n't matter to me . After that little miracle , I knew he 'd once again recover . <p> Diligence . My final lesson from Mr. Noble is something I 'd already learned from him many years ago . Yet , he reminded me of it just a few days before he passed away . I had gone to the nursing home to visit . I entered his room , he was dressed to the nines in his pressed pants and shirt and was enjoying some of the Christmas cards he 'd recently received . He was about as clear and articulate as I had seen him in months and he greeted me with a smile and a request for a hug . We sat and chatted for a few minutes before the activities director walked in and said , " Weston , the Decorah High School Band will be playing Christmas Carols in the cafeteria shortly if you 'd like to come . " Mr. Noble looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit had only been a few short minutes , but I knew he wanted to go . He apologetically said to me , " I 'm sorry to cut our visit short , but you and I have recruiting to do . " I laughed , he did n't ; he meant it . Recruitment for Luther did not stop when he retired ; it did n't stop when he had health issues ; and it certainly was n't going to stop after his 94th birthday . We walked to the cafeteria ; I sat next to him during the performance , and took mental notes as he and I shook the hands of as many of those high school musicians as we could . I wonder if those students knew how lucky they were that day . <p> Mr. Noble died two days later on December 21 , 2016 . I was at Hastings High School working that day . During the clinic , my phone ( which was on vibrate ) buzzed nonstop . After I finished with the clinic , the messages I received pieced the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many choral colleagues that I thought would want to know of his death from someone close to Mr. Noble rather than hearing it via social media . When I arrived home , both sad and emotionally exhausted , I noticed an unfamiliar Luther College phone number that had called approximately an hour after Mr. Noble died . They left no message but called several times . Assuming it was concerning Mr. Noble 's death , I thought no more of it until the next morning when I did some basic sleuthing online only to discover it was the Dean 's office . Shortly after that discovery , I got another call from the Dean offering me the position as the next conductor of the Nordic Choir . <p> Many have asked if Weston Noble , my teacher , my mentor and my friend knew that I was offered the position . My answer is always , " I wished I would have been able to tell him face to face . " It always makes me feel better when people firmly respond with , " he knew . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student for his next adventure in life . <p> Andrew Last , Luther assistant professor of music , conducts the Collegiate Chorale and the first-year men 's ensemble , Norsemen .

@@1543294 <h> To The Luther Class of 2021 <p> Search : <p> By Cassandra Michel <p> May 16 , 2017 at 12:03 am <p> About a year I ago I was a senior in high school and overly excited to graduate and come to Luther . One day , I was looking on the Luther website and I found the student blogs , like the one you are reading now . I read through a lot of the blogs and it made me even more excited to attend Luther . One blog post was a letter addressed to the Luther College class of 2020 , and it has stuck in my mind ever since . I want to write a similiar post : my letter to the class of 2021 , so here it is : <p> To the Luther College Class of 2021 , <p> I am so excited to see you around campus next year . Some of you ( like me ) may be super excited to pack your belongings in a car and move into a small dorm room . Others may be nervous , scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , I still had some anxiety . I worried about if I would get along with my roommate , if I would make friends , how hard my classes would be , and if I would fail . None of my worst-case scenarios ever happened , nothing came close . From changing my major to questioning what I know to be true , Luther has challenged me in ways I could not have imagined . I am so thankful for these challenges because they have made me the person I am today . While I have been at Luther I have been happier than I can remember being in high school , but there have also been days when it has not been easy and I have wanted to give up and go home . I am so glad that I pushed through and stayed at Luther because now I have more friends than I ever dreamed of . I have grown so close to so many people in such a short amount of time . Normally it takes me awhile to get to know someone and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at lightning speed . <p> My biggest piece of advice to you is to be yourself . When you are yourself and you let people see who you are , you connect with them faster . You connect with them on a deeper level and make more meaningful friendships . Being yourself means being honest , and honesty goes a long way in making a roommate relationship work . The Luther community is diverse and accepting and you can find people similar to you if you let us see who you are . All of my closest friendships at Luther formed because I was myself around people I did not know very well . Being your complete self is a freeing and beautiful experience . <p> I can not wait to see what talents and personalities your class brings to the Luther community . Even though coming to college and being on your own can be scary ( and expensive ) , the education and experiences you gain are worth it . It is scary to be yourself , especially around people you have never met , but the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most is that I have been myself through every moment . I 'm looking forward to seeing all of you in the fall ! <p> With Love , <p> Cassie <p> This is a picture I took when on campus for ROAD in the summer of 2016 as I was preparing to come to Luther . ROAD days take place during the summer and help Luther students with registration , orientation , and advising . There are also opportunities to meet your new classmates and socialize with them . I even met my roommate for the first time at ROAD ( although we did not know that we would be roommates ) .

Tombs give archaeologists volumes of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived and died , what diseases they suffered , what handicaps they endured . The tomb goods hint at the funerary rituals they practiced , the kind of afterlife they expected and their relative wealth . The tombs themselves , whether small or large , stone or earthen , suggest the level of construction technology . And the inscriptions on the tombs inform us of their names , value systems , gods and goddesses , and what kind of impression they wished to leave on those who visited their tombs . Think of the hoary tombs in the Valley of the Kings ( like that of King Tutankhamun in Fig. 1 ) , or the burial mound of Philip II ( King of Macedon and father of Alexander the Great ) at Vergina , or that of the emperor Augustus in Rome . Even one of the seven wonders of the ancient world " the famous Mausoleum of Halicarnassus " was a colossal tomb dedicated to the Carian ruler Mausolus . Without these tombs and the myriad smaller tombs scattered throughout the ancient world , what an enormous amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ! But at the same time we archaeologists confront an ethical dilemma . Is it right to disturb the dead ? What 's the difference between digging up an ancient Etruscan princess ( as one recently was ) and excavating the early twentieth-century grave of an Iowa farmer ? Should we not consider the wishes of the deceased and their descendants ? Is time the only thing that matters ? If so , what 's so special about time ? And how much time is required before it 's okay to unearth human remains ? Who decides ? <p> Until recently , I gave this issue little thought . During my college classes and field training the ethical issues involved with digging up tombs and bodies were never raised . If I were ever confronted with excavating an ancient or medieval tomb , I would not have hesitated . Such is the attitude today among the vast majority of archaeologists . As my interests moved into the ancient maritime world , I expected to go my whole lifetime without ever discovering human remains on shipwrecks . This is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bones ( calcium ) dissolve easily in saltwater after only a short time . In fact , of the 2,000 ancient and medieval shipwrecks recorded in the Mediterranean Sea , only a handful contained human remains ; in most cases they had been preserved owing to their deposition in anaerobic mud . This seemed about to change in 2006 , however , when I took part in one of Dr. Robert Ballard 's Black Sea expeditions off Ukraine 's Crimean coast . One of our missions that season ( aside from searching for ancient shipwrecks ) was to assist the government of Ukraine with finding the wreckage of the Soviet hospital ship Armenia , which had been sunk by a Nazi torpedo bomber during the evacuation of the Crimea early in WW II ( Fig. 2 ) . The ship sank in a matter of minutes , taking to the bottom between five and seven thousand passengers , mostly sick and wounded ; only eight people survived . It remains one of the greatest maritime disasters in history . We understood that the ship likely lay in the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen in the water . No oxygen means much fewer forms of life to consume the bodies ( namely anaerobic bacteria ) . In other words , the bodies may be well preserved on the wreck . As I helped direct the search I imagined coming upon a debris field littered with those who appeared to have died ten minutes before . Grim indeed . Despite several days trying to locate the ship , we never found her . I wonder if I would be the same today if we had . <p> But in 2011 , while we were exploring the wreck of an ancient Greek merchant ship on the other side of the deep Black Sea , we came upon skeletal material among the scattered cargo of ceramic wine containers . I sat there slack-jawed until it dawned on me : these are human remains ! Here was the victim of an ancient disaster , his ( or her ? ) bones exposed to the elements only because a very modern fishing trawler had unknowingly dragged its gear across the wreck and upended what was formerly buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with that same dilemma . Should we , or should we not , recover the bones ? Could we learn more about the daily life of ancient mariners , who are nearly historically invisible ? Would the DNA be intact ? We would never find out . When we returned to the site to recover the remains , the bones were gone , the victim of another trawling pass that scattered and destroyed nearly every artifact visible the year before . <p> These experiences shaped my thinking on the subject , so during the fall semester of last year I put the question to my Archaeology of Ancient Greece class and was surprised by the answers . Even after we had surveyed the major archaeological discoveries made in Greece over the past century and a half , even when I had shown that we would not know nearly as much about the ancient Greeks were in not for excavated tombs , and even though these Greeks had been dead for over twenty centuries , more than a third of the class thought that archaeologists should not disturb the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Knowing that the Greeks thought it i 'll to unearth the deceased , one should respect this religious ideal by not deliberately excavating graves It is not as if the fate of humanity hangs in the balance depending on the contents of the tomb . Just as archaeology is important , but not necessary , for the survival of humankind , tombs are not necessary for the advancement of the science . " <p> It was interesting to see students want to honor the wishes of the dead even when no one is left to speak for them . Indeed one senses the " Golden Rule " behind the sentiment " I 'm also uneasy at the thought that the my own bones may one day be on display for all to see . We should remember , however , that tomb robbing is actually the oldest profession . It was as lucrative in 3000 B.C. as it is in 2014 . Of all the rich pharaonic tombs in Egypt , only Tutankhamun 's remained undiscovered and unlooted before archaeologist found it . Today it 's the tombaroli or clandestini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire fields in the middle of the night digging for hidden tombs . Such groups flourish and multiply wherever there are artifacts known to be in the ground . They bribe local police to look the other way , grow rich and feed a ravenous black market for illicit antiquities . Unless tombs are protected they will soon be gone without a trace . At least archaeologists can record , preserve , and study them . At least the memory of the deceased is not totally erased . That 's the view most archaeologists advocate . Still , I wonder , would it make any difference to the dead ? And is that a question worth asking ? <p> What do you think ? Is it okay for archaeologists to excavate the deceased ? If so , under what circumstances ? If not , why not ? <p> Dan Davis , assistant professor of classics , has taught ancient Greek , Latin and classical civilization courses at Luther since 2011 .

Luther College 's mission statement calls us to " embrace diversity and challenge one another to learn in community , " and to be " enlivened and transformed by encounters with one another , by the exchange of ideas , and by the life of faith and learning . " Alumni , faculty , staff , students and friends of the college are encouraged to express their views , model " good disagreement " and engage in respectful dialogue . <p> Search : <p> By La Donna D. McGohan <p> September 29 , 2015 <p> Every year , potential employers of our nursing graduates call me . The conversations usually go something like this : " One of your students is applying at our hospital . Luther College is a liberal arts school . What does that mean ? Are they the same as any other graduate ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as any other graduate . My argument is that they are better ! Of course , I am biased . Not only am I an employee of a liberal arts college , but also a graduate of one ( Luther College class of 1995 ) . <p> It may be useful to step back and define what a liberal arts education really is . While the liberal arts education has evolved immensely since its inception , it is generally agreed that the modern curriculum includes humanities ( such as linguistics and literature ) , formal sciences ( i.e. mathematics ) , social sciences ( like psychology and history ) and natural sciences ( i.e. biology ) . The curriculum is meant to build a broad foundation of knowledge and skills . Additionally , in the United States , liberal arts colleges typically rely heavily on student participation and encourage a high level of student-teacher interaction , mentorship and collaboration . Most have lower student-teacher ratios , employing more faculty dedicated to teaching full-time , rather than using teaching assistants . <p> I 've been in the nursing profession for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nurse in even that relatively short amount of time . Health care is much more complex now . Different opportunities in nursing have exploded in ways that I could n't have even imagined when I first entered the profession . Nurses are asked more than ever before to lead groups and create change , analyze research and data , and write scientifically and persuasively . Nursing requires an immense amount of critical thinking , problem solving and communication . There is a need to effectively work in teams , flex to changing circumstances , and continually learn new knowledge and skills . <p> So how exactly do the humanities translate into strong nurses and positive results for health care ? A liberal arts education stretches nursing students to think in different ways . They are challenged to appreciate their place in an increasingly global society and what that means when it comes to their future practice . By nature , nursing students in a liberal arts college are n't sitting in a giant lecture hall . Instead , they have more individualized attention from their professors that know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , pull them into discussions , and ask them , " What do you think about this ? " This is important to help them learn how their feelings and actions can impact patient care . <p> It 's not only the nursing didactic courses , but also their time in labs and clinicals that have been shown to be important in forging the links between nursing practice and the liberal arts education . During those times , they are in smaller groups than a typical class and faculty have the opportunity to help make connections between the " core " college curriculum with what they are learning in their major . <p> Students are n't always aware of the benefit of their liberal arts education for a number of months after starting their first job . Research has shown that most new nurses start their profession on equal ground-trying to understand their role better , become efficient practitioners and strong members of the health care team . It 's after they become more comfortable in the basic role that the benefits of the liberal arts education have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as leaders among their peers , more confidently addressing the complexity , ambiguity and rapid change inherent in practice . Georgia Nugent , the former president of Kenyon College , and currently a senior fellow at the Council of Independent College , stated once , " The liberal arts are still relevant because they prepare students to be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances . " Health care has been undergoing incredible change over the years , requiring nurses to be competent in new knowledge and skills very quickly . <p> Liberal arts colleges and universities have different cultures and missions . Not everyone is suited for a large university , and not everyone is comfortable in a smaller liberal arts college . High school students searching for where they want to go to college should choose a place that feels right to them . It is a very personal choice . However I hope this piece highlights how liberal arts education , rich in broad-based knowledge , has been shown to benefit both future nursing employers and patients . <p> La Donna McGohan , Luther College associate professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a ' 95 graduate of the school . She completed her master 's degrees in Nursing Education and Nursing Administration at Winona State University , and her Doctorate of Nursing Practice at Minnesota State University , Mankato . LaDonna 's nursing interests are primarily in how religions influence the health care practices of their members . <h> Comments <p> October 1 2015 at 5:16 pm <p> Kathy Kilen <p> I agree Dr. McGohan ! Thanks for doing a great job articulating the value of the liberal arts education in developing our nurses for lifelong learning and change . One of the the great blessings of nursing is the opportunity to practice and grow in our profession in a multitude of roles and settings . I am thankful for the foundation of my liberal arts education at Luther and draw on this perspective as I teach nursing in a liberal arts institution !

@@1543364 <h> CoCo - A Python Virtual Machine <p> Welcome to CoCo , a virtual machine based on the Python virtual machine . This virtual machine was implemented in C++ . Its was designed for educational purposes for learning C++ , assembly language , and higher level language implementation . The entire source for CoCo is available on GitHub free of charge . You may download it by cloning the github repository or by downloading a zip file of the source . A README accompanies the source code repository to tell you how to compile the program . Precompiled binaries for the three major platforms are provided below if you do not have a compiler installed on your computer . <h> Download <p> If for some reason , that does not work for you , you can rebuild the configure and make files with the rebuild script . However , you will have to have make utilities installed to rebuild . To see if you have the right utilities try this . <p> . /rebuild . /configure make <p> If that does not work , you can brute force the compile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this command . <p> g++ -g -o coco *. cpp <p> If you are going to be working with the source code at all , the above command is not desirable since it will recompile everything every time you make a change and recompile . This can take a little time and could slow down development . It would be better to use make if at all possible . <p> If you do n't have a C++ compiler and just want to try CoCo , you can download a precompiled binary of coco by clicking the links below . You are still encouraged to get the source code as a resource for learning C++ . <p> CoCo includes a disassembler that will disassemble certain Python programs into a CoCo assembly language program . To use the disassembler you must have installed Python 3.2 and run the disassembler with Python 3.2 . Usually , if you have version 3.2 installed , you can run it by typing python3.2 at the command-line . Your Python program must have a main function with no arguments where execution will begin . The Python program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to be in CoCo format , classes are not supported . <p> CoCo implementation detail : Bytecode is an implementation detail of the Python interpreter . No guarantees are made that bytecode will not be added , removed , or changed between versions of Python . For this reason , CoCo is specific to Python 3.2 . To use the disassembler that is distributed with this software package , you must have Python 3.2 installed on your system . Use of the disassembler.py module should not be considered to work across Python VMs or Python releases . <p> You can typically install Python 3.2.5 from Linux distributions or MacPorts . If you do n't find it under your platform 's software management , it can be downloaded from python.org at <p> There are Windows and Mac installers available on this page . For Linux you can download the source and compile and install it . <p> CoCo itself is not dependent on Python 3.2 . Only the dissassembler is . However , it is highly recommended that you have Python 3.2 installed so you can use the disassembler to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtual Machine <p> CoCo , like Python , is a virtual machine ( i.e. an interpreter ) for bytecode instructions . CoCo is written in C++ using object-oriented principles and does not store its instructions in actual bytecode format . Instead , it reads an assembly language file and builds an internal representation of the program as a sequence of functions each with their own sequence of ByteCode objects . <p> Each function of a CoCo program , when called , results in a new stack frame object being created . A stack frame contains all local variables that are defined in the function . Each stack frame also contains two stacks , an operand stack and a block stack . <p> The operand stack is used by the virtual machine to store all intermediate results of instruction execution . Operands are popped from the operand stack when an instruction is executed possibly leaving its result on the operand stack for use by a subsequent instruction . This style of computation has been in use a long time , from Hewlett Packard mainframe computers of the 1960 's through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Java virtual machine is a stack machine as is the Python virtual machine . <p> The other stack is a block stack . The block stack keeps track of exit points for blocks of code within a CoCo program . When a loop is entered , the exit point of the loop is pushed onto the block stack . In this way , if a break instruction is executed inside a loop , the exit point of the loop can be found and the execution of the break instruction will jump to that address . Exception handlers also push the address of the handler onto the block stack . If an exception occurs , execution jumps to the exception handler by popping the address from the block stack . When a loop or try block is exited , the corresponding block stack address is popped from the block stack . <p> A program counter ( abbreviated PC ) is responsible for holding the address of the next instruction to be executed . The machine proceeds by fetching an instruction from the code , incrementing the PC , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a RETURNVALUE instruction is executed or an exception occurs . <p> When an exception occurs , if no matching exception handler is found , execution of the function terminates and control is returned to the previously called function where the exception continues to propagate back until a matching exception handler is found . If no matching handler is found , the complete traceback of the exception is printed . <p> If no exception occurs during the running of a program , execution terminates when the main function executes the RETURNVALUE instruction . <h> Usage <p> CoCo is a full-fledged virtual machine . It reads a source file in CoCo assembly format and interprets the instructions . CoCo is a interpreter for Python assembly language instructions . In addition , included with CoCo is a Python disassembler that diassembles Python programs into CoCo format . With these two tools together you can learn a lot about not only the syntax of casm files ( the extension understood as CoCo assembly language ) but also the Python language itself . Two examples below describe the usage of CoCo and the associated disassembler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disassembler is a module found in the tests subdirectory of the source code distribution or you can download it here . To disassemble correctly , Python programs must contain a series of functions including a main function . The disassembler is imported at the top . Instead of calling the main function , the disassemble function of the same module is called on each function . <p> In the code above there is one function called main . The assembly indicates main has 0 formal parameters . Constants that are used in the code include None and 5 . There are two local variables in the function : x and y . The global print function is called and so is in the list of globals . Every function in CoCo has at least these categories of identifiers and values within each defined function . Sometimes one or more of these categories may be empty and can be omitted in that case . <p> The instructions of the code follow the begin keyword and preceed the end keyword . LOADCONST 1 means to load the constant value at index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operand stack . CoCo is a stack machine and therefore all operations are performed with operands pushed and popped from the operand stack . <p> The STOREFAST instruction stores a value in the locals list , in this case at offset 0 , the location of x . LOADFAST does the opposite , pushing a value on the operand stack from the locals list of variables . BINARYADD pops two elements from the stack and adds them together , pushing the result . CALLFUNCTION pops the number of arguments specified in the instruction ( 1 in this case ) and then pops the function from the stack . Finally , it calls the popped function with the popped arguments . The result of the function call is left on the top of the operand stack . In the case of the print function , None is returned and left on the stack . The POPTOP instruction pops the None from the stack and discards it only to have this function push a None on the stack just before returning . RETURNVALUE pops the top argument from the operand stack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run this code , make sure that you have the coco execuatable in your path some place . Then you can execute the following code to try this example . <p> cd tests python3.2 test1.py &gt; test1.casm coco test1.casm <h> A More Complex Example <p> CoCo is capable of handling complex functions that may be nested inside one another . It can handle functions that return functions and functions that take other functions as parameters . Consider the following Python program . <p> Calling disassemble on main will disassemble any nested functions as well , so it is only necessary to call disassemble on all top-level functions . You can read the code above and the comments to understand how this program works . The disassembled code appears below . <p> From the code above you can observe several things that are worth a little more explanation . <p> A nested function appears right after the outer function 's Function : declaration line . <p> FreeVars is another category of variables in a function . FreeVars are variables that are referenced in the function , but not defined within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function 's scope . <p> CellVars are yet another category of variable . A cellvar is a variable that is local to the function , but is referenced by some other function and therefore must be stored with an indirect reference so it can be referenced in both function . <p> The code(g) and code(f) represent the code of function g and the code of function f respectively . The code of a nested function is a constant to the outer function . <p> Labels are used to symbolically indicate the targets of jumps and other branching instructions . <h> Syntax <p> The syntax of the CoCo assembly language is pretty well illustrated by the two examples above . The complete syntax of the language is given here as a BNF . There are just a few things to note in the BNF below that were n't illustrated by either example above . <p> Instructions may have as many labels defined on them as necessary . The definition of labeled instruction is recursive . <p> The NULL below indicates an empty production . So a FunctionList may be empty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list in a function definition . In this case that simply means a function might or might not have some nested functions . <p> Of course , the ... indicates there are more Unary and Binary mnemonics that are not listed in the BNF . The complete list of instructions and descriptions of each of them are given below . <p> The CoCo language is not line oriented . This BNF completely describes the language which has no line requirements . However , formatting a program like the disassembler will help in the clarity of the code you are writing . <h> Types <p> int is for integer types ( implemented as a C++ int , which may be 32 or 64 bits depending on the compiler you use and platform you are running on . <p> float is the type for floating point numbers ( implemented as a double precision floating point number in CoCo ) . <p> str is the type for all strings . <p> striterator is the type for iterators over strings . <p> function is the type of all functions . <p> builtinfunctionormethod is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the type of range objects . <p> rangeiterator is the type of range iterator objects . <p> Exception is the type of all exceptions . <p> list is the type of list objects like the original Python list objects . <p> listiterator is the type of iterators over lists . <p> funlist is the type of functional list objects . This is a new type not supported in Python with the properties of lists from functional languages that are constructed from a head and a tail . funlist values are immutable as opposed to the list type . <p> funlistiterator is the type of iterators over funlists . <p> tuple is type type of tuple objects . Tuples are like lists , but are immutable . <p> tupleiterator is the type of iterators over tuples . <p> code is the type of code objects ( i.e. functions ) . <p> cell is the type of a reference objects . <h> CoCo Magic and Attr Methods <p> One of the powerful features of the Python language results from methods being looked up on objects at run-time . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language because the virtual machine instructions presented below will polymorphically call the proper methods since lookup happens at run-time . In support of this , CoCo , like Python , has what have traditionally been called magic methods . These methods typically begin and end with two underscores . Magic methods are used by instructions as needed . For instance , the add magic method is used by the BINARYADD instruction . <p> CoCo includes support for all the magic methods that are defined by Python . While support is there for the whole list , not all magic methods are implemented on each type of object . The magic methods that are supported by a type of object are controlled by its type or class definition . When a magic method is called , the magic method is first looked up on the type and if it is supported , the call is made . Otherwise , an **25;250;TOOLONG is raised . The use of magic methods is illustrated below in the descriptions of the CoCo instructions . <p> In addition , some objects have additional methods defined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , str objects have a split method that can be called to split a string on separator characters . Here is the list of attr methods defined in CoCo : split , append , head , tail , concat . The head and tail methods are not found in Python but are defined in CoCo to support funlist objects which are defined to have a head and a tail . <h> Global Built-In Functions <p> CoCo supports the following globally available built-in functions . <p> print is a built-in function that prints a variable number of arguments to standard output , followed by a newline character , and returns None , just as print does in Python . The objects passed to print are printed by calling the str magic method on each of them and appending their strings with an extra space between each pair of objects . <p> fprint prints exactly one argument . This is a built-in function that is specific to CoCo and is not part of the standard Python language . It prints its argument by calling the str magic method on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function returns itself , which can be useful when chaining together print expressions . <p> tprint prints exactly one argument , which may be a tuple , and returns None . tprint can be thought of as tuple print , because if a tuple is provided , the contents of the tuple are printed , separated by spaces , just as print does . However , tprint takes only one argument which may be a tuple . print takes a variable number of arguments . tprint is specific to CoCo and is not part of the standard Python language . The values of the tuple are converted to strings using the str magic method on each object . None is returned by tprint . <p> input is a built-in function that prints its prompt to standard output and returns one line of input as a string , just as input does in Python . <p> iter is a built-in function that constructs and returns an iterator over the object that is passed to it , just as Python 's iter function works . This is implemented by calling the iter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-in function that returns the length of the sequence that is passed to it . It does this by calling the len magic method on the object given to it . <p> concat is built-in function that returns a string representation of the elements of its sequence concatenated together . The concat function in turn calls the concat method on the object that is passed to it . <p> int , float , str , funlist , type , and bool are all calls to types . When the type is called , the corresponding magic method of int , float , str , funlist , type , or bool is called on the object that is passed to it . In this way , the object itself is in charge of how it is converted to the specified type . <p> range is a call to the range type that constructs a range object over the specified range . As in Python , the range function has 1 , 2 , or 3 arguments passed to it , representing the start , stop , and increment of the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optional . <p> Exception is a call to the exception type that constructs and returns an exception object that may be raised or thrown and caught by an exception handler . <h> CoCo Virtual Machine Instructions <p> CoCo implements the following instructions . These instructions are a subset of the instructions supported by the Python Virtual Machine plus a few extra instructions . There are two minor differences from the Python Virtual Machine . <p> CoCo instructions each take up exactly one location of space . The Python Virtual Machine uses one or more bytes for each instruction and therefore some instructions are composed of multiple bytes . CoCo does not store its instructions as bytes and therefore each instruction takes exactly one location within the CoCo virtual machine interpreter . <p> CoCo branch and jump instructions jump to labeled instructions . When read by the CoCo assembler , the labels are converted to target locations which are always absolute addresses . In the Python Virtual Machine some branch instructions provide absolute addresses to jump to and others provide relative offsets to add to the current program counter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses in jumps and branches to labels for CoCo . This makes disassembled code more readable and compatible with the CoCo format . <p> Other than these two minor differences , the implementation of the instructions is pretty faithful to a subset of the Python Virtual Machine implementation . The full Python 3.2 instruction descriptions are available here . <p> Implements in-place TOS = TOS1 + TOS . Exactly the same as BINARYADD by making the call TOS. add(TOS1) . <h> Load and Store Instructions <p> LOADCONST(consti) <p> Pushes coconstsconsti onto the stack . <p> LOADGLOBAL(namei) <p> Loads the global named conamesnamei onto the stack . <p> LOADFAST(varnum) <p> Pushes a reference to the local covarnamesvarnum onto the stack . <p> STOREFAST(varnum) <p> Stores TOS into the local covarnamesvarnum . <p> DELETEFAST(varnum) <p> This instruction does nothing in CoCo which varies from the Python implementation . The purpose of this instruction seems to be implementation dependent . In the Python Virtual Machine it performs cleanup after an exception has occurred . The handling of exceptions is different in CoCo so this instruction exists to make it work with the disassembler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOS=TOS1TOS . This instruction provides indexing into a list , tuple , or other object that supports subscripting . This is implemented as TOS1. getitem(TOS) . <p> STORESUBSCR <p> Implements TOS1TOS=TOS2 . This instruction provides indexing into a list or other object that supports subscripting and is mutable . This instruction is implemented by calling TOS1. setitem ( TOS , TOS2 ) . <p> LOADCLOSURE(i) <p> Pushes a reference to the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage . The name of the variable is cocellvarsi if i is less than the length of cocellvars . Otherwise it is **27;277;TOOLONG . <p> LOADDEREF(i) <p> Loads the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage . Pushes a reference to the object the cell contains on the stack . <p> STOREDEREF(i) <p> Stores TOS into the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage . <p> LOADATTR(namei) <p> Replaces TOS with getattr ( TOS , conamesnamei ) . An attribute is usually a method associated with some object . <h> List and Tuple Instructions <p> BUILDTUPLE(count) <p> Creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes the resulting tuple onto the stack . <p> SELECTTUPLE(count) <p> Pushes the contents of the tuple with count elements onto the operand stack . The count must match the tuple 's size or an illegal operation exception will be thrown . The elments of the tuple are pushed so the left-most element is left on the top of the stack . This instruction is not part of the Python Virtual Machine . It is CoCo specific . <p> BUILDLIST(count) <p> Works as BUILDTUPLE , but creates a list . <p> BUILDFUNLIST <p> Works as BUILDTUPLE , but creates a list . <p> SELECTFUNLIST <p> This instruction pushes the head and the tail ( which is a funlist ) onto the operand stack . The head of the list is left on the top of the operand stack . The tail is below it on the stack . This instruction is CoCo specific . <p> CONSFUNLIST <p> Pops two elements from the operand stack . TOS should be a funlist and TOS-1 should be an element . The instruction create a new funlist from the two pieces with TOS-1 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It pushes this new list onto the operand stack . This instruction is CoCo specific . <h> Stack Manipulation Instructions <p> POPTOP <p> Removes the top-of-stack ( TOS ) item . <p> ROTTWO <p> Swaps the two top-most stack items . <p> DUPTOP <p> Duplicates the reference on top of the stack . <h> Conditional and Iterative Execution Instructions <p> GETITER <p> Implements TOS=iter(TOS) . <p> BREAKLOOP <p> Terminates a loop due to a break statement . <p> POPBLOCK <p> Removes one block from the block stack . Per frame , there is a stack of blocks , denoting nested loops , try statements , and such . <p> POPEXCEPT <p> Removes one block from the block stack . The popped block must be an exception handler block , as implicitly created when entering an except handler . In addition to popping extraneous values from the frame stack , the last three popped values are used to restore the exception state . <p> ENDFINALLY <p> Terminates a finally clause . The interpreter recalls whether the exception has to be re-raised , or whether the function returns , and continues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . Both TOS1 and TOS are popped from the stack and the boolean result is left on the operand stack after the execution of this instruction . opname is an integer corresponding to the following comparisons . <p> 0 : TOS1 &lt; TOS or TOS1. lt(TOS) <p> 1 : TOS1 &lt;= TOS or TOS1. le(TOS) <p> 2 : TOS1 = TOS or TOS1. eq(TOS) <p> 3 : TOS1 ! = TOS or TOS1. ne(TOS) <p> 4 : TOS1 &gt; TOS or TOS1. gt(TOS) <p> 5 : TOS1 &gt;= TOS or TOS1. ge(TOS) <p> 6 : TOS1 contains TOS or TOS1. contains(TOS) <p> 7 : TOS1 not in TOS or TOS1. notin(TOS) <p> 8 : TOS1 is TOS or TOS1.is(TOS) <p> 9 : TOS1 is not TOS or TOS1.isnot(TOS) <p> 10 : exception TOS1 matches TOS or TOS1. excmatch(TOS) <p> JUMPFORWARD(target) <p> Sets the Program Counter ( PC ) to target . <p> POPJUMPIFTRUE(target) <p> If TOS is true , sets the bytecode counter to target . TOS is popped . <p> POPJUMPIFFALSE(target) <p> If TOS is false , sets the bytecode counter to target . TOS is popped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORITER(target) <p> TOS is an iterator . Call its next() method . If this yields a new value , push it on the stack ( leaving the iterator below it ) . If the iterator indicates it is exhausted TOS is popped , and the PC is set to target . <p> SETUPLOOP(target) <p> Pushes a block for a loop onto the block stack . The block spans from the current instruction to target . <p> SETUPEXCEPT(target) <p> Pushes a try block from a try-except clause onto the block stack . target points to the first except block . <p> SETUPFINALLY(target) <p> Pushes a try block from a try-except clause onto the block stack . target points to the finally block . <p> RAISEVARARGS(argc) <p> This instruction varies from the Python version slightly . In CoCo the argc must be one . This is because exceptions in CoCo automatically contain the traceback which is not necessarily the case in the Python Virtual Machine . The argument on the stack should be an exception . The exception is thrown by this instruction . <h> Function Execution Instructions <p> RETURNVALUE <p> Returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALLFUNCTION(argc) <p> Calls a function . The low byte of argc indicates the number of positional parameters , the high byte the number of keyword parameters . On the stack , the opcode finds the keyword parameters first . For each keyword argument , the value is on top of the key . Below the keyword parameters , the positional parameters are on the stack , with the right-most parameter on top . Below the parameters , the function object to call is on the stack . Pops all function arguments , and the function itself off the stack , and pushes the return value . <p> MAKEFUNCTION(argc) <p> Pushes a new function object on the stack . TOS is the code associated with the function . The function object is defined to have argc default parameters , which are found below TOS . <p> MAKECLOSURE(argc) <p> Creates a new function object , sets its closure slot , and pushes it on the stack . TOS is the code associated with the function , TOS1 the tuple containing cells for the closure 's free variables . The function also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Usually a brief ABSTRACT or SUMMARY , including an introduction and description of the methods &amp; results is included . <p> In the sciences , the METHODS should primarily be pictures and diagrams with descriptive captions . The RESULTS are mostly figures and tables with descriptive captions . CONCLUSIONS should be point by point rather than textual format . If a viewer must read lots of prose , they will likely move on before understanding your presentation . <h> Display Space <p> Each display is usually contained within a 4 ft x 4 ft space ( although this may vary depending on where you are presenting ) . The board will usually take push pins . Sometimes you can use stick-on Velcro strips to attach to felt-covered surfaces . Scotch tape is always a good backup . Plan ahead to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fit into the available space . <h> Heading <p> The heading consists of the title of your presentation as printed in the program and the name(s) of the author(s) . Use a minimum of 36 point type for the title , to make it readable from a distance ( some poster titles use 72 point fonts or higher ! ) . In cases where titles are extraordinarily long , abbreviated titles are acceptable . <h> Legibility &amp; Visual Impact <p> Viewers will be standing between one and two meters from your display . How the poster looks and how easy it is to read is very important ! The text , captions , and figure legends must be at least 18 pt , preferably 24 pt to be easily readable . Use a consistent font . <p> Graphs , photos , and tables need to be large as well . Use of contrasting color in graphs is effective where appropriate . <p> Include pages of small print with details of methods or long , drawn-out discussion <h> Continuity &amp; Clarity <p> Tell the story of your research in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captions of pictures , figure , and tables to help describe the project . By position of the text and figures , or by using arrows , indicate the flow of your story in the display . Use a single font throughout your presentation . <p> Highlight major points using bullets or some other means in a summary or conclusions paragraph . <h> Displays are not Manuscripts <p> Be sure to limit the prose . However , the display should be self-explanatory . Thus , when you present , you will be free to answer questions and discuss your work with some while others are able to study and understand the display . <p> Posters can also be constructed mounting smaller elements to stiff cardboard or poster board with a spray adhesive . Often colored cardboard is used and a border is left around each item . Use push pins or Velcro to attach your poster to the presentation space . <h> Presenting at the Poster Session <p> Always have at least 1 co-author near the poster to answer questions . Let people peruse your poster for 30 seconds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead them through it . Be ready to clearly and concisely explain the objectives of your study , your methodology , the results , and your conclusions . Do n't be shy in introducing yourself , since the opportunity to meet people and discuss your work is one of the major advantages of poster sessions !

@@1543370 <h> Creating a Recursive-Descent Parser <p> A Grammar , G , is a structure &lt;N , T , P , S&gt; where N is a set of non-terminals , T is a set of terminals , P is a set of productions , and S is a special non-terminal called the start symbol of the grammar . Grammars are used to formally specify the syntax of a language . For example , consider the language of calculator expressions where we can add , subtract , multiply , and divide . We can also store a value in a single memory location and recall the value in the memory location . For example , ( 5S+4 ) * R EOF is a sentence in this grammar . When evaluated , this expression would yield the value 45 . A grammar that specifies the syntax of this language is : <p> G=&lt;N , T , P , Prog&gt; where N=Prog , Expr , Term , Storable , Factor , T=number , + , - , * , / , S , R , ( , ) , EOF the start symbol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rules <p> Prog -&gt; Expr EOF <p> Expr -&gt; Expr + Term Expr - Term Term <p> Term -&gt; Term * Storable Term / Storable Storable <p> Storable -&gt; Factor S Factor <p> Factor -&gt; number R ( Expr ) <p> Using this grammar we can check to see that the example expression given above is valid by constructing a derivation of the sentence . A derivation starts with the start symbol and replace one non-terminal at each step to generate the sentence . For instance , a derivation that generates the example above is : <p> This derivation proves that ( 5S+4 ) *R EOF is a syntactically valid expression in the language of the grammar . The grammar presented above is what is called an LALR(1) grammar . This kind of grammar can be used by a program called a parser generator that given the grammar , will automatically generate a program called a parser . A parser is a program that given a sentence in its language , will construct a derivation of that sentence to check it for syntactic correctness . The derivation can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be many different derivations for a sentence in a language , but only one parse tree ( if the grammar is unambiguous ) . Parse trees are outside the scope of this document . Take CS67 if you want to learn about parse trees . <p> Although parsers can be generated by parser generators , it is still sometimes convenient to write a parser by hand . However , LALR(1) grammars are not easy to use to manually construct parsers . Instead , we want an LL(1) grammar if we are going to manually construct a parser . An LL(1) grammar can be used to construct a top-down or recursive descent parser where an LALR(1) grammar is typically used to construct a bottom-up parser . A top-down parser constructs ( or at least traverses ) the parse tree starting at the root of the tree and proceeding downward . A bottom-up parser constructs or traverses the parse tree in a bottom-up fashion . Again , for more details , take CS67 . <p> In a recursive descent parser , each non-terminal in the grammar becomes a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions become the bodies of the functions . An LALR(1) grammar is not appropriate for constructing a recursive descent parser . To create a recursive-descent parser ( the topic of this page ) we must convert the LALR(1) grammar above to an LL(1) grammar . Typically , there are two steps involved . <p> Eliminate left recursion <p> Perform left factorization where appropriate <h> Eliminate Left Recursion <p> Eliminating left recursion means eliminating rules like Expr Expr + Term . Rules like this are left recursive because the Expr function would first call the Expr function in a recursive descent parser . Without a base case first , we are stuck in infinite recursion ( a bad thing ) . To eliminate left recursion we look to see what Expr can be rewritten as . In this case , Expr can be only be replaced by a Term so we replace Expr with Term in the productions . The usual way to eliminate left recursion is to introduce a new non-terminal to handle all but the first part of the production . So we get <p> Expr -&gt; Term RestExpr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We must also eliminate left recursion in the Term Term * Factor Term / Factor productions in the same way . We end up with an LL(1) grammar that looks like this : <p> Prog -&gt; Expr EOF <p> Expr -&gt; Term RestExpr <p> RestExpr -&gt; + Term RestExpr - Term RestExpr &lt;null&gt; <p> Term -&gt; Storable RestTerm <p> RestTerm -&gt; * Storable RestTerm / Storable RestTerm &lt;null&gt; <p> Storable -&gt; Factor S Factor <p> Factor -&gt; number R ( Expr ) <h> Perform Left Factorization <p> Left factorization is n't needed on this grammar so this step is skipped . Left factorization is needed when the first part of two or more productions is the same and the rest of the similar productions are different . Left factorization is important in languages like Prolog because without it the parser is inefficient . However , it is n't needed and does not improve efficiency when writing a parser in an imperative language like Java , for instance . <h> Translating the LL(1) Grammar to Java <p> Typically , a parser returns an abstract syntax tree ( or expression tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract syntax is defined by a grammar that is likely ambiguous . The ambiguity is not a problem for abstract syntax since this grammar will not be used for parsing . <p> Once you have an LL(1) grammar you use it to build a parser as follows . The following construction causes the parser to return an abstract syntax tree or expression tree for the sentence being parsed . <p> Construct a function for each non-terminal . Each of these functions should return a node in the abstract syntax tree . <p> Depending on your grammar , some non-terminal functions may require an input parameter of an abstract syntax tree ( ast ) to be able to complete a partial ast that is recognized by the non-terminal function . <p> Each non-terminal function should call a function to get the next token as needed . If the next token is not needed , the non-terminal function should call another function to put back the token . Your parser ( if it is based on an LL(1) grammar , should never have to get or put back more than one token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function should be be a series of if statements that choose which production right-handside to expand depending on the value of the next token . <p> The construction above is very simple , but can be confusing without an example . Consider the LL(1) grammar given above . <p> Assume that you have a binary tree class in Java called BTNode that can hold an Object and that operators in the expression are Characters and numbers in the expression are Doubles . Also , assume there are two functions that get the next Token in the input ( getToken ) and push the last token back on the input ( pushBackToken ) . Then , we can write the first part of the parser as follows : <p> The code given here throws an exception if an error is discovered during parsing . You should of course take appropriate action during error conditions . The BTNode constructor for the tree above takes a value for the new node and references to the left and right subtrees . Calling the function Prog() returns a pointer to an abstract syntax tree representing the expression . Kent Lee

The variable root represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of the main window by sending a message to the root window with the line of code <p> root.title ( " Draw ! " ) <p> This is object-oriented programming . The root variable represents the main window of our application and we can communicate with the window object by sending it messages , like the title message . Sometimes we say we are invoking the title method on the root object . Invoking a method and sending a message are two ways of saying the same thing . <p> create a Canvas widget and place it on the left side of the root window . A canvas widget is an area where you can draw things with a turtle object . Our canvas widget will be called cv in our program . <p> These two lines of code <p> t = turtle.RawTurtle(cv) screen = t.getscreen() <p> create a turtle object , called t , and send a message to the turtle object to get the screen object ( which is just another representation of the canvas , cv . Once we have the screen , we can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtle as a pencil . That 's what these lines of code do . <p> screen.registershape ( " pencil.gif " ) t.shape ( " pencil.gif " ) <p> Creating an entry field to enter the width of the line that is drawn is pretty simple . An entry widget is created . The entry widget has a StringVar object associated with it . A StringVar object has to messages it understands , get and set . The set method sets a value in the entry widget . The code below sets the string " 1 " in the entry widget . The get message is used later on . <p> When a button is added to a Tkinter application , you create the button , add it to the window , and then associate the button with a function that is called when the button is pressed . The code below creates the quit button and then ties it to the quitHandler function . <p> When a mouse click occurs , we want the turtle to draw a line to that place on the screen where you clicked . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse click events . That 's what this code does for us . Notice that it sends the get message to the pointSize StringVar object to get its value . It converts this value to an integer and uses that as the width of the line to draw when moving the turtle . <p> Finally , the last line of code in the main function tells the Tkinter code to call the mainloop function . This mainloop function processes the events that occur ( like button presses and mouse clicks ) by calling the appropriate event handler to process the event . <p> tkinter.mainloop() <h> Now You Try It <p> There are two things we 'll try today . First , we 'll create an entry field so we can set the color of the lines we draw . To do this we 'll create a new entry field and a StringVar to go with it . The code looks like this . You can write this code after the code that creates the pointSizeStringVar and pointEntryEntry widget . Be sure to indent your code the same amount as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of code does ? If not , ask ! <p> This is almost all the code we need . The only extra bit of code is in the click handler . To use the current color of the colorVarStringVar object , you have to tell the turtle to use the color when drawing . You do this before you tell the turtle to goto the next point . Here is how you tell the turtle to use the colorVar 's color . <p> t.color ( colorVar.get ( ) ) <p> Many colors are available in turtle graphics , so do n't be shy about trying a few of them . Pretty much any color can also be created by providing a color in RGB mode . In this mode , you write the red , green , and blue components in hexadecimal form . Hexadecimal is a counting system that has 16 values for each digit . The values are 0-9 and a-f . A color in RGB mode has two hexadecimal digits for each component ( the red , green , and blue components ) . So the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green components are at full intensity while there is no blue component at all . In other words , the color represented above is yellow . <h> Have Extra Time ? <p> Try creating a clear button that clears the screen so you can start over . To clear the screen you send a message to the turtle called clear . So you write <p> t.clear() <p> to clear the screen . To get this to work correctly , you need to follow the pattern that was used to create the quitButton and the quitHandler.

@@1543375 <h> Functions can do many things <p> Functions in Python can be used for many different purposes . <p> Sometimes functions return a value as they did in the last lesson . <p> Sometimes a function may have some side-effects . In the functions in this lesson students learn they can write a function that draws a shape . Once they have done this , they can use the function over and over again to draw lots of shapes in their program . <p> When you write a function it defines it 's own SCOPE . Scope refers to the variables that are defined within a function . Any time a variable is assigned a value , it is a variable only for that function . In other words if you see <p> x = anything <p> where x is any variable , then x only exists while that function is called . Likewise , the names t , x , y , scale , and color that appear in the drawSquare function definition to the right only exist while the drawSquare function is executing and can not be accessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variables in main can not be accessed from the drawSquare function . So , for instance , turtle can not be accessed from drawSquare . However , since turtle is passed to drawSquare it gets the name t in the drawSquare function . <p> Scope is an important concept to learn when writing computer programs . <h> Drawing Houses <p> In the last lesson we learned that functions can be used to compute values and return them in our programs . Now we 'll see how to use a function to draw lots of shapes in a program . When writing a function there are three things you should decide . <p> What should my function be named ? <p> What information does my function need to do its job ? <p> What type of value will my function return ? <p> Let 's consider an example . What if we want to draw a square in the graphics window . We could write this as a function called drawSquare . It would need to be given a Turtle to draw with and an ( x , y ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it more useful we 'll also give it a scale for the square . The scale can be used to produce squares of different sizes . We could pick 100 to be a full scale ( scale = 1.0 ) square . <p> This results in the program given here . <p> In this program the random module is used to generate random numbers . Calling random.random() produces a random number between 0 and 1 . So when this program is run , 100 squares appear in the graphics window of random size and at random locations on the screen . To use random we had to import random at the top of the program . <h> Now You Try It <p> Write a program that draws houses on the screen of random size and at random locations on the screen . Use the program above as a guide . Call your function drawHouse . Be sure to give it the correct parameters so the house can be drawn . You 'll need all the same parameters that drawSquare used . Use the forward , left , and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each forward value by scale so your houses can be scaled . You can color your house if you like . As a bare minimum your house should have a roof , a door , and a window .

On this nearly cloudless day ( a rare occasion during the rainy season ) , we enjoyed unobstructed views of many of the mountains and volcanoes surrounding Quito . After traversing valleys and hills , we arrived in Otavalo , a highland town nestled at the feet of several towering mountains . It is famous for its extensive market filled with countless native goods . <p> Our trip to the market presented a chance to practice our bargaining skills " and help out the local economy . Alpaca blankets , scarves , and sweaters , belts , artwork , soccer jerseys , musical instruments , and more . <p> After shopping , we traveled a short distance to have a traditional Kichwa lunch of chicken , rice , potatoes , beets , salad , and juice .

After an intense game of soccer against some local boys at the school across the street , we helped our hosts prepare dinner . The first course was a traditional quinoa and vegetable soup . This was followed by a plate of chicken , rice , beans , and a salad ( composed of avocado , tomato , onion and lemon juice ) , which was all accompanied by freshly-squeezed lemonade . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the rice ) came directly from the family 's garden . They also have pigs , sheep , corn , and many more products . Mar+a Carmen explained that everything they produce is used for the house " none of it is sold in markets . This sustainable type of agriculture seemed fairly common in this area , but it is much different than the large , monoculture fields we have seen in some other parts of the country . <p> We were up early the next morning to help with breakfast and make our way back to Casa Foch . One day in Quito was all we had before departing for another highlands area the following morning ( our last in Ecuador ) : Antisana . <p> The path to Antisana : A narrow road wound its way up the hillslope . Due to the nature of these roads , subject to wear from earth-moving vehicles and gravel trucks , and ever-twisting from the shape of the mountains , it was a bumpy ride . As we neared the reserves we passed through a small town with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost causes . Last January I visited a biological research station named after Santa Rita , the female patron saint of lost causes - I suppose that both biologists and subsistence farmers dwelling near these wilderness preserves have some justified concern for the future . <p> We made a winding ascent of Antisana volcano , one of three large snow-capped volcanoes that skirt the city of Quito . We drove past the violet-gray stone of its old lava fields ( now gravel quarries ) via bus , discussing how the volcano formed , and how human activity had altered the face of the land . Farmers had attempted to control erosion by planting pine trees , the shallow root systems of which had the unintended effect of worsening erosion , while the oil-rich needles formed a layer of earth that stifled the growth of other native plants . <p> Upon arrival at Antisanilla Reserve , we scanned the barren vault of the cloudy sky but failed to observe any Andean Condors on the guano-spattered cliffs that indicate the cave mouths where they nest . We did , however , spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature that our guide had only seen 3 times prior , and never at this site . We saw 3 individuals - a solitary bear , and a mother &amp; cub , each wandering on a grassy hillslope between a forest and a rocky escarpment and cliff-face . <p> Then , as we prepared to depart the site , somebody saw a speck soaring above us , and in short succession , a second was sighted . Condors . Real Andean Condors , in the flesh . By the end of the day , we would see 12 in total ( some experts have estimated the wild population of Andean Condors as being in the 70s , so we may have seen fully 1/6 of all wild Andean Condors , a rather sobering thought ) . In our drive to the next site , we would see 5 condors circling above a place where farmers sacrifice cattle to keep condors well-fed through harder parts of the year . <p> Following this , we journeyed to Antisana Ecological Reserve , where we enjoyed a brief hike and detailed examination of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p+ramo , a neotropical montane grassland . The most common species we observed were varieties of bunchgrass , cushion plant , lichen and moss ( all bear adaptations to drought , for the p+ramo has strong winds which strip the soil of moisture ) . As far as animals are concerned , we saw the Caracara , the Black-Faced Ibis , the Andean Gull , and the Andean Lapwing , and something our guides grew quite excited about - the White-tailed Deer ... In South America , this tends to be a very rare species , and we all had a little bit of a laugh considering how a single night 's walk across Luther Campus would contain several . <p> At this point , we departed for the airport to fly home to the states , wishing that our stay in Ecuador could have been longer . <p> It 's been a pleasure blogging for you , and we wish all of you the best . <p> Jed Nixon &amp; Matt Lagus <p> Playing football ( the world 's football ) with children near mount Cotacachi . <p> Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a game of hopscotch .

Everything we dined upon ( aside from rice ) was locally grown in gardens such as this . <p> Unfortunately , the Andean Condors and Spectacled Bears at Antisanilla Reserve were too distant for us to get good photos , so here 's the entrance sign . <p> After departing Antisana , we stopped for lunch at a birdwatching station , where we observed an Andean Condor fly past at very close range , as well as this very handsome hummingbird .

In lesson 6 they learn how to draw regular polygons and then they take this to the extreme to learn to draw circles . <h> Session Three <p> In this session students learn to define and use functions . First a mathematical concept of a function is graphed using Turtle graphics so students can compare the way to define a function in Mathematics to how functions are defined in Python . <p> Then functions are used to draw squares at random points on the screen .

" Well , then , good Gotama , is there not a self ? " Once again , then Blessed One remained silent ( Strong 95 ) . <p> This passage from the Sumyuta-Kikaya ( a Buddhist text ) deals with one of the most important concepts in Buddhist philosophy : anatman . Anatman is the idea that there is no self ; at least no self in the Hindu definition of atman . There are three aspects to the concept of anatman : <p> The idea that selves do not have an essence is based upon the belief on the existence of the five constituents : the body , consciousness , karmic activities , feelings , and perception . <p> The combination of these five constituents creates who we are : no one part can represent us . Therefore , Buddhists argue that there is no single essence , which leads them to believe that there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everything changes and that nothing stays the same . This is a critical concept in Buddhist philosophy . If nothing stays the same , then there can be no permanent or constant self . We change with each experience , and with each moment we are alive . Therefore , we are different self every minute of our lives and the concept " self " becomes irrelevant . <p> Finally , Buddhism also strongly stresses the idea of interdependence , that ? s the notion that everything affects everything else in the phenomenal world . If one thing changes , then everything changes . Therefore , if the so-called self is dependent on everything else , then , this " self " does not really and can not really exist on its own . <p> The concept of anatman does not necessarily mean that there is not a self , however . The text displayed at the beginning of this page illustrates this idea . The quote shows that there is no " self " , yet at the same time , there is no " no-self " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and does not give into either extreme eternalism or annihilitionism . He is also acknowledging the fact that there is a concept of the self , though Buddhism does not adhere to it . <p> This idea of anatman or " no-self " is evident in Buddhist cultures and society . First , Buddhist cultures generally emphasizes the body as one of the five constituents . In Samkhya Hinduism and in Christianity to the contary , there is a strong idea of seperation between the two . Second , there is also a focus on the present rather that on the past or the future , as some other cultures tend to do . Because o the notion of impermanance , Buddhist know that the only constant thing is change itself , therefore they emphasize the present moment . This notion of enjoying one ? s present situation is also apparent in cultures of Buddhist religio , and very different than the Western notion of working so hard to plan for the future that one often frogets the present moment they are in.

@@1543400 <h> A Brief Introduction to Makefiles <p> When writing programs in Linux , there is a very nice utility program called " make " at your disposal . Make is a project manager , like what you 're use to under Jbuilder or C++ Builder if you have used these programs before . Make will make sure that your project is always up to date . You control how the make utility works by writing a Makefile , which make reads . The Makefile contains rules for bringing your project up to date . The best way to illustrate this is with an example . In C++ , programs may be separated into several source files . For instance , assume that we have written a graphics program in a file called wave.C and we use some utility functions in a file called util.C . To compile this project we want to execute three compile commands as follows : <p> g++ -g -c &lt;other options&gt; wave.C <p> g++ -g -c &lt;other options&gt; util.C <p> g++ -g -o wave wave.o util.o <p> The first two lines compile the two source files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last line produces the compiled program called wave by linking the two object files together . The &lt;other options&gt; represent other options that you may want to include on the compile , the -c option says to produce object files ( . o files ) as a result ( it actually means to suppress the linking stage ) , and the -g option tells the compiler to include debug information that can be used by a debugger . While we could execute all three commands every time we made a change to wave.C or util.C , it would be tedious to re-type the commands . In addition , if we make a change to wave.C , but no change to util.C , it 's unnecessary to recompile util.C . Once we 've written a Makefile , the make utility will execute the compile commands for us and as an extra bonus , it will only execute the compile commands that are actually needed . It does this by looking at the date of the object files compared to their source files . A Makefile for the project above is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used later . The first line of the rules says that the file " wave " is dependent on the file " wav.o " and " util.o " . The next line says that the way to bring " wave " up to date is to execute that g++ command . The second line ( and other similar lines ) must be indented with a tab at the beginning of the line . If you edit the Makefile with XEmacs , it will allow you to press tab to indent these lines . The third line says that " wave.o " is dependent on " wave.C " and " util.H " . We ca n't see it here , but the assumption is that " wave.C " includes " util.H " . The fourch line says how to bring " wave.o " up to date . The next two lines do the same for util.o and util.C . The last two lines will be described in a moment . <p> To make your program , you execute the command " make " at a command-line prompt ( or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make will look for a file called " Makefile " in the current directory . Typically you will organize your projects so that all the files for a project are in one directory and there is one Makefile to tell make what to do when making the project in the directory . Make will then execute the commands one at a time , in the right order , to bring your project up to date . <p> Since you have to write the Makefile , it is possible you could make a mistake . If you do , you may need to clean the project and re-make it . That 's the purpose of the last two lines of the Makefile . If you type " make clean " at the command-line , the next time you type " make " all of your source files will be re-compiled and your project should be up to date ( assuming that you have n't got a compile error in your code or other errors in your Makefile . <h> A Makefile for Java <p> The Java compiler has a make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . However , since XEmacs defaults the compile button to the " make -k " command , it still may be desirable to write a Makefile . To do this you can use a generic Makefile that looks like this <p> all : <p> javac *. java <p> If you 're copying the text out of this page , be sure that there is a &lt;tab&gt; at the beginning of the lines that contain the compile commands . Make will not work properly if the tabs do n't occur in the right spots .

@@1543454 <h> Video Games are fun ! <p> This begins a series of lessons that highlight some important aspects of programming while being fun as well . <p> The game of asteroids is a simple and fun game that illustrates concepts from computer graphics , geometry , and trigonometry . <p> Each lesson is designed to allow the students to play with a small part of the program and extend it in some way . <p> The following lessons also introduce Tkinter programming which is a nice toolkit for doing Graphical User Interface design and implementation . <h> Asteroids ! <p> The Asteroids video game was originally designed and written by the folks at Atari . It was released to the public in 1979 . In the game the player controls a spaceship that navigates space and blows up asteroids by shooting at them . <p> When an asteroid is hit the player scores points and the asteroid splits into two smaller asteroids . The largest asteroids are worth 20 points . Each medium asteroid is worth 50 points . The smallest asteroids are worth 100 points each . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it disappears completely from the game . <p> If an asteroid collides with the spaceship , the spaceship is destroyed , the asteroid that collided with it is destroyed ( resulting in no points ) and the player gets a new spaceship . The game starts with four spaceships total ( the original game started with only three ) . <p> In the original game , there were flying saucers that would periodically appear . These UFOs would shoot at the ship and if the ship fired back and blew one up , there were 200 points awarded for hitting a large UFO and 1000 points awarded for blowing up a small UFO . The version of the game described in these lessons does not include UFOs , but it could be extended to included them if you want to write the code ! <p> Pictured here is an example of a computer game that when completed will play the game of Asteroids ! You can click on the picture below to get a copy of some code that will get you started writing your own asteroids game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clipboard . Then open Wing IDE 101 and create a new program file . Paste the code into the window . Save it as asteroids.py . Run the program by clicking the Debug button to see what is implemented so far . <p> The code that was provided is not complete . To complete the game , you 'll have to implement the extensions described in this and the next few lessons . But first , you need to become familiar with Python programming by examining the code you just copied . <p> We 'll start from the top of the file and cover the code in the order that it is executed . <p> When writing a program , you ca n't possibly write all the code yourself . Python programmers import code from other modules so they can use that code in their programs . Python comes with a large number of modules that all have documentation to describe what they do and how to use them . You import code from a module by writing import statements at the top of your program . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtle module implements turtle graphics . Turtle graphics emulates a turtle on a sandy beach . When the turtle drags its tail it leaves a trail . This is a paradigm ( a way of thinking about ) implementing vector graphics . You should examine the turtle graphics documentation to learn what a turtle can do when using turtle graphics . <p> The tkinter modules implement GUI ( graphical user interface ) programming . Graphical User Interfaces are programs that display a window like the one above . <p> The math module implements functions like square root and cosine and sine . <p> After the import statements are four variables that are assigned values : screenMinX , screenMinY , screenMaxX , and screenMaxY . The values -500 and 500 are stored as values and named with these names . Variables are just like named memory locations in your calculator . You can store values so they can be easily retrieved earlier . <p> After the four variables comes two class definitions . These class definitions define what a Spaceship looks like and how it acts in the program and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll skip to after these class definitions for now . <p> The intersect function is a function that returns True if two objects intersect ( like an Asteroid and the Ship ) and False if they do not intersect . It is not used for now so we 'll come back to it later . <p> Finally the main function is where everything gets started . The main function is called on the last line of the program . Calling a function is just like calling a function in Mathematics . You write the name of the function to call it followed by parentheses and then the information you want to pass to a function . Nothing is passed to the main function on the last line of the program . It is just called to get everything started . <p> The first few lines build the GUI window and get a Turtle Graphics session started . <h> Now You Try It <p> When a spaceship is created it uses the ShaceShip class . This is the code that starts class SpaceShip . The class definition says what a spaceship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turtle because it inherits from RawTurtle ( which is a type of Turtle ) . You can review the turtle module documentation to see what a turtle is . In addition to being a turtle , it can also be told to move , fire its engine , and we can get its current X and Y trajectory ( called dx and dy ) . <p> You can customize your program by picking a color for your ship . Turtle graphics has lots of colors predefined , so you should be able to find something you like . However , pretty much any color can also be created by writing <p> self.color ( " #ffff00 " ) <p> This creates the color yellow using hexadecimal numbers . Each color that can be displayed is composed of a red , green , and blue component . Numbers from 0 ( 00 in hexadecimal ) to 255 ( ff in hexadecimal ) are used to indicate how much red , green , and blue should be included in a color . So full red and green mixed makes yellow . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for your asteroids . Run the program to see that your colors are working and that you like them . <h> Playing the Game <p> Playing an asteroids game means moving the ship and the asteroids around the screen . This code creates a list of five big asteroids for the game . <p> To make the game animated , a play function is repeatedly called to move the game 's objects around on the screen . The following code accomplishes this by setting a timer to call the play function . When the play function is called , another timer is set to call it again . In this way , the play function is called over and over again to move the spaceship and asteroids . <p> def play() : # Tell all the elements of the game to move ship.move() for asteroid in asteroids : asteroid.move() <p> # Set the timer to go off again in 5 milliseconds screen.ontimer ( play , 5 ) <p> # The following line sets the timer to call the play function # the first time only . screen.ontimer ( play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this code to play the rest of the game as we work to complete this game . <h> Responding to Input <p> For the game to be interesting , we must get some input from the user . The keypad will work nicely for this . We 'll have the number 4 turn the spaceship to the left and the number 5 start the spaceship moving . Here is the code that does this . <p> def turnLeft() : **28;392;TOOLONG ( ) +7 ) # This tells the turtle graphics when a 4 is pressed to # call the turnLeft function **26;422;TOOLONG , " 4 " ) def forward() : ship.fireEngine() # This tells the turtle graphics when a 5 is pressed to # call the forward function when immediately calls the # fireEngine function on the ship . **25;450;TOOLONG , " 5 " ) <h> Now You Try It <p> Write the code so when 6 is pressed that the ship turns to the right . Calling the heading function on the ship returns its heading in degrees ( from 0 to 360 degrees ) . Calling the setheading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . The ship is also a turtle . So , heading and setheading are functions that are defined on turtles . Adding 7 degrees to the turtle heading turns the ship to the left . How do you make it turn to the right ? <p> Write the code and then run it to see that it works correctly . <h> Have Extra Time ? <p> By changing the register shape calls you can design your own space ship and asteroids . The rock3 asteroid is the largest of the asteroids . The rock2 and rock1 you ca n't see yet . <p> Before making any new designs , be sure to copy the line you are changing and comment out the copy by adding a # sign to the beginning of the line . That way you are saving a copy of what you had to start with . <h> What 's Next ? <p> In the next lesson , we 'll discover how to fire Photon Torpedoes from our spaceship !

My longevity at Luther enables me to speak about two funding opportunities that mean a lot to me and , more importantly , to the students who benefit from them . They are the Diversity Center Book Fund and the Sonya Lund International Student Emergency Fund . <p> The current book fund began as two book funds . One fund was a partnership with Alliant Energy in response to Adell Patton challenge at the First Black History Conference in 2004 to get Black books into Iowa school libraries . Alliant Energy funded the project . For about 4 years small grants were given to Iowa school districts to buy books that had won the Coretta Scott King Award or the Carter G. Woodson Award . The districts chose from those lists . <p> Later , an alumnus provided a $4,000 grant to Luther College to establish a book fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas in 2004 , those alumni decided that the money would be used to help African American students with purchasing books . <p> In about 2007 , The Diversity Center established new criteria for funding : a ) the fund would provide one-time emergency grants to Luther students ( of color ) to help with retention and grades ; b ) students from diverse backgrounds including socio-economic were included as beneficiaries . These are still in place . <p> The Sonya Lund International Student Emergency Fund was established to honor Sonya Lund who served as the Director of International Student Services for sixteen years until she retired in 2002 from that position . This fund , as the name suggests , is intended to assist students with emergencies that could not have been anticipated and who , for various reasons , are unable to tap family resources and where time is of the essence . <p> What does this have to do with you ?

@@1543467 <h> A Brief Introduction to Linux <h> What is Linux ? <p> Linux is a free version of the Unix operating system that consists of three things ( like most operating systems ) : a file system , an environment , and a means for finding , loading , and executing programs . Each of these is described in more detail below . Since Linux is a version of Unix , for the most part the information below applies to both Unix and Linux . <h> Linux File System <p> The Linux file system , called reiserfs , is a tree of directories . The root directory ( called / ) is the root of the entire filesystem . <p> The concept of drives ( C : , etc ) from DOS is not used in the Linux file system . Instead , devices like a floppy drive are treated as special files ( called devices ) in the file system , but this is beyond the scope of this document . <p> Directories in the file system may contain directories and/or files . <p> File and directory names are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOS uses . File names may be as long as you like ( up to some large limit ) and may contain numbers , periods , dashes , etc . The Linux file system also distinguishes between upper and lower case names . <p> Also unlike the FAT file system , the Linux file system maintains information about each file and directory . This information consists of the file permissions , the owner of the file , and the owning group of the file . You can look at the permissions of each file my using the " ls -l " command . For instance , in your home directory you can if you type " ls -l " you might see something that looks like this : <p> drwxr-xr-x 2 userid users 1024 Dec 2 12:34 bin <p> -rw------- 1 userid users 10240 May 5 1999 book.doc <p> The permissions of the file are divided into three parts : permissions that the owner has to the file , permissions that the owning group has to the file , and permissions that everybody ( all ) has to the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are displayed . The directory has ( r ) ead and e(x)ecute permission for everyone and the file may only be ( r ) ead and ( w ) ritten by the user and no one else has any rights to it . <p> The permissions are divided into three permission bits for each of the owner , group , and all . The three permission bits are read ( r ) , write ( w ) , and execute ( x ) . The permission bits for directories are not as easy to understand as for files . For a directory , execute permission means that you may traverse through the directory . Read permission on a directory means that you may see the files that are in that directory . A directory with write permission means that you may create new files in the directory . In the example above , anyone may look in the bin directory , but only the user may create files in that directory . <h> Linux Environment <p> Every time you sign on to a Linux system , an environment is created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a working directory with a name in the directory tree . However it can be called " . " as an abbreviation . The environment also contains a list of environment variables each of which has some special meaning . <p> The working directory is a directory in the filesystem . The result of executing some commands ( described in the next section ) depends on the working directory . <p> Environment variables are always translated to upper case . An environment variable is an identifier that is bound to a string . The string is called the value of the environment variable . For instance , the environment variable called TERM identifies the type of terminal you are using . You can see the value of the TERM variable by executing the command : <p> echo $TERM <p> You can set the value of TERM by using the setenv command as follows : <p> setenv TERM xterm <h> Programs <p> Programs are special files that are executable . Programs come in two flavors on Linux : a shell script which is a text file that serves as input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat files on DOS ) , and binary executables . <p> The first program that you execute when you sign-on to a Linux system is a shell . Linux places you in a working directory ( called your home directory ) when you initially sign-on . Linux then invokes a shell and the shell creates some environment variables for you . Your shell will set an environment variable called HOME to the working directory . <p> Your shell searches for executable files using the PATH environment variable . To see what your PATH environment variable is bound to execute the program " echo $PATH " in your shell . You just executed a command called echo . To see where the echo command is located execute the program " which echo " . The which command tells you where the echo program ( or any other program ) was found . Notice that the echo program is built in to your shell . The same is true for the which command . <p> Your shell will let you change your working directory by using the built-in shell command " cd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change your working directory to your working directory . While this does n't make any sense , Linux will let you do it . Linux ( like any operating system ) takes things very literally . A little more interestingly , Linux will let you move up one directory in the file system by typing " cd .. " . To go to a subdirectory , subdir , simply type " cd subdir " . <p> Linux comes with many little programs that make your life easier . However , it 's best to learn them as you find you need them . You can get help for many programs by typing " man prog " where prog is the name of the Linux command that you want to learn more about . Or , you can go to the on-line man pages by clicking here . <p> You need to have some place to start . Here is a list of programs/commands that will get you started . <p> ls - lists the files and directories in the working directory . <p> cd - changes the working directory <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case you get lost or just want to get home quickly . <p> pwd - prints the working directory so you can see where you are <p> mv - moves a directory or file from one location to another <p> rm - removes a file ( be careful ) <p> mkdir - makes a directory <p> rmdir - removes an empty directory <p> vi - a visual editor that is hard for the new user to learn but is fast and very powerful . <p> And remember " man prog " usually gives you more inforamation about a program or command .

@@1543471 <h> A little math and some more game rule writing ! <p> In this lesson students learn how to do the math to find if two items intersect in a game . <p> There is some programming involved in discovering whether a PhotonTorpedo and an Asteroid intersect . <p> Students learn what it takes to begin programming the rules of the game . <h> Blowing Up Asteroids <p> In this lesson you learn what it takes to blow up an asteroid . For a Photon Torpedo to blow up an asteroid it must " hit " the asteroid . This means that the torpedo must be relatively close to the asteroid . We need to know the distance from the asteroid to the torpedo . This picture helps depict what we need to compute . <p> The distance between two objects , in this case a torpedo and an asteroid , can be drawn using a right triangle . If the torpedo is at ( x1 , y1 ) and the asteroid is at ( x2 , y2 ) then the distance between the two can be computed using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c2 . To compute the distance between two points you need to find the length of a and b , then square the two values and add them together . Then take the square root to solve for c . The distance between to points ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y2 ) is computed as <p> distance = math.sqrt ( ( x2 - x1 ) ** 2 + ( y2 - y1 ) ** 2 ) <p> So , to see if a torpedo has hit an asteroid we want to know if the distance is small enough that the torpedo and the asteroid have collided . Since both the torpedo and the asteroid have a radius , we can see if the sum of the two radii is greater than the distance between them . If it is , then the torpedo and the asteroid have collided . <p> Since the collision of two objects needs to be detected for more than just torpedoes and asteroids , we can write a function to check this for us . We 'll call the function intersect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersect and False otherwise . <p> This code should already be in your program just before the main function . <p> Now , we can call that function to see if and asteroid and a torpedo have intersected ( i.e. collided ) . To do this , for each torpedo we must ask if it collides with any asteroid . We can do this with what are called nested for loops . <p> This code goes in the play function . Since it uses the deadbullets list , add it at the end of the play function just before call to set the timer . <p> The code above does two things . It adds the hit asteroids to a list of hit asteroids and the torpedo to a list dead bullets . Then it also sets the dx and dy of the asteroid to a combination of the torpedo and asteroid 's dx and dy . This is so the busted up asteroids move in a nice direction when they are created . <p> When we hit an asteroid two things must happen . The asteroid must bust apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and we must score some points . To keep track of the score we can keep a score variable and we 'll want to display it . To display the score we need to create a label and put it in the GUI window . Here is the code to do that . <p> This code should go in the main function right after the frame.pack line . <p> To bust up the asteroids , we must go through the list of hit asteroids and bust them up . This means that if the asteroid is big enough we 'll delete the current asteroid and replace it with two smaller asteroids . Otherwise , the asteroid just disappears . At the same time we 'll update the score . <p> When an asteroids breaks apart , the direction of each of the smaller asteroids is made to be perpendicular to the direction of the bullet and original asteroid it hit . <p> This code goes in the play function after building the list of hit asteroids . <p> If everything has gone well , you are now shooting asteroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of points you 've accumulated . The only problem is that at this point , the asteroids ca n't hurt the spaceship . <h> Have More Time ? <p> It 's possible to make the asteroids rotate with just a few lines of code . Rotating asteroids makes the game just a little more realistic and interesting . <p> Since an asteroid is a turtle , changing the heading of the asteroid has the effect of rotating it . In the init method of the asteroid you can create a random number between 0 and 5 with a call to the random.random() function . This can be stored in the object by writing <p> self.rotation = random.random() * 5 <p> Then , in the move function you 'll want to rotate the asteroid by that amount by calling setheading . To do this you 'll have to get the current heading and add the random rotation amount to it . <p> **28;505;TOOLONG ( ) +self.rotation ) <h> What 's Next ? <p> Next time we 'll make the program keep track of our lives and recognize when the game is over .

So , explode ( " hi " ) would yield # " h " , # " i " . HINT : How do you get the first character of a string ? <p> Define a datatype for integer lists . A list is constructed of a head and a tail . Sometimes this constructor is called cons . The empty list is also a list and is usually called nil . However , in this practice problem , to distinguish from the built-in nil you could call it nil . <p> Write a function called maxIntList that returns the maximum integer found in one of the lists you just defined in practice problem 5.12 . You can consult appendix B for help with finding the max of two integers . <p> One way of proving that the fib function given above is exponential is to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two exponential functions . In other words , there is an exponential function of n that will always return less than the number of calls required to compute fib(n) and there is another exponential function that always returns greater than the number of required calls to compute fib(n) for some choice of starting n and all values greater than it . If the number of calls to compute fib(n) lies in between then the fib function must have exponential complexity . Find two exponential functions of the form that bound the number of calls required to compute fib(n) . <p> Consider the reverse function from practice problem 5.10 . The append function is called n times , where n is the length of the list . How many cons operations happen each time append is called ? What is the overall complexity of the reverse function ? <p> Use the accumulator pattern to devise a more efficient reverse function . The append function is not used in the efficient reverse function . HINT : What are we trying to accumulate ? What is the identity of that operation ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction are instantiated to dummy types ( X1 , X2 , ... ) <p> This warning message is OK . It is telling you that to complete the type inference for this expression , SML had to instantiate a type variable to a dummy variable . When more type information is available , SML would not need to do this . The warning message only applies to the specific case where you created a function by invoking ( map map ) . In the presence of more information the type inference system will interpret the type correctly without any dummy variables . <p> Write a function called depth that prints the longest path in a binary tree . First create the datatype for a binary tree . You can use the Int.max function in your solution , which returns the maximum of two integers . <p> First write a non-cps depth function , then write a cps cpsdepth function . <p> In the exercises below you are encouraged to write other functions that may help you in your solutions . You might have better luck with some of the harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in the solution to the harder problem . <p> You may wish to put your solutions to these problems in a file and then <p> - use " thefile " ; <p> in SML . This will make writing the solutions easier . You can try the solutions out by placing tests right within the same file . You should always comment any code you write . Comments in SML are preceded with a ( * and terminated with a * ) . <p> Reduce by normal order and applicative order reduction strategies . Show the steps . <p> How does the SML interpreter respond to evaluating each of the following expressions ? Evaluate each of these expression in ML and record what the response of the ML interpreter is . <p> 8 div 3 ; <p> 8 mod 3 ; <p> " hi " " there " ; <p> 8 mod 3 = 8 div 3 orelse 4 div 0 = 4 ; <p> 8 mod 3 = 8 div 3 andalso 4 div 0 = 4 ; <p> Describe the behavior of the orelse operator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may use nested if expressions . Be sure to try your solution to see you get the same result . <p> Describe the behavior of the andalso operator in exercise 2 by writing an equivalent if then expression . Again you can use nested if expressions . <p> Write an expression that converts a character to a string . <p> Write an expression that converts a real number to the next lower integer . <p> Write an expression that converts a character to an integer . <p> Write an expression that converts an integer to a character . <p> What is the signature of the following functions ? Give the signature and an example of using each function . <p> hd <p> tl <p> explode <p> concat <p> : : - This is an infix operator . Use the prefix form of op : : to get the signature . <p> The greatest common divisor of two numbers , and , can be defined recursively . If is zero then is the greatest common divisor . Otherwise , the greatest common divisor of and is equal to the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recursive function called gcd to determine the greatest common divisor of and . <p> Write a recursive function called allCaps that given a string returns a capitalized version of the string . <p> Write a recursive function called firstCaps that given a list of strings , returns a list where the first letter of each of the original strings is capitalized . <p> Using pattern matching , write a recursive function called swap that swaps every pair of elements in a list . So , if 1,2,3,4,5 is given to the function it returns 2,1,4,3,5 . <p> Using pattern matching , write a function called rotate that rotates a list by elements . So , rotate ( 3 , 1,2,3,4,5 ) would return 4,5,1,2,3 . <p> Use pattern matching to write a recursive function called delete that deletes the letter from a string . So , delete ( 3 , " Hi there " ) returns " Hi here " . HINT : This might be easier to do if it were a list . <p> Again , using pattern matching write a recursive function called intpow that computes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rotate function of exercise 14 calling it rotate2 to use a helper function so as to guarantee complexity where is the number of positions to rotate . <p> Rewrite exercise 14s rotate ( n , lst ) function calling it rotate3 to guarantee that less than rotations are done where is the length of the list . However , the outcome of rotate should be the same as if you rotated n times . For instance , calling the function as rotate3 ( 6 , 1,2,3,4,5 ) should return 2,3,4,5,1 with less than 5 recursive calls to rotate3 . <p> Rewrite the delete function from exercise 15 calling it delete2 so that it is curried . <p> Write a function called delete5 that always deletes the fifth character of a string . <p> Use a higher-order function to find all those elements of a list of integers that are even . <p> Use a higher-order function to find all those strings that begin with a lower case letter . <p> Use a higher-order function to write the function allCaps from exercise 11 . <p> Write a function called find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file named file that contain the string s . You can print the lines to TextIO.stdOut . The file should exist and should be in the current directory . <p> Write a higher-order function called transform that applies the same function to all elements of a list transforming it to the new values . However , if an exception occurs when transforming an element of the list , the original value in the given list should be used . For instance , <p> The natural numbers can be defined as the set of terms constructed from and the where is a natural number . Write a datatype called Natural that can be used to construct natural numbers like this . Use the capital letter O for your zero value so as not to be confused with the integer in SML . <p> Write a convert(x) function that given a natural number like that defined in exercise 26 returns the integer equivalent of that value . <p> Define a function called add ( x , y ) that given x and y , two natural numbers as described in exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of x and y . For example , <p> - add ( succ ( succ(O) ) , succ(O) ) val it = succ ( succ ( succ(O) ) ) : Natural <p> You may NOT use convert or any form of it in your solution . <p> Define a function called mul ( x , y ) that given x and y , two natural numbers as described in exercise 26 , returns a natural that represents the product of x and y . You may NOT use convert or any form of it in your solution . <p> Using the add function in exercise 28 , write a new function hadd that uses the higher order function called foldr to add together a list of natural numbers . <p> The prefix calculator intpreter presented at the end of this chapter can be implemented a little more concisely by having the parser not only parse the prefix expression , but also evaluate the expression at the same time . If this is to be done , the parser ends up returning a unit because the parser does not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means the definition of the AST is no longer needed . Rewrite the prefix calculator code presented at the end of this chapter to combine the parse and eval functions . Remove any unneeded code from your implementation but be sure to cover all the error conditions as the version presented in this chapter . <p> Alter the prefix expression calculator to accept either integers or floating point numbers as input . The result should always be a float in this implementation . <p> Add an input operator to the prefix calculator . In this version , expressions like + S I 5 when evaluated would prompt the user to enter a value when the I was encountered . This expression , when evaluated , would cause the program to respond as follows . <p> The prefix calculator intrepeter presented in this chapter can be transformed into a prefix calculator compiler by having the program write a file called a.casm with a CoCo program that when run evaluates the compiled prefix calculator expression . Alter the code at the end of this chapter to create a prefix caclulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For an extra hard project , combine the previous two exercises into one prefix calc compiler whose programs when run can gather input from the user to be used in the calculation . <p> Rewrite the prefix calculator project to single thread the memory location through the eval function as shown in figure 5.12 . Completing this project removes the imperatively updated memory location from the code and replaces it with a single-threaded argument to the eval function . <p> These are solutions to the practice problems . You should only consult these answers after you have tried each of them for yourself first . Practice problems are meant to help reinforce the material you have just read so make use of them . <p> Addition is not commutative in Pascal or Java . The problem is that a function call , which may be one or both of the operands to the addition operator , could have a side-effect . In that case , the functions must be called in order . If no order is specified within expression evaluation then you cant even reliably write code with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem with side-effects within code . In the code below , it was observed that when the code was compiled with one C++ compiler it printed 1,2 while with another compiler it printed 1,1 . In this case , the language definition is the problem . The C++ language definition does n't  say what should happen in this case . The decision is left to the compiler writer . <p> int x = 1 ; cout &lt;&lt; x++ &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl ; <p> The practice problem writes 17 as written . If the expression were b+a() then 15 would be written . <p> The second solution will cause a pattern match nonexhaustive warning . That should be avoided , but is OK in this case . The second solution will raise a pattern match exception if an empty list is given to the function . See the section on exception handling for a better solution to this problem . <p> The first step in the solution is to determine the number of calls required for values of n . Consulting figure 5.14 shows us that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , 15 , 25 , etc . The next number in the sequence can be found by adding together two previous plus one more for the initial call . <p> The solution is that for the function bounds the number of calls on the lower side while bounds it on the upper side . Therefore , the number of calls increases exponentially . <p> The cons operation is called times where is the length of the first list when append is called . When reverse is called it calls append with elements in the first list the first time . The first recursive call to reverse calls append with elements in the first list . The second recursive call to reverse calls append with elements in the first list . If we add up ... we end up with . Multiplying this out leads to an term and the overall complexity of reverse is . <p> The first takes a list of lists of integers and adds one to each integer of each list in the list of lists . <p> The second function takes a list of functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The function returns a list of functions that all take an a list argument . The example below might help . The list of functions that is returned by ( map map ) is suitable to be used as an argument to the construction function discussed earlier in the chapter .

We have been up to quite a lot here in Trujillo ! We are all settling into a nice routine and getting comfortable with our families . Each family has been so wonderful and they are sharing so many wonderful things with us ! We are truly getting acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in Peru ! ) Here is a little recap on a few of the amazing experiences we have had thus far : <h> Working in the Hospital <p> After learning a lot about the hierarchy of the pecking order in the hospital in Peru , we are all finding our place in different departments . We are spread out all over the hospital and are all learning different things . For example , we have students in areas like surgery , psychiatry , pediatrics , gynecology , and obstetrics . We are simply observing and trying to pick up new Spanish vocab words . It is a different experience for each one of us and we are all gaining a different perspective . <h> Class <p> We spend two hours every day , Monday through Friday , in an official class structure . However , we are learning so much more in addition to the specified class time . During class , we start by sharing new vocabulary words we heard during our observations in the hospital that morning . Then we move on to learning some new vocab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also spend time in class learning about different ethical pieces about interpreting during a medical interview as well as learning about different medical conditions like diabetes . We are getting a little burst of knowledge in everything . <h> History of Peruvian Medicine and Literature <p> Each day after class , we have an hour of a cultural event . We switch between a discussion of a cultural topic and a dance lesson . So far we have had discussions of the history of Peruvian medicine and a brief overview of Peruvian literature in comparison to United States literature . We learned about different types of medicine from pre-Inca natural herbs to today 's insurance system in Peru . Talk about an incomprehensive hour ! In our literature chat , we learned how Peruvian literature first began being written after coming from a tradition of oral telling of stories . We also learned about famous Peruvian authors like Cesar Vallejo , who is the Peruvian equivalent of Walt Whitman , and Julio Ram+n Ribeyro , who is the Peruvian equivalent of Edger Allen Poe . Our brains are certainly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dance Class <p> On other days , for our cultural time , we have a dance lesson in the Marinera : the traditional dance of Trujillo . We started the day of our dance lesson by going to a Horse Show where the horses danced with the people . The horses are so smooth when they are stepping with the music that the rider can hold a glass of Pisco - the Peruvian alcohol - without spilling a drop ! We got to see beautiful Marinera dancing and then upon returning to our school we got to try our hand at the basic steps of the Marinera ! Everyone did very well and it was fun to be more immersed in the culture . We have several more days of lessons so hopefully we can all come back to the States Marinera pros ! <h> Conversation Club <p> Twice a week , we stay at the school later to participate in what the English School , El Cultural , calls Conversation Club .

We delved into the Moche culture , transporting us back to the years 1CE to 800CE , by discovering their Moon and Sun temples for ourselves . We started the morning off seeing how the Moche people made their ceramic pots and learning how a German Archeologist came to Trujillo and unearthed the entombed Moche ruins . He and his team spent many years cleaning off the ruins and interpreting what the story beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins are preserved due to the layered construction style of the Moche people , where they created each level on top and around the other levels . This helped to prevent the inner artwork from being harmed by environmental factors over the years . We also were lucky to visit the recently opened museum of the Moche ruins that had on display many of the artifacts found in the archeological dig . It was amazing to see everything be completely authentic and truly get a hint of the flavor of the thriving civilization that was the Moche people . <p> We also got to visit the Chimu ruins which were completely open-air and beautiful . The Chimu Civilization thrived between the 12th and 15th century , just before the Inca civilization . The ruins we visited was a fort built very close to the ocean ! Enclosed in the massive walls of this fort was a city . The first opening was the gran plaza , which is a big open space allowing for multi-purpose uses . The fort had three plazas in total and a beautiful room for audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has intricate decorations built into the clay of the foundation .

It is quite amazing how places like this were covered mostly by sand , lost to the world for years . Then after being rediscovered , they are being maintained for us to continue to learn from their rich history . <p> After learning about the Moche and Chimu civilization which both pre-dated that of the Inca civilization , we headed to the beach . We ate an amazing lunch where some of our crew was daring enough to try the traditional Ceviche , fish , of Trujillo . Anna Larson really enjoyed it : ) After lunch we took on the waves of Trujillo ! The difficulty was that the sand on the beach was mostly covered in rocks more than sand .

The Zulu Empire continued to be a regional power until the British annexed Zululand in 1884 . <h> Luther College 's Zulu Connection <p> Norwegian missionaries in Zululand established mission stations , permanent compounds including churches , schools , and housing for the missionaries and Zulu employees . The first Norwegian missionary , Hans Schreuder , was alone ; other pastors and their families joined him over the years . His successor in 1883 was Nils Astrup , joined by his brother Hans in 1884 . <p> Hans and Nils Astrup had a unique relationship with Luther College ; their brother-in-law , Laur Larsen , was the college 's first president . Nils hosted two of President Larsen 's daughters , Marie and Hanna , while they served as schoolteachers at the Schreuder Mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decorah . She later published a book and donated her collection of Zulu objects to the college . <h> Zulu Clothing <p> Zulu clothes were different than European clothes . Children regularly wore nothing , and women wore only a black leather skirt . Men wore a belt from which hung a snuff bag and had aprons in front and rear . While in the military , men wore large collars of cattle tails , with two more tails tied at their knees as shin guards , loincloths , and headdresses of ostrich feathers . Zulu clothing or lack thereof shocked most European newcomers to Zululand . <p> Mission stations required Zulus to wear the approved European-style clothing . By 1897 , many women bought cotton for clothing , marking a success for the missionaries . In addition , colonial employers hired Africans only if they wore Western clothing , thus signaling their missionary education . However , Zulus masquerading as mission-educated took advantage of their employers . These men would find salaried work and work that job for some time , only to quit and return to Zululand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had earned to purchase cattle , entering the traditional cattle economy . <h> The British Colonial Expansion <p> In 1873 , the British colonial governor officially presided over the coronation of the new Zulu king , Cetshwayo , in exchange for his signature on a constitution calling for checks on his power . Cetshwayo ignored the constitution and violated his promises . After failed attempts at diplomacy , the British colonial army attacked , starting the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 . In less than eight months , Great Britain defeated the Zulu and formally annexed Zululand as a colony in 1884 . <h> The Missionaries ' Role <p> Missionaries worked to make Christianity acceptable to Zulus , a process necessitating that obstacles to conversion be removed . After thirty years of little success , the missionaries began seeing the king 's authority as the last obstacle to mass conversion . The Norwegian Bishop of Missions mediated between the new Zulu king and the colonial government to arrange the former 's coronation . The coronation began a series of events that culminated in Zululand 's annexation by Great Britain . Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity ; Zulus did not convert en masse as hoped . <p> This display was exhibited in Koren in 2012 , converted for web exhibit 2013 by Jess Landgraf ( ' 14 ) .

@@1543514 <p> In this section we will describe the paths that water can take to the basin outlet . We will look at details about surface runoff , interflow , and pre-event water .

In fact the soil can be quite dry , but soil properties or land cover do not allow for infiltration to keep up with high rainfall or snowmelt rates . <p> Saturation excess overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer any space for water to infiltrate . This can occur even with soil that would typically allow for large amounts of infiltration in sub-saturated conditions . <h> Infiltration Excess Overland Flow <p> Infiltration excess occurs when the rate of rainfall or snowmelt is greater than the infiltration capacity . The water that can not infiltrate becomes surface runoff . <p> For example , if the infiltration capacity is 15 millimeters per hour and the rainfall rate is 25 millimeters per hour , then the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity by 10 millimeters per hour . That 10 millimeters per hour becomes infiltration excess overland flow , even if the underlying soil is dry . <p> Infiltration excess is most commonly observed with short-duration intense rainfall . It also occurs most often in areas with high clay content or where the surface has been altered by soil compaction , urbanization , or fire . <h> Saturation Excess Overland Flow <p> Saturation excess occurs when the soil layers have become saturated and no further water can infiltrate . <p> It is most common with long-duration , gentle-to-moderate rainfall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . <p> For example , consider a storm that produces a steady rainfall rate of 10 millimeters per hour for four hours . After three hours of infiltration the soil becomes saturated . In the fourth hour , the 10 mm/hr rainfall rate can not infiltrate the saturated soil and becomes saturation excess overland flow . <p> Saturation excess overland flow can occur anywhere the soil is wet . It is most common in humid climates with gently sloped or flat basins . <p> Here we see a farm field where the soil can typically absorb a large amount of water . The standing water in relatively light rainfall suggests that soil saturation is preventing further infiltration of rainwater . Saturation excess overland flow is the result . <h> Interflow <p> Interflow , also known as subsurface stormflow , is relatively rapid flow toward the stream channel that occurs below the surface . It occurs more rapidly than baseflow , but typically more slowly than surface runoff . In some cases interflow may be as important as surface runoff for forecasting rapid rises in the stream channel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain , interflow may be the dominant process by which streams react quickly to rainfall or snowmelt . <p> This process is most likely to occur in humid , deep-soil areas . However , significant interflow contribution may occur in thin-soiled regions when there is an impermeable layer such as bedrock beneath the more permeable surface soil layer . <h> Transmissivity Feedback <p> Click the image above to view animation . <p> One runoff process that contributes to interflow is transmissivity feedback . This occurs when a network of macropores is activated following rapid infiltration . <p> Macropores and natural pipes are void spaces in the soil that provide preferential pathways for water to move downslope . Decayed plant roots , burrowing insects and animals , and chemical reactions between water and soil minerals are a few ways that macropores form . <p> Macropore networks are more likely in deep-soiled areas with considerable organic materials . Thus , humid climates are more likely to have substantial interflow through macropore networks . <h> Soil-Bedrock Interface <p> The presence of a soil-bedrock interface enhances interflow . The soil-bedrock interface typically occurs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the underlying bedrock . Rainwater or snowmelt infiltrates rapidly to the bedrock interface and then moves rapidly downslope along the interface . <p> Sometimes a feature called a fragipan exists . A fragipan layer has low permeability , like rock or clay , and may also serve to focus the lateral subsurface flow . Fragipan features can exist at relatively shallow depths and play an important role in enhancing both interflow and even surface runoff after the soil layers above the fragipan are saturated . <h> Groundwater Ridging <p> Groundwater ridging is yet another mechanism that contributes to runoff . <p> Groundwater ridging is a process that occurs in sloped drainage basins where the water table is much closer to the surface near the stream channel than it is further away from the stream . <p> Rainwater or snowmelt reaches the groundwater level near the stream channel more quickly than it does further up the hill away from the stream . The water table begins to rise near the stream channel more quickly than it does further away , creating a groundwater ridge close to the stream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more rapid interflow to the stream . <p> In some cases the groundwater ridge can reach the soil surface and contribute to surface runoff through saturation excess overland flow . <h> Pre-Event Water <p> Click the image above to view animation . <p> Some of the interflow that quickly finds its way to the stream is not necessarily from the current rainfall . In these cases there is considerable water already in the soil layers that gets displaced as new water infiltrates . The water that appears in the stream immediately following a rainfall or rapid snowmelt period may be from previous precipitation events , or pre-event water . In humid climates , studies have shown that pre-event water is often the greatest contributor to rapid rises in stream level . <h> 8 .

@@1543534 <p> In his work " Dynamics of Faith " theologian and philosopher of religion , Paul Tillich examines the nature of what it means for a person to have faith . In the first chapter entitled " What Faith is " Tillich argues that faith is a state of being ultimately concerned about something unconditionally . On the first page Tillich states " Faith is the sate of being ultimatelly concerned ...... If it ( the object of faith ) claims ultimacy it demands the total surrender of him who accepts this claim , and it promises total fulfillment even if all others have claim to be subjected to it or rejected in its name " ( Tillich , 1 ) . Tillich goes on to explain that this unconditional concern can take religious or non-religious form . He gives the example of Jewish faith in the Lord God as a form of ultimated concern expressed religiously , and the concern for money and social status as a non-religious form of faith . For the individual faith is concern with what is considered to be of infinite importance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faith is a centering act of the entire personality . Tillich states " Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality . It happens in the center of the personal life and includes all its elements " ( Tillich , 4 ) . Therefore to Tillich , faith is something integrative to the life of the person . He says that includes all elements of the personality , both conscious and unconscious , although it is a conscious act , it causes the unconscious elements of the personality are taken into the center of the personality and they transcend themselves . <p> This integration ever takes on doubt . Doubt is integrated with all other elements of the personality . An elements of doubt is important to faith because it gives a " inspite of " character to faith . The individual continues to have faith although they do not have total surety as to whether or not their faith is misplaced . This makes faith an act of courage . <p> Having defined what faith is , Tillich then describes what faith is no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a false distortion that has arisen for Schleimacher 's notion of a felling of absolute dependence ; this notion of faith has relegated to the emotional and cut out the intellectual . It is not merely an intellectual assent to certain beliefs as was the scholastic distortion and it is not volintaristic as was the Protestant distortion . Tillich holds the being an act of the total personality it incorporates all of the above elements into the creation of true faith . <p> Tillich goes on to discuss the object of faith which are symbols which expresses the ultimate concern in a concert finite way . The symbols work in a story form and express a mythology . Symbols arise from the collective unconscious and genuine standing in the human mind . Only myth can express the ultimate concern and broken myth ( which is a myth properly interpreted ) can continue to express the ultimate concern in so far as it is understood properly . <p> He discuses different kinds of faith and tells us that they have unity in so far as they focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science , history , and philosophy . He states that if the ultimate concern is really ultimate it will not be bothered by the conclusions history , science or philosophy . After all , the symbolic form which the ultimate concern is not he ultimate itself , but only a way to expres that which is ultimate . A faith is true only if it expresses that which is ultimate . <p> In the last section , Tillich discusses the nature of the life of faith . In it he discusses the nature of faith as having courage . That is there is an " inspite of " element of faith . Secondly , he restates faith 's integrative quality . Faith is an integrator of personality . Finally , he states that faith always excises in community with others and that the community 's faith and symbols are expressed in the indivudual . <p> B. Analysis and Criticism <p> Overall , Tillich 's argument about the nature of faith seems to be consistent . Nevertheless , there seems to be problems with the understanding of symbols . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken myth , do no those symbols cease to have power ? He believes that they continue to have power because they merely mediate between what is really ultimate and the finitude of the behavior . Although this may work in the case of Judaism and Christianity , which are religion based purely on the intervention of God in history ? <p> Christianity and Judaism both point to specific acts of God in history as sources for their religions . For Christians in particular the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are a matter of ultimate concern . If not , many Christian apologist have argued-the first one being St. Paul - our faith is in vain , God has no given us any kind of relevation or salvation from Jesus Christ . When the story that has given the community meaning has lost it 's empirical basis , the community tends to find another concert element to focus on . Christian communities for example , that have relegated the resurrection to the status of myth usually cease to see it as a matter of ultimate concern . Instead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate concern . <p> Overall , Tillich fails to provide an empirical basis for religion . The non-historical religions as were mention before have an empirical basis for religion in meditation , that is to say their experience of the ultimate is concert because they have empirically experienced it . The . Judeo-Christian tradition was provided with such a basis by history . If their " Sacred History " is relegated to myth they have no concert basis for religion .

@@1543540 <h> What Is Diversity ? <p> Diversity describes the similarities and differences that people have . Luther is actively committed to educating people from diverse backgrounds and to creating a campus environment where people are treated fairly and encouraged to develop the skills that they need to interact with people from different cultures and backgrounds . Luther College developed a definition of diversity to promote a common understanding of the term . <h> Defining Diversity <p> Diversity encompasses complex differences and similarities in perspectives , identities , and points of view among members of an institution as well as among individuals who make up the wider community . Diversity includes important and interrelated dimensions of human identity such as race , ethnicity , gender , gender identity and expression , socio-economic status , nationality , citizenship , religion , sexual orientation , ability and age . These differences are important to understand but they can not be used to predict any individual 's values , choices or responses . <h> Understanding Difference <p> Understanding differences involves recognizing and appreciating the intercultural dynamics , social identities , and the wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of understanding diversity that is often overlooked is that it includes similarities as well as differences . Understanding that we have similar interests or beliefs can encourage cooperation and cohesion . A commitment to understanding and appreciating differences recognizes that disparities in social and economic opportunity among groups often reflect the continuing impact of racism , sexism , and other forms of prejudice and bigotry . <h> Valuing Diversity <p> Valuing diversity involves understanding how overlapping and multiple identities relate to patterns of socialization and affiliation . These patterns influence the way people understand and interpret the world . Diversity enhances the intellectual , emotional , economic , moral , and spiritual life of the community . Achieving a more diverse learning environment is seen as a way to improve education for all students while promoting respect for each of us as individuals .

@@1543552 <h> NWSRFS Components <p> The calibration system of the NWSRFS contains historic streamflow data which are used to establish model parameters . Once such parameters are found , they become the basis for real-time operational model input . <p> The operational forecast system takes model parameters that are updated for current conditions and combines this information with real-time river data as input to the hydrologic model . Model output is used for short-term forecasts and then used to update parameters for future simulations . <p> The interactive forecast system allows the hydrologist to adjust and prepare products and forecasts . <p> The ensemble streamflow prediction component is used to prepare long-term river forecasts based on historic weather and climatic conditions . In this case , a probabilistic value is added to the forecast . <h> NWSRFS Operational Subcomponents <p> The operational forecast system within the NWSRFS is composed of six subcomponents . There is a rain and snow operations component , a snow model , a hydrologic model ( such as the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model ) , a unit hydrograph operations component , an adjustment component to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component . <p> Observed data are critical for the Rain-Snow Operation , Snow Model , and Adjustment Technique sections of the operational forecast system . <h> Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ( SACSMA ) Model <p> The Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model called SACSMA , is a spatially lumped continuous accounting model . This is one of the hydrologic models used in NWSRFS . <p> The term spatially-lumped means that the model views a particular drainage area as a single unit and uses mean basin precipitation , evaporation , temperature , basin topography , and soil characteristics as inputs . Outputs include direct runoff , surface runoff , baseflow , interflow , and evapotranspiration . <p> Continuous means that the model variables that account for soil moisture are updated on a day-to-day basis . This allows for creation of an ongoing model condition of soil moisture . <p> The SACSMA model is ideally suited for the simulation of large drainage basinsgreater than 1,000 square kilometers . Because the model simulates storm runoff as well as baseflow , it is also useful for water supply estimates . <p> Additional inputs to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lakes , and river junctions . <h> SACSMA Model Components <p> The SACSMA model divides each basin into a surface boundary and two vertical zones to represent soil moisture . The upper zone is for short-term storage , while the lower zone is for most of the soil moisture and for longer-term groundwater storage . <p> Rainfall that falls on the impermeable surfaces becomes direct runoff . Precipitation may infiltrate into the soil matrix as modeled in the permeable component of the model . <p> The soil moisture in each zone can exist either as tension water , which is held within the soil matrix by capillary forces or gravity water , which drains freely from the soil matrix . <p> Tension water is an important concept in the SACSMA model . When the tension water requirements are satisfied , the upper zone is saturated . Any additional water is now gravity water . Gravity water is subject to removal by evapotranspiration , percolation , interflow , or surface runoff . Tension water can only be removed by evapotranspiration . Baseflow accounts for the rest of the soil water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall hydrograph . The faster responding parts , such as direct runoff , can be seen as those layers on top of slower-responding components , such as surface runoff , interflow , and baseflow . Together , all of the components combine and influence the shape of a calculated hydrograph . <p> This approach provides flexibility when calibrating or adjusting the computed hydrograph to match the observed data . Each component can be examined separately and adjusted to match the observed hydrograph . <h> Additional Resources : <h> The Antecedent Precipitation Index ( API ) Model <p> The Antecedent Precipitation Index ( API ) offers another useful model for producing flood forecasts on a storm-by-storm basis . The API model is a statistical method to estimate the amount of surface runoff that will occur from a basin from a given rainstorm . The index is based on physical characteristics of the basin , time of year , storm duration , and rainfall amount . <p> Procedures based on the API have been successfully used for many years by River Forecast Centers ( RFCs ) of NOAAs National Weather Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one RFC uses the API model operationally . <h> API Applications <p> The API based rainfall-runoff model offers a simple method to estimate storm runoff . When properly applied , it generally does a good job forecasting storm specific floods . <p> The API model is not suitable for water supply estimates however because it is event-based only . In other words , a streamflow estimate can be derived only when a storm occurs . For water supply estimates we must examine continuous streamflow using a continuous accounting approach , such as that used by the Sacramento model . <h> The Continuous API Model <p> Click the image above to view animation . <p> The Continuous API model uses a series of equations mapped to four quadrants , a method similar to the event-based API . However , unlike the event-based API , extra computations are required to calculate baseflow . <p> Each quadrant represents one component of the hydrologic model : <p> soil moisture <p> surface moisture <p> incremental surface runoff <p> groundwater storage <p> In this model , soil moisture is defined as water stored within the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetation , surface depression storage , and any other surface moisture storage . <p> The first quadrant accounts for the seasonal relationship between the initial API value and current soil moisture conditions within a basin . <p> The value from the first quadrant is used to enter the second quadrant , which accounts for surface moisture conditions . <p> The second quadrant value is then used to enter the third quadrant . Here the incremental surface runoff is determined based on surface and overall soil-moisture conditions . <p> The next step is to use the third quadrant value to enter the fourth quadrant . This step finds the amount of water that is added to groundwater storage . <p> At this point , additional equations are used to compute baseflow runoff based on the conditions determined from the four quadrants . Baseflow runoff is based on existing groundwater storage and the amount of water that has recently entered groundwater storage . <p> This model offers various options such as the ability to account for the effect of frozen ground on runoff , and to make allowances for impervious area runoff and riparian vegetation losses before finally estimating the streamflow.

I would recommend that you watch the video and then read the section of the text that goes along with the video for a more detailed explanation of the concepts in that section . <p> In addition , there are practice exercises in each section of the text ( with answers at the end of the chapter ) that you can use to test your understanding material . Use these exercises to motivate your reading of the text . <p> The first chapter is about 30 pages long and contains a variety of learning objectives . This is perhaps the most broadly focused of the chapters in the text . Its goal is to give you some basis for talking about computer programming and to give you a gentle introduction to the process of writing programs . Specifically , the learning objectives of the first chapter are outlined below . <p> Section 1.3 - In this section of the text you use the Wing IDE to write a simple program . You learn the steps that you must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run it . <p> Section 1.4 - In this section you learn a little about the architecture of a computer and some general terms to use when talking about computer programs . <p> In chapter 2 you learn how to make decisions in your programs using if statements . An if statements alters the sequence of executed statements depending on a condition . You also learn about the guess and check pattern of computation . This pattern is important to learn and memorize because you use it over and over in programs you write . Learning objectives for this chapter are outlined below . <p> Sections 2.1 &amp; 2.2 - Here you learn about the guess and check pattern of computation . You can watch this video that goes along with these chapters . <p> Sections 2.3 , 2.4 , &amp; 2.5 - In these sections you learn about choosing from a list of alternatives , Boolean values , and short-circuit logic . The video below helps to further explain these concepts . <p> Section 2.6 - In this section we learn that floating point numbers are only approximations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when comparing floats for equality . It is likely that two floats will be close to the same value , but not exactly the same value , even when we would like them to be equal . The video below helps to illustrate this problem and the solution to it . <p> In exercise 2 of chapter 3 the problem asks you to write a menu driven address book program . You can use this text file as the data file for your address book or you can create one yourself . Just be sure to use the same format as is presented in the book for your records within the file . <p> In chapter 3 you learn how to repeatedly execute code in programs so you can process repetitive data . This is where computers really are important , since people do n't  like to do the same thing over and over again . Computers are good at doing the same thing over and over . Again , there are video lectures below that complement the text . <p> Sections 3.1 &amp; 3.2 - You should read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections you learn about sequences and how to iterate over them . <p> Section 3.3 - In this section you learn about nested for loops . Nested for loops are when you have one loop inside another loop . <p> Section 3.4 - In this section of the text you learn how to use the guess and check pattern when a list is involved . <p> Sections 3.5 &amp; 3.6 - In these sections of the text you learn about the accumulator pattern and how to use it to count or add together a list of numbers . <p> In chapter 4 you learn about objects and how to create objects and call methods on them . The chapter uses turtle graphics and XML parsing as two examples where many objects are created and methods are called . <p> Sections 4.1 to 4.3 - The introduction and these sections of the text show you how to use modules in Python and how to create some objects . This video complements these sections of the text . <p> Plotting Data - In this video you learn how to use turtle graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this video I read the file called djia-100.txt . This file is provided here for you to download if you want to try out my example . <p> Section 4.8 - In this section of the text you learn about dictionaries in Python . It shows you how to create a dictionary , put a key/value pair in dictionary , and how to lookup a key in a dictionary to get its value . The video below demonstrates these concepts as well . <p> Sections 4.6 to 4.9 - In these sections of the text you learn how to read and parse through the information in an XML file . XML documents are used in many different applications these days and understanding what an XML document is and how to read it in a program is a valuable skill . The video below helps to illustrate these ideas . This video use an XML file called kml.kml as an example . That file can be downloaded here if you want to try my example . <p> Section 4.7 - In this section of the text I show you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attributes are recorded as a dictionary so you 'll want to know what a dictionary is first ( see section 4.8 and its video above ) . In the video that goes along with this section I read a couple of XML files called biking3-15-2012.tcx and workouts.tcx . You can download these files here if you want to try my examples , but these files are large and a little unwieldy . You might start with some smaller XML files first ( see the exercises at the end of the chapter in the text ) . <p> In chapter 4 there are several programming problems that must read data from a file . In a few cases , some code is provided to get you started . Each exercises extra files are provided below . <p> Exercises 2 , 3 , and 4 require you to read an XML file containing a picture . The XML file can be generated by using this drawing program , written in Python . You can download this program and run it with Python 3 to be able to draw a picture and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 use mileage and fuel data from a 2007 Toyota 4Runner , a 2007 Nissan Versa , and a 2007 Suzuki S40 motorcycle . These two programs require you to read one of these data files below . This data was exported from a program called Gas Cubby that is available as an iPhone/iPod Touch App . <p> Chapter 6 introduces Tkinter programming through an example Reminder application . Documentation for the Tkinter API can be found here . You can download the Reminder.py code from the example in that chapter here . Exercise 4 requires you to create an XML file to hold the reminder notes when the program is terminated and for the program to read when the application is started . You can use the format found below for your XML file . Name the file " Reminders.xml " and place the xml file in the same directory or folder as your program . You can begin this exercise by downloading the Reminder.py program from the link above and then modifying the code to read from an XML file using the minidom parser described in chapter 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write method like the code in Reminder.py already does . Of course , you need to modify the code to write the file in this XML format so it can be read by the minidom parser . <p> One thing to be aware of : When using double quotes ( i.e. " ) in strings , you can you single quotes ( i.e. ) to delimit those strings . Python let 's you use either double or single quotes to delimit strings and this is one instance where using single quotes will come in handy . <p> One other thing to be aware of : Sometimes exception handling code ( i.e. try except statements ) get in the way of debugging your code . You may want to remove ( or just comment out ) the try except statements in the Reminders.py program before making modifications to it so you can see what errors occur when you make the modifications for this assignment . You should put the try except statements back in once you have debugged your code . <p> The first sample program is a drawing application . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second example is a bouncing ball program and that code can be downloaded here . The bouncing ball program needs the soccerball.gif file to run . You might also like to make kitties bounce around , so kitty.gif is also provided . <p> Chapter 7 includes an exercise on developing an asteroids application . There are five lessons that will take you through developing this application . The five lessons below can be followed to implement the basic asteroids application . As part of the assignment in the text , you are to implement one more level to the application when level 1 is completed . <p> In addition to the exercises at the end of chapter 7 I have had students implement a minesweeper game . This web page provides a sample as a compiled Python program and provides students with directions for completing the application from the starter code that is provided to them .

@@1543562 <p> The belief of impermanence is instrumental in the understanding of Buddhist traditions . Impermanence , the continually changing nature of all beings and objects , affects the view of self . The Buddhist story of the monk Channa gives us a look at important aspects that relate to the idea of Self in Buddhism . Channa begs the elders to explain this concept to him . Strong quotes the elders saying , " Brother Channa , physical form is impermanent , perceptions arelimpermanent , karmic constituents are impermanent , consciousness is impermanent " ( Strong 96 ) . We learn , as Channa learns , that the idea of impermanence ( anitya ) is essential for one to understand the Buddhist theory of Self . One must not only understand the idea of impermanence , but also be willing to fully accept it to pass from sam sara and suffering to nirvana . <p> The story about Channa shows how the self is actually just a momentary experience in the Buddhist view . One can think of a single candle as the momentary experience that represents the body or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one candle from another one can see how impermanence affects the self . The energy from the flame of the first candle ignites the second , but the flame on the second is not the same flame . Similarly , karma causes the effect which is the self . Although the cause created the effect , it is no longer the same thing , and is thus , impermanent . <p> Revealing the impermanence of the self raises questions concerning karma . " The doctrine of impermanence , which viewed the elements of existence ( dharmas ) as momentary phenomena , arising and passing away in a single present instant , was causing many thinkers to reflect on the problem of how to account for the apparent continuity of things , for the relationship of such distinct , momentary dharmas to one another " ( Strong 129 ) . ( * The Buddhist saint Nagajuna used the candle allegory to explain Karma and reincarnation without transmigration . ) The Buddhist tradition states that this is possible due to the power of karmic activity to affect the next being , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . Following this belief , reincarnation takes place without transmigration , the carrying over of something from one life to the next . Karma affects the next life ( like the energy from the candle igniting the second wick ) , but nothing remains of the karma once it has caused the effect of the next life . <p> Buddhism has explained how karma exists yet does not transmigrate . Karma , therefore , changes . Likewise , the doctrine of impermanence says that everything is constantly changing . Impermanence can lead to suffering as one fails to accept the continuously changing nature of the world . This means that as one tries to relive an event or strives to keep things the same , suffering is caused by the discrepancy between impermanence and desire for permanence . It is the desire for sameness that causes suffering , so by understanding and accepting impermanence one can be free from suffering . <p> As one strives for nirvana , it is essential to accept the impermanent nature of things . With this comes the impermanent nature of self . Self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will affect tomorrow . The idea of karma causing one 's next life is important , but one must realize that they need to view the self as impermanent in the pursuit of nirvana . By realizing the impermanence of self , desires , appearances , and describable things , one is closer to reaching nirvana . <p> Channa learned that as part of the answer to his question on self , he must understand impermanence and how impermanence causes the constant change or causal continuity of experiences . As nothing is permanent , one must understand that nothing survives eternally and that all things are continually changing .

@@1543592 <p> The concept of Pativratya is the Hindu concept that a wife lives to serve her husband in any way possible , making her life his , and supporting him in anything , even death . This idea is widely accepted within Hindu society . I intend to examine Pativratya and the theology that perpetuates it .. Pativratya is an oppressing idea that has been justified by three theological misconceptions . The first is that women are inherently sinful thus inferior to men which warrants servitude to them . The second justification used in the concept of Pativratya is the idea that the wife should see her husband as a god . The third and final justification that will be discussed is the idea that men should lead and women should follow because that is the natural order of things . These beliefs are held among many religions including Hinduism and have been used to encumber women 's participation in religious institutions . Tolerance is an important aspect of Hindu religious thought . I will investigate the contradictory relationship between pativratya and the concept of Hindu tolerance and possible ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that a woman 's purpose is to support her husband in all religious and social aspects and to continue his family by producing sons ( Dhruvarajan 26 ) . By supporting her husband , a pativrata must be obedient and completely servile , putting her husband 's needs and existence above her own . Vanaja Dhruvarajan cites her study of the Musali people . Dhruvarajan shares the views of the Musali people on the ideology on Pativratya : <p> " Obeying the command of one 's husband without question is a mark of virtue and good conduct . She should never be inquisitive . She should never be arrogant . Even slight indiscreton on the part of the wife to her husband is a crime and is unbecoming of a Pativrata. " ( 27 ) <p> A Pativrata must have complete devotion to her husband no matter whatever the circumstances may be . Sita showed complete devotion to Rama . Sita is seen as one of the most dutiful and endearing woman in Indian literature . She chose to support her husband without regard for what she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Indian ideal of a perfect wife . She states : <p> " A princess and the only wife of Rama , Sita gave up palace life for accompanying her husband to the forest Her loyalty and steadfast devotion to Rama , her complete confidence in him and dependence on his omnipotence , are at times touching , especially when compared with his occasional unjust treatment of her " ( 40 ) . <p> Another important aspect of Pativratya is the idea that a wife has no life without her husband therefore , it is better that she die before her husband because without her husband she might as well be dead . Sita realized this when Rama and Laksmana were being carried off by a powerful demon , she begs the demon to release them and take her instead . Sahagamana is the practice of the wife dying with her husband . I. Julie Leslie cites Tryambaka 's avocation of sahagamana in the following , " At the time of a girl 's wedding the brahmins should recite ( these words ) : May you be one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and even when he is dead " ( 292 ) . The Mosali people also feel that a wife 's sacrifice of her life is a virtue of a pativrata . <p> " A pativrata will be happy to die before her husband . Dying in his own hands is an added privilege for her because thereby she surely reaches heaven . A pativrata burns herself in the funeral pyre of her husband as it is not worth living after her husband 's death " ( Dhruvarajan 27 ) . <p> Tryambaka also believed that if a woman performed sahagamana she will receive rewards and absolution of sin after death . He says , <p> " when sahagamana is performed by a woman who has done wrong-that is something that her husband did n't like , throughout her lifetime , ( then ) it is said to have the quality of prayascitta . In this sense , it is the ultimate , and only effective , prayascitta ( atonement ) for the bad wife " ( Leslie 296 ) . <p> The husband and wife should be one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no identity without her husband . It is like the seed soil analogy that is often used in describing the relationship between men and women . The seed being the man and the soil being the woman . The seed is valued more than the soil . This explains the attitude towards widows in Hindu culture . Dhruvarajan goes more specific and explains this idea through the Musali people : <p> " People do not see any reason for mourning the death of a woman because as long as her husband is alive she continues to be part of him . It is only her mortal body that is dead , and if she has been a true Pativrata she has found her salvation . But , on the other hand , when the husband dies , she is also dead , as she is a part of him " ( 31 ) . <p> Tryambaka explains in section IV of the Stridharmapaddhati , which I have cited many times earlier . He says , " the good wife should be like Lopamudra , who takes her husband 's religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no more than her husband 's shadow " ( Leslie 115 ) . The main theme of Pativratya is complete idolization and sacrifice to the husband which results in men 's complete domination and women 's complete subjugation . <p> The practice of sahagamana and the other practices of a pativrata all come from the theology that a wife should see her husband as God . The Mosali people also feel that the wife should treat the husband as God . Dhruvarajan cites their ideology : " A pativrata knows that her salvation lies in her devotion to her husband and to him only . She never even looks at another man . She believes Pati pratyaksha devatha ( Husband is the living God ) " ( 27 ) . This idea even goes to say that a women 's devotion should be to her husband even above a bhramana . In the Mahabaharata , Markandeya shares an anecdote about the devotion of wives to husbands with Yudisthira . It is the story of the brahmana Kausika . Kausika goes to collect alms from a housewife . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife told the bhramana to wait while she tended to her husband . The housewife apologized , but said that , " a married woman should worship her husband before all others " ( Mukherjee 12-13 ) . This story shows the extremely elevated status that wives place their husbands . Since the husband is seen as the living God , then also that is where salvation lies . Dhruvarajan puts it simply . " She should understand that her life goal is to be of service to her husband and cater to his every need She should develop the proper disposition to achieve these goals because that is where her salvation lies " ( 32 ) . Hindu women are taught that they can be free from the cycle of death and rebirth by becoming a pativrata . <p> The idea that the husband is the wife 's path to salvation is closely linked to the second justification ; that women are inherently sinful and they have no hope of salvation without the help of men . Women are inferior to men because it has been believed that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they cause men to lust and desire . Ramakrsna a leading Indian mystic , thought that women were stumbling blocks on the path to moksa . Arvind Sharma cites Ramakrsna 's views on women : " According to Ramakrsna , ' the two obstacles to spiritual life are woman and gold . ' and since Ramakrsna also said that , ' It is woman that create the need for gold , ' we are in the end left really with only one obstacle to spiritual salvation---women " ( Sharma 116 ) . <p> Women are considered more prone to sin not necessarily because of what they do but rather just for being . Dhruvarajan explains that , <p> " The impediment does not arise because anything a woman does directly ; her sheer presense has a corrupting influence on man 's spiritual nature . Sex is something that veers a man away from his path toward spiritual enlightenment ; woman is the personification of sex and therefore a temptation to man " ( 27 ) . <p> Woman ' s birth is a sign of sin in a past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greed and cunning are to be the cause of female birth . Therefore , th concluded that , <p> " First , since sinfulness is the mark of female birth , the female of the species is always lower than the male . Secondly , so deeply ingrained that this sinfulness that it is more difficult for a femal to be reborn as a male than it is for an animal to be reborn as a human " ( Leslie 247 ) . <p> The inherent sinful nature of women has also been argued on the basis that because women menstruate they are impure . " Tryambaka thought that menstruation was a sign of sexual appetite and her innate impurity " ( Leslie 251 ) . These two considerations explains why women are seen as stumbling blocks by Ramakrsna . A woman 's sexuality is seen as the cause of men giving in to their desires and not obtaining moksa . <p> The third justification that is used to support trativatya is the idea that men should rule over women because it is divinely ordained or it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the ideas that women should see their husbands as God and also that women have a inherently sinful nature . The notion that the husband should be God is supported by the natural heirarchy that exists in all forms of life . A master/servant dynamic exists in not only the physical world , but also the spiritual world . Dhruvarajan summarizes the Mosale people 's thoughts : <p> " To run things smoothly someone has to give orders and others have to follow it . Nature has intended that men give orders and women follow . Otherwise men would be bearing childern and women wold have been stronger " ( 28 ) . <p> The idea that women are inherently sinful is also supported by the natural order of things concept . Women are a product of their past lives which are assumed to be sinful . Therefore , the position that they are in is where God intended them to be . Tryambaka compares women 's dharma to the four varnas . If one is born as a woman than for that lifetime they must perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , " Each individual 's action , defined by birth and circumstance , is his duty ; it was ordained to be so and is therefore right . At this level , there is no conflict ; individual dharma is simply the reflection of cosmic law " ( Leslie 263 ) . This justification seemed to be heavily supported by the Mosali people . They seem to have a tremendoud fear that changing natural order only leads to disasters . The only way to prevent this is for everyone to understand and accept their place ( Dhruvarajan 28 ) . <p> The idea of Pativratya supported by all three justifications that i have discussed is hindering women 's participation and contrubitions tothe Hindu religion . The subjugated role of wives is still very present today . In study of South Indian immigrantes to the United States , she found that 16 out of 40 adhered to the traditional marital roles , such as Pativratya . This misconception is in opposition to the philosophy of Hindu tolerance . In this context , Tolerance implies that Hinduism needs to be tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there is a dialectical relationship between the religious tradition and times : the traditions sometimes moulded by the times " ( 84 ) . Sharma applies the issue of tolerance to the caste system . One could gather many similarities between the caste system and the concept of Pativratya since they are both results of birth . The dissolution of the caste system or of Pativratya would also essentially mean the dissolution of the idea of Karma . Sharma argues that Hinduism can still change the times by still maintaining their traditional role and beliefs , but with a new foundation ( 85 ) . However , the foundation is not really new , it is the idea of promoting religious harmony . In a sense Hindu tolerance needs to get back to the original goal . It is important that there is harmony within the Hindu people , before there can be harmony with the rest of the world . Sharma states , " A good religion , which believes in equality , and realizes it within it 's own society , will not then owe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religion it might face " ( 83 ) . Sharma calls for an internalization of the ideals of harmony within the Hindu society . I. Julie Leslie provides two ways to understand and recognize the importance of women in Hinduism . She suggests that , <p> " the religious texts relating to women must be closely analyzed to reveal the implicit sturctures and unarticulated tensions ....

Patrick Larson , Luther College junior of Decorah , Iowa , has been selected to research what factors lead to making the crucial decision on which college to attend . <p> Larson , the son of Rob and Sandy Larson of Decorah , is majoring in economics and biology at Luther . He is a 2013 graduate of Decorah High School . <p> With many prospective students and parents coming to Luther this summer , Larson has the opportunity to discuss what they are looking for in a college .

@@1543609 <h> Functions are Powerful <p> Functions are an important part of programming . Functions do two things for us . <p> They allow us to reuse code so that we do n't have to write the same thing more than once . <p> They also help us to break up our program into manageable chunks that can often make our programs easier to write and easier to understand . <p> When we write a function we must do two things . We must define the function . That part starts with the keyword def . <p> Once we have defined a function we can use it in our program . Using a function means we write the name , followed by a left paren , the values we want to pass to the function , and then finally a right paren . <p> When we are defining a function we must answer three questions . <p> What should we name the function . Generally you should pick a name that makes sense for what you are doing ? <p> What values need to be given to the function so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be returned from the function ? <p> Answering these questions will help you in understanding what your function needs to do and hopefully how it should be written . <h> Defining and Using Functions <p> In the last lesson we learned how to draw a polygon with an arbitrary number of sides . In this lesson we 'll learn how to make the code in that program more useful . Defining and using functions in Python helps us reuse the code we write and also helps to break up our programs into manageable pieces . Let 's start with an example from Mathematics . In math , we can define a function <p> f(x) = 2*sin(x) <p> This is a function called f that can be called to find the value of 2 * sin(x) for some x . We say that x is given to the function and it returns 2 * sin(x) . When working with functions it is important to identify what the function is given and what it returns . <p> To write this in Python we can write a program like the one below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to plot the function between -10 and 10 on the x axis . <p> In the program above there are two functions defined . The first function is f , the one you saw above . The other function is named main . The function f is given a real number and returns 2 times the sin of that real number . The main function is n't given anything . That 's the reason for the ( ) in the <p> def main() : <p> The main function also does not return anything . When this program is run the def f and def main lines , along with all the code that is inside of each of them , do not do anything until the last line of the program above when main() is called . The program begins execution by calling main() on the last line of the file . <h> Now You Try It <p> Now it 's your turn . Try writing a program that plots <p> g(x) = x**4/4.0 - x**3/3.0 - 3 * x**2 <p> In Python the exponent operator is ** so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the function does not go off the bottom of the screen when your run it .

@@1543616 <h> Setting up and using RCS <h> Overview <p> It is often desirable to share files with one or more team members . For instance , if you are working on a project you may want to work collaboratively on it by splitting it up into pieces and sharing access to those pieces . The Revision Control System ( RCS ) provided with all Unix systems is a convenient way to do just that . <p> However , not everyone knows about RCS or if they know about it , they do n't know how to set it up and use it . This lab will guide you in setting up an RCS directory to be shared with a team member of members . <p> While RCS is good for sharing files on an informal basis , if you are going to have a large number of people working on something , you are better off using a more sophisticated file-sharing system . For instance , SCCS ( Source Code Control System ) and CVS are two such systems . However , RCS is very good at sharing files on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by checking them out and checking them in to RCS . It also keeps track of revisions that you make to files so you can go back and review those changes or even revert to a previous version . <p> To get you started , here are a set of directions that will set it up for you and your partner and teach you some of the commands to use it . In the directions below , owner is the userid of the owner of the RCS directory and partner is the userid of the person you are going to share the directory with . <h> Directions <p> First change your group to the group that will share the files . For instance , if you have created a group called " cs66 " use the command " <p> newgrp cs66 <p> Next , check to make sure that your ( owner 's ) home directory is lookable by everyone . Most of you should execute the command <p> cd <p> cd .. ls -l <p> Verify that everyone has at least traversal ( x ) authority to your directory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands <p> cd <p> chmod a+x . <p> This will allow users to traverse your home directory , but not see the files and directories that are in your account . <p> Next you should go to your home directory and make a test directory . I 'll call it test , you can name it whatever you like . Change the permissions on the test directory so your partner can look in it as well <p> mkdir testchmod a+x test <p> Now change directory to test and make one more directory called RCS . It must be in capital letters . Then give your group write authority to the directory <p> You will be asked to enter some text followed by a period .

@@1543634 <p> Shredding her Paideia paper into tiny bits , my roommate yelled , " Who cares about Homer anyway ? It ? s just a stupid story about a bunch of people who never existed ! " At the time , I sympathized with her plight , yet the more that I learned about W estern history , the more I realized that many of the themes in Homer were applicable to the modern world , lending a sense of universality to a work that is otherwise highly topical in nature . The virtues of hard work , knowledge , trust , honor , fidelity , and courage found in The Odyssey are not far removed from virtues of today . As long as these ideals are revered in Western culture , it is likely that students will encounter this epic story for decades to come . <p> Much like The Odyssey seeks to explore Western ideals and values , the Mahabharata is highly useful in explaining many of the values of Hinduism . Though the main story line is the fight between the Pandavas and the Kauravas , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also those underlying themes that bridge the gap of centuries , such as those of duty ( dharma ) , action ( karma ) , worship ( bhakti ) , yoga , and non-violence ( ahimsa ) . As translator of the Mahabharata , Chakravarthi V. Narasimhan outlines some of these themes that are universally important to all Hindus , past and present : " it was intended to be a treatise on life itself , including religion and ethics ( dharma sastra ) , polity and government ( artha sastra ) , philosophy and the pursuit of salvation ( moksa sastra ) . " Within these categories lie the fundamental tenets of Hinduism that are creatively expounded in the form of an epic story . <p> If it is to be thought of as a story that is applicable to all Hindus , it is necessary that the Mahabharata concern itself with the most essential premise for understanding the Hindu notion of existence : the all-pervading Self ( Atman ) . Through the story of Krsna ? s explanation to Arjuna of his duty to fight , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conveys this important message to the recipients of this story , both past and present . This paper seeks to explore the notion of Atman in the Mahabharata through the use of textual examples and by placing the story of Arjuna ? s delay in battle within the greater scope of Hinduism as a whole . <p> It is first necessary to tell the story of Arjuna ? s delay and Krsna ? s entreaty before launching into its implications on Hinduism . The story takes place at a pivotal point in the Mahabharata : the camps of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas have assembled and are prepared to fight for the kingdom . Before beginning the battle , Arjuna wishes to view the armies , at which point he is struck with doubt and incertitude . He casts aside his weapons and sits down , " his eyes filled and oppressed with tears . " It is strange that a battle scene ? something that should inspire and ignite Arjuna ? causes his distress . We find that the reason for his despair lies in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . He says to Krsna , <p> " O Krsna , when I see my own people ready to fight and eager for battle , my limbs shudder , my mouth is dry , my body shivers , and my hair stands on end . Furthermore , I see evil portents , and I can see no good in killing my own kinsmen How can we be happy if we slay our own people ? " <p> It seems that all hope is lost for Arjuna as he abandons his duty ( dharma ) as a ksatriya and chooses the path of inertia over the path of action . <p> At a time when it seems that the mighty hero of this epic has faltered and can not attain glory , Krsna calls upon a fundamental epithet of Hinduism to allay Arjuna ? s fears : Atman . As that imperishable and unchanging force behind all , Atman alone is reality , yet Arjuna has forgotten this and laments the lives that will be lost . Krsna reminds him , " Thou mournest those that deserve not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , it is futile to mourn for individual lives lost . The individual does not exist except as a manifestation of Atman . Much like the sea manifests itself as waves , bubbles , and foam , the Atman manifests itself within every person in a different outward manner . The appearance of individuality is reconciled with the oneness of Atman . Thus , as everyone belongs to that same underlying and unifying soul , there is no distinction between those who perish in battle and those who remain alive , according Krsna . Arjuna is deluded in thinking that his family will perish in battle because , under the unity of Atman , they will always be together . <p> After his initial chastisement of Arjuna ? s inaction , Krsna launches into a philosophical explanation of Atman that is critical to the Hindu concept of Self . He says , " Know that the soul to be immortal by which all this universe is pervaded . No one can compass the destruction of that which is imperishable . " He goes on to describe the attributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These descriptions are similar to the description of Atman found in the Katha Upanisad : " bodiless among bodies , stable among the unstable , the great , all-pervading Self ? on recognizing Him , the wise man sorrows not . " <p> Krsna continues his argument by calling upon a battle metaphor to relate Atman to Arjuna , saying , " He who thinks it ( the soul ) to be the slayer and he who thinks it to be the slain , both of them know nothing ; for it neither slays nor is slain . " Again , nearly identical rhetoric can be found within the Katha Upanisad : " If the slayer think to slay , if the slain think himself slain , both these understand not . This one slays not , nor is slain . " Krsna ends his discourse by a final concise statement that serves to summarize his message : " The Embodied ( soul ) , O Bharata , is ever indestructible in everyone ? s body . " Through his explanation of Atman , Krsna hopes to incite Arjuna into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ksatriya and attain glory for his actions . <p> To fulfill one ? s duty is the highest perfection of the Self and to resist one ? s specific role in society at a critical time is unacceptable to Hindus . What if Arjuna chose not to heed the advice of Krsna and opted instead for the path of inaction ? He would then not attain glory and perfection in his duty and would thus lose his appeal as a model of the ksatriyas . Throughout the epic , Arjuna and the other heroes are tested , much like Odysseus in The Odyssey , and through their correct choices , we are called to make the same decisions in our lives . While no modern Hindu is likely fighting battles as a mighty car-warrior like Arjuna , they must realize from this story that it is the belief in Atman that permeates the disparity in time and calls Hindus of all epochs to realize this unity . <p> To further solidify this unity , Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan expounds various Hindu philosophical and religious traditions to readers as he places the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Radhakrishnan identifies Atman as " ultimate reality " and goes on to define it as " an unborn and so immortal element in man . " With rhetoric similar to the Mahabharata and to the Katha Upanisad , Radhakrishnan calls Atman " that which neither lives nor dies , which has neither movement nor change and which endures when all else passes away . " Much like Krsna speaks to Arjuna , the writings of Radhakrishnan speak to Hindus and bring the Mahabharata into the present world . <p> What , then , must the modern Hindu take from the notion of Atman found in the Mahabharata and the writings of Radhakrishnan ? First , he is linked in spirit to all people , past and present , through Atman . This unity is inescapable and thus he is called to act in such a way that reflects this unity . If the modern Hindu believes himself to be equal in spirit to all people , he is less likely to do them harm , for in doing others harm , he is ultimately harming himself . Wars would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor would anyone wish injury on their neighbor . Second , if the Hindu does not realize the unity of Atman , he is condemned to the cycle of deaths and rebirths ( samsara ) that govern the world . Continuing to see disparity , the Hindu will be reborn until he finally realizes unity and through it obtains liberation ( moksa ) . Finally , the notion of Atman calls the Hindu to expound these ideas to others . Much like Krsna was there to help Arjuna in a time of doubt , so must the modern Hindu be prepared to defend this tenet and help others to understand its significance . <p> Thus , we can surmise that the messages found in the Mahabharata transcend time and appeal to modern Hindus as well . The notion of the Self , Atman , as the all-pervading , imperishable spirit is central to Hindu beliefs and is important both in an epic setting and also in present-day philosophical writings , helping believers to discover an element that unites them despite the seeming disparity in time . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach and reveal virtues to those willing to hear them , they will have an appeal that is beyond the topical , placing them within the grasp of the modern reader and assuring their survival for centuries to come .

@@1543669 <h> Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccine <h> What is meningococcal disease ? <p> Meningococcal disease is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection . The disease most commonly is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis , an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord , or meningococcemia , a presence of bacteria in the blood . <p> Meningococcal disease is caused by Neisseria meningitis , which has become the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in older children and young adults in the United States . Meningococcal disease strikes about 3,000 Americans each year , leading to death in approximately 10-15 percent of cases , which translates into 300 deaths annually . It is estimated that 100 to 125 cases of meningococcal disease occur annually on college campuses and five to 15 students die each year as a result . The disease can result in permanent brain damage , hearing loss , learning disability , amputation , kidney failure , or death . <p> There are five strains or serogroups of N. meningitis that cause meningococcal disease . These are A , B , C , Y , and W-135 . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1997 , serogroup C caused about 28 percent of cases , serogroup B about 30 percent , serogroup Y about 37 percent , and serogroups A and W-135 were extremely rare . Serogroup A is predominantly a cause of meningococcal disease in Africa and Asia . <p> In the United States , the incidence of meningitis outbreaks of serogroup C has risen sharply in the past 10 years , especially among young adults in school and community settings . There were 26 outbreaks between 1994 and 1996 , four of these outbreaks at a college or university , compared with only 15 outbreaks occurring between 1989 to 1993 , including two outbreaks at a college or university . <h> What are the symptoms of meningococcal disease ? <p> Meningococcal disease usually peaks in late winter and early spring . The disease can easily be misdiagnosed as something less serious , because symptoms are similar to the flu . The most common symptoms include high fever , headaches , neck stiffness , confusion , nausea , vomiting , lethargy , and/or rashes . Anyone with similar symptoms should contact a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly and can lead to shock and death , often within hours of the onset of symptoms . <h> Who is at risk for meningococcal disease ? <p> Meningococcal disease can affect people at any age . Certain groups seem to be at increased risk of contracting the disease including those in close contact with a known case , patients with compromised immunity , and persons traveling to specific endemic areas of Asia , Africa , or South America . <p> Since 1991 , cases of meningococcal disease among 15-24 year olds have more than doubled . Recent evidence found students residing on campus in dormitories appear to be at higher risk for meningococcal disease . The highest risk appeared to be in freshmen living in dormitories , who seemed to have a six times higher risk than college students overall . Data also suggests that certain social behaviors such as exposure to passive and active smoking , bar patronage , and excessive alcohol consumption may increase students ' risk for contracting the disease . <h> Is there a meningococcal vaccine ? <p> The vaccine called " Menveo " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meningitidis in the United States ( A , C , Y , W-135 ) and can be used in adults and children greater than two years old . The vaccine is between 85 to 100 percent effective in preventing meningococcal disease . A single-dose vaccination produces protective antibody levels in 10 to 14 days . The vaccine does not currently provide any protection against the B strain or serotype . <p> Based on the possibility of increased risk of this disease among segments of the college population , the American College Health Association ( ACHA ) recommends that students consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease . Recently , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has decided to support ACHA 's decision to educate students and parents about meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine to help prevent it . ACHA and the CDC are collaborating on surveillance studies to further assess the risk of meningococcal disease in the college population . Their current recommendation reads : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those freshmen who wish to reduce their risk of disease . Other undergraduate students wishing to reduce their risk of meningococcal disease can also choose to be vaccinated . " <h> Who should not get the vaccine ? <p> You should not receive the Menomune meningococcal vaccine if : <p> you are pregnant or suspect that you might be pregnant <p> you are allergic to thimerosal , a substance found in several vaccines and in several contact lens solution <p> you have an acute illness , with fever ( 101F or higher ) . <h> What are the possible side effects of the vaccine ? <p> The vaccine is considered relatively free of side effects and is generally effective for three-five years . Minor reactions may include redness and swelling at the injection site that may last one to two days . About 2 percent of recipients may develop fever after vaccination . If you develop a high or persistent fever , consult a physician . Extremely rare allergic reactions have occurred , including those resulting in hives , asthma , and even anaphylaxis . As with any vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all susceptible individuals . <h> How is meningococcal disease transmitted ? <p> Meningococcal bacteria are transmitted through the air via droplets of respiratory secretions and direct contact with persons infected with the disease . Oral contact with shared items such as cigarettes or drinking glasses or through intimate contact such as kissing could put a person at risk for acquiring the infection . <p> Approximately 10 percent of the general population may carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose and throat in a harmless state . This carrier state may last for days or months before spontaneously disappearing , and it seems to give persons who harbor the bacteria in their upper respiratory tracts some protection from developing meningococcal disease . <p> During meningococcal disease outbreaks , the percentage of people carrying the bacterium may approach 95 percent , yet the percentage of people who develop meningococcal disease is less than 1 percent . This low occurrence of disease following exposure suggests that a person 's own immune system , in addition to bacterial factors , plays a key role in disease development . <p> Meningococcal bacteria can not usually live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , they are not easily transmitted in water supplies , swimming pools , or by routine contact with an infected person in a classroom , dining room , bar , restroom , etc . <p> Roommates , friends , spouses , and children who have had intimate contact with the oral secretions of a person diagnosed with meningococcal disease are at risk for contracting the disease and should receive prophylactic medication immediately . Examples of such contact include kissing , sharing eating utensils , and being exposed to droplet contamination from the nose or throat . <h> What is the treatment for meningococcal disease exposure ? <p> Meningococcal disease can be rapidly progressive . With early diagnosis and treatment , however , the likelihood of recovery is increased . Early recognition , performance of a spinal tap , and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy are crucial . <h> Chemoprophylaxis <p> The use of such prophylactic antibiotics as ciprofloxacin or rifampin is recommended for those who may have been exposed to a person diagnosed with meningococcal disease . Anyone who suspects exposure should consult a physician immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Vaccination <p> As an adjunct to appropriate antibiotic chemoprophylaxis , immunization against the meningococcal bacterium may be recommended when an outbreak of meningococcal disease has occurred in a community . It is important to note that meningococcal vaccine should not be used in place of chemoprophylaxis for those exposed to an infected person ; protection from immunization is too slowly generated in this situation . <h> How can one reduce the risk of contracting meningococcal disease ? <p> Maximize your body 's own immune system response . A lifestyle that includes a balanced diet , adequate sleep , appropriate exercise , and the avoidance of excessive stress is very important . Avoiding upper respiratory tract infections and inhalation of cigarette smoke may help to protect from invasive disease . Everyone should be sensitive to public health measures that decrease exposure to oral secretions , such as covering one 's mouth when coughing or sneezing and washing hands after contact with oral secretions . <h> Meningitis Vaccination ( Menveo ) at Luther College <p> Luther College Health Service makes available the meningitis vaccine ( Menomune ) to interested students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administration fee of $10.00 . <p> Meningitis can be a catastrophic and even lethal disease if acquired . The vaccination itself carries some risk of side effects and is not 100 percent effective .

In general , stronger shear environments promote longer-lived and more severe weather producing systems . <p> During the evolution of a weakly-to-moderately sheared squall line , a system is composed of mostly independent convective cells . The line often appears quite narrow , with the surface cold pool generally confined to a small region around the convective cells .

However , if the vortices last for more than two to three hours ( i.e. , beyond four to seven hours into the lifetime of the system ) , the northern , cyclonic vortex tends to become stronger and larger than the southern , anticyclonic vortex . As this occurs , the convective system becomes asymmetric , with most of the stratiform precipitation region found behind the northern end of the system , and the strongest leading-line convective cells found near the southern end . In weak-to-moderate shear environments , the northern line-end vortex is typically observed to move rearward with time . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The symmetric-to-asymmetric evolution of the line-end vortices described for weak-to-moderate shear environments also occurs in stronger shear environments . Although as shown here , when the shear is moderate to strong , the vortices tend to remain closer to the leading-edge convection . In addition , smaller-scale bow-shaped systems within the larger system are more apt to develop in stronger shear , with each subsystem also displaying a symmetric-to-asymmetric evolution . These systems observed on radar give the line echo wave pattern , or LEWP signature especially well known for producing long swaths of damaging surface winds . In moderate-to-strong shear environments , the northern line-end vortex has been observed to be a favored region for especially intense straight-line surface winds . This is also true with the northern circulation portion of any given individual embedded bowing segment . These regions should be monitored closely . <p> The dominant cyclonic vortex can last well beyond the lifetime of the originating convective system and is often referred to as a mesoscale convective vortex ( MCV ) . In some cases , MCVs have been documented to last for several days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly referred to as MVCs , Mesoscale Vorticity Centers . These topics will be discussed further in the MCC section . <h> Review Question Feedback <p> Moderate shear is the best answer . <p> Because the dominant northern line-end vortex moves quickly rearward behind the leading edge convection during this 90-minute loop , we should suspect the shear is in the weak-to-moderate range . However , if the shear were truly weak , we would not expect to see convection this strong at the same time as a well-developed line-end vortex . If the shear were very strong , the vortex should remain closely tied to the leading line convection and we would not expect to observe an enhanced trailing stratiform precipitation region , given that this squall line is in its mature stage . Data shows that in fact , this system occurred in a low-end moderate-shear environment . We will discuss quantifying shear values later in this module . <h> 3.2.6 Pressure Field Evolution <p> The surface pressure field during a squall lines mature phase reveals a pre-squall mesolow ahead of the system , a mesohigh collocated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back edge of the stratiform precipitation . <p> The fields are similar whether the low-level wind shear is weak or strong , but surface pressure gradients , and thus often the strength of the surface winds , are usually stronger in stronger-shear environments . <p> As a squall line becomes asymmetric , the surface pressure field also becomes distorted . Both the cold pool mesohigh and the trailing wake low are also shifted northward . <h> 3.2.7 Squall Line Evolution : Cross Section View <p> Click the image above to view animation . <p> ( Click the above image for animation , or see still series below : ) <p> 12 <p> 3 4 <p> 5 6 <p> 7 <p> This animation shows the idealized evolution of a typical squall line in a vertical cross section with hypothetical radar echoes and cloud .

@@1543696 <h> Minesweeper <p> This is an additional exercise for chapter 7 of my text . Chapter 7 and this web page will prepare you to write a minesweeper game in Python . A minesweeper is a wooden hulled ship that is used by the Navy to find and disarm mines in the ocean . My father-in-law served on a minesweeper in the late 50 's and early 60 's . They are not as big as most ships and riding out a typhoon on a minesweeper is not advisable . Just ask my father-in-law . <p> The game of minesweeper has been around for a while . It is a Windows application that has been included on Windows since the early versions of Windows , including Windows 3.1 . <p> The game begins with a 9x9 matrix of tiles that cover 10 mines . Some tiles hide mines , most do not . You play the game by clicking on tiles to reveal what lies beneath . If you expose a mine , you blow yourself up and the game is over . Your goal is to expose all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . <p> You are aided along the way when you uncover tiles by numbers that appear in squares that are adjacent to a bomb . When a square is adjacent to zero bombs , the square appears blank . When one or more bombs are adjacent to a square ( either left , right , up , down , or diagonally adjacent ) then the number of adjacent bombs is displayed . <p> To help you keep track of which tiles you have inferrred that cover bombs , you flag squares by turning flags on . When flags are turned on and you click on a tile you are flagging it as a bomb and not exposing what is underneath . If you incorrectly flag a tile as a bomb then when the game is over the program will show you that you incorrectly flagged a bomb by displaying a flag with an X through it . <p> To help you see how the game works you can download a compiled version of my program to try out . You should unzip this file . Then you play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mac user or you can double-click the windows-minesweeper.bat file if you are a Windows user . <p> To complete this assignment , you should make your minesweeper program work as much like the compiled version provided above as possible . Here is the criteria considered for grading purposes . <p> Your program should include two more buttons , a New Game button and a Flags On/Flags Off button . The New Game button should start a new game by calling the newgame function to restart the game . The Flags On/Flags Off button should toggle a boolean value between False and True . It should also set the text of the button to reflect the current state of the program . Initially the text of the button should read " Flags Off " . When clicked it should toggle to " Flags On " and again to " Flags Off " if clicked again . To change the text of a button called toggleFlags to " Flags On " you can write toggleFlags.config ( text= " Flags On " ) . You can use the data dictionary to store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The data dictionary can be used to store a mapping from " flags " to True or False . So , data " flags " = False is what flags is initially set to in the newGame function . Your button should toggle that value between False and True . HINT : You can use the not operator to do this very easily . If you tried to write flags = False in your button 's event handler , Python would create a local copy of the flags variable and the contents would be lost as soon as you returned from the event handler . By using the data dictionary in this fashion you can access it from the enclosing scope and mutate it ( with the example code above ) and your changes will remain in place , even when the event handler is done . <p> You must add logic to the clickHandler event handler to detect if a game is over . A game is over when a bomb is exposed or when the only unexposed turtles ( i.e. tiles ) are bombs . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile in the two dimensional tile matrix is a Turtle as well . So tiles can do anything a Turtle can do . You can hide them with the hideturtle method . You can change their shape with the shape method . The other thing you will want to understand is the purpose of the data dictionary . Writing data " gameOver " = True will map the string " gameOver " to True in the data dictionary . <p> When the game is over you should reveal all the tiles in the game . To do this , write a new method for the Tile class called reveal . In this method , if a Tile is both armed ( i.e. it is a bomb ) and flagged you should change its shape to bombflag.gif . If it is armed , but not flagged , its shape should be set to bomb.gif . If it is flagged , but not armed , its shape should be set to badflag.gif . Finally if it is neither armed nor flagged , you should hide the Tile . Once you 've written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tile once the game is over . <p> Finally , you need to add logic to the expose method of the Tile class to correctly handle exposing a tile when it is clicked . The expose method returns True if an armed Tile is exposed ( indicating you just blew up ) or False ( indicating that you are still alive ) . You will want to add one more parameter to the expose method , a boolean value to indicate if flags are on or off . <p> You should begin the expose method by checking to see if the tile has already been exposed . If it has , then you should return false immediately . You can keep track of whether the tile has been exposed or not by setting the exposed instance variable in the object to true when it it has been exposed and you can check that value at the beginning of the expose method to see if has already been exposed . <p> If flags are on , you should simply turn on or off the flagged instance variable depending on what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the tile from self.shape ( " tile.gif " ) to self.shape ( " flag.gif " ) or vice-versa depending on the current state of the flagged instance variable . <p> If flags are not on , then you can set the exposed instance variable to true . <p> If the current tile is armed , then the exposed method should return True and set its shape to bomb.gif ( this is already in the starter code ) . <p> Otherwise , the expose method must count the number of neighbors of itself that are armed . You can get a list of the neighbors of a tile by calling the neighbors function . If zero neighbors are armed , the Tile should hide itself and call expose on all the neighbors of itself . If one or more neighbors is armed , it should hide itself and write a number into its square indicating the number of neighbors that are armed . <p> The description given here is a pretty detailed description of what remains to be done , but the final say on what to implement should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making your program behave like mine . <p> Various extras could be done as well . For instance , you could have the program record high scores . You might store the high scores in XML format and you might add a widget to display the high scores in the window . You might identify a particular game by a unique number ( like solitaire does ) so you can select a certain game to play . You might allow the user to pick from a difficulty level by increasing the size of the matrix and the number of bombs . You could have an intermediate 16x16 matrix or a hard 25x25 matrix with 20 and 40 bombs respectively . You could allow the user to select their difficulty level using a Listbox or some other sort of widget . Of course , colors can be changed , you can change the gifs that are used , or you can add animation when the game is one or lost if you like . Have fun with it !

@@1543726 <h> 3.5.1 Squall Line Motion <p> For all types of squall lines , line motion is a result of both the advection of individual cells within the line and propagation due to the triggering of new cells . The overall propagation speed of the entire squall line tends to be controlled by the speed of the system cold pool with new cells being constantly triggered along its leading edge gust front . At midlatitudes where some mid-level potentially negatively buoyant " dry " air is nearly always available , an average cold pool speed is on the order of 20 m/s ( 40 kt ) . Nearly everyone has experienced the cool , often refreshing and gusty winds that accompany thunderstorm passage . However , with many organized systems these winds become much stronger and potentially damaging as will be discussed later . <h> 3.5.2 Long Line Motion <p> Click the image above to view animation . <p> Within squall lines composed of primarily ordinary cells , each cell will generally move with the 0-6 km mean wind with new cells triggering in the downshear direction of the low-level vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For very long squall lines ( greater than 200 km or 110 n mi in length ) , individual cells may move at an angle to the line , but the net motion of the line usually stays perpendicular to its initial orientation , independent of the direction of the mean wind or mean wind shear vector . This was true during the scenario case where the cells moved to the northwest , but the long line overall moved eastward . <p> It may be difficult to assess cell motion within solid squall lines , as shown in the radar reflectivity loop above . Derived radar products , such as the NEXRAD storm track indicator , 1-hour precipitation , or storm total precipitation may help .

The lines then propagate in the direction of the shear vector as new cells are more easily triggered along the downshear gust front . <h> 3.5.4 System Motion and Back Building <p> System motion can also be affected by variations in the environmental conditions along the squall line . For instance , more cells may be triggered in regions where the CAPE is greater or LFC is lower , thereby promoting squall line propagation toward the region with more favorable environmental conditions . This image shows a common scenario where cells are first initiated to the north where the " cap " or convective inhibition ( CIN ) is smaller , but over time cells are triggered further southwestward , as the gust front intersects the preexisting boundary . This setup can lead to " back building .

We trust this document shows that Anderson Prairie has significant value for both the college and the Decorah community . <p> Report finalized March 17 , 2017 <p> The Luther College administration is currently considering a proposal from the Decorah School Board about the potential for constructing a new elementary school on college lands . The site under consideration is a 28-year old prairie reconstruction , known as Anderson Prairie , located across from the main entrance to central campus on College Drive and Ridge Road . Activities and uses of the college 's natural areas are structured by the Land Use Plan ( also known as the Land Stewardship Plan ) that was approved by the Board of Regents in 2010 .

The committee will review the proposal and also seek the opinions of faculty , staff , and students . After review and seeking input from the college community , the committee will finalize a report and opinion on the proposal that may or may not be put forward to the Board of Regents ( depending on the outcome of the review and report ) . <p> Timeline : <p> Fall 2016 to end of February 2017 : Gather feedback from the college community <p> Submit your letters , online submissions , and emails <p> Forums for discussion and to learn more : Student , faculty , and staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Land Use Committee will review the proposal and college community feedback to produce a final report . <p> May 2017 : If it is deemed that the proposal should continue to move forward , the committee 's report will be submitted to the Board of Regents , through the college President 's office . <p> Luther College 's Land Use Plan The Land Use Plan was written by a committee of faculty , staff , students , and community members and approved by the Board of Regents in 2010 . A few relevant excerpts of the plan are provided here . The full Land Use Plan is linked below . <p> The purpose of the Land Use Plan is to provide direction and goals for the management of campus natural and agricultural lands not developed as part of the central campus . <p> This plan includes all areas where biological education and biodiversity are the primary goals or could be in the future . <p> Luther College 's land plays a vital role in its educational mission . The diverse ecological communities educate students in courses across disciplines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops a connection to place for members of the community who use college lands for recreation . The land and its diverse communities are important for their aesthetic value . In addition to these direct services , the ecological communities of the land protect the Upper Iowa River from excessive runoff , protect the soils from erosion , play key roles in cycling carbon and other nutrients , and provide habitat for hundreds of native plant and animal species . <p> Policy Recommendations from the Land Use Plan : <p> This plan is to be followed by the college administration in making decisions about requests for new construction , the acquiring or sale of property , and the initiation of new campus projects . <p> The plan should also be followed by any individual or group planning activities that could impact the biodiversity or ecological function of the land , including new construction ( trails , buildings ) or management activities ( planting , harvesting , hunting , herbicide use , etc. ) not prescribed in the plan . <p> Changes in the Land Use Plan may be initiated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the staff , or the student body . In all cases the Land Use Committee should review the proposed changes and compare them to the goals described in this plan and would make a recommendation to the Board of Regents through the president . If the proposed activity is deemed to be inconsistent with the goals of the plan then the proposed project should be revised or abandoned . <p> The Land Use Committee is charged with reviewing and approving any activities that impact the ecology of the lands described in this plan . Groups or individuals are responsible for presenting proposals for projects to the committee prior to implementation . Proposals will be reviewed by the Land Use Committee , who will also seek to learn the opinion of faculty , staff , and students . <p> Land Use Plan Goals Specific to Anderson Prairie : <p> Due to its accessibility , this area has the highest educational and recreational use . <p> Increasing the educational value by restoring diverse habitats should the highest priority . <p> Future Management : The primary method of managing Anderson Prairie will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and occasional mid-summer or fall burns when research needs warrant the availability of those treatments . Periodic mowing and spot herbicide application on stumps is needed in addition to fire to control seedlings of Japanese maples and box elders . <p> Given the proximity of this open space to College Drive and the central campus , future core campus expansion may take place in Anderson Prairie . Any future development should be restricted to the southern edge along Ridge Road . <p> Current Anderson Prairie Uses and Services Coursework that takes place in Anderson Prairie ranges from hands-on field laboratory work , contemplative practice , investigating research questions , identification and sampling of organisms/ environmental factors , and other uses.Many of the courses listed below use the prairie for multiple weeks of the semester during regular lab periods as an extension of classroom space , while other classes use the prairie for a morning or afternoon . For example , every fall , 175 to 200 students use the prairie for their Introductory Biology ( Bio 151 ) course work . This overlaps with other classes that use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible prairie on campus , Anderson Prairie is used throughout the fall and spring semesters by classes and students in majors across the campus . <p> Other workshops , tours , camps , etc. use Anderson Prairie for a variety of reasons , depending on the educational focus of the group . Some of the uses by groups include : discuss land stewardship work and natural resource management examples , demonstration teaching area for grade school and high school teachers , safe natural resource exploration area for kids , conferences , and campus visitors . The proximity of Anderson Prairie to campus and Baker Village/Baker Commons makes it the visit location of choice for many groups . <p> Workshops , summer camps , community , and other uses of Anderson Prairie : <p> Admissions visits/tours/science exploration with prospective students and parents <p> Luther College Staff Day program : Natural areas stewardship and introduction to the Luther trail system <p> Various non-college affiliated workshops that take place at Baker Village and Baker Commons <p> Leisure and green space use : Anderson Prairie is the most accessible site for students who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible from the campus grounds , especially Baker Village and College Apartments . The prairie is regularly used by community members and neighbors for hikes , dog walking , bird watching , etc . <p> Research in Anderson Prairie <p> Biological research has been occurring since 1994 in Anderson Prairie . This research ranges from long-term experimental plots , multi-month summer student research , and class-based research projects ( projects lasting for several weeks during a semester ) . This research has been funded by the college as well as outside funding sources ( e.g. , HHMI research trios ) . Numerous student research posters and presentations have focused on , or included data from , Anderson Prairie . Six peer-reviewed scientific publications have been published by Kirk Larsen of the Biology department and his research students over the years ( F. Purrington and K. Larsen 1997 , K. Larsen and J.B. Williams 1999 , K. Larsen and J. A. Bovee 2001 , K. Larsen and T. Work 2003 , K. Larsen , T. Work , and F. Purrington 2003 , R. Worthington and K. Larsen 2010 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water draining from Ridge Road , Venneheim , surrounding housing development and farm fields . In the past four summers , the portion of Anderson Prairie nearest College Drive and Ridge Road has been flooded for at least one month . In 2016 , the area was flooded with standing water from late August to mid-October . A seven-acre building site would remove this infiltration and increase the amount of water to the City sewer system and to the Upper Iowa River . Other ecosystem services provided by reconstructed prairies include carbon sequestration and improved air quality . Anderson Prairie plays a significant role in improving local biodiversity . For example , over 200 monarch butterflies were banded in a two hour period in September 2016 . At least five native species recorded in Anderson Prairie have not been recorded elsewhere in the state . The prairie is densely populated by migratory birds for nesting and feeding habitat . As prairie becomes fragmented and reduced in size by development , the overall value decreases because of edge effects and restrictions to only species that can survive in smaller patches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been managing Anderson Prairie since its beginning as a reconstructed prairie , including planting , weed management , prescribed fire , etc . The college 's volunteer burn crews ( faculty , staff , and students ) have been conducting prescribed fires annually in various burn units of the prairie . Burn crews for particular fires vary in size ( typically 6 to 20 students ) and take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours of time in Anderson Prairie . Since 2010 , dedicated crews of interns ( 23 students over the past seven years ) have been conducting land stewardship in Anderson Prairie including invasive species treatment/removal , brush control , and native species supplementary plantings . <p> School Information The administration 's proposal was initiated by a request from the Decorah School Board . At this stage in consideration , a full site proposal has not been developed by the Decorah School Board .

@@1543729 <h> Radar Signatures for Severe Convective Weather <h> Storm Top Divergence <h> Detection <p> Storm top divergence refers to a diverging wind field in the vicinity of the storm top . To determine if you are seing a Storm Top Divergence signature , follow the techniques illustrated in the sections below . <p> Aliased Storm Top Divergence signature located approximately at the storm core top . <h> Reflectivity : PPI/Plan View <p> Determining updraft location : <p> Step up in elevation scans until you run out of &gt;50 dBZ echoes . <p> Step down one elevation scan . <p> Set a reference point in the vicinity of the 50 dBZ echo . Note : if the background flow is strong , the divergence signature may be upwind of the storm top . <p> Switch to the velocity field . <h> Velocity : PPI/Plan View <p> Start with stepping up or down by one elevation scan . <p> Is there an area of outbound radial velocities downrange and inbound radial velocities uprange from the reference point ? If yes , a Storm Top Divergence signature is present . <p> Note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes may not be displayed as a symmetric inboundoutbound velocity pair , as the jetlevel divergence signature may translate rapidly . Also , especially for storms close to the radar , a steeply tilted radar beam might only sample the inbound or outbound branch of the divergent flow at storm top level . Moreover , aliasing is common in this signature due to the high flow velocities ( often 50100 knots ) at this altitude . See the examples section for a demonstration of this . <h> Potential Difficulties in Detection <p> Aliased data Typically , velocity data is aliased in this signature purely due to the large velocity values observed as a result of divergence and/or the background flow at the altitude . <p> In particular for storms close to the radar , the tilted radar beam might only sample one of the two branches of the divergence signature , especially if the divergent layer at storm top level is shallow or the signature is located close to the radar . <p> The thunderstorm is too close to the radar Storm top is not visible as the beam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use the radio buttons or click the image to switch between reflectivity and velocity imagery : Reflectivity Velocity <p> Aliased Storm Top Divergence signature located approximately at the storm core top . <p> Use the radio buttons or click the image to switch between reflectivity and velocity imagery : Reflectivity Velocity <p> Aliased Storm Top Divergence signature located approximately at the storm core top . <p> Use the radio buttons or click the image to switch between reflectivity and velocity imagery : Reflectivity Velocity <p> Storm Top Divergence signature located at approximately storm core top .

Note : To avoid this mistake , make sure there is a white ( or zero radial velocity ) isodop separating the two wind fields . Usually aliasing will jump from maximum inbound to maximum outbound radial velocities . <p> Use the radio buttons or click the image to switch between reflectivity and velocity imagery : Reflectivity Velocity <p> Strong inbound flow , aliased , which looks like a Storm Top Divergence signature in the absolute velocity . Corresponding reflectivity fields show no storm top . <p> Corresponding CAPPI fields shows a storm top located 50 km away from the false divergence signature evident in the previous imagery . <p> Divergence signature not in the vicinity of the storm top As the divergence signature is representing the outflow from the strong updraft , it is necessary that the signature is in the vicinity of the updraft/storm top . <h> Conceptual Model <p> Strong storm top divergence is used as one of many signatures suggesting a severe thunderstorm . The presence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the upward velocity in a strong updraft is simply evacuated as outflow at the top of the thunderstorm . The intensity of the divergence is therefore positively correlated to the intensity of the updraft ( Witt &amp; Nelson , 1990 ) . <p> A strong updraft increases the chances of all four severe weather types , especially large hail and damaging winds . A study by Witt and Nelson ( 1990 ) derived a useful relationship between maximum storm top divergence and probabilities of maximum hail size ( for more see diagnosis tab ) . Damaging winds are included , as a strong updraft is likely to produce a strong downdraft , especially if large hail is expected . <h> Determining Thunderstorm Classification <p> Storm Top Divergence signatures can be found in all three of the storm types listed here . To help determine the classification of the thunderstorm you are observing , use the following flow chart to help diagnose which thunderstorm conceptual model you should consider more closely . <h> Diagnosis <p> Once you have confidently identified a Storm Top Divergence signature , this section will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spatial and temporal scales of a signature are loosely related to the updraft strength . In other words , the larger and/or more longlived the signature , the stronger the updraft that produced it . In velocitybased signatures , updraft severity can usually also be gauged by the magnitude of the measured radial velocities . Examining a storm 's overall temporal evolution will suggest whether the storm is becoming more or less severe . Radar signatures and associated storm developments can also be timeshifted relative to each other , as is the case in supercell tornadoes that occur during the collapse of the parent storm . <p> When comparing signatures to diagnose relative severity , keep in mind that it is assumed that signatures are sampled at equal ranges from the radar . Otherwise , a storm sampled at greater range ( with a wider beam ) can appear to be weak and/or weakening , while a storm sampled at a closer range ( with a narrower beam ) can appear to be strong and/or strengthening . <h> Degree of Severity <p> The stronger the maximum radial velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stronger the associated updraft velocity that is required to maintain the divergence . The following nomogram was produced from a study conducted in the United States by Witt and Nelson in 1991 , correlating observed hail size to the magnitude of the storm top divergence . <p> Probability of occurrence of various hail sizes based on the radial velocity differential across the storm top divergent flow DV . <p> Read off the maximum inbound and outbound velocity values and correct both for possible aliasing <p> Add the magnitudes of these two values together and use this number to find the corresponding probabilistic estimate of the maximum hail size on the nomogram . For the example above : ? V = ( 39 + 63 ) ms-1 = 102 ms-1 ( 198 knots ) . <p> The figures presented enables you to gauge whether you are dealing with a significant signature . Strong storm top divergence ( ? V exceeding approximately 50 knots ) strongly suggests the presence of a severe thunderstorm . However , radar information should never be used in isolation and should always be considered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotter reports . <h> Most Likely Convective Hazards <p> If a thunderstorm has been determined to be severe and possesses a strong Storm Top Divergence signature , the following severe convective hazards should be considered for inclusion in the severe thunderstorm warning : <p> Damaging winds a strong updraft , with potential to produce a strong downdraft . <p> Large hail a strong updraft has the potential to produce large hail , providing the updraft extends into the hail growth layer , 10C to 30C . Also the nomogram should give some direct indication of the maximum hail size expected from the storm . <p> See Conceptual Models for more details on why particular severe weather should be included .

Not only does this allow for a variety of courses to be offered on campus , it 's really lead to an astonishingly large number of possibilities for courses to be taught abroad and allows Luther to craft an educational experience where students are asked to draw connections across disciplines and cultures . <p> Image by Seth Vanderhorst <p> Throughout the post you will see images produced by students who accompanied us on the J-term course in China . These images were also on display during February in the Union Gallery on campus . <p> During January Luther College professor Todd Green published a wonderful ( and wildly successful ) blog post titled " Why Study Islam In Europe ? " As I sat there reading him so eloquently explain the advantages of teaching a religion course abroad , I naturally started to ask the same question of myself : why travel to Asia to teach photography ? Well , here 's my attempt to work through that very question . <p> A few years ago I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a job most ( including me ) would consider a dream . One of the mantras we tell the students on those trips is that they need to strive to be travelers , not tourists . While designing our J-Term course Professor Kate Elliott and I decided early on that this mantra should be part of the backbone in which the course was formed around . You see , tourists go to a place and they simply passively consume without leaving anything behind . But travelers , travelers mutually engage with culture . Yes , they may also consume but they also engage and exchange with the culture they are in . And it 's in that act of engagement that photography begins to show its advantages . <p> Image by DJ Simpson <p> There are some January trips based around traveling together almost entirely as a group , having daily readings , going to museums and other assignments . There are subjects in which this type of travel works very well , and it 's pretty fantastic to experience the exact thing you have been reading about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to travel more independently , engaging individually with the people you are photographing . <p> After a couple of classroom hours in the morning our students were asked to pick up their cameras , grab two other classmates , and head out into the neighborhood . Street photography is so much more than just mindlessly wandering and taking " vacation photos . " To successfully photograph in the streets you need to engage with the community around you . Your camera is your golden ticket , your excuse to push yourself out of your comfort zone and walk up to people and ask if you can make a portrait of them , or walk down that alleyway that looks slightly uninviting only to find out it contains a local restaurant and after a brief conversation with the owner you 've made a new friend .

We talk often about ways to break out of the " Luther bubble " and through the medium of photography our students were able to do just that . <p> So why do we travel to teach photography ? For me travel/street photography is a tool that allows me to engage with culture . It gives me an excuse to explore , to learn , and experience a place in a way I simply would n't do without the camera . It pushes me to leave my comfort zone and strike up conversations with people on the street . It 's through this engagement that I take away bits of culture and experiences that help me grow as a person , while at the same time leaving behind a piece of myself in the process .

Her immigration to Iowa certainly made her a writer and gave her a voice , which she probably would not have found in Norway , " Gulliksen said . <p> Kvaale said : <p> " Whenever I am writing a feature story , it is important to get as many details as possible .

Many things were obviously very different back then , but at the same time Elisabeth Koren 's very personal letters show us how a lot of human thoughts and feelings can be pretty universal across time and continents , " said Kvaale . " For me personally as a Norwegian it was great to visit Decorah and Luther College with all of its Norwegian-American history . It is truly a beautiful place .

@@1543770 <p> In chapter 6 binary search trees were defined along with a recursive insert algorithm . The discussion of binary search trees pointed out they have problems in some cases . Binary search trees can become unbalanced , actually quite often . When a tree is unbalanced the complexity of insert , delete , and lookup operations can get as bad as . This problem with unbalanced binary search trees was the motivation for the development of height-balanced AVL trees by G. M. Adelson-Velskii and E. M. Landis , two Soviet computer scientists , in 1962 . AVL trees were named for these two inventors . Their paper on AVL trees AVL62 described the first algorithm for maintaining balanced binary search trees . The chapter goes on to discuss Splay Trees as another example of balanced binary search trees . <p> AVL trees maintain their own balance . The balance can be maintained in one of two ways . Either the height of each node in the tree can be maintained or the balance of each node in the tree can be maintained .

@@1543802 <h> Radar Signatures for Severe Convective Weather <h> Damaging Low-level Winds <h> Detection <p> Damaging Low-level Winds is the only signature that directly observes one of the four convective hazards through radar eyes . The definition of severe damaging surface winds in Australia is gusts exceeding 48 knots at 10 m AGL . Winds that close to ground level are difficult to meaningfully estimate by radar unless the storm is very close to the radar . <p> Measurement of radial winds past the severity threshold of 48 knots with the radar beam centre at approximately 100 metres above radar level . <h> Velocity : PPI/Plan View <p> Using one of the lowest velocity tilts through a thunderstorm ( particularly , pay attention to those storms that are tall , large or have intense cores ) , move your cursor over the individual pixels , then note the maximum radial velocity recorded . Note : Be wary of aliased data . Aliased data is common with this signature due to the strength of the wind required . <p> Are there any ( dealiased ) velocity pixels exceeding 48 knots ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the info bar or the cursor data window . <p> Is the damaging wind measurement obtained in ( 2 ) located close to the surface ( within , say , a few hundred metres ) ? To determine this , read the height of the pixel off the scale bar , info bar or the cursor data window . If yes , low-level damaging winds are observed . <p> It is unlikely that the radial velocity observed in the Doppler channel equals the total surface wind . Three main adjustments are required to deduce the likelihood of damaging winds at the surface : <p> Viewing angle : The Doppler velocity shows only the radial component of the total wind . Due to this , the Doppler velocity is most likely an underestimation of the true wind velocity , and adjustments for the viewing angle need to be made . <p> Observation height : The radial velocity observed along the radar beam is most likely an overestimation of the true radial wind at the surface given that the total wind generally increases with height due to the decreasing influence of surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the greatest impact on the shape of the velocity wind profile . The lower the stability of the atmosphere , the more vigorous the eddies , and therefore the stronger the transfer of vertical momentum . There are , of course , exceptions to the rule that wind speeds should increase with height . In microbursts the strongest horizontal winds can be very close to the ground . <p> Radar sampling : The observed radial velocity on the radar display is an average of individual measurements throughout a broader pulse volume . Wind gusts can occur on a scale smaller than the pulse volume and would therefore be averaged with individual wind measurements that are less strong . This averaging process overall means that the radar measurement is an underestimate of the strongest winds within a pulse volume . <p> In summary , radar yields pulse-averaged radial velocities ( a double underestimate of the total velocity ) above the surface ( mostly an overestimate of the total surface velocity ) . Ideally , forecasters should endeavour to apply a viewing angle , pulse averaging and a height correction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lowest scanning angles . <p> There are a number of signatures that could be used as precursor to the onset and detection of damaging winds . Any of the signatures suggesting the presence of a strong updraft , could be used as an alert to the potential of a strong downdraft and damaging winds . For microbursts , the presence of strong low-level divergence signature could be a very short lead time precursor to the onset of damaging winds . Also for microbursts , midlevel convergence near a descending precipitation core ( a.k.a. a Mid-Altitude Radial Convergence or MARC signature ) might herald a microburst formation ( not shown ) . <p> Low-level divergence signature , a potential precursor for damaging winds at the surface for the special case of microbursts . <h> Potential Difficulties in Detection <p> Aliasing Forecasters may either not detect the signature , or are unable to determine the actual radial velocity due to velocity aliasing . <p> Measurement of radial winds past the severity threshold of 48 knots with the radar beam centre at approximately 100 metres above radar level . Strongest winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident to the northwest of the radar . <p> " Hot " velocity data As damaging winds are often shown as a small area of pixels , poor velocity data could easily be mistaken as true extreme values . To establish pixel value credibility , check that the suspected high velocity pixels exhibit some continuity in space and time . <p> Ground clutter breakthrough : It is desirable to obtain radar-based wind estimates as low to the ground as possible , which automatically increases the likelihood of ground clutter breaking into the velocity image . <p> The thunderstorm is located too far from radar Therefore the radar overshoots a shallow layer of damaging near-surface winds . <h> Examples of Damaging Low-level Winds <p> Measurement of radial winds around 60 knots near Sydney airport on 2 February 2005 as a supercell tracked across the area . The maximum radial velocity pixels are located around 100 m above radar level . <p> Destructive radial winds of 34.4 m/s ( 69 knots ) in the rear-flank downdraft region of a northeastward tracking supercell south of Brisbane . These radial winds were observed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 35.8 m/s ( 72 kts ) at 700m ARL associated with " The Gap " storm west of Brisbane . Note the ground clutter breakthrough west of the radar location . <h> Damaging Low-level Winds LookaLikes <p> Low velocity tilt of the Gap storm west of Brisbane seemingly showing aliased outbound velocities that folded back onto the zero line ( suggesting that the measured speed is twice the Nyquist velocity of 27.2 m/s , or 54.4 m/s 109 knots ) . Note that along the radial containing the " dubious " pixel , unphysical pixel to pixel velocity jumps of 24 m/s occur . Apart from the inflated magnitude of the signature , however , the overall signature still shows damaging low-level winds . <p> Use the radio buttons or click the image to switch between reflectivity and velocity imagery : Reflectivity Velocity <p> The velocity image seemingly shows three patches of very strong outbound velocities south , west and northwest of the radar . A comparison with the associated reflectivity distribution shows that no convective echoes are linked to any of the above three velocity peaks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model <p> Identifying a Damaging Low-level Winds signature directly indicates that the thunderstorm is severe . The presence of Damaging Low-level Winds generally suggests a strong downdraft . The most common mechanism for damaging winds is a downburst or microburst where negatively buoyant air with high vertical momentum reaches the surface . Negative buoyancy is primarily generated by evaporation and precipitation loading . In deep layer shear-affected storms , especially in supercells , downdrafts can be enhanced through the additional air parcel accelerations due to dynamically induced vertical pressure gradients . <p> Other mechanisms that generate damaging surface winds include the downward transfer of high horizontal momentum aloft , usually from a jet , brought down to the surface through a downdraft or vertical mixing . <p> Finally , very strong surface winds can be created near supercells through large horizontal pressure gradients due to the formation of a storm scale low ( low level mesocyclone ) . <p> Damaging winds should definitely be included on the warning with upgrades to destructive winds if the surface winds are likely to reach 67 knots or 125 km/hr . <h> Determining Thunderstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the conceptual models we have included in this module . <p> To help determine the classification of the thunderstorm you are observing , use the following flow chart to help diagnose which thunderstorm conceptual model you should consider more closely <h> Diagnosis <p> Once you have confidently identified a Damaging Low-Level Winds signature , this section will help you estimate the storm severity associated with it . Generally , the spatial and temporal scales of a signature are loosely related to the updraft strength . In other words , the larger and/or more longlived the signature , the stronger the updraft that produced it . In velocity-based signatures , updraft severity can usually also be gauged by the magnitude of the measured radial velocities . Examining a storms overall temporal evolution will suggest whether the storm is becoming more or less severe . Radar signatures and associated storm developments can also be time-shifted relative to each other , as is the case in supercell tornadoes that occur during the collapse of the parent storm . <p> When comparing signatures to diagnose relative severity , keep in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the radar . Otherwise , a storm sampled at greater range ( with a wider beam ) can appear to be weak and/or weakening , while a storm sampled at a closer range ( with a narrower beam ) can appear to be strong and/or strengthening . <h> Degree of Severity <p> Magnitude of the measured radial velocities The stronger the radial velocities along the radar beam , the higher the likelihood of stronger flow on the surface . <p> Proximity of radar-observed damaging winds to the surface The closer a radial wind measurement is to the surface , the higher the chance that most of this wind magnitude will also be present at the surface . The lower the static environmental stability below the radar beam , the higher the likelihood that vertical momentum can be transferred from the beam height to the ground . <p> Horizontal extent of the damaging winds The larger the area of damaging winds the more destruction is likely . <p> Longevity of the damaging winds The longer the damaging wind signature exists , the longer-lived the storm and more damage likely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to determine overall the severity of the storm . The presence of Damaging Low-level Winds is one of the few signatures that can influence you directly into issuing a severe thunderstorm warning . Generally , radar information should never be used in isolation and should always be considered in conjunction with the near storm environment and any reports . <h> Most Likely Convective Hazards <p> If a thunderstorm has been determined to be severe and possesses a Damaging Low-level Winds signature , the following convective hazards should be considered to be included in the severe thunderstorm warning : <p> damaging winds , with some consideration to upgrading the warning to include destructive winds , especially with observed winds of above 67 knots close to the surface . <p> See Conceptual Models for more details on why particular severe weather should be included
