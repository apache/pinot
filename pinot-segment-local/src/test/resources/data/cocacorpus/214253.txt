@@3686762 <h> A Timeline of K-12 Competency-Based Education Across New England States <p> The New England region stands out for its early innovations , bold vision , and high percentage of districts becoming competency-based . Yet , a quick glance at the timeline shows that the earliest models popped up on both sides of the country " in Boston and Anchorage " around 1995 . So why is it that competency-based education has taken hold in New England with such momentum ? <p> Let 's take a look at a few of the possibilities . <h> A Good Idea Creates Continuity <p> The New England states have not had continuity in leadership . Governors have changed , as have the Secretaries of Education and other key personnel . Complicated budget issues , volatile political dynamics , and redistricting have demanded attention . Yet competency education has continued to be a major priority . Why ? Because there are enough people in influential positions who believe in it . Some have argued that because students in New England states are relatively high-achieving , there just is n't any other way to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , many educators will vouch for it , affirming that once you understand what competency education can do , there is no going back . With strong local control , this makes it harder for state leadership to change course because the policy is perceived as beneficial to students and educators. - <h> Geographic Size <p> The small geographic size of New England states helps , but ca n't fully explain the momentum . Small states can make it easier to bring people together to build a cohesive vision and understanding of competency education . Small districts can also be an advantage in creating a dialogue within schools and with communities about why the change is important as well as managing mid-course corrections in implementation . Yet , every state big or small faces the same challenges of scaling beyond the coalition of the willing . <h> A Catalytic Intermediary <p> Great Schools Partnership ( GSP ) has played a vital role in advancing proficiency-based learning . It has provided technical guidance to states in their efforts to create policies , helped to develop exemplars of graduation expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential barriers of proficiency-based diplomas , and provided training and technical assistance to districts and schools . They have demonstrated enormous generosity in sharing their resources under Creative Commons licensing . As an intermediary , GSP has also developed expertise across states , thus building extraordinary capacity in understanding the choices and implications of different policy and design decisions . <h> History of Inter- and Intra- State Collaboration <p> The New England states have a history of collaboration across states and within states . For example , Maine , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Vermont have used the same standards and same state assessment system , the New England Common Assessment Program.10 All of the New England states , with the exception of Massachusetts , formed the- New England Secondary Schools Consortium- ( NESSC ) and its regional professional learning community , the- League of Innovative Schools- ( LIS ) , which has spurred on the efforts to introduce personalized , competency-based education . In 2007 , the commissioners of five states signed a- pledge to implement proficiency-based graduation , flexible learning pathways , and redesigned student-centered accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are advancing together , with no state too far behind or too far ahead . NESSC and LIS have also generated and disseminated effective practices across the networks so that districts and schools receive support even when state resources are not available . <h> Strong Philanthropic Partners <p> There is no doubt that philanthropy has played a catalytic role in advancing competency education in New England . The Nellie Mae Education Foundation has played a powerful role through the combination of strategic investments throughout New England to support student-centered learning and the inspirational leadership of one of the early leaders of competency education , Nicholas Donohue , the Commissioner of Education at the time that New Hampshire redefined the Carnegie unit credit and now the foundation 's President . With the addition of another regional foundation , the Boston-based Barr Foundation , with a team of program officers knowledgeable in personalized learning and competency education , it is likely that these foundations will have even greater catalytic influence . <h> Leadership <p> Leadership matters . We know it does . There has been extraordinary leadership in the New England states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many to list here . There are leaders willing to convert to competency education before the idea takes hold because they feel it 's the right thing to do for students . There are leaders who have created the early models and provided opportunity for others to see it in action . There are leaders who excel in engaging others in sharing a vision and the belief that it is possible to transform the education system . There are policy leaders working together to support each other across states . There are leaders who possess an imagination big enough to begin to put into place the new systems based on transparency , empowerment , and responsiveness that will help students succeed no matter what their backgrounds . <p> There are two qualities of leadership that abound in the state policymakers , districts , and schools leading the way in New England . First , they are leader-learners , always seeking to better understand , to become more effective , and to seek out the best ideas even if it means accepting that theirs might not be . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( referred to as distributed , adaptive , or transformational leadership ) needed to help educators move from the traditional system to embrace the values and create the conditions for a more personalized , competency-based system . Are these qualities we can only find in New England , with its history of town meetings ? Doubtful . They can be found all across our nation . However , it is possible that the multiple networks and collaboratives in New England have helped to nurture and popularize these forms of leadership . <p> What does this all mean for other states that are geographically larger , operate in isolation , or lack catalytic intermediaries and foundations ? It means they will need to figure out their own strategic advantages , develop partnerships , and , if necessary , seek to form partnerships outside their region to tap into the expertise they need . They , too , will need to create cultures of learning , engage communities in defining what they want for their children , and develop their own shared vision and values to ignite the transformation process .

@@3686900 <h> Boosting Access to the Benefits of Blended Learning <p> Organizations like iNACOL and the many partners we are honored to serve and support have long recognized the role of policy in either encouraging or blocking progress toward universal access to high-quality , personalized learning options . We spend a lot of time working as advocates for the creation of policies to enable education innovation or the removal of policies that stifle it . <p> One active example that has our attention , and deserves yours too , is playing out in Pennsylvania . <h> Policy Barrier in Pennsylvania <p> A vague Pennsylvania law is being interpreted to restrict blended learning for cyber schools . This is leaving cyber charter schools with little flexibility to create blended learning environments that combine the advantages of face-to-face instruction with the best of online learning . <p> Recently the Philadelphia Inquirer- reported that Pennsylvania 's Education Department is requiring cyber charter schools offering blended learning to significantly curtail their use of physical facilities for in-person instruction . What was not part of the story is how Pennsylvania 's charter school policies contribute significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter schools to choose between offering almost entirely face-to-face or entirely online instructioncutting them off from the full potential of blended learning . Cyber charter schools do not have clear legislative authority to blend instructional approaches . This creates tensions and challenges for schools , teachers , parents , and students . Most importantly , this holds back educators from shifting to new models of learning backed by a- growing body ofevidence , such as the RAND report that found " students are making significantly greater gains in math and reading over the last two years than a virtual control group made up of similar students at comparable schools . " <p> Throughout Pennsylvania and nationwide , there are promising examples , both within school districts and charter schools , of blended learning that enhances and personalizes students ' learning experiences . In some schools , students rotate between individualized , collaborative , and direct instruction learning stations . Teachers personalize instruction and support learners who have much more control over their pacing with online curriculum . <p> Cyber charter schools can effectively use drop-in learning centers to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging , hands-on learning opportunities to help students become independent , lifelong learners . These efforts are starting to show results across all grades and subjects , often with the highest gains going to at-risk and special education students . <p> Solutions exist to allow cyber charter schools operating blended programs to stay open and to use blended learning to meet students ' unique needs . <p> A Simple Solution . Pennsylvania 's Education Department is limiting the use of cyber charter schools ' physical facilities to only testing , tutoring , and special education services . School district-based charter schools do not face the same limitations . The Department can support blended learning in cyber charter schools simply by removing this unnecessary restriction . The policy fix really is this simple . <p> Pennsylvania 's charter school laws must be updated . It has been 13 years since the state 's cyber charter school law passed and many of today 's blended learning models did not exist at the time . <p> Pennsylvania lawmakers should think long and hard about how to best update the state 's laws to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter schools , to use the best of blended learning to improve student success . <p> There are legitimate questions and concerns surrounding funding policies , quality assurance , and school districts ' local control .

Pennsylvania state leaders should do the same .

@@3686975 <h> We Have a Proficiency-Based Diploma . Now What ? <p> The trust in the conventional education system has been undermined by the tradition of awarding diplomas to students who do not possess the skills needed for college and careers . It has been possible in many districts to receive a diploma even though students are still reading at the elementary school level . In order to eliminate this practice of passing students on without the necessary skills , states are introducing policies that set the expectation that students will demonstrate proficiency at an agreed upon performance level in order to receive a diploma ( i.e. , a proficiency-based diploma ) . <p> The proficiency-based graduation policies developed in Maine , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Vermont appear to be high-leverage in terms of engaging districts ; however , the diploma policy can not stand alone .

Second , states may want to expedite the process by helping districts understand the elements of personalized , competency-based systems and/or the implementation process .

@@3687039 <h> On Scaling Competency Education : Equity , Quality , and Sustainability <p> The early lesson from New England is that the scaling strategies for competency-based education require a combination of schools and districts that have the courageous leadership to convert to competency education and state leadership willing to commit to goal-oriented policies supported by long-term capacity-building strategies . Again , over time and as more states move forward , we are likely to learn about where there might be additional issues that need to be addressed . In particular , districts and states need to consider equity , quality , and sustainability . <h> Equity <p> Even though equity resides at the very heart of competency-based education , it still requires an unrelenting commitment to challenge institutional patterns , individual bias that creates lower expectations , and strong management practices that can lead to much greater responsiveness . The focus on equity should be found in the accountability designs within school , district , and state systems and processes as well as the schoolwide instructional philosophies and strategies . <p> Although states are trying to increase responsiveness through embedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with educators across New England suggest that courageous leadership is still needed . Under the pressure of the end-of-year accountability exams , too many schools and educators , even in the most developed competency-based districts , are still providing grade-level curriculum to students even if they have already learned the content or are lacking the prerequisite skills . In addition to leadership , we will need to engage a broad range of expertise , both practitioner and leadership , to identify the best ways to help students fill skill gaps without falling back into the trap of tracking . <h> Quality <p> The field is currently challenged by not having enough research and evaluation on the quality indicators for competency-based districts and schools to determine the elements that will lead to a high-quality model or effective implementation . This task is further complicated by what might be called waves of innovation that take place once districts become competency-based : As educators and schools become more intentional about what they want students to know and be able to do , there are efforts to build assessment literacy ; build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order skills ; develop stronger instructional strategies based on- learning progressions ; introduce practices that support student agency , voice , and choice ; integrate more personalized learning practices ; and introduce digital tools and online learning . Thus , schools and districts are taking different paths with different sequencing as they build the full range of capacities needed to operate a high-quality competency-based system . <p> Another consideration is whether districts are converting to competency-based education because they see it as meaningful for students or it is done solely under the weight of compliance . In some districts , there has been extraordinary commitment of the community and school board to developing high-quality competency-based schools . However , we do not know what the impact will be of districts converting because of state policy rather than because they see real value in it . Without understanding the major levers that will produce high-quality , equity-boosting achievement , districts must rely on benchmarking " learning about the most effective processes that their colleagues are using across the region . <p> Thus , at this point , states must depend primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principals , and educators in conversations about quality . Vermont 's strategy for peer-led quality review of schools may be the most promising until greater research is in place . <p> As we have seen with other efforts to create innovation space , early adopters take advantage of the opportunity , but it does n't necessarily translate into a groundswell of change . For example , once Connecticut 's enabling policy to allow for mastery-based credits was in place , at least three districts sought to redesign the K-12 system and another fifteen or more were solely focusing on high schools . Time will tell if Connecticut 's strategy will lead to more districts embracing mastery-based learning or if there will need to be additional policy or support . <h> Sustainability <p> The momentum in New England for creating a personalized , competency-based system continues to grow in the New England states . Most of the strategies used in New England have required a strong consensus that the traditional system is obsolete ; to date , that commitment has remained vital even through major leadership changes . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have raised their voices against competency education are taking the word of private vendors , who claim that competency education is the same as online learning . To date , they appear not to understand that competency education , rooted in the growth mindset , deeply values teachers and teaching and can help strengthen the knowledge and skills of teachers to respond more effectively to the needs of their students . <p> One of the crystal clear lessons learned from districts that have transformed their systems is that community engagement is not something you do once or twice . It becomes an ongoing process in which the districts open up dialogues , listen to feedback to inform their efforts , and , when possible , co-create strategies that meet the needs of communities , parents , students , and teachers . Community engagement is equally important as a mechanism to create the respect and trust needed for empowering school cultures and continuous improvement as a sustainability strategy .

@@3687089 <p> Assessment literacy has traditionally evoked measurement principles such as validity and reliability accompanied by complex equations , statistical terms , and images of normal curves , ogives , and error bands . We now conceptualize assessment literacy as the knowledge and skills associated with designing , selecting , interpreting , and using high-quality assessments to improve student learning . Beyond using assessments in their classrooms , assessment literate educators should be equipped to deal with an onslaught of data from large-scale state assessments , interim assessments , local district- or school-wide assessments , and classroom-based assessments . Whatever the definition , there is widespread concern about the lack of assessment literacy among educators . <p> The call for improved assessment literacy is not isolated to teachers . Administrators and policymakers need to be assessment literate to understand how to support school improvement efforts and other major initiatives . Unfortunately , educational leaders are inundated with so much data that they often resort to ideology , prior knowledge , and misleading sales pitches to make decisions ( Coburn , 2009 ; Gerzon , 2015 ) . The assessment literacy expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contextual nature of assessment literacy . For example , district leaders need to understand how to interpret and use assessment data to evaluate programs , but they do not necessarily need to know how to interpret student work on a complex mathematics performance assessment in order to be considered assessment literate . This also points to the need for different types of assessments to serve different purposes and uses . Therefore , assessment literacy also refers to an understanding of systems of assessment coherently linked together through a common learning model . <p> Improving assessment literacy has been a major challenge in the assessment community for many years . Notably , people like Rick Stiggins have kept this issue at the forefront of professional measurement organizations for at least 30 years . While we have made some progress , we are also facing new challenges . Many are now pushing for educators , administrators , and policymakers to be literate about the assessment of student learning in competency-based education systems and related initiatives to promote deeper learning by students . Unfortunately , unlike designing scoring rubrics for evaluating student writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education are just starting to be addressed by the measurement community . This makes enhancing literacy of assessment in a competency-based context that much more challenging . For instance , when designing competency-based systems , educators and educational leaders need to work from research-based frameworks on how students develop discipline-based and interdisciplinary expertise . This raises challenges , among others , of creating assessments and assessment systems to support inferences of generalization ( or transfer ) . <p> iNACOL has invited noted assessment experts Scott Marion and Lorrie Shepard to discuss ways to promote assessment literacy in general and with competency-based education systems more specifically in an upcoming webinar on Thursday , June 15 from 3:00-4:00 p.m .

When the body is overstressed , it is more difficult to develop and exhibit self-control and delayed gratification. - Those skills are helpful in academic settings but for students in stressful environments it is more like having a fire alarm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the poverty directly , but the stress related to it that causes academic issues. - Our application in online learning is to be sure our focus on big data and learning management also includes collecting information on student home lives and providing interventions when necessary . <p> The next obvious question is how to address the stress associated with high poverty home environments ; exactly what type of interventions will be effective. - Parental attachment let 's students deal with the stress of poverty. - Children need to be comforted when they are upset. - While that sounds intuitive to many parents , what it looks like in practice does not come naturally to all. - Parenting coaches help parents learn to better comfort their children and build stronger attachments. - When parent attachment is high , the stress levels children experience is drastically lower , even in high poverty . Students can also benefit from intense mentoring that will help students better cope with the stress in their lives . By focusing on these non-academic issue , students are in a better mental state to develop the soft skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are typically face-to-face , the core coaching and mentoring can certainly be applied in an online environment as well . <p> The second section of the book focuses on how to build character , by which he means self-control , willpower , and motivation. - There is a good summary of psychological research on motivation including a study that showed candy as a reward led kids to do better on IQ test. - It of course was n't that it made them smarter , it made them try harder. - It is n't just a high IQ that helps you do better in life , job , school , money , but the characteristics that make you try hard on an IQ test to get a higher score too . While these little perks help with motivation , too much affluence can actually hurt motivation . Without enough struggle people generally do n't develop character as well. - Prestigious schools do n't raise the ceiling for rich kids , they raise the floor. - By surrounding students with other affluent achievers , it provides a safety net that will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are working on systems that seek to teach character traits that lead to academic success . KIPP schools have behavior modification systems like SLANT , which stands for sit up listen ask questions , nod and track speaker. - They refer to it as role switching , how you need to act when in the dominant culture , which is the business culture and how you should act at college interview , in a museum etc. - Other strategies that are taught in some schools include mental contrasting where students are taught to concentrate on positive outcomes as well as obstacles that may get in way of achieving it . Students do better when they think they can improve their intelligence. - Character report cards seek to reinforce with students that their character is something they can improve over time. - It is not static. - These behavior modification systems and character report cards are certainly interesting ideas to incorporate further into the online environment . <p> The third section of the book looks at how to think. - The primary example is with chess. - Some schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching students how to play at high levels. - When students become more accomplished chess players , it correlates with an increase in IQ. - Additionally , it teaches soft-skills like problem solving and self-control. - The idea of clubs in the online arena is by no means new , but Mr. Tough 's ideas make a compelling argument for any online school to add a chess club or give it more priority if it already exists . <p> The fourth section focuses on how to succeed . There is a college conundrum in our nation in that we still send lots of kids to college but other nations are catching up with their post-secondary attendance rates . College education is more valuable today than it has ever been yet we have so many American college students dropping out. - One issue is undermatching in low income groups where they tend to attend schools below their ability level and that actually makes them more likely to drop-out. - Whether or not you finish college has more to do with your work ethic than IQ. - This work ethic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just ACT SAT prep , they need rigorous courses along with mentoring that provides a path to college for students and focuses on that long-term goal. - This is an area where online learning is well positioned to meet student needs. - Projects like NROC 's Ed Ready can let students see what they need to do to gain the necessary skills to be good candidates for higher level colleges. - The visualizations possible in an online tool like this help make the college preparation process concrete in a way never possible before . <p> The final point Mr. Tough makes is about creating a better path for students . He begins with where not to look , teacher quality is important but likely accounts for only ten percent of variation in student success . Initiatives for educating high poverty populations work best with the most able of the poor , but our national education initiatives are done broadly based on lunch subsidies so we ca n't easily identify the best places to focus efforts. - We need a well-organized national system like Teach for America but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motivated staff to help young children better deal with the stress of their high poverty lives. - When students are able to better deal with the stress in their lives , they will be in a position to close achievement gaps seen in underperforming groups . <p> The overall message of the author is that schools must focus on addressing non-academic barriers before students are ready to learn the content schools teach. - For students to be successful in college and beyond , they will need soft-skills that will equip them to persevere through difficult academic and life situations. - These skills can be taught to students in schools and need to be supported with intensive mentoring for at-risk students . <p> In terms of blended and online learning , the overarching application is that we must shift our focus from being so content driven. - A learning management system is ideally suited to efficiently help students acquire content knowledge. - However , if we stop there , we have done our students a disservice and have not set them up to succeed after leaving the K-12 education system. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their postsecondary education and the skills required to well wherever that next step is. - In this challenge , we in online learning also have a great opportunity because of our ability to easily organize and aggregate student data. - Instead of only focusing on student data with academic performance , the focus must shift towards data on student soft-skills and gaps in those skills that need to be addressed. - Overall , this book is one that I would recommend to anyone in online and blended learning. - Mr. Tough compiles a wealth of educational research and presents it in interesting snippets that keep the reader engaged. - It provides a glimpse into the bigger picture of the challenges our students face everyday outside the classroom and what we can do to help them . <p> Joe Cozart is the Associate Director of Strategic Planning with Georgia Virtual Learning , which runs a statewide virtual school through the Georgia Department of Education. - He has been in education since 2003 and online learning since 2005 . Dr. Cozart oversees research conducted on the program both internally and externally. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Additionally , he writes policies for the school and advises regarding online learning policies with stakeholders across the state. - Dr. Cozart earned his Ph.D . from The University of Georgia in mathematics and science education .
