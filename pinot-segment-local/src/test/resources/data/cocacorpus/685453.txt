@@29728379 @3428379/ <h> Dormeo 's Frequently Asked Questions <h> FAQ <p> What is memory foam ? <p> Memory foam is a revolutionary material which was developed by NASA for the space program to give astronauts additional support during take-off and landing . High density memory foam , like that used in our mattresses , was developed for use in the bedding industry because of its amazing pressure relieving ability . Memory foam reacts with the heat of your body , moulding to your body shape and giving you ultimate support and comfort for a really great nights sleep . <p> How are memory foam mattresses made ? <p> Dormeo memory foam mattresses have a layer of high quality visco-elastic memory foam on the very top of the mattress . This provides comfort and support right where you need it . The memory foam layer is supported by a thicker layer of Dormeos patented Ecocell foam , which provides additional support for the body and works in conjunction with the memory foam to draw away heat and moisture from the sleep surface throughout the night . This core is wrapped up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate in comfort . <p> What will memory foam do for me ? <p> Memory foam provides a very comfortable and supportive sleeping environment , free of allergens and dust mites . If you have n't slept on a memory foam bed before , or if you are upgrading to a Dormeo mattress from another memory foam bed , you can be confident in the quality and value that Dormeo memory foam mattresses provide . You 'll get comfortable faster , fall asleep quicker , sleep deeper for longer and wake up feeling fully refreshed . <p> Will memory foam help with my back pain ? <p> Dormeo mattresses are ideal for sufferers of back pain , because the comforting memory foam moulds to the shape of your body , relieving pressure points and spreading the weight across your whole body . Memory foam mattresses are known the world over to provide excellent support for the back and neck . They allow better spine alignment while you sleep and reduce the number of uncomfortable pressure points you sometimes experience with other mattresses . Whilst we can not guarantee or make any specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattresses , we do know that they give a very comfortable and supportive nights sleep . <p> Is memory foam hot ? <p> Dormeo memory foam mattresses have been specially designed to keep you cool all night long . Our researchers have spent years perfecting the perfect combination of foam layers in the Dormeo memory foam mattress for just this purpose . Dormeos own patented Ecocell foam which supports the memory foam layer has a remarkable open structure with millions of breathable pores that allow air and heat and humidity to be drawn away from the sleeping surface whilst you sleep , to keep you cool and fresh all night . <p> Is a memory foam mattress good or bad for dust mites and other allergens ? <p> Memory foam naturally repels dust mites and is not a source of allergens like other mattresses . Feathers , horse hair and sprung mattresses all provide environments which have excellent living and breeding conditions for dust mites and over time allergens and dust mites numbers in these mattresses can become very large indeed . With memory foam , the structure and density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more hygienic bed for the best possible nights sleep . <p> Are your memory foam mattresses delivered rolled and vacuum packed ? <p> Yes , all our Dormeo memory foam mattresses are vacuum packed and rolled before they leave our manufacturing facility in Italy . We have found that not only does this have a positive environmental impact , because we can use fewer lorries to transport the same number of mattresses , but that it is also the most hygienic and convenient method of delivery for our customers . The mattresses havent been touched by anyone else before you open them , and when you get them into your home you can easily carry them to your bedroom before opening them . The process of rolling and packing the mattresses does not cause any damage to the mattress in any way . <p> How do I open my memory foam mattress when it arrives ? <p> When your Dormeo memory foam mattress is delivered simply take it to the room of your choice and then carefully open the plastic cover with a small knife or pair of scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to damage the cotton cover of the mattress when opening it . <p> What happens when I unpack my memory foam mattress ? <p> When the plastic cover is pierced , this allows air back into the mattress . Very quickly , usually within 15 minutes , the mattress will have recovered its original shape . We always recommend you allow 6 hours for the mattress to fully regain its shape before covering it with sheets and sleeping on it for the first time . <p> Does my memory foam mattress require turning ? <p> Your Dormeo memory foam mattress does not require turning like other mattresses . Because the memory foam layer is on one side of the mattress , we just recommend rotating the mattress head to toe every two weeks . <p> I 've heard memory foam mattresses can be smelly - does Dormeo smell ? <p> This is called " off-gassing " and is frequently found with cheap imported mattresses . Immediately after opening your vacuum-packed Dormeo there will be a faint smell from the foam , but this will quickly disappear . <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a simple result of the natural oxidization process and happens with all memory foam mattresses . It does not affect the performance or feeling of the mattress in any way . <p> Can I try your mattresses before I buy ? <p> To keep our memory foam mattresses at the best possible prices for our customers , we currently only sell our mattresses via dormeo.co.uk and through other carefully selected online retailers . But we do offer a unique 60 night risk-free trial on all our memory foam mattresses , which means that we will refund or exchange your mattress after 60 nights with absolutely no quibble , if you are not happy with it . So why not try it for yourself in your own home , and well take the risk for you ? <p> Why is the guarantee so long ? <p> We rigorously test all our memory foam mattresses to ensure that they will provide the same comfort and support for a very long time with normal use .

The material was initially considered far too expensive for general public use and was used in hospitals for both people and animals ! Supporting precious injured race horses was an often unknown early use . NASA launched memory foam to the world in the 1980s , but there were few companies willing to work with the material initially . Memory foam continued to be used in the medical world , particularly with immobile bed-ridden patients who were at risk of developing pressure sores .

But .... was never really interested in trying it out as for me was just another mattress . Then this year i found myself in the situation where i had to sleep on a sofa in the living room . I think i changed about 3 sofas as they all looked appealing in the shop but offered a very bad night sleep . As i was very reserved in trying another sofa , i started to look for a topper . This time i was prepared to pay the price for the right topper as i would have been able to reuse it in the future . It 's how i came across the Dormeo toppers . I bought one of the expensive ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sleeping like a baby ! On a sofa believe it or not ! As i have the topper on my normal hard base sofa ! I have been sleeping on it for over 3 months now and I am extremely pleased with my choice .

The mattress arrived promptly and is very comfortable . It is also a blessedly neutral colour ( white/grey ) not one of those hideous day-glo combos in nylon ' brocade ' . I think it looks slightly less thick than my previous mattress but does not feel thinner : it is very supportive.The mattress arrived rolled up which was funny for some reason but it 's actually very convenient when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the programme on TV and just a few days later it arrived at our house , after unwrapping and following instructions we went to bed that evening to what I have to say was / is the most comfortable nights sleep I have had in years , With it having a 15 year guarantee as well we are very happy with the purchase and would recommend to anyone considering buying one , do not waste time thinking about it . Have a great nights sleep and wake up refreshed like I do <p> When it came to time for a new mattress we thought we 'd give a Dormeo a try &amp; very glad we did . At first sight the mattress seemed a bit thin &amp; we wondered if it would support us . We went for the Duo to give us some variations . Firm side up suits us best &amp; the memory foam topper really makes it . We both have less problems with our backs &amp; hips , sleep well &amp; do n't disturb each other when we get up in the night.Overall , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these mattresses years ago , our quality of sleep has improved no end . I also bought the memory foam pillows which my husband is not so keen on but I love it but that 's just personal choice . Fantastic would recommend to anyone <p> My mattress is absolutely superb . I had a memory foam mattress before but nothing like this it is absolutely superb and so supportive .

Protection , by Massive Attack <p> Just because of the peace of the thing . Had you forgotten how good this sounds ? <h> 5 . Sad and Beautiful World , by Sparklehorse <p> This really must be one of the saddest and , yes , most beautiful songs ever . Sniffle . So beautiful .

Yet its not hugely discussed. - So we wanted to give you an outline on what it is , what to look out for , and steps you can take to prevent it from occurring . <h> What is sleep apnea ? <p> Sleep apnea is a very common sleep disorder characterised by irregular and- interrupted breathing in your sleep . Basically , pauses in your breathing which can last for a few seconds to a few minutes . This shallow breathing , too-infrequent breaths , and actual gaps- in breathing can take place- more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loud snort or choking sound. - Sleep apnea has the potential to be- quite a serious health risk , and as such deserves to be taken seriously . <h> Diagnosing it <p> The primary symptoms of sleep apnea are breathing difficulties during sleep , which is of course difficult to spot because well , because were asleep ! <p> People who suffer from sleep apnea are rarely aware of the problem because they just do n't  recognise that they 're having respiratory problems in their sleep . In general , there are three different types of sleep apnea : obstructive , central and mixed . It may be something your partner can pick up based on how they comfortably they observe you to be sleeping . <h> Symptoms <p> As- mentioned previously- there 's a high chance that you 'll maybe not- be able to recognise if you 're a sufferer of sleep apnea , so try make sure that the other members of your family aware of potential problems , what to look out for , and if you are concerned that you or are a family member are suffering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look out for when diagnosing sleep apnea include : <p> Loud snoring <p> Sore or dry throat <p> Often waking-up with a snort or choke <p> Daytime sleepiness <p> Lack of energy <p> Morning headaches <p> Forgetfulness <p> Difficulties in concentrating <p> Mood changes <p> Decreased libido <h> Who is most at risk ? <p> Research findings show that about 6 to 7 percent of people- suffer from sleep apnea , so its a not inconsiderable- amount of people . Sleep apnea can happen to both men and women , adults and children , but there are certain groups of people for whom- sleep apnea is much more common .

@@29728432 @3428432/ <h> British Summer Time Facts <p> It happens every year , but we realised we actually knew very little about how and why we change our clocks twice a year . So , we did all the work to find out the details so you do n't need to . <p> Did you know ? <p> 1 . Although the date varies from year to year , the clocks always go forward on the last Sunday in March of the Gregorian calendar . This year that makes it Sunday 26th March at 1am . <p> 2 . British Summer Time and Daylight Savings Time are the same thing . <p> 3 . The practice was invented by George Vincent Hudson , a New Zealand entomologist in 1895 but the first Brit to suggest it was businessman William Willett who published a pamphlet in 1907 entitled A Waste of Daylight . In it he claimed that we should make the most of the brighter mornings that come with summer by getting up an hour earlier and having more daylight hours after work . <p> 4 . Britain did n't formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented it as a wartime measure . By which time , unfortunately William Willett had died . It was thought it might help the war effort , save fuel by adding an hour of natural light and improve the economy by boosting working hours . <p> 5 . William Willett happens to be Chris Martin from Coldplay 's great-great-grandfather . <p> 6 . All the 2,000 clocks inside the Houses of Parliament are changed at the same time ( well just afterwards ) ; with a team of people working throughout the night to ensure they all show the correct time . <p> 7 . The mission to turn back the giant hands on Big Ben 's four clock faces takes an incredible FIVE hours in total . <p> 8 . The best way to avoid changing the clocks the wrong way and being two hours out of sync is to memorise the phrase Spring forward , Fall back . ' <p> 9 . While the UK has always had daylight savings time since it was first introduced , it came into widespread use across the world during the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice was temporarily discontinued by the UK government in 1940 when they introduced Double British Summertime instead . At this time , the nation was put two hours ahead of GMT in the summer and 1 hour ahead in the winter . The idea was to increase productivity and ensure people got home before the blackout . <p> 11 . Harold Wilsons Labour government experimented with a return to Double BST in 1968 , although Scotland protested it left northern parts of the country dangerously dark until 10am . It was abandoned three years later . <p> 12 . Since 1981 , European Union directives have ensured a uniform observance of daylight savings time . Until then , many member states had different start and end dates , which made conducting business across the continent difficult . Iceland , Belarus and Russia are the only European countries to opt out of this system and instead remain on the same time all year round . <p> 13 . Many have argued for a permanent change to British Summer Time , prioritising sunlit evenings over bright mornings . The Daily Telegraph adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses in the same time zone as Brussels , Paris , Frankfurt and Milan . For businesses that operate internationally , this could cut down staff overtime costs not to mention confusion over scheduling . It would also give the UK an extra hour of overlap with Beijing , Tokyo and other major import and export markets in Asia . <p> 14 . Studies in the US National Library of Medicine have shown there is an increase in accidents in the days following the switch as the hour less sleep makes people drowsier . An extra hour of evening daylight could potentially save the NHS -200 million a year in accident related costs . In addition , the Home Office believes crime would see a 3% drop , as crime is more likely to be committed in the evening than in the morning . <p> 15 . A report from the Policy Studies Institute in the mid-1990s estimated that consumers could save -260 million a year on electricity bills by switching permanently to BST . More recently , researchers at the University of Cambridge found that an extra daily hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as people use less electricity and heating . <p> 16. - Scientists have found that children benefit more from longer evenings , where they can be active for up to 20% for longer but concerns have been raised about the dangers of children walking to school in the darker mornings . <p> 17 . Lighter and longer winter evenings could provide an annual boost of -3.5 billion to the tourist industry , according to the Tourism Alliance as businesses would be inclined to stay open longer . <p> 18 . The Football Association , The Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have all backed year-round daylight savings , and with good reason . The extra hour of daytime increases the time available for exercise , makes people more likely to attend evening sporting events and means professional athletes can train for longer . <p> So , what do you think ?

But .... was never really interested in trying it out as for me was just another mattress . Then this year i found myself in the situation where i had to sleep on a sofa in the living room . I think i changed about 3 sofas as they all looked appealing in the shop but offered a very bad night sleep . As i was very reserved in trying another sofa , i started to look for a topper . This time i was prepared to pay the price for the right topper as i would have been able to reuse it in the future . It 's how i came across the Dormeo toppers . I bought one of the expensive ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sleeping like a baby ! On a sofa believe it or not ! As i have the topper on my normal hard base sofa ! I have been sleeping on it for over 3 months now and I am extremely pleased with my choice . I would definitely recommend Dormeo products ! <p> Dormeo mattress we purchased definitely works exactly as is described.Its easy to handle , lightweight and a very comfortable supportive place to rest our weary heads.Great idea to be able to switch and turn each half separately for individual comfort.altogether a great product . <p> I have had ' normal ' mattresses before so was a bit unsure about this but it worked out well . The mattress arrived promptly and is very comfortable . It is also a blessedly neutral colour ( white/grey ) not one of those hideous day-glo combos in nylon ' brocade ' . I think it looks slightly less thick than my previous mattress but does not feel thinner : it is very supportive.The mattress arrived rolled up which was funny for some reason but it 's actually very convenient when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the programme on TV and just a few days later it arrived at our house , after unwrapping and following instructions we went to bed that evening to what I have to say was / is the most comfortable nights sleep I have had in years , With it having a 15 year guarantee as well we are very happy with the purchase and would recommend to anyone considering buying one , do not waste time thinking about it . Have a great nights sleep and wake up refreshed like I do <p> When it came to time for a new mattress we thought we 'd give a Dormeo a try &amp; very glad we did . At first sight the mattress seemed a bit thin &amp; we wondered if it would support us . We went for the Duo to give us some variations .

( The term " Devices " almost seems too cold a word somehow does n't  it , when , really , they are " magic wands " - that enable us to- stay connected with our loved ones wherever they are in the world . ) <h> Modern connectivity is coming at a price and harming our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , as soon as they wake up in the night , instantly check their phones ? - <p> Checking on loved ones is one thing , making sure no emergency texts or calls have come in , but the dreaded and wonderful internet is another thing entirely . How tempting is it just to have another wee peek at the gossip pages , to check- out what 's been going on on Facebook , to read yet another piece of sporting analysis , or to do a spot of online shopping ? The worldwide web is one of the biggest distractions to sleep there is and accounts for- many lost hours and weary mornings . <p> Astonishingly 1 in 4 of us do n't  silence our phones before sleep . <p> Perhaps this is because we also use it as an alarm clock , perhaps its because we do n't  want to be uncontactable in case of emergency . Whatever it is , it leaves us open to broken sleep . <p> One in 10 people say that they are woken by their phone at least once a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes it may be emails coming in . Whatever it is , that blue light in the periphery of your vision or random chirruping of alerts is n't going to help your sleep . <p> If you want good quality , deep sleep , experts unanimously recommend that you should n't use your electronic devices just before bedtime . The reason being that the blue light emanating from the screen sends confusing signals to your mind , tricking it into thinking you are in daylight hours . This messes with your bodys melatonin production and prevents true sleepiness . <p> So you ca n't sleep . It seems like the easiest thing in the world to go reaching for that phone or iPad to while away a few minutes before you feel tired again . But this is all leading towards what is known as JUNK SLEEP. - Junk Sleep is low quality sleep caused by using electronic devices . <h> What you can do : <p> 1 . Turn off the tech about 15-30mins before going to your bedroom to sleep . Itll help your mind calm itself and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom into a tech-free zone .

@@29728499 @3428499/ <h> A Guide to the Healthiest Sleeping Positions <p> For an activity we do for a third of our lives , it is remarkable how little we think about sleep . But we all know just how much it affects our waking lives , especially when we do n't get enough of it . <p> Many factors can affect how well you sleep , and one thing that can affect the quality of your sleep is your sleeping position . So could your chosen position actually be worse for you than another option ? <h> On the Back Is Best <p> According to an article in Medical Daily , the best sleeping position is on the back . It quotes a couple of experts , including Dr. Michael Breus , the Sleep Doctor , who recommend this option . Apparently , this keeps you in a neutral position with everything in alignment , and it avoids putting pressure onto your joints . It is also good for acid reflux , but it may increase snoring . <h> Side Sleeping Comes in Second <p> According to the same source sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly for those that suffer with back pain , neck pain or snoring . It does have its downsides however , including the possibility of ageing the skin and causing facial wrinkles . The side you choose to sleep on also makes a difference . Right-sided sleepers suffer more heartburn whilst left-sided sleeping puts pressure on organs like the lungs and liver . Despite its popularity , sleeping in the foetal position ( on your side with your knees drawn up to your chest ) can cause neck and back pain and is not recommended . <h> On Your Stomach in Third <p> Sleeping on your stomach is not recommended for every night . This does not support the spine 's natural curve , and it puts pressure on the muscles and joints which can lead to numbness and pain . It is definitely not a good option for people with back pain , but it may be beneficial for snorers . <h> The Importance of a Good Mattress <p> No matter which position you sleep in , one thing to remember is that you need a high-quality mattress if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The type of mattress you choose is up to you , and there are many options , including memory foam mattresses , which can be ideal for getting a comfortable night 's sleep . <p> With mattresses , you tend to get what you pay for . You should also try out some mattresses in the store if you can , and also read up on some online reviews to get a good idea for the options available . <h> FUN FACTS <p> Sleeping on your back where your face is not pressed up agaisnt your pillow leads to fewer facial wrinkles . <p> Doctors recommend sleeping on your left side when pregnant as it improves circulation to the heart which benefits both mother and baby . <p> Although sleeping on your stomach is regarded as the worst position , one of the benefits is that it eases snoring . <h> How Do You Sleep ? <p> Because of the importance of your sleep position , it could be worth thinking some more about the type of sleep position you favour . Whether it reflects your personality or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wellbeing . <p> If you are waking up with aches and pains , or you feel you have not rested properly , it could well be your sleeping position .

If you 're struggling to remember , it 's probably time they were replaced . The Sleep Council recommends that pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets every five . <p> Your pillow is vitally important to getting a good night 's sleep . After all , it supports your head ( which , for an average adult , weighs an impressive 11lb ) and aligns your neck with your spine . Anyone who has ever fallen asleep upright and woken up with a crick in their neck will know how incredibly important this is . Some experts say that if you can fold your pillow in half without it flipping back into shape , it has lost its support and needs to be replaced . <p> Even if you only manage 6 hours sleep a night , your pillow will be doing its best to aid your sleep for over 2000 hours per year .

Its benefits have been recorded by numerous civilizations dating as far back as around 2,200 BC when its cleansing benefits are first thought to have been documented by the Mesopotamians . <p> There are numerous documented uses of the Aloe Vera plant throughout history and the world . Ancient Chinese doctors called it the harmonic remedy ' ; the Hindu people the silent healer ' ; the Russians the Elixir of Longevity ' and during the Crusades , the Knights of Templar created a drink using aloe juice that they named the Elixir of Jerusalem ' .

There are many benefits associated with letting your dog sleep next to you through the night . A recent survey1 showed that over half of 23,000 dog owners allowed their pooch to curl up in bed next to them . If you are n't  quite convinced , here are 5 reasons why your dog should sleep in your bed with you : <h> 1 . Helps with insomnia <p> If you 're a sufferer of the clinical condition insomnia , having the company of your dog in your bed could help ease the symptoms . Insomnia sufferers have difficulty falling asleep or struggle to sleep continuously throughout the night . The presence of a dog has been proven to have amazing calming influences and may even help with relaxation techniques .

If you found it a frightening experience you may well have experienced the phenomenon of Sleep Paralysis . <p> What is it ? <p> This phenomenon can affect people of all ages and the frequency of attack seems to be linked to a combination of genetics and sleep disturbance . It 's not harmful in a medical sense and the attacks themselves pass in just a few seconds or minutes at the most , but are extremely frightening for the person suffering . <p> Episodes occur during the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep . During an episode sufferers are aware that they are still in their bedrooms , but may feel as though there is a pressure on their chest and often find it difficult to take deep breaths . Some find they can open their eyes whilst others ca n't . Many sufferers report an overwhelming feeling of dread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are convinced that there is someone or something in the room with them that means them harm . In children and young people especially , this can cause anxiousness about going back to sleep . <p> Experts agree that episodes occur as a result of disrupted REM sleep when there is an inability to move muscle in order to prevent us from acting out our dreams . In other words , your brain is awake but your body is n't . <p> How common is it ? <p> The most recent research suggests that around 8% of the population suffers regularly from Sleep Paralysis and that it is more common in people with depression and anxiety or other recognised sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea . It 's likely that up to 40% of the population will suffer at some point and students seem to be at great risk with at least a quarter reporting episodes . This makes sense when you consider the link between lack of quality sleep and Sleep Paralysis . <p> The history <p> Sleep experts have known about Sleep Paralysis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cultures from all over the world . Many have developed fables and tales to explain what happens during an episode . The 1781 painting by Henry Fuseli called " The Nightmare " shown at the beginning of this article , depicts a demon sitting on the chest of a sleeping woman , and is perhaps the most famous historic example of a Sleep Paralysis depiction . <p> One theory suggests Sleep Paralysis may also have played a role in the 1692 Salem Witch trials . A 2003 paper quotes a possible description of sleep paralysis found in evidence used during that time . Bernard Peach testified that one night , " he heard a scrabbling at the window , whereat he then saw Susanna Martin come in , and jump down upon the floor . She took hold of this deponents feet , and drawing his body up into an heap , she lay upon him near two hours ; in all which time he could neither speak nor stir .

The open cavities of the mattress are perfect places for dead skin cells to congregate , the ideal- food for hungry dust-mites , and a nice little resting spot .

@@29728552 @3428552/ <h> 6 Ways Sleep Can Help You Lose Weight <p> When we were young , our mothers always told us how much we needed to get a good nights sleep . <p> After all , restful sleep is important to good health . Perhaps it is more important than many of us realise . Numerous studies through the years have shown that how much sleep we get can directly affect how much we weigh . Sleeping too little or too much can lead to weight gain while sleeping just enough can help us lose those extra pounds and keep them off . For the record , the Mayo Clinics Dr Donald Hensrud says the optimal amount of sleep is 5 to 9 hours per night . Anything less than five is too little ; anything more than nine is too much . With that in mind , here are six ways that sleep affects both weight loss and gain : <h> Sleep Affects Food Choices <p> When you do not get enough sleep , your brain is tired . And when that happens , you are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are sleep-deprived are more likely to choose foods that are high in carbs and fat . Individuals who do n't  sleep enough also tend to consume more sugar . Just think about that sweet latte you indulge in every morning in order to wake up . <h> Sleep Affects Hunger Levels <p> Lack of sleep is known to interrupt hormonal balance . Where hunger is concerned , not getting enough sleep tends to make you hungry more often due to an imbalance of two hormones known as leptin and ghrelin . The former tells you to stop eating because you are full while the latter signals your body that its time to eat . When both are out of balance , you are likely to eat more than you need . <h> Fatigue Causes the Body to Store Fat <p> Another hormone , cortisol , spikes when you 're not getting enough sleep . Cortisol triggers your body to conserve as much energy as possible so that your body is properly fuelled , resulting in a natural tendency to store fat . In other words , not sleeping enough is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat rather than burning it as energy . <h> Sleep Affects Insulin Levels <p> When you 're getting enough restful sleep , your body is able to process the insulin it needs to break down sugars and starches into usable energy sources . On the other hand , not having enough insulin results in an inability to process the foods you consume , leading to even more fat storage . <h> sleep Affects Exercise <p> Studies have shown a direct correlation between how much sleep people get and how often they exercise . Those who sleep too little often find they do not have enough time to exercise regularly while those who sleep too much tend to lack the will to exercise . Both groups also tend to say they just do n't  have the energy to exercise . At any rate , not getting enough exercise directly affects weight gain and loss . <h> Too Much Sleep Can Lead to Lethargy <p> While its true that not getting enough sleep is unhealthy , getting too much sleep can be equally so . People who tend to sleep more than nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Lethargy results in a lack of drive and energy , which then dictates that a person will burn fewer calories throughout the day due to lack of activity . On the other hand , feeling refreshed and ready to go in the morning tends to be a great motivating factor to keep moving . The more you move , the more calories you burn in your daily routine . <h> Get Enough Quality Sleep to Help Weight Loss <p> The relationship between sleep and weight gain/loss is fascinating in the sense that sleep , by itself , does n't  determine how difficult a time a person has managing weight . But sleep does affect decision-making , hormonal balance , metabolism , and the amount of energy we put into the days activities . Those four factors are direct influences of both weight gain and loss . <p> If you get between five and nine hours of restful sleep every night , you should have an easier time maintaining a healthy weight .

Here are some tips for making sure you get enough good quality sleep : <h> Stick to a schedule <p> This means going to bed and getting up at the same time each day . When your body is in a routine you will find it easier to fall asleep at night and to wake up in the morning . <h> electronic devices <p> Try to avoid using your phone , tablet , laptop and TV for at least 1-2 hours before bed .

Invest in a good quality mattress , such as a Dormeo memory foam mattress , to help you get a great nights sleep every night . <h> What you consume <p> Try to avoid consuming any stimulants for a few hours before bed , including caffeine , nicotine and alcohol . Large meals may also make getting to sleep more difficult ; try smaller snacks of nuts or warm milk . <h> Relax <p> Try to avoid getting your adrenaline pumping by doing any high intensity exercise and stop working at least two hours before bed . Listening to soothing music , meditation or reading can help to stop your mind from racing and prepare you for sleep . 
@@29728553 @3428553/ <h> Why You Should Wake Up in the Night <p> Yes , you did read that right . It 's estimated that at least one third of us regularly wake up in the middle of the night and of those , nearly half are unable to easily fall back to sleep . Quite often , a trip to the doctor will result in an insomnia diagnosis and some medication to treat it . But is this the right route to take and why do we wake in the first place ? <p> Some scientists and historians have argued that far from this being a sign of a medical problem , in humans there could be an innate biological preference for two sleeps each night . Many of us consider eight uninterrupted hours of rest the marker of a healthy lifestyle but it seems that this holy grail ' of sleep is actually unprecedented in human- history . <p> First Sleep and Second Sleep <p> According to 16 years ' worth of research by influential historian Roger Ekirch in 2001 , prior to the Industrial Revolution our ancestors experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which means sleeping for two separate intervals each night with a period of wakefulness in-between . <p> These segments are referred to in many historical documents including medical records and diaries , as First Sleep ' lasting from around 9pm or 10pm until midnight and Second Sleep ' from around 1am until dawn. - In-between people would either stay in bed and meditate or pray , or get up to take medication , do chores such as brewing ale or talk with family or neighbours . Doctors also believed this time to be ideal for conception . <p> So what changed ? <p> It was the Industrial Revolution that ultimately led to a change in people 's sleeping habits . The invention of electric lighting meant that people began to stay up later into the evening , prolonging our productivity and experience of daylight but cutting night time short . Also , as people gravitated towards working in factories rather than on farms , the working day began to be dictated by strict time schedules as opposed to the natural patterns of light and dark . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it all in one go . <p> Ekirch has concluded that biphasic sleep may not have been characteristic of all cultures , but it certainly seems to have been present in a large percentage of pre-industrial cultures . Indeed , segmented sleep continues to be the norm for many people in undeveloped parts of the world , such as the Tiv group in Central Nigeria . <p> What about today ? <p> An experiment conducted in the 1990s by Thomas Wehr , also concluded that biphasic sleep could indeed be our natural sleep pattern . He found that after spending 14 hours a day in darkness each day for a month ( as we would have done in the days before electricity ) volunteers naturally began to sleep in two shifts with a period of wakefulness in the middle . <p> These experiments have helped Psychiatrists and Sleep Scientists distinguish between the kind of insomnia people experience when they ca n't fall asleep in the first place , and waking up in the middle of the night which is actually likely to be a remnant of this long-dominant pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that if these people start to perceive interrupted sleep as normal , they will experience less distress when they wake at night , and fall back to sleep more easily . <p> Of course it 's hard to fall asleep in the first place if your mattress is n't in tip-top shape .

We 've all been there " those nonsensical worlds where the familiar is turned upside down , where we are capable of things we could never do in real life . <p> Dreams of flying and running over buildings may be exhilarating , but then there are the ones about falling , being chased by man-eating tigers or perhaps being trapped in a burning building . Those are n't so great . <p> What if we could understand what they mean ? What if we could tease out the common elements and link them to what is happening in our everyday lives ? Many people believe we can do just that , and here at Dormeo we have looked into some of the most common explanations for you . <h> Dreams of Falling , Flying and Being Chased <p> Do you regularly dream about falling uncontrollably , or from a great height ? If so , it could be an indication of underlying anxiety or a lack of control in everyday life . But the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fall it could simply mean a gradual process of letting go . <p> When it comes to flying , the same principle applies do we fly confidently towards a goal , do we soar high in the sky , or do we just skim the surface of the ground , unable to gain height ? Flying often indicates confidence and control , but if you have trouble maintaining it there may be obstacles in your path . <p> Being chased suggests that you are running away from your problems . Turn around and look at who is chasing you . Is it someone you recognise ? Does this give you a clue about the issue you should be trying to resolve ? <h> Dreams About Your Teeth Falling Out <p> Another common dream is the imagining of ones teeth falling out all at once .

A still , clear lake or sparkling stream suggests that we are managing our emotions well , but cloudy or turbulent water indicates a more troubled mind . <h> Dreaming About Money <p> Many of us have seen money in our dreams , whether we 've won it , found it , or just appeared to have it . This can represent a quest for love or power , rooting from new energy and confidence within . On the other hand , losing money may reflect a sense of loss related to power or ambition in a present situation . <h> At the end of the day , only you can decide what your dreams mean. - But if you 're regularly hunted by a scary great white shark through a murky ocean " well you may just want to turn around and hit that symbolic shark on its metaphorical nose ! <p> Dormeo is an Italian memory foam mattress brand dedicated to delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about our products and the benefits of ordering direct through us ( and avoiding all the sharks ! ) - HERE . <h> ( Image source unknown .

@@29728571 @3428571/ <h> Top Ten Tips For An Allergy-Free Bedroom <p> It is estimated that more than 10 million people suffer with hayfever in England alone and there are plenty more if you factor in other allergies . <p> If you happen to be one of these people , you may well find that your symptoms worsen at night . There are three main reasons for this . Firstly , pollen levels worsen at night time . Secondly , many bedrooms contain hidden allergens . Lastly , consider whether it 's time to change your pillows . The Sleep Council recommends you do this every two years " more details about why over in our Pillow Talk blog . <p> If you are a sufferer , the good news is that there are things you can do to limit your symptoms . <h> 1 . Clothing <p> Hayfever and seasonal allergies are caused by pollen which we all unknowingly carry around in our hair , shoes and clothes after being outside . Consider keeping your laundry basket outside of the bedroom so that dirty clothes do n't contaminate the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Curtains <p> Ideally , curtains need to be washed every three to six months at the highest temperature allowed on the label . If that seems like an awful lot of hassle ( as it does to us ! ) , a roller blind may well be the way forward . <h> 3 . Plants <p> Keep flowers out of the bedroom to minimise pollen exposure at night . Houseplants however , can act as good air filters if you do n't  have a specific allergy to mould . <h> 4 . Floor <p> If you have carpets , vacuuming daily at the worst times of the year is a good idea but remember that dust can stay in the air for up to 4 hours . If you have flooring in the bedroom , washable rugs are ideal . <p> A bedstead may be a better bet than a divan for serious allergy sufferers because of the improved air circulation . If you have a model that allows you to easily vacuum underneath , that 's a big bonus too ! <h> 5 . Windows <p> Wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both can trigger symptoms if you have allergies or asthma . Also wipe blinds , the bed frame itself and other dust traps with a damp cloth at least once a week to reduce reactions to dust . <p> Keep your windows closed in the early morning and early evening during the pollen season , but keeping them open slightly during the night is recommended in order to keep the bedroom well ventilated . <h> 6 . De-clutter <p> Keep things ' to a minimum in the bedroom and try not to store anything under the bed . The fewer items there are to collect dust , the easier it is to clean and the better you 'll be able to breathe " and sleep . <h> 7 . Temperature <p> Dust mites ca n't breed as well at lower temperatures , so turning the heating down further than you usually would may be a good idea . <h> 8 . You ! <p> Having a bath or shower before bed will remove any pollen and other allergens that you 've collected over the course of the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests it may help you sleep better . <h> 9 . Bedding <p> Anti-allergy mattress and pillow protectors are a worthy investment and all bedding should be washable at 60 degrees . Drying in a hot dryer will further reduce any allergens. <h> 10 . Mattress <p> Last but certainly not least , it 's important to consider your mattress itself . Did you know that the average traditionally sprung mattress can have upwards of 10 million dust mites living in it . Creepy , eh ? It 's for that very reason that Dormeo strongly recommends that allergy sufferers choose a memory foam mattress . <p> Memory foam mattresses are made from inorganic fibres and as such , they do n't provide any tasty , life-sustaining food for nasty , hungry dust-mites to feed on . As a result , dust-mites ca n't thrive and will avoid them . <p> For the same reason , allergy sufferers should avoid padded headboards and the use of quilts and cushions on the bed . In fact , the less upholstery in your bedroom the better when it comes to allergies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanitized- protection against dust-mites , fungi and bacteria , making them especially suitable for people with asthma or allergies .

@@29728573 @3428573/ <h> 6 Signs You 're Not Sleeping Well <p> We all know that not getting enough sleep is n't good for us and that a bad night will likely mean a day of scratchy eyes , low mood and a fuzzy head but there are other , less well known signs that your sleep is perhaps not as good quality as you may think . Here are some of the stranger things to watch out for . <p> - 1 . Your Eyes Do n't Work <p> If your sleep has been suffering recently , you may well be suffering from eye strain which can cause blurry vision and swollen , itchy or sore , watery , sensitive eyes . Its not usually serious if it only happens occasionally and usually calms down after a nap or a shot of caffeine . <p> If your lack of sleep becomes a habit however , you 'll start to find it does n't calm down quite so easily . That 's because tiredness affects the eye muscles and specifically , the muscles that helps the eye to focus and the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't working well , you may even experience double vision which can be quite scary . <p> 2 . You 're Clumsy <p> Put simply , this is because tired people ca n't function as well . We all have the occasional day when nothing appears to go right . You spill your coffee , trip over the cat , forget where you put your keys and drive so badly you wonder you ever had the co-ordination to manage it properly . On these days , it 's worth considering how you slept the night before . When we need sleep , our reflexes are dulled , reaction times are slower and our balance and depth perception are off . In other words , you 're quite possibly an accident waiting to happen . <p> 3 . You Keep Getting Sick <p> Thanks to a study conducted in 2009 , there 's no doubt that a lack of good quality sleep suppresses the immune system . The study found that people who slept less than 7 hours each night were three times more likely to catch a cold than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to bed early instead . <p> 4 . Everyone Gets On Your Nerves <p> As any new parent can tell you , sleep deprivation directly affects your mood and when you 're tired the world and everyone in it are , quite simply , annoying ! Do n't worry though , this is n't a long term problem ( unless you are a new parent ) ; a good sleep will put things back into perspective again . <p> 5 . You Ca n't Stop Snacking <p> If your brain is n't getting the energy it needs from sleep , it may try to get it from food . Lack of sleep stimulates the production of ghrelin , a hormone that makes you crave all things fatty and sugary and leptin , the hormone that tells your body it 's full . If you 're constantly visiting the fridge , it 's worth considering a change in your sleeping habits . <p> 6 . Shall I or Sha n't I ? <p> If you are n't  getting enough sleep , you 'll probably find you ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reaction time issue noted above but does n't just affect us physically . Poor sleep hinders our ability to make quick decisions and the resulting mental lethargy can make us feel frustrated and frankly , a bit useless .

Dormeo can help eliminate the most common causes of a lack of sleep but do n't just take our word for it .

@@29728574 @3428574/ <h> Once Upon a Time <p> Once upon a time , it was practically unheard of for children to go to bed without a bedtime story . It seems a shame then that a recent study found that although more parents read to their children than they did a generation ago , approximately two thirds of parents today still do not read regularly to their children . Of course , with ever increasing demands on our time something has to give . But do you know the benefits of snuggling up to your little ones with a book ? <p> Dormeo investigates <p> Routine <p> Childcare specialists talk of the importance of establishing a routine for children and of preparing them for sleep by winding down ' before bed . A bedtime story is a fantastic way to separate the hustle and bustle of the daytime activities and the quieter , calmer time before bed . <p> Communication and Comprehension <p> It 's in the pre-school years that children learn critical language and enunciation skills . By listening to you read , your child is reinforcing the basic sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stories read aloud and following along with the story , children see and hear how to pronounce words correctly . You will find that your child 's vocabulary grows and they become better at expressing how they feel and think about what you are reading . <p> As Stacey Sheppard , freelance writer and author of the popular interior design blog The Design Sheppard told Dormeo Reading is something I love to do with my own children . My eldest daughter is almost two and a half and people always comment on how good her language and vocabulary is . I definitely put this down to all the reading we do . I want my kids to develop their imaginations and what better way than through reading stories ? ' <p> Stacey is absolutely right . Studies have proven the link between reading and vocabulary as well as showing that the greater a child 's vocabulary , the better their later reading comprehension across the subjects . <p> Later on , reading helps to develop Communication Confidence ' . - We are not born understanding how to communicate effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the actual stories we read with our children assist in raising awareness of how to communicate well with others , but the conversations we have with them about the stories also help . <p> Academic Achievement <p> Everyone wants their kid to achieve to the best of their ability right ? Is n't that why we spend so much time choosing the right school for them ? Numerous studies have shown that being exposed to reading before school age leads to a greater aptitude for learning in general . <p> Interestingly , research has also repeatedly shown that the most accurate predictor of a pupil 's achievement is not household income or social status but the extent to which parents create an environment at home that encourages learning . <p> Logic <p> Reading helps children grasp abstract concepts , apply logic , recognise cause and effect , and utilise good judgment . As children begin to relate the scenarios in books to what 's happening in their world , they are likely to become more interested in stories in general . As a result , if they are approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to help prepare them ? It may help to show children that their anxiety is normal and help to make them feel less anxious . <p> By listening to stories , children learn how to predict events , to recall events in a certain order and to make sense of real life situations . In other words , you are helping to provide them with skills that can only benefit them throughout their education and beyond . <p> Reading is fun ! <p> Early reading can help children view books as a treat rather than a chore . As Liz Daffern told Dormeo We read to the kids every night and they feel very hard done by if they do n't  get their stories ! ' <p> Children with a wide exposure to reading materials are far more likely to choose books over video games or television as they grow older . As Stacey Sheppard told Dormeo All the other kids would be out on their bikes but I just could n't put my book down . It was the same for my brother and now weve both gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soppy bit Those parents that do read regularly to their children talk of the bonding experience this provides .

@@29728575 @3428575/ <h> The Top Ten Things You Did n't Know About Sleep <p> 1 . Before alarm clocks were affordable or reliable , people were employed as " knocker-ups " to wake people up . <p> The profession started in Britain and Ireland during the Industrial Revolution and lasted well into the 1920s . A knocker-ups job was to rouse sleeping people so they were n't late for work . <p> In return for a few pence a week , the knocker-up would knock at the door with a truncheon or short , heavy stick or use a long bamboo cane to reach the bedroom window . They would n't leave until they were sure that their client was awake . Many policemen supplemented their income this way . <p> 2 . The sensation of falling when half asleep and jerking yourself awake ? That 's a myoclonic jerk ' . <p> Have you ever gently drifted off to sleep only to suddenly jerk awake , convinced you 've just had a fall or crashed into something ? This happens in the first sleep stage during which muscle activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really knows why these jerks occur but they are perfectly normal . They seem to be more frequent in young people . <p> A study published in 2008 found that childhood exposure to black-and-white television seemed to be the common denominator . It found that people aged 25 and younger almost never dreamed in black and white but people aged over 55 , who grew up with little access to colour television reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time . <p> 4 . If your pillow is over 2-3 years old , you may have more company at night than you realise <p> In a horrifying study of the health ' of hundreds of pillows , Dr Arthur Tucker , principal clinical scientist at Barts and The London NHS Trust found that up to a third of the weight of a pillow could be made up of bugs , dead skin , dust mites and their faeces . <p> All other mammals simply fall asleep when tired . Humans however , choose to work late , read , watch TV " almost anything in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is why we suffer so much from anxiety and depression . <p> 6 . Parents of newborns miss out on 6 MONTHS of sleep in the first 2 years of their childs life . <p> That 's according to research conducted in 2010 . Most adults need at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep every 24 hours in order to function properly but almost two thirds ( 64% ) of parents with babies and under-twos get just three-and three-quarters hours . And even worse , 12% of those surveyed get less than two-and-a-half hours of uninterrupted sleep per night . <p> It goes without saying that these parents suffer a huge sleep debt which can lead to mood swings , depression , arguments and even relationship break-ups . <p> In 1964 , 17 year old Randy Gardner , a high school student in San Diego , California , stayed awake for 264.4 hours ( 11 days 24 minutes ) . <p> Serious cognitive and behavioural changes were recorded during the experiment , including moodiness , problems with concentration and short term memory , paranoia , and hallucinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press conference without slurring or stumbling his words and in general appeared to be fine . <p> After completing his record , Gardner slept 14 hours and 40 minutes straight and no long term psychological or physical effects were observed . It 's important to point out however , that others have died staying awake for this long . <p> 8 . Memory foam was originally developed by NASA . <p> Memory foam has been around a lot longer than you might think , but it was n't originally developed with mattresses and pillows in mind . In fact , being both very soft and highly energy absorbing , it was first developed in the 1960 's by NASA 's Ames Research Center to be used in aircraft seat cushions . Since then , it has found many other uses but is now probably best known for its use in the sleep industry . <p> For humans and other land mammals , sleep involves partial or total unconsciousness .

Dormeos Octaspringmattresses , for example , are 8 x more breathable than traditional memory foam and will keep you cooler at night . <p> Is the cover washable ? Does your mattress have a removable cover ? Some do . Again , this is something that Octaspring has and itll keep the mattress fresher for longer and preserve its- longevity in the same way that reducing night sweats will . <p> No metal springs . Comfort is absolutely essential- for sleep . Sleeping on an old spring mattress- can lead to pressure points , and not having a layer of clothing to protect our bodies from this can exacerbate the problems caused by a lumpy mattress . These pressure points will- result in discomfort which will wake you up and prevent you from getting a good nights sleep . This is why many experts recommend getting a good quality memory foam mattress .

A Swiss study also found that when the body prepares to sleep , the bodys temperature regulation system redistributes warmth from the core of the body to your extremities . Having cold signals coming from the feet demands more of the body and upsets the production of melatonin , the hormone most closely related to- your- sleep cycle . <p> But which socks should you wear ? Do n't  just put on your dowdy old holes-in-the-heel black work socks made of well-worn threadbare materials.Why not treat yourself to some luxurious cashmere bed socks- and really make going to bed every night feel like the treat it really is ! <p> If you sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of becoming too warm in the night and waking up as a result , but- you can counter this by choosing a mattress which has built-in- temperature regulation , like the breathable Dormeo Octaspring , which will keep your body at the perfect temperature all through the night . <p> Of course when it comes to er other more adult-themed- bedroom activities , the wearing of socks is well-known as a strict no-no , particularly on gentlemen .

But the true secret to youthful looks is right in front of you , you 've heard of it before , and its cheaper than anything else you 've tried . Its called BEAUTY SLEEP . <p> Scientists agree that those who get a regular 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep look more youthful and attractive than those who are deprived of sleep . In fact , in one study , - conducted at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and published in the British Medical Journal , 20 young people were photographed after a good nights sleep and again after a broken nights sleep . Members of the public were then asked to rate the photographs in terms of attractiveness and the clear winners were the well-rested . Sounds obvious when you think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better beauty sleep <p> 1 . Get into a good sleep habit . Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day . This routine will help get your body get into a good routine for sleep and it will help your sleep and help your skin recover as a result . <p> 2 . Treat yourself to a better- pillowcase . Sleeping on a fine cotton , satin or silk pillowcase with a high thread count will be kinder to your skin . <p> 3 . Sleep on white sheets and pillowcases. - Overly coloured- materials often use dyes that can be unkind to- sensitive skin . <p> 4 . Sleep on your back . Repeated pressure on the skin caused by side or foetal sleeping can cause facial creasing , and eventually lead to permanent , set-in lines on the face . <p> 5 . Change your pillows and pillowcases regularly so you 're not resting your lovely skin on top of a nest of bacteria for 8 hours at a time . <p> 6 . Sleep with a humidifier in the room . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that requires air conditioning . We all know its good to keep hydrated by drinking lots of water , but do n't  forget the importance of keeping hydrated externally . Ever use moisturiser on your face ? You can help yourself by- sleeping- around moist air . <p> 7 . Try to avoid alcohol- and salty food before bedtime as this will dehydrate your body . Your body over-compensates for this by collecting natural fluids- around the eyes and in other places , leading to that puffy-eyed , tired look . <p> 8 . Get a good mattress . We really ca n't stress enough the importance of good sleep to health and beauty . When we sleep our cells are busy rebuilding and repairing themselves . Lack of sleep drastically impairs this function and bad sleep also leads to- stress , which causes the capillaries to tighten , meaning the bodys flow of nutrients to the skin is reduced , causing skin and hair to look dull and lifeless .

The temptation to go wild both on the slopes and in the apres-ski is always there is n't it ! So how can you prepare appropriately for your ski holiday , ensuring you stay healthy and avoid mishaps ? <p> Dormeos " home " market of Slovenia ( sharing- a border with- Italy , Austria , Croatia and Hungary ) is a nation that 's skiing mad , boasting a proud history of world and Olympic champions , and the team there have kindly put together some top tips for us part-time skiers to take into account <h> 1 . Advice : - It Pays to Have the Right Kit <p> Do n't  go skiing with old- equipment . Not for just appearance reasons , but mainly due to the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boards primarily . Old equipment is not as responsive as it should be , and there- have been so many advances in technology and components over the years that skiing on new kit is just so much easier . <p> If you ski on new equipment , you 'll be able to ski longer , you 'll feel less pain , you 'll feel less tired and your enjoyment will be far greater. - ( Were not talking about Fergie one-pieces here , which were told are actually back in the horror ! ) <p> Rental ? - Definitely worth it if you 're only having a- few days in the snow each year. - Take particular care in- choosing the right ski boots a few minutes extra in the rental shop is SO worth- it- compared to discomfort all day up the mountain . <h> Tip 2 : - Prepare Your Body <p> Try to prepare for your holiday- with some basic exercises to get your body in shape for the unfamiliar rigours that will be placed on it on the slopes. - General endurance ( aerobic exercise ) and strengthening individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You do n't  need to be ripped as a result , but if your body is firm , strong and durable , the skiing is better because your endurance will be so much greater and the- likelihood of injury will be significantly decreased . <h> Tip 3 : Plan the Details of Your Ski Holiday in- Advance <p> Certain factors , such as the weather , we cant control . But most of the others we can . Before you decide to ski , devise a good plan for your holiday . <p> You need to know where you 're going to be sleeping ( do n't  choose somewhere without carefully thinking what the beds might be like you 'll pay for it if you do n't  ) ; where and what you 'll be eating ; wholl be responsible for the transportation , and- so on <p> If you know that you 'll have to get bus transport to the ski lifts make sure you know the timings . Most of all- make sure you know what time the last lift and last bus is . <p> If you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because you cant do more , you 'll save by buying tickets in the morning . <p> If you know that certain routes- you plan to ski on- do n't  have catering facilities- ALWAYS take a- sandwich and a thermos believe me , nothing is more embarrassing than having a problem in the middle of nowhere when you 're underprepared . <p> Besides the above- " odds and ends " and logistics , - make sure you do an " equipment check " before you travel. - Ski gloves ( good ones make ALL the difference ) , goggles , and a good hat or helmet <h> 4 . Tip : Take it Nice and Easy <p> Go sensibly . Even if you 've skied many times before , make sure you start modestly . Do n't  hit the black run on your first day . Start with some nice un-demanding routes to get used to skiing again , and when you feel good , then you can increase the complexity of skiing. - PLEASE- do not ski- yourself into the ground and exhaust yourself early . <p> The majority of accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a rest and take it easy . Also , many accidents happen late in the day. - Its so tempting to make the last run of the day a fast one , but listen carefully to what your bodys telling you- before pointing the skis straight down the hill . <h> 5 . Tip : - Stick to the Piste <p> That pristine freshly-fallen powder snow all along the edge of the piste- might look more tempting than the well-ploughed snow on the slopes , but hopping over- that line can be a risky business . Skiing in powdery snow is much more strenuous than crushed , and often lurking underneath can be- rocks and other potential- hazards . Stick to the designated areas . <h> 6 . Tip : Get Some Advice from the Experts <p> Ski courses are an excellent idea . They 're not- just- for beginners and children , but for anyone whod like to refresh and refine- their skills . <p> Ski courses or hiring a ski instructor for a day or two is great thing to do. - The instructor will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and itll really- improve your skiing technique , which means that it will skiing will feel easier- and safer , and you 'll be less likely to succumb to tiredness and injury . <h> 7 . Tip : Practice and Preparation Makes Perfect <p> Before you rush to the top of the highest hill in the valley , take a little time on easier runs to get your sights in , to get a feeling for your equipment and the conditions . Practice short turns , long turns , stopping , walking on the skis Its important to get a good sense of balance , you will also get a sense of how your skis glide , how quickly they react when reducing speed and the like . <h> 8 . Tip : Alcohol on the Slopes <p> Sport and alcohol mixes about as well as- driving and alcohol . Skiing is a demanding physical activity and any substance that affects physical and mental faculties- is dangerous . Some are of the opinion that snow is really best suited with mulled wine , but we really urge caution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because at altitude we are even more susceptible to the effects of- alcohol- than- normal . Just be sensible . After lunch , ski carefully , as if you were starting again . <p> Suggestion : - Favour water and tea . it may be cold up there , but due to the strenuousness of the activity and all your- thermal insulated gear you will sweat . So its very important that you do n't  allow yourself to become dehydrated. <h> 9 . SLEEP <p> Do n't  deny yourself ! Weve talked about tiredness and altitude already , but if you add to it by burning the candle at both ends you 'll significantly increase the risk of injury . <p> Many people favour a powernap once they get in from a days skiing just to recharge before dinner and drinks in the evening . Many mountain resorts have a lot going on in terms of apres-ski , but try to avoid staying out too late if you are serious about your skiing . Its a tricky- quandary because- the- pistes are always in the best condition in the mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late night once or twice , make sure you get the right amount of sleep to recover . <p> 10 . Can you believe we 've just written an entire article about skiing without once mentioning a " bed " of snow , " drifting " off , looking out for " sheet " ice , or- any other bad sleep-related puns ? <h> Finally . GOOD LUCK and enjoy yourself ! <h> One things for sure , no hotel or chalet bed is going to feel as nice as your own bed after a weeks skiing ! <p> And if you cant afford to go abroad this year ?

It gained in popularity and was widely used in the treatment of everything from heart conditions to , believe it or not , bad breath ! <p> In the Middle Ages , the use of silver utensils and goblets are thought to have given the Upper Class who used them a bluish skin tone " quite possibly resulting in the term blue-blood ' .

What better time to think about replacing your old mattress ? <p> Memory foam has been around a lot longer than you might think , but it was n't originally developed with mattresses and pillows in mind . In fact , being both very soft and highly energy absorbing , it was first developed in the 1960 's by NASAs Ames Research Center to be used in aircraft seat cushions . Since then , it has found many other uses but is now probably best known for its use in the sleep industry . <p> So what is the memory foam difference ?

As such , they do n't provide any tasty , life-sustaining food for nasty , hungry dust-mites to feed on .

So how can we manage bedtime and make it as seamless as possible ? <p> Here are a few little sleep tips for Halloween which should help make the post-party bedtime routine a little less- like a horror film . <p> 1 . Try to set a sweetie limit . When your child comes home from guising with a bag full of sugary booty the temptation is always to allow them dive right in .

Manage bedtimes sensibly . Many experts recommend , on an exciting night like this , planning for a- slightly later bedtime . Try to allow an extra 30 minutes , and do your best to stick to it . Of course it will be hard to get them to bed because they 're still excited , so reinforce that they 're being allowed to stay up late as an extra treat .

Take some candy from the baby . Do n't  be ashamed of half-inching a few choice items , particularly if the goodie-haul is a bumper one . Its not good for your child to have too much after all .

A warm soothing bath , the most comforting of stories , the favourite teddy , and some warm milk will all come in handy as you attempt to bring your child down from the high of the party and the sugar .

@@29728610 @3428610/ <h> The Stages of Sleep <p> " I love sleep . My life has a tendency to fall apart when Im awake , you know ? " -Ernest Hemingway <p> It will come as no surprise to hear that we at Dormeo HQ are fascinated by all things sleep related and if you 're reading this , you probably love sleep almost as much as we do . But how much do you really understand about what happens when you 're asleep ? Did you know that the average person takes 7 minutes to fall asleep ? Do you really know your REM from your non-REM ? <p> It may feel as though sleep is the only time that you completely switch off and shut down but actually our brains are working super hard . It 's this brain activity that defines the four different Sleep Stages which make up one Sleep Cycle , lasting anywhere from 90-110 minutes . <p> Stage 1 <p> Have you ever gently drifted off to sleep only to suddenly jerk awake , convinced you 've just had a fall or crashed into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle activity and eye movement really begin to slow down . If you want to be a bit of a smarty-pants , the next time someone tells you they 've experienced this phenomenon you can tell them that they were startled awake by a myoclonic jerk ' . <p> This first stage only lasts about five to ten minutes and if you 're woken up during this stage you 're unlikely to even feel you 've been asleep . During this phase our brains produce small , fast brain waves called beta waves ' before slowing down to produce alpha waves ' and then finally theta waves ' . <p> Stage 3 lasts for about half an hour and is also sometimes called Delta Sleep ' after the extremely slow brain waves that define this Stage . This is the Stage during which children wet the bed or experience night terrors and adults or children may sleepwalk . During this Stage there is still no eye or muscle movement and it 's extremely hard to wake someone . <p> Stage 4 <p> The Stage of many names , Stage 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Stage , the Dream Stage or the Paradoxical Sleep Stage . Why ? <p> Dream Stage <p> This is the main phase for dreaming which occurs due to the increase in brain activity . On average , we experience three to five phases of REM sleep each night and if you wake up during one of your REM sleep intervals , you are likely to remember your dreams . <p> Paradoxical Sleep Stage <p> During this phase our brain waves are actually comparable to when we are awake . Our heart rate and blood pressure go up , respiration quickens and we take quick , shallow breaths but although our brain and other systems become more active , our voluntary muscles become paralyzed . Our involuntary ones ( our heart for example ) , thankfully keep on moving . Quite some paradox . <p> The paralyzing of voluntary muscles is a safety thing . If our legs and arms ca n't move , we ca n't get up and run away screaming from the zombie we just met in our dream . Pretty cool , eh ? <p> REM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also characterised by our eyes moving and jerking about rapidly . These days , most people have heard of REM " and not just in relation to the 80 's American rock band " but it was n't actually until 1953 that the sleep-related REM was discovered ' by a graduate student of the University of Chicago called Eugene Aserinsky . He went on to prove a correlation between the eye movements , dreaming and increased brain activity ( up until then , believed to stop completely during sleep ) . He is now recognised as one of the founders of modern sleep research . More recent research is being carried out into the link between REM sleep and memory . <p> Interestingly , children spend nearly half their sleeping time in REM sleep whereas adults spend half of their sleeping time in Stage 2 and only 20% in REM . <p> It would be nice and neat and tidy if we just cycled through Stages 1-4 in sequence throughout the night but of course it does n't quite happen that way . The actual sequence is slightly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 , 3 , 2 , and 4 and then Cycles 2-5 looking something like this : 2,3,2,4 . <p> Of course it is n't even that straightforward , because the length of time each Stage lasts also changes as the night goes on . - During the first Sleep Cycle , we will enter Stage 4 approximately 90 minutes after falling asleep . The first REM sleep however , may well last only a short time with later REM sleeps lasting up to an hour . <h> Share 133419 @qwx333419

@@29728614 @3428614/ <h> Five Fascinating Historical Sleep Facts <p> The idea of the body clock is actually a relatively new one and our knowledge and understanding of sleep and sleep science is constantly evolving . Many ancient experts ' have tried their best to explain the phenomenon of sleep and dreams though ; some coming up with far wackier explanations than others . Here are some of our favourites . <p> - 1. - People thought God communicated through sleep <p> The phenomenon of sleeping in a holy area like a temple in order to receive messages from the Gods was practiced in multiple ancient societies . Evidence suggests the ancient Egyptians practiced it , and the classical Greeks certainly did , believing that the answers to their questions would be revealed in their dreams . <p> This belief may well have come originally from the biblical story of Abraham . In Genesis , Abraham falls into a deep sleep during which God promised him an heir . <p> - 2. - The Ancient Greeks nearly got there <p> The Ancient Greeks were full of theories relating to sleep . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of sleep , describing it as a loss of consciousness as blood retreats from the surface of the body into areas like the brain . He speculated that waking up was as a result of it moving out again . <p> 50 years later Aristotle stated that he believed sleep to be caused by warm vapours rising from the heart during digestion , and concluded that sleep is a time of physical renewal . Getting closer to the truth there . <p> - 3. - Medieval dreams were thought to be the result of demonic possession <p> In medieval times , dreams were thought to be visions of the future but also a sign the mind was vulnerable to the devil . One medieval author wrote that dreams could arise from God through inspiration or sometimes from the devil through treacherous deception and contrivance . ' <p> The word nightmare ' actually derives from the Anglo-Saxon word marc ' meaning demon , which is related to the Sanskrit words Mara ' - meaning destroyer , and mar ' meaning to crush . The word night-mare ' therefore , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spooky eh ? <p> 4 . Sleeping through the night was unnatural <p> In medieval times , people actually slept twice a night with a gap in-between to eat , pray or read . This idea of two sleeps ( or biphasic sleep ' ) is ancient , with references to it having been found in Homer 's Odyssey . Movement towards sleeping through the night in one go ( monophasic sleep ' ) seem to have been a result of the Industrial Revolution and the new working-day demands of industrial factory production as well as Thomas Edison 's invention of the light bulb . <p> In the 1990s , a sleep scientist named Thomas Wehr discovered that everyone sleeps biphasically ' when subjected to natural patterns of light and dark . His study concluded that biphasic sleeping is actually the most beneficial and natural sleep pattern . <p> 5 . Descartes spent nearly half his life asleep <p> Ready for a bit of philosophy ? Rene Descartes of I think therefore I am ' fame held that people took breaks from mental awareness by sleeping at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , clearly that did n't mean the sleeping mind did n't exist . Even while asleep , he speculated , the mind retained its thinking ' status ( remember : according to Descartes , thinking equals existence ) because it stored the experiences perceived and digested by the waking mind . <p> More than 350 years later , science is validating Descartes . We now know that the sleeping brain does indeed store thoughts and solidifies memories collected during waking hours . Basically , Descartes nailed it , all whilst spending 10 to 12 hours a day asleep . Whilst most 17th century Europeans were up by 5am , Descartes apparently preferred to saunter out of bed around lunchtime ! <p> Of course it 's hard to fall asleep and stay there if your mattress is n't in tip-top shape .

Men tend to dream more than women . <p> Dreaming happens during the deepest phase of REM sleep . Your ability to fall asleep and stay there depends on a drop in body temperature at bedtime , and higher levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a rise in body temperature particularly at night . As a result , women are likely to achieve fewer hours of REM sleep and therefore dream less overall than men . <p> 3 . Women tend to need more sleep than men . <p> Nothing to get overly excited about ladies , but it has been found that women require about 20 more minutes of sleep each night than men do . There has been a whole load of coverage about this recently which would seem to confirm the theory that this is due to women 's ability to multitask during the day . Their brains require more regeneration time at night and therefore require more time to achieve that . <p> 4 . Men tend to wake later than women . <p> It follows that as women tend to fall asleep earlier than men they also tend to wake up earlier in the morning , by about 30 minutes on average . Women are also more likely to wake up before the alarm goes off . Remember , its up to your circadian rhythm to keep your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's circadian rhythms are approximately two hours ahead of mens , women are also more alert earlier in the day . If you 're a woman who has found herself wide awake in the early hours whilst your partner is zonked out beside you , this could be why . <p> - 5. - Women tend to experience more sleep troubles than men. - <p> Whilst it 's true that men are more prone to- sleep apnea than women ( a very serious condition in which a person stops breathing several times during the night ) , women are twice to three times as likely to have trouble falling asleep and staying there for long enough . <p> We all know that men 's and women 's brains seem to work a little differently . When analysed , in general , women 's brain cross-hemisphere connections appear to optimize intuitive and analytical thinking whilst men 's appear to optimize motor coordination . It would seem that it 's harder to switch off from the analytical/intuitive stuff at bedtime meaning that women are far more likely to continue thinking later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , you 're not sleeping . <p> 6 . Men tend to be better at sleeping in . <p> Because men generally feel ready for bed later than women , their bodies tend to make up for the late nights by signalling that they need to sleep later in the morning . <p> Of course it 's hard to fall asleep and stay there whether you are a man or a woman , if your mattress is n't in tip-top shape . Dormeo can help eliminate the most common causes of a lack of sleep but do n't just take our word for it .

Whilst researching this piece , Dormeo UK came across one study that suggested that nightowls ' tend to be more creative than the larks , bringing the old adage of the title into some dispute . Then again , another study concluded that larks tended to be more optimistic personalities and ( possibly as a result ) suffered less from depression than owls . Perhaps it all depends on your own personal definition of the worm ' then ! <p> So would you describe yourself as a morning person , ' or a night owl ? ' Despite both phrases being quite common , research suggests that whilst more women present as larks and more men as owls , only about three out of ten of us can be described as extreme owls ' or extreme larks ' . The rest of us are likely to show tendencies towards one camp or the other but are more easily able to adapt . So the question is why . Why are some people raring to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following morning ? <p> As with most things sleep-related , it probably comes down to your own personal circadian rhythm . Humans ( and many other organisms ) are programmed to have a 24 hour circadian rhythm to tie in with the Earth 's 24 hour cycle , but it seems that some people have a slightly longer rhythm ( night owls ) and some , a slightly shorter one ( larks ) . Although each individual 's rhythm can change over time ( i.e. it 's rare to find a teenaged lark and most people tend to become more larkish once they have children " even if they do complain about it ) , research suggests that the tendency towards early rising or partying late into the night may well be as genetic as your hair or eye colour . <p> It 's worth pointing out that some experts consider the term night owl ' to be misleading , preferring to use evening people ' . They point out that as a species , without exception , humans are programmed to function best during the daytime and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to sleep . <p> There is no doubt however , that lark ' or owl ' traits have consequences on many aspects of our lives . You just may not realise it . They will actually determine everything from when we want to eat our meals , to when we are most alert and produce our best work , to when we get the best quality sleep . It 's unlikely that a lark would choose to work in a nightclub for example , and an owl is n't going to make the best milkman or postman . <p> Indeed , research suggests that we may well function better overall if we were able to get our daily lives more in synch with our own personal rhythm and concludes that night owls may well be at risk of serious sleep deprivation when forced into a standard 9-5pm work pattern .

@@29728642 @3428642/ <h> How Does Diet Affect Sleep ? <h> Diet and the time- we eat can have a huge impact- on the quality of our sleep . <p> By Robert Logie . If , like me , you- can be referred to as- a " buffet enthusiast " , youve probably experienced those agonising sleepless nights " and difficult mornings " after one too many extra helpings . <p> Imbibing- over-generous portions of food , alcohol , coffee before bedtime can not only affect our sleep it can also even affect our dreams and our health . BUT making- the RIGHT- choice of meal before bedtime can significantly- help our- well-being and help us to overcome and even prevent weight problems . <p> Here are our top tips for a good , healthy nights sleep <h> 1 . Starchy foods <p> If you eat a large amount of starchy foods before bedtime , such as rice and potatoes , you may- feel- drowsy and sleepy and these foods are generally ok- if you are one of the very lucky few with a great metabolism , and who do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely recommended . <p> We should- take particular care to avoid heavily salted foods , as this causes water retention and increased thirst , which can make us overly-thirsty . Not a good idea last thing at night ! <h> 2 . Caffeine <p> This is an obvious one , right ? Caffeine may impair sleep . Duh . We all generally know its good to avoid drinking coffee after about 5pm , but we do tend to forget that caffeine is also present in various carbonated drinks and even , to some extent , in black and green teas . <p> This is the exact opposite effect that a- camomile tea , prepared an hour before bedtime will give you . For sedative effects also seek out hops , valerian , lemon balm and St. Johns Wort . <h> 3 . A warm glass of milk before bedtime <p> Milk contains the amino acid tryptophan , which is a natural relaxant and promotes sleep . For best results combine milk with carbohydrates , which promotes the secretion of insulin , helping tryptophan to easily and quickly enter the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple- teaspoon of honey . <p> A glass of milk every night before bedtime can also have the additional placebo effect of routine , giving your body and subconscious subtle signs that its time to relax and prepare for sleep . <h> 4 . Dinner <p> Try to have dinner earlier rather than later in the evening . Around 7.30-8pm , - or at least 3 hours before bedtime . Dinner should be light , but not too insubstantial . After all , you do n't  want to have to wake up in the night hungry . Past experience dictates that this can lead to a disastrous pincer movement towards the fridge . Danger , danger ! <p> If your evening meal is high in fat , this can cause- difficulties in getting to sleep , because your digestive tract will be too busy processing what you 've eaten . <p> Also try to avoid- strongly spicy foods particularly if you have a sensitive stomach . This will often lead to indigestion as you lie flat in your bed . <p> Sugary food , meanwhile , can also cause restlessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also shown that dinners high in sugar content can- increase the frequency of night walks . <h> 5 . Dining for athletes <p> If you take part in sporting activities its recommended that during the day you " graze " on food , ie taking several smaller meals , rather than maxing-out with one big mean. - At bedtime consume a snack with a high protein content , possibly in combination with carbohydrates the latter is particularly true for those who have difficulty in obtaining muscle mass. <h> 6 . Booze ! <p> Alcohol is well-known to induce drowsiness and the urge to sleep . Whether having had a big night out or a couple of glasses of wine in the evening , experts advise that you should avoid drinking too close to bedtime . <p> Your body needs time to process the alcohol in your body. - Alcohol will also put you straight into a deep sleep , bypassing that essential REM phase which is the rejuvenating and regenerating phase of sleep . It varies from person to person , but usually allow about one hour per unit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure about units , this handy unit-calculator might be- helpful . <h> Recommended foods before bedtime <p> Yogurt , milk , cheese , oats , bananas , poultry , eggs , peanuts- and- tuna- all contain a good amount of- tryptophan and are great for helping you get a restful nights sleep . <p> Herbal teas . Passionflower , camomile valerian can all have a soothing sedative effect . <p> A mug of warm milk . Its actually true ! Drinking one of these just before bedtime will- help you sleep better. - Dairy products are rich in the amino acid tryptophan , which helps in the production of serotonin and melatonin , the brain chemicals which induce sleep . <p> Carbohydrates . A- bowl of cereal , or a couple of oatkakes about an hour before bedtime stimulates the release of insulin , clearing the- amino acids that compete with tryptophan from the bloodstream , allowing more of the sleep-inducing amino acid to enter the brain .

Our Sleep experts here at Dormeo have done some digging and have come up with the following 8 suggestions to help you avoid the burnout blues . <h> 1 . Get Some Exercise <p> Getting regular exercise is- not just about looking good and feeling fit . Our physical state plays a huge role in defining- in our ability to concentrate . When exercising regularly , our muscle strength and endurance will be boosted , giving us extra energy that will make us- more productive in everyday life . A release in endorphins will also make you feel happier and improve your memory , which again leads to greater productivity so make the effort to get that- heart pumping . <h> 2 . Keep the temperature- under control <p> When the central heating is blaring away at full whack , while it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ability to get the best nights rest . Waking up too hot or too cold at night will also leave you feeling stressed and tired the next day. - Check that your central heating is at the right temperature . An ambient temperature of 18-C " 21-C is- what most experts recommend . Investing in good quality bedding that has good ventilational properties , and with no pressure points , is also a must . <h> 3. - SLEEP ! Not too little , not too much ! <p> Our emotional state is another important factor in concentration . Many people do n't realise the toll a lack of sleep can have on their cognitive and mental health . When we are well rested we are calm and generally more positive towards life , giving us a far- higher tolerance for stress . Try to get an absolute minimum of at least six hours of undisturbed sleep a night . But do n't  go overboard . Recent studies have shown that oversleeping in the morning does actually have a number of physical and psychological side effects too , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind for the rest of the day . Its therefore vital- to try and get a good number of hours of sleep in the evening , by going to bed early . <h> 4 . Eat the breakfast you know you should eat <p> You should n't go to work BEFORE- eating breakfast . And DO NT simply rely on that Costa Latte with the extra shot purchased at the railway station to see you through . Once that caffeine burns off , you 'll be in big trouble ! Studies have shown that while- a high calorie breakfast can hinder concentration , a small breakfast containing fibre-rich whole grains , dairy and fruit actually improves short-term memory and attention . <h> 5 . Do n't  push it if its not there <p> If you feel that your concentration levels are starting to flag , then that may be a time to- give yourself a little five minute break to let your mind wander , knowing that youll- get back to the task in hand after a set time period . In order to switch off from the task , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colleague , go for a quick walk or make yourself a cup of tea . And never , ever underestimate the power of FRESH AIR ! - When you sit back down you should feel buzzed-up and ready to go again . <h> 6. - You can do it . You KNOW- you can <p> Feeling confident in your abilities is a huge motivator , because- if you believe the work you 're doing is of a good standard you will be proud of it and more likely to focus . A lack of knowledge of the task at hand often leads to procrastination , which will see time fly by . Instead of worrying about a task , do research or ask someone . Confidence that you are doing the right thing will aid your concentration immeasurably . <h> 7. - Tap into the power of music <p> Listening to music whilst working causes a positive mood change , increases curiosity and enhances perception . These are great characteristics to have , especially if in a creative role . People often say music helps them concentrate by stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're easily distracted by your colleagues see if listening to headphones when you need to concentrate works for you .

Concentration depends on the ability of messages to flow freely between brain cells and in order for this to happen , the cells need plenty of oxygen so they can continue to pass messages on . This oxygen comes from blood sugar . To keep blood sugar up , eat little and often . Walnuts and seeds are great to snack on and oily fish has been proven to improve nerve function in the brain .

In this world of stress , long working hours and worries , it is easy to dismiss the need to regenerate and heal the body through rest . <p> Keep it simple . <p> We do n't all need the same amount of sleep and some of us are wired as early birds or as night owls ; your genetics will influence your body 's own natural rhythm . However there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that there are certain things we can do to improve our sleep and restorative capabilities . <p> If you want a good night 's sleep , bedrooms should ideally be a temple to peace and calm . That means , ideally , no televisions and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is emitted from a computer or a TV screen can put your body clock out by several hours .

Feng Shui says a mirror doubles the energy in the room , therefore having one opposite the bed doubles your chances of not sleeping so well . You can always try draping a scarf or sheet over the mirror and see if it has any effect . <p> Traditionally it was thought that your soul left your body at night and if it caught sight of its own image as it came back into the body it would give you a nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that a mirror literally doubles everything it can see , so if you have a lot of clutter in your room , the mirror doubles the clutter ! <p> The best position to place a bed is with your head at the opposite end of the room to the door . Psychologically it gives you the best vantage point for you to see immediately if someone is entering the room . As for the bed itself , Feng Shui would always choose wood and natural products over and manmade substances . For example , if you have a metal headboard , Feng Shui would advise you to put up a padded back or drape some beautiful material over it . <p> If you read any Feng Shui books you will come across the term cutting chi ' and poison arrows ' . This refers to the sharp pointed corners of wall edges , furniture , wooden beams etc . What they do n't always say is that providing you are a reasonable distance away from them , they are unlikely to have a detrimental effect . However , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture with rounded corners to soften the effect . Ideally , you should have at least a metre between where you lay and the sharp corner of a wall , wardrobe or cabinet . <p> Geopathic Stress ; ever heard of it ? <p> The underlying energies of the earth / ground beneath our homes can have subtle but detectable changes in frequency and these can have an effect on our health and our sleep without us even realising it . The optimum healthy frequency for our bodies , according to NASA , in order to keep astronauts healthy in space , is 7.83 Herts . There may be underground water streams or rivers , underground cables , nearby industrial plants , the vibrations from motorways etc. all of which can cause variations in frequency that can negatively affect us , especially young children , the old or infirm . It is possible to find out where they are through dowsing , although modern technology is catching up with the old ways and there is a lot of research , especially in Germany , looking into the way it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of colour in the bedroom : soft , subtle , gentle sleep-inducing colours are best , with accents of warm earth colours , for example , yellow , ochre , sand , cream , terracotta , brown and pink .

@@29728664 @3428664/ <h> Top Reminders For A Great Nights Sleep <p> At Dormeo HQ , we all know the importance of sleep . Its what we do . We read about it all the time and focus on it incessantly . We even recommend that all our staff members sleep minimum of 8 hours . ( At night not during the day tempting though it is to have a nap when surrounded by mattresses all day long. ) - <p> So we wanted to share the knowledge , and bring you some top sleep tips to help you on your way to a great nights sleep . <h> 1 ) Keep a regular schedule <p> Getting back in sync with your body 's natural sleep-wake cycle is one of the most important strategies for achieving good sleep . If you keep a regular sleep schedule going to bed and getting up at the same time each day , you 'll feel much more refreshed and energised than if you were to sleep the same numbers of hours but at different times . This holds true even if you alter your sleep schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . <h> 2 ) Set a regular bedtime <p> Go to bed at the same time every night . Experts advise trying not to break this routine even at weekends , but we are also realists , and know that we also need to let our hair down every now and again ! If you want to change your bedtime , help your body adjust by making the change in small daily increments such as 15 minutes earlier or later each day . <h> 3 ) Wake up at the same time each day <p> It 's not rocket science , but if you 're getting enough sleep you should wake up naturally without needing an alarm clock . This is a risky strategy however , so if you need an alarm clock to wake up on time , you may need to set an earlier bedtime . Try to maintain your regular wake-up time at weekends , however tempting it may be to have a lie in . If you have children , who are at an early age , you 're probably thinking you have no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost time <p> If you need to make up for a few lost hours , opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping-in late . This strategy allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep wake rhythm , which often backfires and throws you off for days . <h> 5 ) Be smart about napping <p> While taking a nap can be great , especially for older adults , it can make insomnia worse . If insomnia is a problem for you , consider eliminating napping . If you must nap , do it in the early afternoon and limit it to thirty minutes . <h> 6 ) Fight after dinner-drowsiness <p> If you find yourself getting sleepy long before your bedtime , get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating to avoid falling asleep , such as washing the dishes , calling a friend , or getting clothes ready for the next day . If you give in to the drowsiness , you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep . <h> 7 ) Get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night in bed that 's 56 hours a week and nearly 3,000 hours a year !
