Content to be tested on the Examination is covered in the Examination Blueprints . The blueprints provide an in-depth look at what you can expect to see on the Examination , including content topics , the skill level at which content will be assessed , and tasks representative of those you may be asked to complete . You should thoroughly study the Examination Blueprints before ever sitting for the Examination , familiarizing yourself with the task statements presented for each section .

@@1074395 <h> Social Security and Divorce : What Clients Need to Know <p> Posted by Guest Blogger on Mar 06 , 2017 <p> Put powerful emotions in the same cauldron as money and you get a volatile and highly flammable mix . If your clients need one reason to involve a trusted CPA in their divorce process , that argument is as strong as it gets . As a financial professional , you have likely seen first-hand that divorce has the potential to uproot the financial stability of your clients ( see more in this latest trend survey released by the AICPA Personal Financial Planning Section ) . If splitting the family possessions and bank accounts were n't complex enough , there is also Social Security and Medicare to consider . <p> By asking the right questions , CPAs can steer their divorcing clients around pitfalls and help them make smart choices that maximize their financial outcomes . <p> Here are three key points of social security and divorce to discuss with your clients : <p> 1 . Understand the basic rules <p> A widow or widower at full retirement age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceased spouse 's basic Social Security benefit amount . The same rule applies to divorced spouses as long as they were married for at least 10 years and the spouse seeking to collect benefits is not remarried . If those conditions hold true , the currently single ex-spouse can collect the equivalent of 50 percent of the living ex-spouse 's Social Security benefits without any cost to the ex-spouse . <p> There is an additional benefit that used to apply to all ex-spouses in that position " and still may apply to a subset of your clients ( more on this in a moment ) . An ex-spouse could file a restricted claim for spousal benefits only , allowing him or her to collect spousal benefits ( 50 percent of the ex-spouse 's full retirement age benefit amount ) while his or her own retirement benefit continued to grow by 8 percent per year up until age 70 . That is where the new rules kick in . <p> If your client was born before Jan. 1 , 1954 , he or she can file a restricted claim for spousal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is full retirement age . <p> If your client was born on or after Jan. 2 , 1954 , he or she can still file a Social Security claim but can not choose which benefits will be paid . The claim is deemed to be filed for all available benefits " those based on the ex-spouse 's as well as one 's own earning record . The Social Security Administration will compare the two sets of benefits and pay the higher amount . Your client will not be able to reverse the decision . <p> The major take-away from this rule change is that strategic timing of filing for Social Security benefits as an ex-spouse is still available to some individuals , but is no longer an automatic option for everyone . <p> 3 . Do n't forget Medicare <p> Unlike Social Security , which is based on an individual 's earnings history , Medicare benefits are uniform . Part A of Medicare that provides for hospitalization coverage is available to anyone who has 40 quarters of Social Security work record . If the individual 's work record is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least 10 consecutive years prior to a divorce to have a Medicare record based on the spouse 's work record . If neither of those two conditions is met , your client will have to pay premium for Medicare Part A ( currently $420/month ) . Walk your client through the decision tree to ensure he or she is aware of the upcoming premium expense and can build it into the budget . <p> A divorce settlement agreement may require one spouse to cover the other spouse under his or her health plan , but only until the non-working ex-spouse reaches age 65 . At that time , the ex-spouse must sign up for Medicare Part B to avoid the Medicare penalty . <p> If a divorcing couple has a company or government-sponsored retirement health plan ( equivalent to Medigap ) , the plan will have its own rules about whether or not a divorced spouse can remain covered . CPAs can offer to review the plan rules with the client to make sure that the divorce agreement is based on factual information . <p> How does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the divorce matters ! The rule about qualifying for Social Security and Medicare benefits based on the ex-spouse 's record is very specific , and only 10 consecutive years ( no fewer ) of marriage will do . <p> Second , strategic timing of filing for Social Security may still be an option for clients born before Jan. 1 , 1954 . Everyone else must clearly understand the consequences of filing so that there are no surprises . <p> Finally , if Social Security will be a considerable part of your client 's financial safety net , encourage him or her to work with a specialty financial planner who has a deep understanding of tax and Social Security rules . After all , Social Security is a life-long benefit and can serve as an effective longevity hedge if used strategically . <p> For more information on how to help your clients develop a plan for drawing social security benefits , the AICPA Personal Financial Planning Section has developed The CPA 's Guide to Social Security Planning . <p> Tracy B.

@@1074397 <p> If there is one topic that clients dislike talking about more than death and taxes , it is the possibility of a protracted illness or infirmity . The mere suggestion that they or their spouse may at some point need care in a nursing or assisted-living facility brings about resistance . After all , the commonly held view is that nursing and assisted-living facilities are dreadful places for seniors who have no family willing to take care of them . News stories of patients neglected and abused show up every now and again , strengthening that perception . As a result , many of your clients may subscribe to the belief that if they simply ignore this difficult subject , it will go away . Unfortunately , that is far from the truth . <p> According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 70% of people turning 65 will need some form of long-term care during their lives . That care can come in many forms . It can range from around-the-clock medical and personal assistance to independent living with a safety net . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 2016 long-term-care survey shows that the median national cost of care at an assisted-living facility is $43,539 per year . The median cost for a semiprivate room at a nursing home is $82,125 . <p> Therefore , it 's crucial that older clients have a plan in place in the event of a serious illness or incapacity . Not having a plan can have disastrous consequences for your clients and their families , from homes lost to retirements sabotaged . CPAs can add significant value by helping their clients make the best possible decisions when it comes to planning for extended medical care . Here 's a blueprint you can use for opening and structuring a discussion about long-term care with clients . <h> CLEAR UP CLIENTS ' MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE <p> Advisers can open a discussion about long-term care by assessing their clients ' level of knowledge on the subject and by addressing some common misconceptions they may hold , such as the following : <p> Misconception : I do n't need to worry about paying for long-term care . Medicare will cover all my medical expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover certain costs of care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility , as well as certain home care and hospice care costs . However , that coverage comes with a set of conditions . <p> To qualify for Medicare coverage , the care must follow a hospital stay of at least three days ( admission for " observation " does not count ) and must happen within 30 days of discharge . The level of care must be " skilled " as prescribed by a physician ( meaning that it can not be provided at home or on an outpatient basis ) . Care must be delivered on a daily basis and must be directly related to the condition that caused the hospitalization . And , even if an individual qualifies for coverage , Medicare will pay for only 100 days of skilled care , and in many cases , a daily co-pay is required in addition to the usual monthly Medicare premium . <p> Misconception : I 'll never need long-term care . If I get sick , my family will take care of me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them in old age without consulting with their family members first . Sometimes , they discover that family members have far different expectations on the subject than they do . <p> Clients also tend to underestimate the impact of providing extended care , which can be significant . According to a Senior Care Cost Index study , 33% of family caregivers report that they spend more than 30 hours a week on caregiving , which is a considerable investment of time " on par with a full-time job . The same study shows that 60% of caregivers report that taking care of family members has negatively affected their work . In other words , taking care of an ailing family member is a big responsibility and commitment . Clients should have a heart-to-heart conversation with their family about the realities and expectations of providing care before making care from family members a part of their plan . <p> Misconception : I will never end up in a nursing home . <p> Reality : The majority of people turning 65 will need some form of long-term care during their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up living in a nursing home may still need in-home care or home modifications in the event of an illness ( such as ramps , bed and bath rails , and other structural adjustments and equipment ) . Without a plan for covering the related costs , they could be exposing their families to a significant financial hit . <p> Misconception : Long-term-care insurance is my only option . <p> Reality : Long-term-care insurance can be one solution to the problem of paying for extended nursing care . However , it 's not the right choice for everyone . For instance , premiums are significant and tend to rise as an insured individual ages . It is also critical to choose a policy from a reputable and financially stable insurance company . Long-term-care insurance products are relatively new ( less than 40 years in the market ) , and some well-established companies such as John Hancock Financial ( owned by the Canadian insurance company Manulife ) have recently announced a move away from selling individual long-term-care policies . <p> In reality , the spectrum of options is much broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clients could opt to self-insure or have an actual plan for family members to take care of them in the event of a prolonged illness . Annuity products can be a viable choice for some clients . The ultimate goal is to have a plan for getting medical and personal care in a way that makes sense financially and does not expose clients and their families to unreasonable financial and estate risk . <p> Misconception : Once I get a long-term-care policy , I do n't have to worry about expenses . <p> Reality : Most long-term-care policies will cover a portion of the cost of care , usually up to a specified maximum amount per day . Also , the benefit payment is not automatic ; certain conditions must be met to trigger a payment . Coverage of equipment costs also varies by policy . <h> EXPLAIN THE PROS AND CONS OF LONG-TERM-CARE INSURANCE <p> Make sure clients are aware of the pros and cons of this type of insurance . The right policy can be a financial lifeline in the event of a serious illness or accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings , maintain a level of independence , and choose where and how to receive care . There can also be potential tax benefits to buying long-term-care insurance . <p> However , long-term-care insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution to the high cost of extended care . For one thing , premium costs can be significant . Your clients will have to weigh the potential cumulative effect of paying rising premiums for many years and assess the possibility that at some point those premiums may become unaffordable . <p> Then there is the financial stability of the long-term-care insurance company to consider . After all , your clients are investing in a product they may not need until a decade or more from now . Help them choose a reputable and financially strong insurance company by guiding them to public ratings from reliable sources such as A.M. Best , Moody 's , and Standard &amp; Poor 's . <h> A BLUEPRINT FOR DECISION-MAKING <p> When a client is ready to discuss long-term care , here is a blueprint for how the conversation might go . <p> Step 1 : Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict the future , and many factors will determine which path of planning for medical cost coverage is right for your clients . Encourage them to consider factors such as their overall health , family health history , financial status , and their spouse 's age and health . Ask whether there are adult children or other family members living nearby who would be available and willing to assist . <p> Consider that long-term care comes in various forms , including skilled nursing facilities , senior communities , in-home care , continuing-care retirement communities , and many more . Choosing a facility or a care provider requires careful thought and planning , and is best done before a medical crisis happens . Encourage clients to talk with family members about their personal care preferences , and the financial consequences of various long-term-care options . The more insight family members have into your client 's internal decision-making process , including their feelings on such matters as what is most important to them about the facility and the care they receive , the better equipped and informed everyone will be . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences : Some may be strongly opposed to leaving their home unless medical circumstances leave them no other choice . Depending on the degree and kind of help needed , this scenario may be workable for some ( with a good deal of additional help from family and friends ) but not for others . <p> Step 2 : Identify options <p> As with all financial decisions , it helps to begin the long-term-care conversation by identifying the universe of relevant options . When deciding whether long-term-care insurance makes sense , CPAs can generate several hypothetical scenarios that project anticipated premiums into the future and compare them with the likely costs of care under various circumstances . Online cost-of-care surveys and calculators , like the one maintained and updated annually by Genworth ( available at genworth.com , offer a wealth of data and inputs that are state-specific . <p> Given the financial circumstances of the family and the results of the projections , options vary . Wealthy families may opt for self-insurance . When paying long-term-care premiums would be an unmanageable financial stretch , families may choose to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of facilities . <p> Step 3 : Research and read the policies <p> Before a client purchases a policy , encourage him or her to get multiple quotes and read the policies carefully . The fine print may well make a difference between a great-fit policy and a poor choice . Clients should think through the type of coverage they wish to buy , whether it is for adult day care , custodial care , skilled nursing home care , or something else . They must also be sure they understand details such as waiting periods , daily maximums , limitations , and exclusions for preexisting conditions . Also important are the rules concerning guaranteed renewals and waiver of premiums while receiving care . <p> With costs of medical and specialized care on the rise , your clients should give serious consideration to policies that have a cost-of-living adjustment ( COLA ) built into the policy at level premium rates . That provision means the insurance benefit will rise every year automatically . For most people , this option is preferable to buying stand-alone COLA inflation protection at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a later age when it will be more expensive ) . <p> Clients considering the purchase of a long-term-care policy should think about premiums over a span of many years . They must be confident that they will be able to keep up with premium payments in the long run . If they decide to drop traditional long-term-care coverage after three or four years because of premium increases , the money they have paid into the policy will be lost . <p> Encourage your clients to explore the complete universe of options available to them . Does their employer offer voluntary coverage ? Can they get a group long-term-care policy through an association ? Would they be able to self-fund a portion of the expense and buy coverage with a higher deductible in exchange for a lower monthly premium ? <p> Step 4 : Look into hybrid products <p> Most traditional long-term-care policies are " use it or lose it " : If your client ends up never needing care , his or her premiums will not generate any value beyond peace of mind . However , newer products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so-called hybrid policies may be worth considering in addition to traditional policies . Clients can buy products that are combinations of long-term-care insurance and life insurance , long-term-care insurance and annuities , or even long-term-care coverage that can be shared by a couple . Any of those options can offer the combination of flexibility , asset accumulation , and access to care that is optimal for a specific client . <p> Step 5 : Think through the tax aspects of the decision <p> Qualified long-term-care insurance contracts are given special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code , as long as the policy meets the requirements of Sec. 7702B . If the contract does qualify , then long-term-care premiums can be deducted as qualified medical expenses , to the extent they exceed 10% of adjusted gross income , and they are subject to a cap that increases with age ( see Rev. Proc. 2016-55 ) . Many states also offer a tax credit or a tax deduction for qualified long-term-care premium expenses , with certain tax credits amounting to as much as 25% of the annual premium ( usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a long-term-care policy for actual costs incurred are excludable from income under Sec. 7702B , although amounts paid under a per-diem policy are included in income to the extent they exceed the greater of ( 1 ) actual costs incurred or ( 2 ) $360 per day ( see Rev. Proc. 2016-55 ) . <p> Favorable tax treatment may also be available to self-employed individuals , who can claim an above-the-line deduction for health insurance premiums , including eligible long-term-care insurance premiums , for an insurance plan established by their business .

@@1074401 <h> 10 Steps to a Successful Audit <p> If preparing for your upcoming audit seems daunting , you 're not alone . Many of us feel a sense of dread at fiscal year-end . We 've compiled our best tips to help you have a smooth audit : <p> 1 . Plan ahead . Devote additional time both prior to and in connection with year-end close to adequately prepare for the audit , to be available during audit fieldwork , and to communicate with those involved in the audit process . Proper planning and clear expectations will help minimize anxiety and frustration . To be ahead of the curve , treat audit preparation as a year-long process . By keeping schedules and reconciliations up-to-date throughout the year , you can reduce the time it takes to prepare for the audit at the end of the year . Also , maintain an open line of communication between the organization and the external auditors during the year rather than waiting until the audit to discuss new or unusual transactions . This will minimize surprises and allow the organization to make appropriate plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting standards . New accounting pronouncements may affect your organization 's audit . You will want to stay up-to-date because you may need to manage or track data in a different way ( for example , by updating documentation or reorganizing the chart of accounts ) in order to implement new standards . Also , be sure to assess whether accounting personnel require any additional training or information in order to implement the new requirements . The AICPA provides eNewsAlerts for its members on new and emerging trends affecting NFPs through its Not-for-Profit Section- and also publishes the annual Not-for-Profit Entities - Audit &amp; Accounting Guide . To go straight to the source , refer to the Financial Accounting Standards Board 's website , fasb.org , to determine which new accounting pronouncements are effective for the year under audit . <p> 3 . Assess changes in activities . Did the organization start a new program or receive a new grant ? - Are there any new reporting requirements ? Were any activities discontinued , or were there any impairments ? - Were there significant changes in internal control systems ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should be communicated to the auditor during the planning process . <p> 4 . Learn from the past . Take stock of any prior year audit adjustments , internal control recommendations , or struggles encountered during prior audits . These can be a starting point for self-review and a memory-jogger to insure these issues are not repeated . During the planning meeting with the auditors , discuss what went well during last year 's audit and where there may be opportunities for improvement or more effective communication between the organization and the auditors . <p> 5 . Develop timeline and assign responsibility . Review the list of workpapers and schedules requested by the auditors , making sure to obtain clarification of requested information when necessary . Assign each item from the list to a responsible person and include a due date . Make sure to allow adequate time for review and correction of schedules if necessary. - Tackle the most difficult , complex , or time-consuming areas first when possible . The drafts of the financial statements , schedules , work papers or other items requested by the auditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit fieldwork . <p> 6 . Organize data . Create a repository of audit schedules that can be accessed in future years by the appropriate personnel. - Consider creating subfolders for significant transaction cycles or categories , such as cash , revenue and receivables , expenses and payables , investments , fixed assets , debt , etc. to make it easier to manage and retrieve schedules . Schedules and workpapers containing sensitive information , such as payroll , may need to be password-protected or maintained in an appropriately restricted network location . <p> 7 . Ask questions . If an item requested by the auditor is unclear , ask for clarification prior to the start of fieldwork to avoid potential delays . Auditors are generally happy to answer accounting questions regarding unusual or infrequent transactions the organization may need assistance in accounting for . Also , ask questions of those within the organization to obtain information necessary to prepare required footnote disclosures. - Such discussions could include significant accounting estimates , pending or threatened litigation , related party transactions , commitments and contingencies , and other topics necessary to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once all year-end closing entries are made , review schedules and workpapers to ensure amounts agree or reconcile to the trial balance . Take a step back and assess the overall financial statements for reasonableness . Also read and update the notes to your financial statements , and refer to a disclosure checklist to make sure you have included all the required information . Be prepared to explain financial statement line item variances from year to year or from budget to actual . <p> 9 . Be available during fieldwork . Avoid key personnel scheduling time off during the audit , and consider rescheduling or postponing non-critical meetings for finance and accounting staff heavily involved with the audit . Although most of the schedules and work papers will have been requested by the auditors prior to the start of audit fieldwork , understand that the auditors will be asking for additional information , including supporting documents and explanations , throughout fieldwork . Consider having brief status meetings or obtaining an open items list from the auditors at logical intervals during the engagement to track progress . <p> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between fieldwork and the issuance of the audit report . If there are any open items at the end of fieldwork , establish agreed upon dates for the information to be provided to the auditors whenever possible . If the auditor is to attend meetings with the audit or finance committee and/or board of directors , confirm that the auditor has the date , time , meeting location and other pertinent details of the meeting . Consider holding a post-audit closing meeting with employees involved in the audit to communicate results and solicit feedback . <p> Additional Resources <p> Do your- account workpapers need to be refreshed ? - Look no further than the AICPA Not-for-Profit Section for timesaving tools and resources this audit season. - The following illustrative- templates- have been compiled by volunteers serving on the AICPA Not-for-Profit Advisory Council .

The conceptual framework approach included in these two frameworks- is a way of identifying , evaluating and addressing threats to compliance with the rules resulting from a specific relationship or circumstance that is not otherwise addressed in the code . In addition to the flowchart below , you may find the Conceptual Framework Power Point presentation a useful training tool . <p> Under the conceptual framework approach , users follow the following steps : <p> Step 1 Identify threats to compliance with the rules .

Because you do n't want to be an April fool according to World Backup Day 's organizers . <p> Human error , equipment failure and theft are just a few ways your organization could be at risk of data loss . Today , no firm or company can afford to be without a cybersecurity risk management program . If you 're like most CPAs , this is not news to you . In fact , if you 're somewhat of a data backup fanatic , you might already be paying for secure offsite storage of paper files as well as digital backups . Still , experts say even the most diligent often have gaps in their backup practices . Let 's look at some of the most common considerations and how to address them . <p> Do you know exactly how to retrieve your backups ? For starters , knowing the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your backups does n't count . Knowing the name of one of your cloud backup vendors is not enough . Retrieval is an often underdeveloped but equally important aspect of backup planning ( see #5 below ) . Unfortunately , there 's no single , all-encompassing solution for backing up your systems . Even in a small firm , you 'll likely need three or four different backup systems . Tax preparation , bookkeeping and auditing software packages often have integrated , cloud-based backup options . There 's the information on your office network and server(s) " here you can choose a cloud-based solution or an onsite backup system that updates each night . Then you have your desktop and laptop PCs . And , finally , you have smart phones , tablets , watches , etc . Organize your retrieval information for ALL systems and test it " like a fire drill . If your test goes off without a hitch , you can skip the rest of this post . <p> Do you back up your smart phone or tablet ? 119 phones are lost or stolen every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones and tablets are easy to backup for little or no cost . Apple devices can be backed up automatically to iCloud , which is free for the first 5GB . If you have an Android device , you can automatically back up contact and email information and your app data such as calendar , browser , photos , music and things like Wi-Fi passwords . If you want an all-in-one backup solution for your Android device ( recommended ) , Android expert Cory Gunther recommends a third-party app such as Helium or MyBackup ( Pro version $6.99 ) . <p> Do you apply a retention policy to your backups ? Backups and archives are n't necessarily the same thing , but for certain systems , you might be able to cover both with one solution . Although retention policy development is beyond the scope of this post , the point is you should have one , and backups should be incorporated into it . <p> Do you back up your PCs ? Large and small organizations alike struggle with this one often , because of the challenge of managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important files should not be stored on PCs . In reality , important files do get stored on PCs " even if temporarily " and PCs should be backed up . Solutions exist " both in the cloud and with an external hard drive that connects via USB . Both technologies have their pros and cons . Cloud solutions require a good Internet connection , which can be challenging when traveling with a laptop . External drives are easy to use and inexpensive " but they can be lost or stolen . Use both ? Maybe , depending on what data you have on your laptop . Consider using encryption , too . It will add an extra layer of security , making your data much harder to access if stolen . <p> Do you have a backup plan ? Simply having a system to back up your information is not the same as having a plan . A backup plan should include identifying and prioritizing information that needs to be backed up , mapping that information to the systems and devices where that information is stored daily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and regulations . Documentation for each backup system and how it is administered needs to be included , complete with authorized users and retrieval procedures . <p> Of course , being a CPA means more than simply protecting your own data . Increasingly , CPAs are stewards of clients ' personally identifiable information as well . Backing up data securely and regularly is an essential part of a larger data management strategy . <p> Whether you are just now realizing the need for a backup plan or have a robust cybersecurity risk management program in place , it 's a good idea to familiarize yourself with current methodologies and processes . Technology is always evolving , and the system you put in place yesterday might not be adequate tomorrow . Use March 31 as your day to secure your data and protect your business . <p> In the coming weeks , you 'll hear more from the AICPA about these kinds of business concerns when we launch our cybersecurity risk management reporting framework . To help educate members about the framework , this spring , the Private Companies Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource can help CPAs understand cybersecurity as it relates to their own firms and assist them in starting a new service line offering cybersecurity risk management advisory services or examination services based on the framework .

@@1074439 <p> The passing score is determined by the AICPA Board of Examiners ( BOE ) . Like most other significant BOE decisions , the passing score decision is supported by a strong collaborative effort among the Examination partners . The standard-setting process followed for the computer-based test ( CBT ) is rigorous , and performed with input from the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy ( NASBA ) , state boards of accountancy , and several consultant psychometricians . <p> In setting the passing score , the BOE considered many factors , including standard-setting study results , historical trends , any changes in Examination content , and input from the academic community and the profession . The passing score is the basis of the pass or fail decision recommended to boards of accountancy on the advisory score report . <p> The passing score is 75 on a 0-99 scale . The scale of 0-99 does not represent " percent correct " . A score of 75 indicates Examination performance reflecting a level of knowledge and skills that is sufficient for the protection of the public . <p> Scoring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication tasks . Some written communication responses are scored by a network of readers ( CPAs ) , while others are scored using an automated process . All scoring routines - whether automated or not - are verified at various stages of the scoring process . <p> The Examination is not curved . Every candidate 's score is entirely independent of other candidates ' Examination results . <p> The Examination is a criterion-referenced examination which means that it rests upon pre-determined standards . Every candidate 's performance is measured against established standards to determine whether the candidate has demonstrated the level of knowledge and skills that is represented by the passing score . Every candidate is judged against the same standards , and every score is an independent result . <p> The AICPA uses Item Response Theory ( IRT ) for the objective portion of the Examination . IRT is a well-established psychometric approach to scoring used by licensing and certification examinations that administer many different test forms . IRT scoring ensures that scores and pass or fail decisions based on scores from different Examination forms are comparable . Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-testing , the difficulty level as well as other statistical characteristics of Examination questions are known and taken into account in scoring . <p> If I am given more difficult questions to answer than another candidate , how can our responses be scored comparably ? <p> IRT scoring takes into account differences in the difficulty of test questions in addition to other statistical properties . IRT scoring uses statistical properties of items , and the pattern of correct and incorrect responses , to calculate scores representing candidates ' knowledge and skill levels . These scores are comparable because they have been calculated taking difficulty levels , as well as other item statistics , into consideration . <p> In Auditing and Attestation ( AUD ) , Financial Accounting and Reporting ( FAR ) , and Regulation ( REG ) , multiple-choice questions account for 50% and task-based simulations for 50% of the score . In Business Environment and Concepts ( BEC ) , multiple-choice questions account for 50% , task-based simulations for 35% and written communication tasks account for 15% of the score . <p> Given the different values of Examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUD , FAR , and REG , separate scores are produced for multiple-choice questions and task-based simulations .

For more details on scoring , please refer to the paper , How is the CPA Exam Scored ? <p> No . Responses to pretest questions are never taken into account in calculating candidate scores . Pretest questions are included in every Examination ( they may be multiple-choice questions , task-based simulations , or written communication tasks ) only for the purpose of collecting data .

@@1074440 <h> May I Interrupt ? Asserting Yourself Into a Conversation <p> Do n't interrupt . While this may be an all-too-frequent childhood reprimand , you 're now an adult , so how can you make a point or justify your position when you were taught not to interrupt ? <p> Is it ever okay to interrupt a conversation ? How do you do it politely without offending those involved and still get your point across ? <p> Despite what your mother may have told you , sometimes interrupting a conversation is okay . According to Professor Stephen Boyd , professor emeritus of Speech Communication at Northern Kentucky University , it is okay to interrupt in the following cases : <p> When introduced if you do n't get the person 's name . At a party or a business meeting , it is important to know who you are talking to before continuing the conversation . Simply insert Excuse me , or I 'm sorry , I did n't hear your name . <p> To get a definition when you do n't know the meaning of something or misheard a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing a discussion if you do n't understand a key word or phrase in the conversation . You might say Sorry , I 'm not familiar with that word . Can you me ? <p> To clarify a point when critical decisions are being made or tasks assigned . It is important that everyone in the room understand what is being said , so if you have , for example , a rambler who has gone on and on during a conversation , it makes sense to interrupt to ensure everyone is on the same page . Examples of phrases might be : Excuse me , I want to make sure I understand or Just a minute , let 's make sure we all know our roles on this project . <p> Confidential information that has the potential to harm others . In the break room or if you overhear a conversation in the hall , it is okay to interrupt conversations about someone 's career or salary , or some other kind of confidential subject . This can be awkward , but it is important since everyone should conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like You might not realize this , but this is confidential information or Let 's take this conversation into the conference room it is confidential . <p> Gossip that is malicious and harmful needs to be stopped . Interrupt someone who is gossiping and either ask the person to take the conversation elsewhere . Perhaps you can redirect it with a business question : Oh , sorry to interrupt . When is that financial review due ? <p> Sounds good , but what if your boss loves the sound of his or her own voice ? How about when your colleague hijacks the meeting to make an obscure point ? Who do you do when the interruption may seem rude or overbearing ? <p> Here 's a case example . How many times have you wanted to interrupt a colleague during a conference call who was speaking without making any kind of point ? While this is n't against the law , you may sense that the client or customer on the call may be tuning out because he or she thinks the call is unimportant . <p> Interruptions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities . The best way to approach this is to look for an opportune time in the conversation , such as when the speaker is slowing down . You can try to interject by saying Wait a second . Or , at a pause , just jump in . <p> Some other techniques may help when trying to make a point or change the direction the conversation is going : <p> Agree and change the subject . You 're right , Bob , now how about the first quarter margins ? <p> Disagree with the statement . I 'm not sure about that , Bob , but it is interesting . I wanted to clarify roles in this project . <p> Ask to interrupt . If I may interrupt , I wanted to go back to another point you made earlier . <p> Use a question to interrupt . What do you think about extending the workday ? <p> Make sure you are clear why you are interrupting before doing so and think about who you are interrupting . Your supervisor or manager may not think your interruption is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think about it before you act . If needed , take a private moment with the person after the incident to discuss your reasoning for interrupting . <p> There are definitely wrong ways to interrupt . Disinterested looks may be a great way to curtail your sibling 's long-winded story , but could be misconstrued . Loud talking over the speaker can lead to a shouting match in the conference room and put your reputation in the tank . Motor mouth interruption , where you jump in and talk as fast as you can , is an unprofessional approach to the situation . <p> Unfortunately , there are times when interrupting a colleague , client , and even a boss seem necessary . Do n't do it often " you do n't want to get a reputation for being unprofessional . Listen to your gut and interrupt only when you 're sure it is the right thing to do .

Without a holistic understanding of your company 's financial situation and value drivers , it would be tough to assess the organization 's performance , risks , challenges , and opportunities and drive long-term growth . Planning without all the information could potentially put the company at a competitive disadvantage and expose the company to greater risk . <p> However , that 's what happens in many organizations when they fail to fully consider the operational and financial implications of environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) risks . Examples of how these risks can play out in the market include : <p> A beverage company 's production drops or they lose their license to operate due to drought conditions in water stressed regions in which the company operates . <p> A technology company faces employee turnover and sinking revenues because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its highly skilled labor force . <p> An apparel company experiences a stock price drop after reports allege its suppliers are committing human rights violations . <p> Incorporating sustainability considerations into a company 's overall strategy and risk management practices can help to proactively address these risks and unlock potential value within an organization through cost savings , efficiency improvements and product innovation , among others . Below are three ways that CFOs and other finance professionals can get started . <p> Establish Effective Governance <p> Since sustainability and corporate performance are inextricably linked , integrated approaches to managing sustainability risks are critical . For example , with oversight by the board of directors , the CFO would address risks that affect financial performance while the chief strategy officer would address the organization 's response to material sustainability concerns . The head of operations would tackle health , safety , environmental , and process risks ; human resources professionals would examine risks related to diversity , resource management , and training ; and the head of procurement would identify risks related to areas such as child labor and conflict minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managing sustainability risks and resource allocation drive integrated thinking and a more holistic understanding of corporate risk and performance . <p> Focus on Material Matters <p> Material sustainability risks can have a range of short- and long-term effects on financial performance , but those risks vary by industry and organization . Not all sustainability considerations will be priorities for every organization , so identifying key ESG risks is an essential step in effective risk management . You ca n't manage what you do n't measure . Total fuel consumed and the percentage that is renewable might be material for an air freight company but not for a telecommunications organization , for example . But by focusing on fuel and renewable use , the air freight company can reduce costs in the short run , while potentially avoiding the impact of regulation and also enhancing its brand over time . <p> Tell Your Story <p> 73% of portfolio managers and research analysts surveyed by CFA Institute reported that they take ESG matters into account when making investment decisions .

You may not always agree with the consensus , but if you want to avoid earning a less-than-admirable reputation , you need to learn how to help those around you agree . <p> In an accounting environment , why is this important ? If you 're working in public practice , it 's vital you agree with your colleagues , first and foremost , in the way you work with clients and the technical advice you 're offering . Think about it : If you were a client and you received conflicting advice from your firm , you would not only be confused as to what to do ; you would be miffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and industry , the thinking is the same , albeit from an internal perspective versus dealing with the public . If you were asked , for example , to adhere to a certain set of accounting controls and one of your team members did not see the need to follow the rules , you , obviously , would be in deep trouble . Sure , there are many ways to get to a solution , but you have to have the team aligned in thinking and action in order to maintain some semblance of continuity . <p> When you have consensus , everyone will be more committed to the way you address a situation and its outcome . As a leader , though , you 'll want to ensure you pay attention to everyone 's voice . Here 's how to do that . <p> Take Your Time . While most days are filled with immediate deadlines , one thing you do n't want to rush is consensus . Everyone from the CEO or managing partner down to the mailroom clerk or receptionist needs to have the opportunity to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't have universal buy-in and will quickly be back at square one . If you can not reach agreement , you may need to make the decision yourself and we all know how that might look , especially after you 've asked for everyone 's opinions . <p> Spend Time Gathering Information . You work in a profession known for discovery " gathering the information you need to deliver accounting services that bring bottom line results to your clients and customers . In the area of consensus , dismiss any thoughts of reaching agreement in just one meeting or even by email . Be prepared to take the time to gather and analyze information so the team can accept the situation and the conclusion . If not , the team will feel as if it is not a part of the final decision and react adversely to what you are trying to achieve . <p> Embrace Conflict . It 's better to acknowledge from the get-go that we all have unique personalities and viewpoints , and as a result , there will be conflict unless you work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not exist . Of course , consensus comes about only when everyone 's opinions are heard . However , colleagues and co-workers need to feel comfortable to disagree with each other . If you are a leader , you can encourage discussion by addressing all the concerns and serving as a mediator . This does n't mean you should sugarcoat your remarks , but try to reach a consensus within yourself to ride the fence in order to help your teams see the matter from all sides . Keep it professional . <p> Focus on the Issue . Instead of playing kindergarten games and dealing with conflicting personalities , focus on the issue . Remind everyone that the goal is for the benefit of the firm or organization and you 're not there to play on one another 's emotions . Avoid letting people get too personally involved . As a leader , you 'll be more highly respected if you keep the conversation professional . <p> While there is no textbook solution to reaching consensus , the very best leadership you can offer is to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of the decision . Leaving someone out will only cause conflict ; we have enough of that in our day-to-day lives without adding undue stress . Be a good leader " and set a good example by building consensus .

However , at firms with under $500,000 in revenues , a median of 25% of their fees are based on another method , including fixed fees , value billing , a per-tax-form fee and client retainers .

@@1074566 <p> OVERVIEW In April , the AICPA and NASBA Boards of Directors each approved for exposure changes to the Uniform Accountancy Act that would simplify the international pathway for licensure , and the NASBA Board approved exposing changes updating the Uniform CPA Examination Model Rules . Comments on this proposal are requested by September 1 , 2016 . <p> BACKGROUND The AICPA and NASBA have worked together since 1984 to produce the Uniform Accountancy Act ( UAA ) and UAA Model Rules to serve as reference documents for all U.S. states and jurisdictions as they update their own statutes and regulations . They are evergreen documents that are regularly reviewed and updated by the joint AICPA/NASBA UAA Committee . The UAA is subject to the final approval of the two organizations ' Boards of Directors , while the Model Rules are subject to the final approval of NASBA 's Board . <p> INTERNATIONAL PATHWAYFor several years , there have been discussions about the global economy and the worldwide demand for skilled CPAs and their foreign counterparts to meet the needs of international business . Since 1991 , the AICPA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that recognize substantially equivalent foreign designations and allow holders of these designations to apply for state licensure as a CPA so long as the foreign authority that granted the designation allows a licensed U.S. CPA to obtain the foreign authority 's comparable designation to practice . <p> To qualify for licensure as a U.S. CPA , the applicant 's foreign designation must be issued by a foreign authority that regulates the practice of public accountancy and the individual must be in good standing . In addition , the foreign designation must have been issued upon the basis of education , examination and experience requirements established by law , and must entitle the holder to issue reports on financial statements . <p> Existing differences in licensure requirements as well as political hurdles have made the development of functioning MRAs extremely difficult to achieve . Recognizing that in a global economy there are foreign accountants who meet or exceed the high standards for licensure as a U.S. CPA , the AICPA and NASBA Boards of Directors approved for comment an Exposure Draft of a change to the UAA that provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Under the unilateral pathway , the NASBA/AICPA International Qualifications Appraisal Board ( IQAB ) would evaluate the foreign designation to verify that the foreign designation has substantially equivalent , or higher , licensing requirements as those contained in the UAA and recommend that applicants holding that foreign credential be eligible to apply to a state for a U.S. CPA license . The in-depth reviews of the education , examination and experience requirements of foreign designations , plus the professional environment of the designations would continue by the IQAB , and those with approved designations would still have to pass the International Qualification Examination ( IQEX ) , but the need for reciprocal recognition of U.S. CPAs by the foreign body would be eliminated . <p> As foreign professionals are working in the United States , bringing them under the jurisdiction of the State Boards would strengthen public protection . This would allow for increased transparency as those who are qualified to sign financial reports could sign them . It is in the public interest to license qualified individuals , without regard to whether the foreign authority reciprocates , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing requirement obsolete . It is anticipated that other countries will want to similarly move to recognition of qualified U.S. CPAs as the European Union and other areas of the world require more frequent rotation of auditors and firms make it clear to regulators that the ability to provide high quality talent should not be limited by geographic barriers . <p> SUPPORTING THE UNIFORM CPA EXAMINATION In 2013 , the AICPA initiated a practice analysis to update the Uniform CPA Examination . The revised examination will be launched in April 2017 and will require updates to the Model Rules . <p> Updates to the Model Rules include : <p> Identifying the Uniform CPA Examination as the examination required for licensure . <p> Eliminating the definition of the two-month testing window and replacing it with a new definition of the testing window equal to a calendar quarter with a minimum of two months of testing . <p> Highlighting that examination content tests the knowledge and skill of a newly licensed CPA and that passing all sections of the examination is only one component of qualifying for a license . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UAA and the Model Rules will positively impact the ability of the State Boards of Accountancy to effectively regulate the evolving accounting profession and to therefore meet the public 's needs .

@@1074591 <h> Will a New EBP Audit Proposal Enhance Quality ? <p> Posted by Guest Blogger on May 01 , 2017 <p> Enhancing quality in various areas of the audit and various kinds of audits is a top priority for us at the AICPA . We recently issued an exposure draft entitled Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements of Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA . Its goal is to provide a report that clarifies audit procedures and the responsibilities of auditors and management , thus improving quality and transparency . The Auditing Standards Board ( ASB ) is encouraging auditors and preparers who are involved in audits of the financial statements of Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) plans to familiarize themselves with this proposal , and we are very interested in receiving feedback on the proposed changes . Comments should be sent to Sherry Hazel at **27;116;TOOLONG by Aug. 21 . <p> Working with the DOL <p> We issued the exposure draft in response to concerns over the quality of employee benefit plan ( EBP ) audits , including some expressed by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released in May 2015 , the DOL 's Employee Benefits Security Administration ( EBSA ) found that 39 percent of audits studied had one or more major deficiencies . The DOL turned to the ASB for help because regulatory requirements call for many employee benefit plan audits to comply with generally accepted auditing standards . In response , the ASB created a task force to enhance the overall quality and the end product of an EBP audit . <p> According to the EBSA report , 17 percent of auditors ' reports did n't comply with one or more of ERISA 's reporting and disclosure requirements . Since compliance problems are more likely for auditors who are n't trained in ERISA audits , one of the ASB 's goals was to make auditor 's reports more specific to these plans , rather than having them fit formats that suited other industries . Both the ASB and DOL believed auditors ' reports could be more informative and transparent both about an auditor 's role and management 's responsibilities , resulting in greater quality . Here are some of the ways the exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Content Requirements <p> DOL rules allow EBP management to impose a limitation on the scope of an audit of an ERISA plan . These limited-scope audits enable auditors to forgo auditing certain areas ( mainly investments ) if they obtain certifications from a qualified institution that holds the investments . The exposure draft provides new requirements that would improve the auditor 's understanding of his or her responsibility in a limited-scope audit and enhances these audits ' quality and consistency . Among other changes to existing practice , the auditor would have to obtain additional written representations from management about their responsibilities for these audits . <p> The exposure draft enhances the description of both management 's and the auditor 's responsibilities to provide more transparency into such limited-scope audits , including required procedures relating to the certified investment information . <p> A New Report on Findings <p> Another key change would affect the testing of certain procedures and would create new performance requirements that serve as a basis for a new reporting requirement , Report on Specific Plan Provisions Relating to the Financial Statements . Based on information provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new requirement focuses on plan instrument provisions that could have a direct effect on the financial statements . Auditors would be required to perform audit procedures related to the specific plan provision without respect to the assessed risks of material misstatement . The goal would be to enhance the consistency and quality of audit procedures in this area , including related disclosures . <p> The exposure draft , which would apply to audits of single employer , multiple employer and multiemployer plans subject to ERISA , includes a series of questions soliciting feedback on specific key proposals , including ones on cost benefits . The ASB is aware that the document may change practice and is eager to gather input about the effect on CPA firms , preparers and other interested parties . The ASB considers every comment . In the coming months , we will post discussions on the comments we receive on aicpa.org , as part of our meeting agenda materials . We urge you to review the exposure draft and share your comments by the Aug. 21 deadline so that you can play a part in enhancing the quality of ERISA audits.

@@1074644 <h> Using Flexible Budgeting to Improve Sustainability Measures , Part II <p> Published April 17 , 2017 <p> In our first article , Using Flexible Budgeting to Improve Sustainability Measures , we identified a common problem with sustainability reporting.1- Some companies incorrectly use the average intensity of sustainability key performance indicators as measures to report efficiency improvement . While it is true that efficiency improvements impact average intensity , we identified four confounding factors that also impact average intensity causing it to lose usefulness as a measure of improvement in efficiency . With a straightforward example , we demonstrated how CPAs can use their expertise to remedy this situation by applying flexible budgeting to correctly measure efficiency improvement . <p> In the initial article , we focused on correctly measuring efficiency improvement when a single confounding factor , a shift in product mix , is present . We considered a shift in production volume from a high-energy intensive product to a low-energy intensive product . The shift in production volume to the less energy intensive product causes average intensity to decline even if no efficiency improvements were made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be reported as an improvement in energy efficiency , and we demonstrated how flexible budgeting can be used to correctly measure the change in energy efficiency ( none in this case ) . In this article , we acknowledge that in real life situations more than one factor will likely change. - Accordingly , we demonstrate the application of flexible budgeting to correctly measure the change in efficiency in a more complex situation where both a shift in product mix and an outsourcing event occur . <p> We begin with the Nelson Company , a manufacturer of two products , X and Y. Product X is produced in two stages . In Stage 1 a component , N , is manufactured to be used as an input in the completion of X in Stage 2 . One unit of N is required for each unit of X. In year 1 , 6,000 units of N and 6,000 units of X are manufactured . Electricity consumption was 6,000 KWH and 18,000 KWH for Stage 1 and Stage 2 , respectively . Thus , total electricity consumption is 24,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very energy intensive . In year 1 , 2,000 units of Y were produced consuming 20,000 KWH of electricity . <p> TABLE 1 <p> Year 1- <p> - <p> - Production <p> - Electricity Used <p> - Rate- <p> - ( Units ) <p> - ( kWh ) <p> - ( kWh/Unit ) <p> - Input N <p> - 6,000 <p> - 6,000 <p> - 1.0 <p> - Product X <p> - 6,000 <p> - 18,000 <p> - 3.0 <p> - Product Y <p> - 2,000 <p> - 20,000 <p> - 10.0 <p> - Total <p> - 14,000 <p> - 44,000 <p> - <p> - <p> - Average Intensity : <p> - = Total electricity used/Total units of products produced* <p> - = 44,000/ ( 6,000+2,000 ) <p> - = 5.5 <p> - <p> - * N is an input , NOT a product <p> Three changes take place in year 2 . First , Nelson outsources the production of N. Second , there is a shift in the production mix . Nelson now produces only 2,000 units of X and increases production of Y to 6,000 units . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8,000 units . The third change is an energy efficiency improvement of 10% in the Stage 2 production of X and a 20% energy efficiency improvement in the production of Y. In year 1 , the rate for Stage 2 is 3.0 KWH of electricity per unit of X- ( 18,000 KWH/6,000 units of X ) ( see Table 1 ) . The rate for Y was 10 KWH per unit of Y ( 20,000 KWH/2,000 units of Y ) ( see Table 1 ) . For year 2 , a 10% efficiency improvement for Stage 2 results in a new rate of 2.7 KWH per unit of X and a 20% improvement for Y yields a new rate of 8 KWH per unit of Y ( see Table 2 ) . <p> - Nelson 's management is pleased with the thoughtful investments made to improve energy efficiency and is expecting its numbers to reflect this effort . Nelson uses average intensity to measure its progress at improving energy efficiency . We know that the three changes will each have its own impact on average intensity . Outsourcing reduces electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shift in production mix to a higher energy intensive product will contribute to an increase in average intensity . And the improvement in energy efficiency will contribute to a decline in average intensity . Average intensity for year 1 is 5.5 ( 6,000+18,000+20,000 ) / ( 6,000+2000 ) ( see Table 1 ) and is 6.7 ( 5,400+48,000 ) / ( 2,000+6000 ) for year 2 ( see Table 2 ) . Management is shocked that average intensity has worsened . <p> TABLE 3 <p> Year 2 <p> - <p> - Production <p> Flexible Budget- <p> - Actual Electricity Used <p> Efficiency Improvement <p> - ( Units ) <p> ( kWh ) - <p> - ( kWh ) <p> ( % ) <p> - <p> ( a ) <p> ( b ) <p> = ( a-b ) /a <p> - - Input N <p> - - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> Product X- - <p> 2,000 <p> 6,000- ( 3*2,000 ) - <p> 5,400- <p> 10.0%- <p> Product Y <p> 6,000 <p> 60,000- ( 10*6,000 ) - <p> 48,000- <p> 20.0% <p> Total <p> 8,000 <p> 66,000- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculation of average intensity is correct , but this measure should not be used to monitor efficiency improvement . As we see in Table 3 , the flexible budgeting approach does show an improvement in electricity efficiency of 10% and 20% for X and Y respectively . More importantly , this approach provides a measure of the aggregate average improvement in electricity efficiency . For Nelson it is 19.1% . The aggregate improvement is not the simple average of 10% and 20% . Rather , the aggregate improvement is a weighted average of the individual improvements and the weights are driven by the relative size of each component of the total flexible budget amount . Because Y is the most significant part of the flexible budget , the aggregate average improvement is closer to the 20% improvement in Y. <p> In summary , we demonstrate , once again , how the commonly used measure of average intensity by companies to report efficiency improvements often does not produce an accurate metric. - Fortunately , the use of the flexible budget approach provides information to support a more accurate measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investing in sustainability initiatives and in reporting the results of these investments. - In our next article , we will discuss the third confounding factor of changes in total production as a company more fully utilizes its capacity . <p> Jon Bartley , CPA , Ph.D. , is Professor Emeritus of Accounting and former Dean of the Poole College of Management , North Carolina State University in Raleigh , NC. - You can reach Jon at jonbartley@ncsu.edu <p> Y.S.

We always need to remember that we are working together and continue to support each other so that we are providing the highest level of service for the clients we are serving . We have regular Zoom video meetings , so that the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss client issues or challenges . We have n't utilized Zoom for virtual celebrations yet , but plan to start doing that in the coming year . Though we have a group of self-contained and self-motivated employees , as we have grown there has been an increase in interest and requests for celebration and team building type events . <p> Creating Sticky Client Relationships Because my firm serves the not-for-profit industry , it 's even more important that we are making a connection to the work that we do . I encourage staff to take an active role in any events that our clients may be having . We will volunteer time or resources to help make our client initiatives a success . I want us to strive to be as involved with our clients as possible and demonstrate that we are deeply invested in them and the work that they do . This can be especially important at the holidays . One annual tradition that we have for employees in our immediate area is visiting a local women 's shelter that we serve and carol for them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a highly rewarding experience for everyone involved . <p> In serving the not-for-profit industry , it 's also imperative that we are always working to stay educated and ahead of the curve on what is happening in this area . I encourage employees to seek out any external training that they feel will be valuable to their work , and will typically either cover the cost ( for employees ) or split the cost ( if the employee is a contractor ) . The firm also offers a number of trainings for our clients and take every opportunity to help educate them on the technicalities of what is happening in their industry . We look at subjects that are relevant and important to our clients and provide in-house workshops for them and their teams . I allow and encourage any of my- team to attend these workshops as well . <p> Finally , the firm also has a monthly web-based radio show that we produce. - The Nonprofit Journal has been- in existence- for about a year and a half now and it has been a real success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this as well . I ask everyone to take the opportunity to suggest a client they are working with to be featured on the show . That- team member- will also- participate on the day that their client is being interviewed . <p> Exhibiting a Consistent Commitment to the Firm 's Mission Dedication to employee engagement is a key component in firm performance . Creating a highly engaged team improves morale and retention , and promotes an understanding that we have a deeper commitment to our clients than just providing base level services . I want my team to strive to create sticky ' relationships and always remain aware of what assistance our clients need , even if that is as simple as volunteers or donations . The niche we serve drives the firm 's mission , and has allowed- us to build a team of individuals who are passionate about the work we are doing . That passion is who we are . 
@@1074675 <h> Benchmarking to Prepare for the Future <p> by Andrea L. Campbell , CPA.CITP <p> I originally joined my firm in 1989 , when it was under the ownership of another CPA . I became a partner in 1997 and then eventually bought out my partner at the end of 2013 . Now I am a sole practitioner , though I do have one part time staff who assists with tax work . Around 90% of the work my firm does is completed by myself . As a solo , I have a new set of concerns for my firm so it 's especially important for me to be mindful of how my firm is performing in relation to my peers . I need to be diligent about tracking my numbers to ensure my firm is in line for success . One way that I collect and organize this data is by participating in the AICPA PCPS/CPA.com National Management of an Accounting Practice ( MAP ) Survey . <p> Why I Participate in the MAP Survey <p> One unique aspect of being a sole practitioner is that my future depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband and I recently met with our personal financial planner and were discussing plans for retirement . Though I have many years left ahead of me , I realize that the success of my firm greatly affects the life my family will have once I eventually decide to retire . The MAP survey provides an easy and organized way to collect key firm data and , through continued participation , track how my firm is performing over time . Then , as I 'm having meetings like those with my financial planner , I have comparative data readily available . <p> I also use the MAP survey to benchmark my firm 's performance and see how I compare to other firms my size . I actively participate in the PCPS 2005 Small Firm Networking Group , which allows me a forum to discuss my most pressing practice management issues with other small firm owners . However , while these meetings are an incredibly valuable resource , we do n't have the opportunity to analyze all of our firm numbers at each meeting . The MAP survey allows me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures and see how my firm stacks up . While it is nice to look at the national and regional reports to compare my practice across all firms in the profession , I mainly utilize the firm size reports for benchmarking . Since geography can affect billing rates and staff compensation , looking at the data broken down by firm size is most helpful for me . <p> How I Plan to Use the Results <p> My firm has a high emphasis on technology and I use technology to make myself and my clients more productive and efficient . I am also a Certified Information Technology Professional , so it 's important to me that my firm is maximizing its use of technology . That 's why this year , I 'm interested to look at the technology section of the MAP survey in particular . I will be very interested to see what other firms my size are investing in that area and how my costs align . <p> The value of the MAP survey is well worth the effort it takes to complete . I would especially encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not often we get such a thorough look into how other firms our size are doing business . And while the benchmarking results may not radically change the way you manage your practice it does provide valuable insight into how your firm is performing and allow for better decision making as you move into the future . 
@@1074678 <h> Simple Steps to be Cyber Secure <p> by Lisa Traina , CPA , CITP , CGMA <p> I began my career as a sole proprietor focused primarily on technology consulting . The IT audits I performed when I first started were very simple in comparison to the issues and challenges that organizations are facing now . Today my practice has grown to an 11 person firm that completes over 100 IT audit engagements a year . Our services and area of expertise include controls review , vulnerability and penetration testing , vendor due diligence and speaking and training on cybersecurity and technology issues . Because CPAs work with such a wide range of clients , it 's imperative that they take the necessary steps to protect both themselves and their client base from a cybersecurity standpoint . <p> Initially , our clients were limited to financial institutions and healthcare organizations . We 've also served a number of CPA and law firms . However , in the last two years , we have really seen a large increase in clients coming from nonregulated industries . Cyber-attacks are a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cybersecurity services has become increasingly prevalent and businesses are starting to raise their level of awareness regarding this issue . <p> Protection Beyond Insurance Like many firms , we protect ours with cybersecurity insurance , but we 're pragmatic about insurance . While this is valuable , it can also provide a false sense of security . Insurance can help with costs in light of an event or attack . However , if there is a breach and the firm 's controls and procedures were lacking , the reputation damage can be detrimental , not to mention that the insurance coverage might be impacted or the claim denied . Firms need to consistently test their controls and vulnerabilities , and identify and swiftly address areas for improvement . To that end , they also need to be timely in addressing those areas that they have identified . <p> As a security firm , we implement an extensive list of controls to aid in protecting ourselves . Some of the primary components include keeping our systems cloud based and utilizing vendors that we have vetted with extensive due diligence efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected internet connections , and strict authentication controls , particularly multi-factor authentication on key applications . We also maintain virus and malware protection on all mobile devices and laptops . <p> Because security is our specialization , we have highly aware employees . They stay abreast of cybersecurity trends and research related topics before they become a big issue , so that we 're positioned against potential risks . <p> It 's important that firms have a cybersecurity governance plan. - There are a number of resources and frameworks available to assist with developing these plans . Generally our approach is to integrate different elements of those various frameworks , such as NIST , while also tailoring the plan based upon our personal , practical knowledge . <p> Overcome Common Issues There are several steps firms can take to help protect themselves and their clients . One major issue that is extremely prevalent is exchanging client documents via email , which is not a secure way to exchange information and makes you more vulnerable . This is a trend I have read about and experienced in our work with clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would strongly encourage use of a secure portal or file transfer system . In addition to implementing and regularly testing controls , firms need to be sure that mobile devices are included in these procedures and protocols . You should have a solid grasp on the number of devices that are in use and how they are being managed and protected . On a similar note , be sure to implement multi-factor authentication for your critical systems . As more people move to cloud-based systems , and more mobile devices are being used in a work capacity , the need for device authentication has become vital . <p> Another key to protecting your firm and clients is employee awareness . Often times , an uninformed employee can be the weakest link in a firm 's defense mechanism . This is further complicated by the fact that the methods used in cyberattacks are constantly becoming more sophisticated . Sometimes firms can view cybersecurity as an IT issue and delegate the responsibility of protection to a single department or IT individual . Because CPAs are increasingly busy , many do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk involved with cybersecurity . I would recommend appointing someone who is outside of the IT department to be responsible for working towards a secure environment and communicating that goal firm-wide . With threats that are evolving and becoming increasingly prevalent , cybersecurity needs to become a critical business priority . <p> Traina &amp; Associates is an IT security firm operating in the southeast .

@@1074694 <h> States Moving to Conform Tax Due Dates with Federal Law <p> Posted by Eileen Sherr , CPA , M.T . on May 23 , 2016 <p> As you recover from yet another grueling tax season , the optimist ( and realist sometimes ) in me says next year will be better with fewer practitioner frustrations . After many years of AICPA tax policy and advocacy efforts , Congress enacted several AICPA-supported federal due date changes and a de minimis safe harbor of $100 of income/$25 of withholdings for corrected Form 1099s that take effect for 2016 tax returns ( 2017 filing season ) . <p> New Federal Due Dates <p> As described in detail in the AICPA summary chart , these federal due date changes should provide a more logical workflow next year . Starting with 2016 returns , business entity investors ' Schedules K-1 are due before the investors ' returns are due , and foreign account information ( FBAR ) is due ( and can be extended ) when the individual returns are due . Here 's a brief recap of the new federal tax return deadlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 15 , providing investor Schedule K-1 information to their partners and shareholders ( including corporations ) before the investors ' returns are due . <p> Tax returns for calendar-year corporations , individuals , trusts and estates , and FBAR are due on April 15 . <p> The extended due date for partnerships continues to be September 15 , along with corporations ( until 2026 ) . The extended due date for trusts and estates is September 30 . <p> The extended due date for individuals and FBARs ( and starting 2026 , for extended corporations ) is October 15 . <p> State Tax Return Due Dates <p> As we get ready to implement the new federal due dates in the upcoming 2017 filing season ( for 2016 tax returns ) , many states are considering legislation , regulations or administrative/guidance changes to conform state tax return due dates to the new federal due dates . <p> States should consider making sure the state corporate tax return is not due before the new federal corporate due date of April 15 . Otherwise , CPAs may need to prepare state tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to consider aligning the partnership due dates to the new federal due date of March 15 . <p> State Legislative Update <p> So far , due dates conformity legislation has been enacted in the following states : <p> As of May 19 , Arizona and California were considering proposals to alter their due dates . <p> Several states that might want to consider changes to the state corporate tax return due date include the District of Columbia , Illinois , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Ohio and Wisconsin . Some states , such as Alabama , may require only a regulatory rule or guidance change from the state departments of revenue to change their due dates . <p> Lastly , as taxpayers and practitioners plan for the 2017 filing season , they may want to update their work processes and workflow to align with the new due dates .

@@1074696 <h> Practical Approaches to Common Conflicts of Interest <p> This column highlights some common conflicts of interest encountered by CPA tax practitioners and offers some practical means of properly addressing the consequential ethical issues . <p> To provide some context for this discussion , consider the following situation : In 1998 , an attorney wrote several tax opinions for prospective benefit plan participants concerning the plan 's tax qualification , while at the same time he maintained an attorney-client relationship with the plan 's promoter . The attorney later became a co-trustee of the plan . When the IRS challenged the plan , the attorney represented individual plan participants before the IRS with respect to their individual tax disputes , while continuing to serve as the plan 's co-trustee . <p> Throughout this period , the attorney failed to advise his clients of his multiple engagements and roles , and , of course , he failed to obtain their informed consent to continue the representations . The IRS Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) viewed these layers of conflicted representation as jeopardizing the rights of the various clients the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of these conflicts ( see IRS News Release IR-2012-63 , " Attorney Censured by the Office of Professional Responsibility for Mishandling Conflicts of Interest , " ( 6/22/12 ) . <p> Relevant Ethical Provisions <p> A practitioner does not need to be an attorney with multiple layers of conflicts to be in the middle of a conflict problem . The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct ( AICPA Code ) , which applies to all members of the Institute ( and , by reference , to practitioners in those states where the governing board of accountancy has incorporated the AICPA Code into the state-specific code of conduct ) , and Treasury Circular 230 , Regulations Governing Practice Before the Internal Revenue Service ( 31 C.F.R. Part 10 ) , which applies to professionals who are licensed to practice before the IRS , both speak to conflicts of interest and how to address them . <p> AICPA ethics interpretations state that a conflict may occur whenever the member or someone in the member 's firm " has a relationship with another person , entity , product , or service that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the client , employer , or other appropriate parties as impairing the member 's objectivity " ( AICPA Code , ET -102-2 , " Conflicts of Interest " ) . The rule does not prohibit providing a nonattest service , such as tax services , where such circumstances exist , as long as " the member believes that the professional service can be performed with objectivity , and the relationship is disclosed . . . and consent is obtained " ( i 'd . ) . <p> Section 10.29 of Circular 230 spells out the following situations that are deemed to be conflicts : <p> ( 1 ) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client ; or <p> ( 2 ) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the practitioner 's responsibilities to another client , a former client or third person , or by a personal interest of the practitioner . <p> Section 10.29(b) provides that , even when a conflict exists , the practitioner may still represent the client if ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client ; and ( 2 ) assuming the representation is not prohibited by law , each affected client waives the conflict of interest and gives informed consent , confirmed in writing by each affected client , at the time the existence of the conflict of interest is known by the practitioner . <p> Note that Section 10.29(b) ( 3 ) of Circular 230 allows the written confirmation to be made within a reasonable time after the informed consent , but in no event later than 30 days . In addition , Section 10.29(c) requires practitioners to retain the written consents for at least 36 months from the date of the conclusion of the representation of the affected clients . The written representations must also be available to the IRS upon request . <p> Commonly Encountered Conflicts <p> Based on the authors ' experiences , the following are some of the more common conflicts encountered by CPA practitioners : <p> Example 1 . Practitioner 's personal interest : D , CPA , is also a registered representative with ABC Securities Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has a 1-year-old child . When delivering E 's income tax return , D advises him that he would benefit from using a Sec. 529 qualified savings plan to save money for his child 's education . D points out that in E 's home state , he would benefit from a state income tax deduction of up to $3,000 per child per year . The state income tax rate for E 's home state is 7% . Therefore , if E were to contribute $3,000 per year for 10 years , his cumulative state tax savings ( ignoring the time value of money ) would be $2,100 ( $3,000 + 7% + 10 years ) . E agrees , and D completes a new account form , opening a Sec. 529 qualified savings plan with E as the owner and his child as the beneficiary . E then invests $5,000 into the plan . As a result of this investment , D earns a 5% commission ( $250 ) on the sale of the Sec. 529 plan security . <p> Before opening an account for E , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possibly affecting her objectivity . This is the type of situation ET Section 102-2 identifies as a possible conflict of interest , and D must determine whether she can be objective in making the recommendation to E. Similarly , Section 10.29 of Circular 230 requires D to be confident that she can provide competent and diligent representation to E. Some questions she should ask herself regarding the materiality of the personal interest and her duty of objectivity include : <p> Do the potential tax savings for the client justify paying a commission ? <p> Is the home state 's Sec. 529 plan more suitable for the client than that of any other state , especially one whose securities may not be sold by ABC Securities ? <p> Is the Sec. 529 plan more suitable than other higher education savings strategies that may be available , such as a Coverdell education savings account ? <p> If E were to take D 's advice but buy the investment from another broker , could D still diligently provide him with tax preparation services ? <p> Is the $3,000 recommended contribution a material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material amount to D , such that it would influence the advice she is rendering on entering into any Sec. 529 plan ? <p> If D is satisfied that she can objectively , competently , and diligently make a recommendation to E , ET Section 102-2 requires her to inform E that she will receive a commission if E invests in the plan through D and to obtain E 's written consent . The Circular 230 rule permits D to make the recommendation and open the plan even if she thinks there is a significant risk that her dual role could materially limit her ability to represent E , provided that D captures E 's informed consent in D 's files so as to completely satisfy Sections 10.29(b) ( 2 ) and 10.29(c) . For example , D may explain that she is familiar with other plans or investment opportunities that may be available , and E may decide that the convenience of having D open the account outweighs the actual or perceived benefits of alternative solutions . <p> ET Section 102-2 does not require the consent to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is a significant risk that D 's dual role would materially limit her ability to represent E. D , however , may wish to eliminate the risk of questions arising in the future by obtaining E 's written consent . At first blush , this seems to be an easy exercise ( i.e. , just have the client sign a consent ) , but there is more to it than meets the eye . <p> What Is " Informed Consent " ? <p> Informed consent rules may vary by jurisdiction and by various rules of professional practice ( see , e.g. , American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.9 and 1.10 ; see also ABA Formal Ethics Opinion 08-450 ( 4/9/08 ) ) . ABA Model Rule 1.4(b) , for example , states that a client must be provided information " to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation . " The key is to ensure that the client understands what is involved in the transaction and the scope of risk being undertaken in having the practitioner provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Example 1 , D should prepare a waiver form similar to the one shown in Exhibit 1 . This will allow D to discuss the issue with E and obtain his approval after ensuring that he satisfactorily understands the conflict to provide informed consent . D should then obtain E 's signature and retain the written consent in accordance with Circular 230 . <p> Example 2 : Interplay between conflict-of-interest and independence rules : For a number of years , F , CPA , has provided services for G , and they have developed a friendly relationship . G is the general partner in a successful real estate and rental property business based in a nearby oceanside town . F prepared G 's personal income tax returns as well as those of the partnership . F also has prepared the partnership 's reviewed financial statement for the last several years . Both G and the partnership have executed annual engagement agreements for the services rendered . G informs F that his family is considering buying a house on the beach with another family as joint owners so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a weekend beach house . G asks F whether F would be interested in joining . Can F join G in buying the house and continue to provide him tax services ? <p> F should recognize that entering into such a joint venture with G poses several possible conflicts of interest that have not been addressed in the engagement agreements . There could be a threat to his objectivity in both fact and appearance regarding the nonattest services that he provides . F may believe that if he jointly owns a vacation home with G , he can continue to be objective ( ET -102-2 ) and that he is not materially limited from being able to provide competent and diligent representation to G and the partnership ( Circular 230 , -10.29 ) . By obtaining the appropriate written informed consent from G , the partnership , and other partners , F may be able to continue tax return preparation and tax planning work . <p> However , F may be unable to continue to review the partnership 's financial statements because the AICPA rules requiring independence can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the AICPA Code expressly provides that a jointly held vacation home can be considered a joint closely held investment and , if material to the covered member , can impair the required independence for attest services ( ET -191.184 ) . <p> In this instance , if F elected to withdraw from the reviewed financial statement engagement , he could prepare a written informed consent documentfor G and the other partners in the partnership to consider and execute . ( It is the authors ' belief that the partnership 's tax matters partner ( TMP ) could waive the conflict on behalf of the partnership for purposes of compliance with Circular 230 , although the TMP may be unable to legally bind the partnership for other purposes ( see Gateway Hotel Partners , LLC , T.C. Memo . 2009-128 , in which the court said the TMP serves as a -fiduciary ) . ) <p> Example 3 . Multiple clients : H , CPA , prepares the income tax return for XYZ Inc. , an S corporation owned equally by F and J. In addition , H provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J 's wife , K , with whom he files jointly , is starting a home business in the current tax year , for which she will report a substantial ordinary loss on Schedule C , Profit or Loss From Business ( Sole Proprietorship ) . In the current tax year , F 's wife , L , won $1- million in the lottery . H advises XYZ Inc. to elect to expense $200,000 of certain depreciable assets for the current tax year . ( Assume that $200,000 is under the maximum allowable Sec. 179 election limitation . ) This election would considerably reduce income tax for F and his spouse , offsetting the overall impact of her lottery winnings , but it would not provide current-year tax benefits for J and his spouse 's business losses . J expects significantly higher personal income in the following year . <p> Either J or F could view H 's dual roles of advising XYZ and preparing its corporate return , in addition to advising J and preparing his return , as affecting her ability to objectively determine the appropriate elections for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her objectivity while serving in both these roles ( ET -102-2 ) and whether she is materially limited from being able to provide competent and diligent representation to XYZ and J ( and J 's spouse ) ( Circular 230 , -10.29 ) . <p> Assume H has become comfortable with her ability to handle the dual representation . H also has determined that , regardless of how she advises XYZ , it is up to XYZ to make the election . She concludes it is within XYZ 's sole discretion whether to elect the amount of Sec. 179 expense deduction H recommends or to elect an amount higher or lower than her recommendation . <p> Since H has determined that she can fulfill her professional responsibilities , she does not need to obtain written consent from the relevant parties under the Circular 230 rules . Because of a possible appearance of a conflict however , under the AICPA Code , H should inform XYZ of the implications of the election to its owners on their individual returns , make the relevant parties aware of her role as return preparer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear that it is XYZ 's decision whether to make the election . The AICPA Code does not require written consent from the parties , but H should document her advice and disclosure and make it a part of her client file so as to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest . <p> Example 4 . Adverse clients:M is a CPA who has prepared a joint Form 1040 , U.S. Individual Income Tax Return , for Mr. and Mrs. N for several years . This year , M receives a call from Mr. N , saying that he and his wife have started divorce proceedings . Mr. N wants to meet with M to discuss preparing a joint return for him and Mrs. N , and to discuss whether any tax positions could help him prepare for what he expects will be a bitter battle with Mrs. N over their marital assets . <p> The first step in the analysis , as in any potential conflict situation , is to consider whether anyone could view the arrangement as affecting M 's objectivity , or whether M 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to another . Here , a tax position that is advantageous for Mr. N likely will be disadvantageous to Mrs. N. M therefore will be unable to complete the return with 100% neutrality . Even if he were able to maintain neutrality , that may not be sufficient to meet the objectivity , competency , and diligence standards required by Circular 230 and applicable AICPA and state society professional ethics standards . M likely should not prepare a joint return for the Ns , even if both Mr. and Mrs. N are willing to sign consents . <p> Suppose the Ns agree to file separate returns for the year , and Mr. N asks M to prepare his . In that case , M 's duty of confidentiality to Mrs. N may affect his ability to provide services to Mr. N ( ET -301 , " Confidential Client Information , " and IRC Sec. 7216 ) . M is prohibited from disclosing information that is confidential with respect to Mrs. N or using information received from Mrs. N in connection with the preparation of prior-year returns without Mrs. N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide competent and diligent service to Mr. N without betraying any of Mrs. N 's confidential information , it would be prudent for M to seek Mrs. N 's consent before agreeing to complete Mr. N 's separate return . A sample of consent language may be found in Exhibit 2 . Note if both Mr. and Mrs. N consent to the arrangement , M should also obtain a separate written authorization from Mrs. N to share tax return information under Regs . Sec. 301.7216-3(a) ( 1 ) . <p> Conclusion <p> These scenarios suggest that every CPA tax practitioner must watch for potential conflict situations , regardless of the size or the scope of a practice . Open and direct conversations with clients are necessary to address potential conflicts in fact or in appearance , and it is prudent to document those conversations . When a conflict may have a material impact on a client 's representation , Section 10.29 of Circular 230 requires written documentation of the client 's informed consent .

@@1074708 <h> Latest Stories <h> Contributing Intangible Property to an LLC <p> Sec. 721 generally provides that a member 's transfer of property to a limited liability company ( LLC ) taxed as a partnership does not result in income or loss to the member or the LLC . The LLC steps into the shoes of the contributing member with respect to the holding period and adjusted tax basis of the contributed property ( Secs . 1223 and 723 ) . This general nonrecognition rule applies both to contributions made upon the formation of the LLC and to subsequent contributions by new or existing members . <p> However , the nonrecognition rule applies only to contributions of property . While there usually is little difficulty in determining whether a contribution consists of property , questions can arise when a contribution could be characterized as property created by a person 's services or services that create property for the LLC 's benefit . This issue also arises if a member 's capital account is credited with an amount that clearly exceeds the fair market value ( FMV ) of the contributed property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misstep can be significant . <h> What Constitutes Property ? <p> In most instances , determining whether a member 's contribution is property is a simple task . Money , fee title to real estate , and ownership of equipment are examples of contributions that clearly constitute property . When the property was created by the personal efforts of a member , however , there may be a question of whether the interest was received for the product ( property ) or the effort ( services ) . <p> There is no requirement that the contributed property be tangible ( see , e.g. , Rev. Rul. 71-564 and Ambrose , T.C. Memo . 1956-125 ) . Contract rights , goodwill , technical knowledge , and trade secrets all constitute property eligible for nonrecognition treatment . Also , a federal appeals court overturned a district court ruling that a letter of intent could constitute property only if it had value and was legally enforceable ( Stafford , 727 F.2d 1043 ( 11th Cir. 1984 ) ) . The appeals court disagreed , determining that enforceability was not an essential condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to goodwill , which is considered to be property even though it is unenforceable . For that reason , although it was not binding , the letter of intent constituted property . The property had been created by the partner 's efforts , for his own account , and the partner owned the property before he contributed it to the partnership . As a result , the contribution of the letter of intent was a nonrecognition transaction . <p> Example:A wants to construct an office building on block R. To this end , A ( who is not an attorney ) drafted a letter of intent by which an investor agreed in principle ( 1 ) to provide a first mortgage loan for the project and ( 2 ) to enter into a long-term lease for the completed building . The letter of intent was not legally binding on either party . <p> After the letter of intent was executed , A decided to form an LLC with B and C to develop the project . Pursuant to an operating agreement , A contributed the letter of intent he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building and prepare architectural drawings for the LLC . C contributed $75,000 cash . Each member received an initial capital account equal to the agreed-upon FMV of their contribution and a one-third interest in LLC profits and losses . <p> C 's cash contribution is a property contribution . Based on the preceding discussion , A 's contribution of the letter of intent should also be treated as a contribution of property . <p> B 's services in designing the building are performed for the LLC 's account . Although his services create property , namely architectural drawings , B agreed from the start to create this property for the LLC . He never owned the property he created . As a result , B 's contribution does not qualify for nonrecognition treatment , and the FMV of his LLC interest is treated as compensation for services . If B had created the designs and drawings before an LLC had been formed so that he owned them with no obligation to contribute them to the LLC , a contribution of this service-created property would qualify for nonrecognition treatment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <h> Contribution of Patents <p> The contribution of a patent or patents is considered a contribution of property to which the general nonrecognition rule applies . Special treatment is available if a patent is acquired from the patent holder ( Sec. 1235 ) . In such cases , in a subsequent sale of the patent by the transferee , the transferor member 's share of the gain recognized by the LLC on disposition of the patent will qualify under Sec. 1235 as long-term capital gain . Letter Rulings 200506008 , 200506009 , and 200506019 held that where the original patent holders transferred a patent to a wholly owned LLC , the LLC is entitled to long-term capital gain treatment on the subsequent sale of the patent . <h> Contribution of Debt Guarantees <p> Many LLCs request that members guarantee loans or make other similar financial guarantees . Often the LLC will treat such arrangements as a full or partial capital contribution . This creates some issues of timing and valuation that should be addressed in the operating agreement or other written agreement between the LLC and the member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans a guarantee fee . <p> In Seminole Thriftway , Inc. , 42 Fed . Cl. 584 ( 1999 ) , the court held that the deductibility of guarantor payments was generally dependent on ( 1 ) the reasonableness of the fees ; ( 2 ) whether businesses of the same type and size customarily paid guarantor fees to their owners ; ( 3 ) whether the owners demanded compensation for signing as guarantors ; ( 4 ) the absence of equity distributions to the owners , even though the payer 's profitability permitted such distributions ; and ( 5 ) the proportional relationship between the amount of the guarantor payment and the owner 's share of equity . <h> Valuing the Contribution <p> Valuing the contribution of a financial guarantee can be problematic since there is no ready market for such instruments . To avoid having the value of the contribution questioned , the members should agree in writing on its value before the contribution is made . The guarantee can be valued using any reasonable method , including basing the value on a percentage of the guaranteed amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining the value should be specified in the LLC 's operating agreement or a separate capital contribution agreement . The agreement should also contain a provision for future increases in the guarantee . The LLC may also want to limit the dollar value of debt guarantees that can be contributed to capital to avoid the dilution of voting control . <p> The contribution agreement may also need to address the situation where the amount guaranteed is reduced because the guarantor loses financial strength . In that case , the agreement should provide for a reduction in interest , perhaps using a percentage range . For example , if the guarantee is reduced by no more than 10% , there is no reduction ; if it is reduced by between 10% and 25% , there is a 5% reduction , etc . <p> An alternative to a traditional debt guarantee is to issue a second class of LLC interest to the guarantor . These LLC interests have a liquidation preference but have limited ( or no ) voting rights unless there is a default on the guaranteed debt . <h> Timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee , and the right of the member/guarantor to vote and exercise the rights of ownership resulting from the contribution should be determined before the contribution is made . Since the receipt of an unrestricted LLC interest results in income to the guarantor , timing may be important to minimize income taxes as well . Normally , the execution of a guarantee establishes the responsibility of the guarantor for the debt . Accordingly , the authors believe the guarantor/member should be credited with a capital contribution at that time . @qwx64575 
@@1074718 <p> Canadians looking to immigrate to the United States must consider a number of tax issues . Despite similarities in the countries ' taxing systems , some significant differences must be properly planned for to avoid paying significantly higher cumulative taxes . This item focuses on a couple of the major differences that need to be considered before emigrating from Canada . <h> Income Tax Residency <p> One of the major differences from an income tax standpoint between the United States and Canadian tax systems is which taxpayers are subject to taxation on their worldwide income and which taxpayers are subject to taxation on only their income sourced to that country . U.S. persons , which includes citizens and resident aliens under Sec. 7701(a) ( 30 ) ( A ) , are subject to tax in the United States on their worldwide income . A resident alien is a person who ( 1 ) is lawfully admitted for permanent residence ; ( 2 ) meets the substantial presence test ; or ( 3 ) satisfies the requirements and makes an election to be treated as a resident ( Sec. 7701(b) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is a noncitizen and nonresident , he or she is subject to U.S. taxation on his or her U.S.-source income and not on worldwide income . <p> Canada , similarly to the United States , taxes its residents on their worldwide income , while nonresidents are taxed on their Canada-source income ( Canada Revenue Agency Income Tax Folio S5-F1-C1 ) . Unlike the United States , however , citizenship is not a determining factor . Therefore , a Canadian citizen who is not a Canadian income tax resident is taxed in Canada on his or her Canada-source income only . Another distinction is that the United States has codified the definition of " resident , " while the meaning of the term " resident " in Canada has been left to judicial interpretation ( i 'd . ) . <h> Transfer Taxes : How Estates and Gifts Are Taxed <p> Another major difference between the Canadian and U.S. taxing systems is how the countries levy taxes on estates and gifts . In the United States , estates and gifts are subject to a transfer tax under Subtitle B of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less allowable deductions , exclusions , and credits , is subject to tax . The current maximum tax rate for estates and gifts is 40% ( Secs . 2001(c) and 2502(a) ) . The estate or gift is reported , if required , on Form 706 , United States Estate ( and Generation-Skipping Transfer ) Tax Return , or Form 709 , United States Gift ( and Generation-Skipping Transfer ) Tax Return , respectively . <p> In general , in the case of gifts of appreciated property , the donee takes a carryover basis in the property and has a tacked holding period ( Secs . 1015(a) and 1223(2) ) . In the case of inheritance , " a person acquiring the property from the decedent or to whom the property passed from a decedent " gets a step up ( or down ) in basis to the property 's fair market value ( FMV ) at either the date of death or , if elected , the alternative valuation date provided in Secs . 2032 and 1014(a) . Whether property is acquired or passed from a decedent is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of the property under Sec. 1014(a) but also in determining the holding period of the property under Sec. 1223(9) . <p> In Canada , estates and gifts are subject to a deemed-disposition tax on the transfer . The deemed-disposition tax operates as though the donor/decedent sold the property for the property 's FMV . The donor/decedent determines his or her gain or loss by comparing the deemed proceeds of disposition against his or her adjusted cost basis . The gain or loss is then reported on the donor/decedent 's income tax return . Thus , under Canadian law , a transfer of property at death or by gift during the donor 's lifetime is treated as a " sale " of the property and taxed under Canadian income tax principles and not under a transfer-tax regime such as the one the United States uses . <p> The deemed-disposition concept is also important to understand for -Canadians thinking of emigrating . When Canadians who are Canadian residents for income tax purposes emigrate from Canada , they will be subject to the deemed-disposition tax on their property . Certain types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition . Form T1243 , Deemed Disposition of Property by an Emigrant of Canada , provides the list of excluded properties , including : <p> Canadian real or immovable property , Canadian resource property , and timber resource property ; <p> Canadian business property ( including inventory ) if the business is carried on through a permanent establishment in Canada ; <p> Property the person owned when he or she last became a resident of Canada , or property inherited after he or she last became a resident of Canada , if he or she was a resident of Canada for 60 months or less during the 10-year period before emigration ; <p> Employee security options subject to Canadian tax ; and <p> Interest in life insurance policies in Canada ( other than segregated fund policies ) . <p> Property not excluded is deemed to be disposed of and reacquired for its FMV when the taxpayer leaves Canada . A taxpayer emigrating from Canada can make a couple of elections regarding the deemed-disposition tax . First , he or she can elect to recognize the deemed disposition of the excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The election to include these properties is made on Form T2061A , Election by an Emigrant to Report Deemed Dispositions of Property and Any Resulting Capital Gain or Loss , and attached to the taxpayer 's return . Second , the taxpayer can elect to defer the tax on the deemed disposition . This election is made by filing Form T1244 , Election , Under Subsection 220(4.5) of The Income Tax Act , to Defer the Payment of Tax on Income Relating to the Deemed Disposition of Property , by April 30 of the year after the taxpayer emigrates from Canada . Depending on the amount , the Canada Revenue Agency may require the taxpayer to provide adequate security to cover the tax being deferred . If the election to defer the tax on the deemed disposition is made , then the tax would be due when the taxpayer disposes of the property . Lastly , the taxpayer can elect to unwind the deemed disposition that occurred upon his or her emigration if the taxpayer later reestablishes Canadian income tax residency and still owns some or all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he or she emigrated . <p> The U.S.-Canada tax treaty becomes an important tool for a Canadian emigrant who was subject to the deemed-disposition tax when he or she left Canada . Article XIII , Paragraph 7 , of the U.S.-Canada tax treaty provides : <p> where at any time an individual is treated for the purposes of taxation by a Contracting State as having alienated a property and is taxed in that State by reason thereof and the domestic law of the other Contracting State at such time defers ( but does not forgive ) taxation , that individual may elect in his annual return of income for the year of such alienation to be liable to tax in the other Contracting State in that year as if he had , immediately before that time , sold and repurchased such property for an amount equal to its fair market value at that time . <p> The Technical Explanation to the 2007 Protocol explains that the purpose of this election is to " provide a rule to coordinate U.S. and Canadian taxation of gains in the case of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " such a mismatch may occur , for example , where a Canadian resident is deemed , for Canadian tax purposes , to recognize capital gain upon emigrating from Canada to the United States . " The Technical Explanation also discusses the effect of the election : <p> If the individual is not subject to U.S. tax at that time , the effect of the election will be to give the individual an adjusted basis for U.S. tax purposes equal to the fair market value of the property as of the date of the deemed alienation in Canada , with the result that only post-emigration gain will be subject to U.S. tax when there is an actual alienation . If the Canadian resident is also a U.S. citizen at the time of his emigration from Canada , then the provisions of new paragraph 7 would allow the U.S. citizen to accelerate the tax under U.S. tax law and allow tax credits to be used to avoid double taxation . This would also be the case if the person , while not a U.S. citizen , would otherwise be subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . <p> The election is made on the taxpayer 's timely filed U.S. income tax return for the first tax year ending after the taxpayer 's change of residence on Form 8833 , Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b) ( Rev. Proc. 2010-19 ) . The information and documents required to make the election are also found in this revenue procedure . <p> As discussed above , the deemed--disposition tax applies whether the Canadian resident gifts property or emigrates with the property . Therefore , gifting of unneeded assets before emigration may be a planning opportunity for Canadian residents who are considering emigrating in the near future . From a Canadian tax standpoint , if property is gifted as opposed to being retained upon emigration , the only difference in the deemed-disposition tax that would result would be due to the change in the property 's FMV between the time of the gift and the time of emigration . If the property 's FMV increased between the time of the gift and the taxpayer 's emigration , the deemed-disposition tax would be lessened by gifting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the time of the gift and the taxpayer 's emigration , the reverse would be true . Also , one should consider the time value of money , since gifting the property before emigration accelerates the tax into the year of the gift rather than the emigrant 's final Canadian tax year . <p> If the donee is a Canadian resident , he or she would take an adjusted cost basis in the property equal to the FMV on the date of transfer . This makes sense since the donor recognized a gain on the deemed disposition . If , however , the donee is a U.S. citizen or resident , the answer is not as simple . As discussed earlier , for U.S. tax purposes , the donee generally takes a carryover basis in property received by gift . Fortunately , Article XIII , Paragraph 7 , of the U.S.-Canada tax treaty also provides relief in the case of gifts from Canadian residents to U.S. residents . The Technical Explanation to the 2007 Protocol states : <p> In the case of Canadian taxation of appreciated property given as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subject to tax in Canada upon making the gift , and the donee may be subject to tax in the United States upon a later disposition of the property on all or a portion of the same gain in the property without the availability of any foreign tax credit for the tax paid to Canada . . . . The election will be available to any individual who pays taxes in Canada on a gain arising from the individual 's gifting of a property , without regard to whether the person is a U.S. taxpayer at the time of the gift . The effect of the election in such case will be to give the donee an adjusted basis for U.S. tax purposes equal to the fair market value as of the date of the gift . If the donor is a U.S. taxpayer , the effect of the election will be the realization of gain or loss for U.S. purposes immediately before the gift . The acceleration of the U.S. tax liability by reason of the election in such case enables the donor to utilize foreign tax credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property . <p> By gifting the property before emigrating and making this election , the taxpayer could eliminate U.S. transfer taxes in the future for himself or herself and reduce U.S. income taxes for the donee on the later disposition of the property . <p> Example 1 : Taxpayer A is considered a Canadian resident and a nonresident alien for U.S. tax purposes . This means A is subject to tax in Canada on his worldwide income and in the United States on only his U.S.-source income . A has a significant estate that , if he were a U.S. taxpayer , would be subject to the U.S. estate tax . <p> If one of A 's assets is stock in a publicly traded Canadian corporation with an adjusted cost basis of $10 and an FMV of $100 , what would the potential taxes be if he were to emigrate ? The gain on the deemed disposition in Canada upon emigration would be $90 , which would be subject to the Canadian income tax rules . Furthermore , if A failed to make the election provided for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 while considered a U.S. taxpayer , there would be another $90 gain taxed in the United States . A now has $100 cash less the U.S. income tax paid included in his taxable estate . Therefore , the taxpayer could be subject to two levels of income tax on the " sale " of the stock , as well as an estate tax upon his death . <p> Example 2 : Assume the same facts as Example 1 , except that A gives the stock to a U.S. taxpayer before emigration . A would still be subject to tax on the $90 gain in Canada under the deemed-disposition concept . However , if the election under Article XIII , Paragraph 7 , of the U.S.-Canada tax treaty is made , the donee would get an adjusted cost basis of $100 so a later sale of the stock for $100 would result in no U.S. income tax . The $100 asset ( i.e. , stock or cash ) would be out of A 's estate , so no additional estate tax would apply . <p> The idea of gifting property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of reasons . First and foremost , tax professionals are always looking for ways to reduce a client 's tax burden , but that savings can not come at the expense of a client 's future economic independence . Secondly , the term " resident " in the United States for purposes of estate and gift taxation differs from that term 's definition for income tax purposes . Therefore , an individual could be a resident for U.S. estate and gift taxation without being a resident for U.S. income taxation and vice versa . <h> Planning for Canadian Registered Accounts <p> Often one of the largest assets a Canadian emigrant has accumulated while a Canadian resident is a registered retirement savings plan ( RRSP ) or registered retirement income fund ( RRIF ) ( collectively referred to as RRIFs ) . RRIFs are not subject to the deemed-disposition tax on emigration from Canada . Therefore , a Canadian emigrant needs to understand how the United States views and taxes these assets . <p> From a Canadian point of view , these types of accounts are treated in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . However , from the U.S. perspective , RRIFs are nonqualified plans , and the U.S. treatment is akin to a brokerage account or grantor trust . Therefore , RRIFs do not receive tax-deferred growth as they would in Canada or as a 401(k) or IRA would in the United States . The U.S.-Canada income tax treaty does provide a solution for Canadian emigrants who wish to continue to receive tax-deferred growth in their RRIFs . Article XVIII(7) of the tax treaty allows for an election to be made in the United States to defer the taxation " with respect to any income accrued in the plan but not distributed by the plan , until such time as and to the extent that a distribution is made from the plan . " This election is made on IRS Form 8891 , U.S. Information Return for Beneficiaries of Certain Canadian Registered Retirement Plans . This election is irrevocable and applies to the year the election is made and all subsequent years . Because the election is irrevocable and applies to all subsequent years , careful consideration should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incorrectly making or failing to make the election could be costly . Regardless of whether the election is made , Form 8891 needs to be completed by all U.S. taxpayers who are beneficiaries or annuitants of Canadian registered retirement plans . <p> If the election is made , the RRIF will be taxed in the United States in a manner similar to how it is taxed in Canada . The tax will be deferred until distributions from the RRIF are made ; then , the distributions will be taxed at ordinary income rates . If the election is not made , the taxpayer will be required to report the RRIF 's underlying income ( i.e. , interest , dividends , gains , etc. ) on his or her U.S. tax returns . This can sometimes be a difficult task because the adjusted cost basis of an RRIF 's underlying assets is not always readily available and the taxpayer does not receive a consolidated Form 1099 as he or she would if the investments were held in a U.S. brokerage account . However , in most cases , this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the election , the taxpayer may benefit by reporting the underlying activity because of the preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends . The taxpayer may also benefit by not making the election if the income of the underlying assets is less than the distributions the taxpayer is receiving , regardless of a tax rate differential . <p> Regardless of whether the taxpayer makes the aforementioned election for U.S. federal income tax purposes , the same treatment may not be afforded to him or her for state income tax purposes . For example , the state of California takes the position in Information Letter No. 2003-0040 that : <p> The Franchise Tax Board considers a RRSP to be similar to a savings account . The Franchise Tax Board will treat a taxpayer 's original contributions to the RRSP , made while a Canadian resident , as a capital investment in the RRSP . A California resident must include any earnings from their RRSP in their taxable income and pay taxes on this income in the year earned . After a taxpayer pays tax on these earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the RRSP . Therefore , when a taxpayer receives a distribution from their RRSP , the amount consisting of the contributions and the previously taxed earnings is considered a nontaxable return of capital . <p> As such , the letter determines that " the federal election to defer taxation on earnings of the RRSP is inapplicable for California income tax purposes . " The taxpayer needs to be aware of this potential divergent treatment for state income taxes , which depends on the state of residency after he or she emigrates . <p> Another issue that should be addressed before emigration is the nature of the RRIF 's underlying assets . It should be determined whether any of the assets would be classified as a controlled foreign corporation ( CFC ) or passive foreign investment company ( PFIC ) under U.S. law . If any of the assets are CFCs or PFICs , the rules related to these types of investments could change the character and timing of tax in the United States . Before emigrating , the taxpayer should understand the taxation of CFCs and PFICs in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-emigration or dispose of them before emigrating . After the taxpayer emigrates , Canada will continue to tax the RRIF ; however , the tax will be collected through nonresident withholding by the RRIF custodian at the time of distribution . The withholding rate is either ( 1 ) 15% if the distributions qualify for period payment treatment under Article XVIII of the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty or ( 2 ) 25% if they do not qualify for the treaty rate . The Canadian withholding tax will be an allowable foreign tax credit in the United States . If the election is made under Article XVIII(7) , the timing of the foreign tax credits will not be an issue . If the election is not made , the taxpayer and his or her tax professional should consider the timing mismatch that can occur . Additionally , the sourcing of income becomes more important if the election is not made , as not all of the income the RRIF generated will likely be foreign-source . For example , capital gains from the sale of investments are generally sourced to the taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prudent not to make the special election under Article XVIII(7) , then additional preemigration planning should be done . As noted above , in Canada an RRIF is treated as similar to an IRA in the United States . As such , gains realized on the sale of investments in the RRIF are not taxed . As noted above , if the election is not made , the account is treated as the U.S. taxpayer 's brokerage account or grantor trust . Therefore , realized gains and losses are reportable on the U.S. taxpayer 's ( beneficiary 's ) return as they arise . Since a transfer tax is not paid with respect to the RRIF 's assets upon emigration , the election to step up the basis of the assets is not available . Therefore , the " new " U.S. taxpayer will have a carryover basis in the RRIF 's assets . If the assets have substantially appreciated at the time of emigration , the " new " U.S. taxpayer would have a substantial tax to pay on a later disposition of the assets . This tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the gain will generally be considered U.S.-source income . The U.S. income tax can be avoided , however , if the highly appreciated assets held in the RRIF are sold before immigrating to the United States and replaced with new investments . This technique essentially steps up the basis of the assets for the " new " U.S. taxpayer with no additional tax cost , since in Canada the activity of the RRIF is not subject to tax . <p> Another important consideration of a U.S. taxpayer who is a beneficiary of an RRIF is the taxation of the RRIF upon his or her death . Since Canada does not have an estate tax in the way the United States has an estate tax , there is no treaty between the countries on this issue . However , Article XXIXB of the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty does cover " Taxes Imposed by Reason of Death . " Article XXIXB(7) provides : <p> in determining the amount of estate tax imposed by the United States on the estate of an individual who was a resident or citizen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a credit shall be allowed against such tax imposed in respect of property situated outside the United States , for the federal and provincial income tax taxes payable in Canada in respect of such property by reason of death of the individual . . . <p> The credit is allowable in the United States " for an amount of federal or provincial income tax payable in Canada only to the extent that no credit or deduction is claimed for such amount in determining any other tax imposed by the United States " ( i 'd . at ( c ) ) . <p> The Technical Explanation to the 2007 Protocol explains that this paragraph of the treaty " applies where an individual who immediately before death was a resident or citizen of the United States held at the time of death an RRSP . " For this purpose , RRSP and RRIF are interchangeable . The Technical Explanation goes on to add that " this provision ensures that the Canadian income tax will be allowable as a credit against the U.S. estate tax . " Without this provision , a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subject to Canadian nonresident withholding on the final distribution from the RRIF and U.S. estate tax on the entire value of the RRIF without any foreign tax credits available . <h> Conclusion <p> There will inevitability be additional issues that a taxpayer and his or her advisers will need to consider and address before emigrating from Canada to the United States . Some of these will be tax related and others will not . However , without a comprehensive understanding of the tax issues , the taxpayer may end up paying taxes he or she could have otherwise avoided with the proper pre-emigration planning . <p> EditorNotes <p> Anthony Bakale is with Cohen &amp; Co .

@@1074719 <h> Latest Stories <h> Using a Crummey Trust to Preserve Gift Tax Exclusion <p> A gift qualifies for the annual gift tax exclusion ( $14,000 for 2014 ) only if the transfer is of a present interest in the property . A present interest is defined as an unrestricted right to the immediate use , possession , or enjoyment of the property or the income from it . This present interest requirement often prevents a gift to a trust from qualifying for the annual gift tax exclusion if the trust accumulates income and defers the distribution of principal . <p> A favorite tool of practitioners is the Crummey trust . It satisfies the present interest requirement while allowing the donor to avoid the requirement of the Sec. 2503(c) trust that all income and principal be distributed to the beneficiary at age 21 and the requirement of the Sec. 2503(b) trust that all income be distributed currently . It was named after a 1968 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that was subsequently accepted by the IRS in Rev. Rul. 73-405 ( Crummey , 397 F.2d 82 ( 9th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , a periodic contribution of assets to the trust is accompanied by an immediate withdrawal power that gives the beneficiary the right to withdraw the contribution for a limited time . However , the expectation of the donor is that the power to withdraw will not be exercised ( although there should be no express agreement to this effect ) . The beneficiary 's limited withdrawal right ( a Crummey power ) causes the gift to the trust to be a gift of a present interest that can be sheltered by the annual gift tax exclusion . It is the presence of a legal right , not the likelihood of its exercise , that is the determining factor . <p> In Letter Ruling 199912016 , the IRS considered four factors in determining whether a beneficiary 's withdrawal ( Crummey ) right qualified gifts to a trust as present interest gifts : <p> The trust is required to give the beneficiary reasonable notice in which to exercise the withdrawal right ; <p> The beneficiary is given adequate time following notice in which to exercise the withdrawal right ; <p> Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate and unrestricted right to an amount equal to the amount contributed to the trust ; and <p> There is no understanding or agreement , expressed or implied , that the withdrawal will not be exercised . <p> Withdrawal Right <p> The trust 's beneficiary must be given actual notice of the withdrawal right along with a reasonable period to exercise it , generally considered to be 30- days or longer . The IRS has privately ruled that without a current notice that a gift is being transferred to the trust , it is not possible for a donee to have the real and immediate benefit of the gift ( Technical Advice Memorandum 9532001 ) . The authors recommend the notification be written ; also , a written acknowledgment should be received from the beneficiary or the beneficiary 's representative . The trust instrument may limit the withdrawal right to the amount of the annual gift tax exclusion or the fair market value of the property contributed to the trust , whichever is less . <p> The IRS has long been concerned about trust arrangements that give individuals Crummey withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal of the trust ( sometimes referred to as " naked " Crummey powers ) . The IRS holds that the beneficiaries of a Crummey trust must have an actual economic interest in the trust property for the present interest requirement to be satisfied ( Letter Ruling 9045002 ) . In other words , the beneficiaries should have a vested right to principal or income for the annual exclusion to apply . <p> The IRS was dealt a major defeat on this issue in 1991 when the Tax Court ruled that the controlling factor in the present interest requirement was not the likelihood of the beneficiaries ' exercising their withdrawal power , but whether the beneficiaries had the power to make the withdrawals ( Estate of Cristofani , 97 T.C. 74 ( 1991 ) , acq. 1992-1 C.B. 1 , acq. 1996-2 C.B. 1 ) . Although the IRS acquiesced in the Cristofani decision , it also issued an action on decision ( AOD ) , which indicates it will continue to litigate in situations where the annual withdrawal power is granted to persons who do not have income or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ( AOD 1992-09 ) . <p> In an unusual move , the IRS issued a second AOD ( 1996-10 ) on the Cristofani decision five years after the event . In addition to repeating the rationale of the earlier AOD , the second one states that the IRS will challenge Crummey powers if the withdrawal rights have no real substance , regardless of the power holders ' other interests in the trusts . Specifically , the IRS Chief Counsel stated that if there is evidence of an agreement between the donor and the power holder that the withdrawal right would not be exercised , or if the exercise of the right would result in adverse consequences to the holder , the withdrawal right will not be considered a bona fide gift of a present interest . Simultaneously with the release of AOD 1996-10 , the IRS issued Letter Ruling 9628004 , in which it denied annual exclusions on transfers to trusts , based in part on its finding that the donor and beneficiaries had a " prearranged understanding " that the beneficiaries would not exercise their rights of withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AOD 1996-10 , practitioners should be aware that the IRS will continue to look very carefully at the substance behind Crummey power holders ' rights and the vested interest that a power holder has in the trust . The practitioner should assume that an annual gift tax exclusion will probably not be allowed for a power holder who has no interest in a trust other than withdrawal rights . In addition , the IRS will likely challenge exclusions for powers held by contingent beneficiaries . While the IRS acknowledges that in Cristofani not all of the power holders for whom a gift tax exclusion was allowed by the court had an income or vested remainder interest in the trust ( although those that did not were contingent beneficiaries ) , it does warn that it will continue to deny exclusions for Crummey power holders where the withdrawal rights have no substance , regardless of the beneficiaries ' economic interest in the trust . <p> Lapse of Withdrawal Right <p> When the income beneficiary and the remainderman are different individuals , a hidden gift tax trap awaits the Crummey power holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has the power to withdraw the contribution from the trust for a limited period ) allows the power to lapse at the end of the specified period , he or she has in effect made a transfer of a future interest in the property to the remainderman . If the power holder or his or her estate is the remainderman , no transfer has occurred , because he or she would simply be making a transfer to himself or herself . Where the power holder and the remainderman are different individuals , the lapse of the power may be a taxable gift from the income beneficiary to the remainderman under the power-of-appointment rules . <p> To avoid this unexpected gift from the income beneficiary to the remainderman , the Crummey power may be limited to a level that does not exceed the allowable lapsing right gift tax exemption ( i.e. , the " five and five " limitation , where withdrawals can not exceed $5,000 or 5% of the trust 's assets , if greater ) . However , this limitation may not allow for full use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be given a testamentary power of appointment over the property , which would cause the trust property to be included in the beneficiary 's estate . The obvious solution is to make the Crummey power holder the trust 's sole beneficiary . <p> Income Tax Considerations <p> Under Sec. 678(a) , a person other than the grantor will be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust over which he has a power to vest trust income or corpus in himself . Therefore , until a Crummey power is exercised or allowed to lapse , the power holder is treated as the owner of any income attributable to contributions made to the trust that are subject to the power . Such income is reported directly to the power holder under the grantor trust reporting rules . If the power holder ( beneficiary ) allows the withdrawal power to lapse , but retains an interest in the trust property ( the usual case ) , the beneficiary will continue to be treated as the owner of that portion of the trust ( Sec. 677 via Sec. 678(a) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent that trust income is taxed to a trust beneficiary under the age of 18 , or if the child is age 18 or a full-time student age 19 " 23 who has earned income equal to less than 50% of his or her support , the kiddie tax rules will apply . To minimize the income tax effects , the trustee could be authorized to invest in non " income-producing property , such as growth stocks , or in tax-exempt bonds . <p> Other Considerations <p> Other types of trusts may contain a Crummey power ; that is , the beneficiary ( child ) is granted the power to withdraw a specific amount of income or principal annually . This power may qualify gifts to the trust for the annual gift tax exclusion , even though the withdrawals may not actually occur . Also , Crummey clauses can be structured to permit multiple beneficiaries to invade the trust . <p> Parents may prefer a Crummey trust over a Sec. 2503(c) trust to gain more certainty over the termination of the trust . Assets in a Sec. 2503(c) trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless he or she elects to let the trust continue . This distribution requirement does not apply to a Crummey trust , which can , by its terms , extend termination well past age 21 . <p> To summarize , a Crummey trust can affect the clients ' income , estate , and gift tax planning . Therefore , careful consideration should be given to the tax and trust rules before setting up a Crummey trust . @qwx64575 
@@1074728 <h> IRS Offers New Options for Taxpayers Who Failed to File International Information Returns <p> In June , the IRS made considerable modifications to the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program ( OVDP ) , which for years has been used by taxpayers to avoid criminal prosecution by disclosing foreign financial accounts , getting current on taxes owed on income generated by those accounts , and paying a penalty . <p> In addition to changes to the OVDP , the IRS provided updated guidance addressing the appropriate procedure for taxpayers who have failed to file required international information returns ( such as Forms 5471 , Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations , and 5472 , Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business ) or who have failed to file required FinCEN Forms 114 , Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ( FBARs ) ( previously Treasury Form TD F 90-22.1 ) . The ways a taxpayer can deal with the failure to file these forms are outlined in " Options Available for U.S. Taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Remedial procedures contained in the options may apply to taxpayers in the following situations : <p> Failure to report gross income from a foreign financial asset and pay tax as required by U.S. law ; <p> Failure to timely file FBARs ; and <p> Failure to timely file international information returns ( e.g. , Forms 3520 , Annual Return to Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts ; 3520-A , Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner ; 5471 ; 5472 ; 8938 , Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets ; 926 , Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation ; and 8621 , Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund ) . <p> The four options available contain significant distinctions that must be considered by taxpayers and tax advisers . Below is an overview of each option . <h> Option 1 : Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program ( OVDP ) <p> The OVDP is designed for taxpayers with exposure to potential criminal liability and/or substantial civil penalties due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay all taxes due on those assets . It provides taxpayers with such exposure ( 1 ) protection from criminal liability ; and ( 2 ) terms for resolving their civil tax and penalty obligations . The decision for a taxpayer to enter into the OVDP is not one to be taken lightly . Indeed , many practitioners regard the decision as one requiring legal consultation , given the risk of potential criminal prosecution . <h> Option 2 : Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures <p> The streamlined filing compliance procedures are designed to provide individual taxpayers ( including estates ) with an efficient way to file amended or delinquent returns and- terms for resolving their tax and penalty obligations . This option requires that the taxpayer certify that the failure to report all income , pay all tax , and submit all required information returns , including FBARs , was due to nonwillful conduct .

A taxpayer that files FBARs under this option will not be subject to a penalty for failure to file delinquent FBARs if the taxpayer properly reported and paid tax on all income from the foreign financial accounts reported on the delinquent FBARs and otherwise meets the requirements above . FBARs submitted under this option are not automatically subject to audit , but they may be selected for audit through the existing audit selection process . <p> Delinquent international information return submission procedureswill generally be available where a taxpayer does not need to use either Option 1 or Option 2 but has not filed one or more required international information returns ( e.g. , Forms 5471 , 5472 , 926 , etc. ) , has reasonable cause for not timely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil examination or a criminal investigation , and has not already been contacted by the IRS about the delinquent information returns .

The taxpayer must provide a statement of facts under penalties of perjury establishing reasonable cause and certify that any entity for which the information returns are being filed was not engaged in tax evasion . Information returns submitted under this option are not automatically subject to audit , but they may be selected for audit through the existing audit selection process .

@@1074744 <h> 5 Ways to Create a Sense of Belonging through Sponsorship <p> This blog post is the second part of a two-part series on intentional sponsorship , or dedicated efforts at a firm to ensure that everyone with leadership potential has access to a sponsor . <p> At HORNE , we launched a formal sponsorship program at our 525-person firm because we recognized first and foremost from a business case perspective , for us to be relevant in the future , we must develop a diverse leadership team . Collaboration , connecting and creativity require diverse leadership and we can not win with less than half the leadership talent . Failure to develop a diverse leadership team will limit our ability to grow , to attract great talent or to have a sustainable succession plan . We also estimated our tangible cost of our turnover at $3 million a year which includes recruiting , onboarding and training . We excluded the additional costs of lost knowledge and lost client relationships . <p> Beyond the business case , it really hit home to me personally and to our partners , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly showed that women and minorities were less likely to feel a strong sense of belonging or to have adequate access or information to increase their contribution to the firm or to reach their full potential . This lack of an equitable playing field was limiting our ability to sustain a diverse leadership team . <p> 1 . Focus on inclusion . To respond to these challenges , we launched our sponsorship and advocacy program in 2014 . We 've now have a total of three pilot groups ongoing . When introducing the program , we emphasized that it was a part of our effort to create an equitable playing field for all team members and foster a firm wide sense of belonging . <p> About 45 team members have been involved in the program , including people of both genders , of diverse backgrounds and all ages , although the primary focus is women and minorities . In the first two pilots , partners nominated high-potential team members , but in the third pilot we allowed people to self-nominate and attracted a wide range of applicants . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper exploration of their long-term career opportunities . Have they shown interest in developing into a well-rounded business person ? Do their developmental needs match what the program has to offer ? Do they understand HORNE business goals and the marketplace ? Are they willing to invest the necessary time and energy ? Do they have a real or immediate need to raise their visibility ? Some of these issues may not be pressing in their first or second year , but when they have supervisory or client responsibilities this may become more relevant . <p> 2 . Build a plan that meets your needs . Our program begins with a training session that covers everything the sponsor or team member needs to know , including why we 've undertaken the program and our expectations for each role . The sponsor and team member create a two-year plan that includes working on goals they form together based on the team member 's development or advancement needs . We recommend regular face-to-face meetings to discuss progress . <p> 3 . Understand the obstacles . Intentional sponsorship is challenging because it removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy schedules . In addition , the profession has traditionally evaluated certain success factors , such as chargeable time and utilization , and sponsorship does n't follow that established path . The solution is building a strong business case so that you can return to it if problems arise or the program drifts off course . We recognized unintentional bias as a big obstacle and with this program we began to intentionally limit its affect on our firm . <p> 4 . Consider results . After just a few months of the program , the first two pilot groups ' participants nearly unanimously reported having a much stronger sense of belonging and the ability to achieve their dreams . Our turnover is down 25% ( and will decline more this year ) due to a number of factors and our sponsorship program is playing a significant role . While we may not be able to point to the results on our balance sheet or income statement , when you consider the importance of diverse leadership and access to the full talent pool , the return on investment is obvious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our ultimate plan is to make sponsorship a natural effort that is just a part of how we define ourselves . Every single team member should have a sense of belonging and the opportunity to reach his or her full potential . Sponsorship is one of many ways we are working to ensure that happens . At HORNE we stress that it is each team member 's role to help others develop a strong sense of belonging . <p> Sponsorship is one of the many interesting topics that will be covered this year at the AICPA Women 's Global Leadership Summit , taking place in San Francisco , California on November 12 and 13 . Online attendance is also available . A new AICPA mentoring tool , accessible by all members , will be launched at the summit .

@@1074759 <h> Gifts to Trust Qualify for Annual Exclusion <p> The Tax Court held that the withdrawal rights provided in a trust declaration were not illusory and that therefore a married couple 's gifts to the trust were gifts of present interests in property that qualified for the annual exclusion . <h> Background <p> On June 7 , 2007 , Israel and Erna Mikel established the IEM Family Trust , an irrevocable inter vivos trust . The trust 's beneficiaries were the Mikels ' children and lineal descendants and their respective spouses . On June 15 , 2007 , the Mikels jointly transferred property to the trust with an asserted value of $3,262,000 . The trust at the time allegedly had 60 beneficiaries , many of whom were under 18 years of age . <p> For the year the trust was created and each subsequent year , Article V of the trust declaration allowed each of its beneficiaries to withdraw the lesser of a formula-derived amount or an amount equal to the maximum federal gift tax exclusion in effect at the time of the transfer . The trust was required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardians ) when it received property to which the beneficiaries had a demand right . The demand right was required to be exercised in writing and lapsed within 30 days . <p> In addition , Article VI of the trust declaration gave the trustees the power , " in their sole and absolute discretion , " to make discretionary distributions from income and principal for the health , education , maintenance , or support of any beneficiary or family member and , in the trustees ' " absolute and unreviewable discretion , " to assist a beneficiary in defraying " reasonable wedding costs , . . . purchasing a primary residence , or . . . entering a trade or profession . " <p> Article XXVI of the trust declaration provided that if any dispute arose concerning the proper interpretation of the distribution provision in Article VI , that the dispute " shall be submitted to arbitration before a panel consisting of three persons of the Orthodox Jewish faith " ( in Hebrew , a beth din ) . The beth din was directed , in the event of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party the rights he or she is entitled to under New York law and to construe the declaration as a whole " to effectuate the intent of the parties . . . that they have performed all the necessary requirements " for the trust declaration to be valid under Jewish law . <p> Further , Article XXVI of the trust declaration contained an in terrorem provision designed to discourage beneficiaries of the trust from contesting the trustees ' discretionary acts performed under Article VI . Under this provision , if a beneficiary did so , the provision in the trust for the beneficiary would be revoked and the beneficiary would be excluded from participating in the trust . <p> In October 2007 , the trust provided each beneficiary notice of his or her right of withdrawal and that this right would lapse after 30 days . <p> The Mikels timely filed a gift tax return for 2007 . On it , they reported gifts of assets appraised at $3,262,000 to the trust . The return indicated that the gifts were split gifts and claimed annual gift tax exclusions of $720,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 60 beneficiaries ) . After application of the Mikels ' lifetime unified credits , the returns showed no gift tax due on the transfers to the trust . <p> The IRS disagreed with the Mikels ' claims of the annual exclusion for the gifts to the trust and determined in separate notices of deficiency that the Mikels were ineligible for the exclusions . The Mikels each filed a petition with the Tax Court challenging the IRS 's determination , and the Tax Court consolidated their petitions for trial . <h> The Tax Court 's Decision <p> On a motion for summary judgment , the Tax Court held that the Mikels were entitled to the annual gift tax exclusion for their transfers of property to the trust . The court rejected the IRS 's argument that the annual exclusion was not available for the transfers because they were not gifts of a present interest in property . <p> In its opinion , the court first reviewed the annual gift tax exclusion and the requirements for a taxpayer to claim it for a gift . Under Sec. 2503 , an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as adjusted for inflation , was $12,000 in 2007 . However , the annual exclusion is available only for gifts of a present interest in property , which is defined in Regs . Sec. 25.2503-3(b) as " an unrestricted right to the immediate use , possession , or enjoyment of property or the income from property . " Also , per the regulations , no part of the value of a gift of a future interest may be excluded from taxable gifts . <p> With respect to a gift to a trust , the IRS will generally not contest that the gift is a valid gift of a present interest in property where the trust instrument gives the beneficiaries of the trust the power to demand immediate possession and enjoyment of principal or income of the trust . This is known as a Crummey power ( and trusts that contain such a power are known as Crummey trusts ) after the case in which this device was first approved , Crummey , 397 F.2d 82 ( 9th Cir. 1968 ) . <p> The court explained that despite following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will challenge annual exclusions if there was a prearranged understanding that the withdrawal right will not be exercised or that doing so would result in adverse consequences to its holder ( e.g. , losing other rights or gifts under the trust instrument or other beneficial arrangement ) . The IRS argued that in the Mikels ' case , the withdrawal right was illusory because any attempt to seek legal enforcement of that right would result in adverse consequences to its holder . <p> According to the IRS 's theory , the trustees might refuse , without legal basis , to honor a timely withdrawal demand . In that event , Article XXVI of the trust declaration would require the beneficiary to submit the dispute to a beth din . If the beth din , again without legal basis , sustained the trustees ' refusal to honor the demand , the beneficiary could seek redress in a New York court despite the general reluctance of a state court to disturb an arbitration decision . However , the IRS further contended that a beneficiary would be extremely reluctant to go to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beneficiary would forfeit all of his or her rights under the trust by going to court . Thus , as a practical result , the beneficiaries ' withdrawal rights were " illusory " and did not constitute a " present interest in property . " <p> The court observed that there were two problems with the IRS 's argument . First , if the trustees were to breach their fiduciary duties by refusing a timely withdrawal demand , a beneficiary could seek justice from a beth din , which was required to enforce the trust declaration and protect a beneficiary 's rights under state law . A beneficiary would not suffer the adverse consequences of the in -terrorem provision by submitting a claim to a beth din . Since a beth din was required to follow the rules in the trust declaration , there was no reason to believe that the beneficiary would have to take a dispute over his or her withdrawal rights to court . <p> The second problem the Tax Court cited was that the IRS misapprehended the in terrorem provision and gave it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , as the IRS suggested , apply to any case in which a beneficiary went to court to challenge a decision of the trustees , including a decision by the trustees not to honor a withdrawal demand . Rather , the provision , when read in context of the rest of the trust agreement , should be interpreted to apply only when a beneficiary went to court to dispute the trustee 's decision to make a discretionary distribution from the trust as the trustee had a right to do under Article VI . The court stated that this interpretation gave the in terrorem provision " a coherent meaning that is consistent with the provisions of article VI affording the trustees ' absolute and unreviewable discretion ' concerning such matters . " <h> Reflections <p> While the IRS has conceded that a gift to a trust with a valid Crummey power provision is a gift of a present interest , it has not given up the fight against this planning technique . This case makes clear that , even on fairly weak facts , it will not hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax benefits that giving a withdrawal provision to a beneficiary provides without actually taking the risk that a beneficiary will take advantage of the provision against the donor 's wishes . @qwx64575

For example , in 2014 , the Sec. 280F limit for trucks and vans that are subject to the passenger automobile limits is $3,460 , so the combined Sec. 179 expense and regular depreciation deductions for a truck or van purchased in 2014 can not exceed $3,460 . Taxpayers can take a Sec. 179 expense deduction for new and used vehicles . <p> Bonus depreciation:Under the bonus depreciation rules , an extra 50% depreciation deduction is allowed for qualifying property in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify for bonus depreciation if they are new vehicles that are used more than 50% for business and the taxpayer did not elect out of bonus depreciation . Under these rules , the depreciation limit for a passenger automobile that qualifies for bonus depreciation is increased by $8,000 for the first tax year . The $8,000 amount is not adjusted for inflation . <p> Interaction between the deductions : If a passenger automobile qualifies for the Sec. 179 expense deduction and bonus depreciation , and the taxpayer elects to apply both provisions in the year the passenger automobile is purchased , the taxpayer first determines the Sec. 179 expense deduction , next the bonus depreciation deduction , and then the regular depreciation deduction . The Sec. 179 expense deduction is calculated on the cost of the auto , the bonus depreciation deduction on its cost less the Sec. 179 expense deduction , and the regular depreciation amount on its cost less the Sec. 179 expenses deduction and the bonus depreciation deduction . However , the amount that is deducted can not exceed the Sec. 280F depreciation limit ( including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Example 2 : In 2014 , T purchased a new passenger automobile ( not a truck or van ) that she used 100% in her business that qualifies for both bonus depreciation and the Sec. 179 expense deduction . T made other purchases for her business that qualify for the Sec. 179 deduction during the year , and only has $5,000 left that she can take as a Sec. 179 expense deduction for the auto . The automobile cost $18,000 . <p> T 's Sec. 179 amount is $5,000 , the remaining amount available to take as a Sec. 179 deduction . Her bonus depreciation deduction is $6,500 ( 50% + $18,000 " $5,000 ) . Her regular depreciation deduction ( using the half-year convention ) is $1,300 . However , because of the Sec. 280F limit , she can only deduct in total $11,160 ( $3,160 + $8,000 ) of the $12,800 that is otherwise deductible . She therefore is allowed a Sec. 179 expense deduction of $5,000 , a bonus depreciation deduction of $6,160 , and no regular depreciation deduction for 2014 . In 2015 and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining $6,840 of the cost of the auto , subject to the Sec. 280F limits . <h> Sport Utility Vehicles <p> SUVs are considered trucks , so SUVs that are less than 6,000 pounds are subject to the Sec. 280F depreciation limits for trucks and vans . However , SUVs over 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight are not subject to the Sec. 280F limits . SUVs that fall into this category also qualify for the full amount of bonus depreciation allowed in the specific year . In addition , under Sec. 179(b) ( 5 ) , a Sec. 179 expense deduction of up to $25,000 can be taken for an SUV that is rated at more than 6,000 pounds but not more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight ( loaded ) . No depreciation or Sec. 179 limits apply to SUVs with gross vehicle weights over 14,000 pounds , but very few SUVs are that large . So even though SUVs are not the most practical business vehicles , it might be worth thinking about purchasing one for the depreciation benefits . An SUV over 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the weight limit that qualifies as a passenger automobile . <h> Trucks and Vans Over 6,000 Pounds <p> There is no limit on regular and bonus depreciation for trucks and vans that do not qualify as passenger automobiles . As with SUVs , the Sec. 179 expense deduction for trucks and vans rated at more than 6,000 pounds but not more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight ( loaded ) is $25,000 . However , the limit does not apply to trucks and vans in this weight class if the vehicle : <p> Is designed to have a seating capacity of more than nine persons behind the driver 's seat ; <p> Is equipped with a cargo area at least 6 feet in interior length that is an open area or is designed for use as an open area but is enclosed by a cap and is not readily accessible directly from the passenger compartment ; or <p> Has an integral enclosure , fully enclosing the driver compartment and load-carrying device , does not have seating behind the driver 's seat , and has no body section protruding more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windshield . <p> This means that no limits apply to the Sec. 179 expense deduction or bonus depreciation under Sec. 168(k) if one of these exceptions applies , which will allow many taxpayers to deduct the full cost of a vehicle in the year of purchase . Practitioners must be aware of these definitions to ensure that the Sec. 179 deduction limit is not improperly applied . <p> Example 3 : If a taxpayer purchases a new large pickup truck that has a bed over 6 feet in interior length for $60,000 in 2014 and uses it 100% for business , the business can claim a deduction for Sec. 179 depreciation and/or bonus depreciation of the full $60,000 in the year the vehicle was placed in service . <p> These rules are in place because most business vehicles are large trucks or vans , and the ability to purchase a vehicle and depreciate the entire cost in the first year to reduce the company 's or individual 's tax bill encourages business spending . Various websites and tax research products list vehicles over 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax consequences , accelerated depreciation on vehicles over the past few years has provided an incentive to make purchases . While the extension of the rules for bonus depreciation and the increased Sec. 179 expense deduction amounts are useful , it would be helpful if these rules were also made permanent for 2015 and future years , giving certainty to taxpayers and practitioners and helping the U.S. economy to continue to recover by encouraging capital investment . <h> Reflections <p> Although there has been no recent discussion about this , Congress should consider making an upward revision to the Sec. 280F limit amounts or changing the rules regarding which vehicles are subject to the limits . Because there is a very real incentive for business owners to abuse the cost recovery rules by purchasing vehicles that are either larger or more luxurious than warranted by business needs , having limits is appropriate . However , the current low levels at which the limits are set and their applicability to almost all vehicles under 6,000 pounds make the limits overbroad , causing them to apply to many vehicles that are purchased for legitimate business reasons . @qwx64575 
@@1074771 <h> Removing Capital Gains From Trusts <p> With more assets held in trust and higher marginal tax rates , many clients and advisers are now considering distributions from trusts to beneficiaries as a way to shift the tax burden to individuals in lower tax brackets. - However , under the traditional definition of fiduciary accounting income ( FAI ) , capital gains are typically excluded from distributable net income ( DNI ) and , thus , are taxed at the trust level. - <p> The implementation of the Uniform Principal and Income Act of 1997 ( UPAIA ) and the 2004 revisions to the regulations under Sec. 643 have provided fiduciaries with some flexibility in making distributions of capital gains to beneficiaries . Tax advisers should understand the options available under state law , including the " power to adjust " and " unitrust " provisions , and how those provisions intersect with Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3 . Additionally , advisers should consider the grantor trust rules and how they may provide further options for income shifting . <h> Background <p> FAI , also referred to as trust accounting income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Although it is not a tax concept , FAI is important in determining whether the fiduciary or beneficiaries pay tax on the trust 's income . When the Internal Revenue Code refers to " income , " the reference is to the definition of FAI in the governing instrument and applicable local law ( Sec. 643(b) ) . <p> If the governing instrument is silent as to the treatment of capital gains for FAI purposes , the fiduciary should look to applicable local law . Currently , 46 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of the 1997 UPAIA ( see RIA Checkpoint , " List of States Following One of the Revised Uniform Principal and Income Acts , " Table T309 ) . Three states ( Georgia , Illinois , and Louisiana ) currently operate under the 1962 UPAIA . Rhode Island has not adopted any form of the UPAIA . The UPAIA typically allocates money or property received from the sale , exchange , or liquidation of an asset to principal ( UPAIA -404 ) . For fiduciary accounting purposes , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception . <p> However , the UPAIA was adopted in part to update the current income and principal rules to reflect the concept of total return investing , which includes the gain or loss that the asset realizes . Total return " encourages investors to seek the highest overall return ( given a certain risk tolerance and within the bounds of prudent investing ) , without being needlessly hampered by how that return is created " ( Lee , Implementing Total Return Trusts , p. 4 ( 2003 ) ) . For trusts with a payout to a current beneficiary based on income , a fiduciary relying on total return investing ( particularly in the -current low-yield environment ) may not generate sufficient cash from sources typically considered income , such as interest and dividends , thus inadvertently reducing the payout due to the income beneficiary . <p> Example 1 : A Trust is a marital trust required to distribute all income to the surviving spouse , B , during his life , with the remainder to the decedent 's children . The governing instrument is silent regarding treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 UPAIA . The trustee invests for total return with a 70/30 allocation between equities and fixed income . In 2014 , the trust has $10,000 of dividend income and $25,000 of realized long-term capital gain income . FAI is $10,000 , which is the total amount the fiduciary should distribute to B for 2014 . The trust receives an income distribution deduction of $10,000 , and the remaining $25,000 of capital gain income is taxed to the trust since capital gains are generally excluded from DNI and are unavailable for distribution to any beneficiary ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(a) ) . <h> The Problem <p> Given that the top marginal tax rate of 39.6% and the 3.8% net investment income tax apply to estates and trusts with taxable income in excess of only $12,150 in 2014 ( not to mention state income taxes ) , the tax impact of retaining capital gains in a trust can be severe . In Example 1 , $12,850 of long-term capital gains will be subject to a total federal tax rate of 23.8% ( 20% top marginal long-term capital gains rate plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a lower tax bracket and not subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax , what options does a fiduciary have to minimize tax on undistributed capital gains ? <h> The Regulations <p> Generally , capital gains are excluded from DNI to the extent they are allocated to corpus and are not paid , credited , or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the tax year ( Sec. 643(a) ( 3 ) ) . However , Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(b) allows capital gains to be included in DNI to the extent authorized by the governing instrument and local law or pursuant to a reasonable and impartial exercise of discretion by the fiduciary if one of three exceptions applies . <h> Exception 1 : Allocated to Income <p> Capital gains actually allocated to income per the governing instrument or a reasonable and impartial exercise of discretion by the fiduciary may be included in DNI ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(b) ( 1 ) ) . In this exception , either through the governing instrument or through a power provided under state law , capital gains are allocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beneficiary . Clearly , if the governing instrument allows for capital gains to be allocated to income , then the fiduciary has the power to do so , but what if this is an older document ? What options are available to the fiduciary ? <p> Power to adjust:Section 104 of the UPAIA provides the fiduciary with the " power to adjust " between income and principal to ensure a fair result for all beneficiaries . For states that have adopted it , a fiduciary may use a power to adjust if the fiduciary invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor , the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed by referring to the trust 's income , and the trustee exercises the power to adjust impartially and based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries . <p> In Example 1 , the trustee might have originally allocated the portfolio 20% to equities and 80% to fixed income . However , the trustee determines that a 70/30 equity/fixed-income portfolio allocation is more in line with the trust 's investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less FAI , which negatively affects B. Under the power to adjust granted by the UPAIA , the trustee of A Trust may transfer a portion of the capital gain receipts from principal to income , to the extent he or she impartially determines it is necessary to ensure fairness among B and the children . ( This example is adapted from Example ( 1 ) of the comments to UPAIA -104 . ) The trustee reallocates all or a portion of the $25,000 of capital gains to income , and once they are included in income , the capital gains would be required to be distributed to B under the terms of the trust agreement . <p> However , the tax treatment of this adjustment is unclear . Citing the numerous potential variations in circumstances and applicable state law , the IRS has declined to include any examples illustrating the tax treatment of including capital gains in DNI pursuant to a power of adjustment ( preamble to T.D . 9102 ) . Additionally , the IRS noted that it agrees " the power does not have to be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impartially . " This comment and the lack of other guidance in the examples suggest that consistent treatment is not required when exercising a power to adjust . <p> For trusts that do not have discretionary power to distribute principal , the trustee should generally be able to rely on the power to adjust to shift capital gains to income and include them in DNI . However , taking another look at the A Trust example , if the trust provides the trustee discretion to make distributions to B for health , maintenance , and support , then the power to adjust might be exercised independently of realized capital gains . This would suggest that the discretionary power to adjust has no effect on the amount of the distribution . In this case , such a power , similar to a unitrust , will be respected for tax purposes only to the extent the discretionary power is exercised consistently . <p> Given the uncertainty in tax treatment and the fact that the power to adjust fundamentally alters the amounts allocated to each class of beneficiaries , the exercise of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the desired tax result . Fiduciaries looking to use a power to adjust to include capital gains in DNI should consider several issues , including , most importantly , whether it makes economic sense , applicable state law , whether the practice must be applied consistently , and the lack of IRS guidance . Depending on the amount involved , a trustee may wish to seek a private letter ruling . <p> Unitrust provision : An alternative to the power to adjust is the use of a state unitrust statute . While the IRS declined to provide any examples illustrating the power to adjust , it did provide several examples of the application of a unitrust statute . Unitrusts are not addressed by the UPAIA but exist under state law . However , they generally allow a fiduciary to calculate the trust 's income as a percentage of the trust 's assets as of either the beginning of the year or averaged over some period . A unitrust provision is consistent with total return investing and can ease the administrative burden on a client , since calculating a percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Example 2 : The facts are the same as in Example 1 , except that the state law governing A Trust allows for a conversion to a unitrust . The trustee relies on state law and elects to convert to a 4% unitrust based on the trust 's value as of the beginning of the year . Assuming A Trust is worth $500,000 at the beginning of the year , the trust 's income equals $20,000 ( $500,000 + 4% ) . B is to receive the income from the trust , which , following the conversion to a unitrust , is now $20,000 rather than the previously calculated $10,000 . <p> Treatment for tax purposes depends on whether the governing instrument or the state 's unitrust provision has an ordering rule for the character of the unitrust amount . If the state provides for the order from which the unitrust should first be considered paid ( typically , from the highest-taxed income first , followed by a return of principal , similar to the federal tax rules for a charitable remainder trust ) , then B will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income and $10,000 of long-term capital gain income ( see Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(e) , Example ( 11 ) ) . If neither the state statute nor the governing instrument provides for an ordering rule but , rather , leaves that determination to the trustee 's discretion , then capital gains can be distributed to the beneficiary , assuming the trustee follows a consistent and regular practice of including capital gains in the unitrust distribution to the extent the unitrust exceeds ordinary and tax-exempt income ( id. , Example ( 13 ) ) . <p> The major disadvantage of this approach is that A Trust still has taxable capital gain income subject to the top marginal rate and net investment income tax . While it enables the fiduciary to shift some taxable income to the beneficiary , a unitrust provision may not enable complete income shifting , and in states with no ordering rule , the decision to include capital gains in DNI must be exercised consistently every year . However , there is some concern with the other options as to whether the fiduciary can adopt a consistent practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9102 notes that " in implementing a different method for determining income under a state statute , the trustee may establish a pattern for including or not including capital gains in DNI . " This ability to select a new consistent method regardless of the trustee 's prior treatment is a major benefit of adopting a unitrust over alternative options . <h> Exception No. 2 : Allocated to Corpus but Consistently Treated as Part of a Distribution <p> Capital gains allocated to corpus but treated consistently by the fiduciary on the trust 's books , records , and tax returns as part of a distribution to a beneficiary may be included in DNI ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(b) ( 2 ) ) . In the A Trust example , the trustee has discretionary power to distribute principal to B for health , maintenance , and support . After calculating FAI of $10,000 per Example 1 , the trustee distributes $10,000 of income plus , at his or her discretion , an additional $25,000 of principal to B. Assuming the trustee intends to follow a regular practice of treating discretionary distributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains realized by A Trust during the year , the trustee can treat the $25,000 principal distribution as consisting of the capital gains and include it in DNI ( see Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(e) , Example ( 2 ) ) . However , the trustee must continue to treat principal distributions as coming from realized capital gains for all future years . <p> The consistent practice is adopted during the trust 's initial tax year ( id. , Example ( 1 ) ) . For new trusts , this is not an issue , since the capital gains could be included in DNI under this exception , with the limitation that the fiduciary must continue to do so going forward . ( Given the uncertainty of future tax rates for both the trust and beneficiaries , this decision should not be taken lightly . ) However , will older trusts be allowed to adopt a new consistent practice , particularly following new tax legislation ? A commentator on the IRS 's proposed net investment income tax regulations asked this question , and the IRS indicated that the final net investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new consistent practice going forward ( preamble to T.D . 9644 ) . Existing trusts for which the statute of limitation has expired on prior tax returns will likely be unable to adopt a new methodology despite the subsequent creation of tax rules that were not contemplated when the initial tax return was prepared . <h> Exception No. 3 : Allocated to Corpus but Actually Distributed <p> Capital gains may also be included in DNI when they are allocated to corpus but actually distributed to the beneficiary or used by the fiduciary in determining the amount that is distributed or required to be distributed to a beneficiary ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(b) ( 3 ) ) . A fiduciary could distribute capital gains to a beneficiary when relying on this regulation in a couple of different scenarios . <p> First , the trust can actually distribute the capital gains to the beneficiary . This exception is valuable in situations such as an age-attainment trust , where specific proportions of the trust are distributed at certain ages of a beneficiary . For example , a trust whose governing instrument provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the remainder distributed at age 45 sells one-half of its assets and distributes the proceeds to the beneficiary at age 35 . All or a portion of the capital gain distributed to the beneficiary is included in DNI since it is actually distributed ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(e) , Examples ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) . <p> This approach has limited utility , as the regulation examples focus solely on mandatory principal distributions and situations when the proceeds of a specific asset are to be distributed to a beneficiary . The IRS has noted that in this circumstance , " the inclusion of capital gains in DNI applies only where there is a distribution required by the terms of the governing instrument upon the happening of a specified event " ( Rev. Rul. 68-392 ) . Furthermore , the exception in the regulation does not seem to apply when the trust has sufficient cash to fund its required principal distribution . <p> Second , the trust can use the amount of capital gains in determining the amount distributed to the beneficiary . In Example 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficiary based on the trust 's realized capital gains . If the trustee of A Trust decides that discretionary distributions will be made to the extent the trust has realized capital gains , then the trustee would distribute $35,000 to B and include the full $25,000 of capital gains in DNI ( see Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(e) , Example ( 5 ) ) . However , the IRS commentary on the regulations ( preamble to T.D . 9102 ) notes that it is rare for a trust to consider recognized capital gains in determining the amount to be distributed , suggesting that Example ( 5 ) of the regulations has limited applicability . <p> Typically , the amount distributable to the beneficiary is determined without regard to the amount of capital gains realized during the year . Furthermore , money is fungible , and it may be difficult to determine the source of the funds actually distributed to the beneficiary . For trusts with discretionary power to distribute principal , unless the trustee consistently uses realized capital gains in determining the amount distributable to the beneficiary , it is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two exceptions in requiring a consistent methodology adopted in the first year of the trust . The regulations do not specifically state that consistency is required ; however , the key seems to hinge on whether the trustee has discretion over allocating capital gains to DNI . Any discretionary power to include capital gains in DNI seems to require a consistent exercise . <p> Another consideration when applying exception No. 3 is the ordering rule for capital losses . Generally , any capital losses will first be netted against capital gains at the trust level ( Regs . Sec. 1.643(a)-3(d) ) . Any net remaining capital gains are available for inclusion in DNI . However , netting does not apply when capital gains are distributed under the third exception ; rather , the distributed capital gains are taxed to the beneficiary prior to netting . Trusts with capital losses must consider this rule when planning capital gain distributions . <h> Grantor Trusts <p> Perhaps the regulations are not even necessary if the trust or part of the trust is treated as a grantor trust . In the case of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and credits including capital gains attributable to the grantor portion of the trust are taxed to the grantor . For example , in the case of the age-attainment trust described above , assume instead that the beneficiary does not withdraw his one-half principal distribution at age 35 . Under Sec. 678(a) , the beneficiary has the power to vest the corpus and income of one-half of the trust in himself , so the beneficiary is treated as the owner of one-half of the trust . The trustee would file a partial grantor trust tax return including one-half of the income and one-half of realized capital gains on a grantor information letter to the beneficiary and prepare Form 1041 , U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts , under the normal subchapter J rules for the remaining one-half of the trust . If distributions are made from the trust , then it is possible that the beneficiary would receive both a grantor information letter and a Schedule K-1 . <p> Trusts with " Crummey " powers or " 5 and 5 " powers are also subject to Sec. 678(a) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a power held by the trust beneficiary to vest a portion of the principal for a specified period of time , typically 30 to 60 days . During the withdrawal period , the beneficiary is treated as owner of the portion of the trust over which he or she has the right of withdrawal , plus any related income and realized capital gains ( Letter Ruling 8521060 ) . <p> Under a " 5 and 5 " power , the beneficiary has the right to withdraw up to the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the trust assets each year . The IRS has ruled that the beneficiary will be treated as the owner under Sec. 678(a) ( 1 ) , until the power is exercised , released , or lapses , over the portion of the trust subject to the withdrawal power . If the withdrawal power is not exercised , the beneficiary is treated as if he or she released a power to withdraw and will be treated as the owner under Sec. 678(a) ( 2 ) . Each year of an unexercised power will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's corpus ( Letter Ruling 9541029 ) . While this section can produce unintended tax results , it can also facilitate shifting capital gains to a beneficiary in a lower tax bracket . <p> Obviously , the application of the grantor trust rules is specific to the governing instrument and trust history . However , these rules are often overlooked and can often solve the issue of capital gains taxed at the fiduciary level . Under Sec. 678(b) , any other grantor trust power trumps grantor treatment under Sec. 678(a) . For example , if a trust were grantor with respect to the settlor because he or she possessed a power of substitution under Sec. 675 , then the trust would be a grantor trust with respect to the settlor rather than beneficiaries holding a Crummey power . <h> Conclusion <p> Although this item focuses on minimizing income tax , there are numerous nontax issues to consider , such as spendthrift protection , estate inclusion , asset protection , and balancing the competing interests of beneficiaries . While forcing out distributions or grantor trust status may produce the desired income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subject assets to the claims of creditors . Additionally , the many limitations of the regulations have been noted above . If the regulations do not provide the fiduciary sufficient flexibility to distribute capital gains from an existing trust , it is appropriate to consider whether a trust amendment or decanting could be used to add the necessary administrative language to the governing instrument . Lastly , for newly drafted governing instruments , it is appropriate to consider whether the document will provide the fiduciary the flexibility needed to distribute capital gains and minimize income tax . <p> The author gives special thanks to Damon Rose , director of Wealth Management Tax Services at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , for his assistance . <p> EditorNotes <p> Anthony Bakale is with Cohen &amp; Co .

@@1074789 <h> Understanding How Corporate Dividends Are Taxed to Shareholders <p> Shareholders recognize a taxable dividend to the extent a distribution is paid out of corporate earnings and profits ( E&amp;P ) . If the distribution exceeds E&amp;P , the excess reduces the shareholder 's stock basis . Any amount in excess of the shareholder 's stock basis is capital gain ( Secs . 301(b) ( 1 ) and ( c ) ) . The amount of the distribution is decreased ( but not below zero ) by liabilities assumed by the shareholder ( e.g. , a mortgage on a distributed piece of real estate ) . <p> The tax rates for qualified dividends are ( 1 ) 0% for taxpayers with a marginal tax rate on ordinary income of 10% or 15% ; ( 2 ) 15% for taxpayers with a marginal tax rate on ordinary income of 25% or greater whose taxable income falls below the levels for the 39.6% regular tax rate ( 2014 inflation-adjusted $457,600 for married filing jointly , $406,750 for single filers , and $228,800 for married filing separately ) ; and ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Individuals with modified adjusted gross income above a certain threshold ( $250,000 for married filing jointly , $200,000 for single filers , and $125,000 for married filing separately ) may also owe the 3.8% net investment income tax ( Sec. 1411 ) . Net investment income includes dividends less expenses properly allocable to the dividends . This means that the tax rate applicable to a redemption taxed as a nonliquidating corporate distribution ( taxable dividend to the extent of the corporation 's E&amp;P ) may actually be 18.8% ( 15% + 3.8% ) or 23.8% ( 20% + 3.8% ) . <h> Taxation of Cash Dividends <p> A cash distribution to a shareholder is a taxable dividend to the extent of the corporation 's current or accumulated E&amp;P . If the current E&amp;P equals or exceeds the amount of the distribution , it is a fully taxable dividend to the shareholder even if the corporation has negative accumulated E&amp;P ( Regs . Sec. 1.316-1(a) ) . In other words , if there is sufficient current E&amp;P to cover all distributions made during the year , all distributions are taxable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's E&amp;P balance , but not below zero . <h> Taxation of Noncash Dividends <p> When property ( rather than cash ) is distributed , the amount of the dividend equals the fair market value ( FMV ) of the property on the date of the distribution , reduced by any liabilities assumed by the recipient or to which the property is subject ( Sec. 301(b) ) . In addition , as is the case with cash dividends , the distribution must be from current or accumulated E&amp;P to be classified as a dividend . The recipient shareholder 's basis in appreciated property received in a distribution equals the property 's FMV ( Sec. 301(d) ) . The shareholder 's holding period begins on the date of distribution . <p> In January 2009 , the IRS released proposed regulations that provide comprehensive guidance on the recovery of stock basis in distributions under Sec. 301 , along with guidance on the resulting gain and the basis of stock or securities received ( see Prop . Regs . Sec. 1.302-5 ) . The regulations are designed to harmonize the tax treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single model for Sec. 301 ( dividend equivalent ) distributions and a single model for Sec. 302(a) sale or exchange ( nondividend equivalent ) transactions , regardless of whether Sec. 301 or 302(a) applies . Consistent with the premise that a share of stock is the basic unit of property that can be disposed of , the proposed regulations would , for example , treat a Sec. 301 dividend equivalent distribution as received on a pro rata , share-by-share basis with respect to the class of stock upon which the distribution is made . <h> Taxation of Stock Dividends <p> Distributions of a C corporation 's own stock to its shareholders ( stock dividends ) are generally tax-free to the recipient shareholders ( Sec. 305(a) ) . The term " stock " includes rights to acquire such stock . Tax-free treatment apparently applies to unissued and treasury stock , as well as common , preferred , voting , or nonvoting stock . Despite this general rule , stock dividends can be taxable if ( Sec. 305(b) ) : <p> Shareholders have an option to receive cash or other property instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and others receive stock and increase their proportionate ownership ; <p> Some shareholders receive preferred stock while others receive common stock ; <p> Shareholders receive distributions with respect to preferred stock ; or <p> Shareholders receive distributions of convertible preferred stock . <p> If a shareholder has stock redemption rights at a time when a stock dividend is declared , this may be construed as an option to receive cash or other property , which could render the stock dividend taxable ( see Rev. Ruls. 83-68 and 90-98 ; however , in IRS Letter Ruling 9709044 , the IRS concluded that the shareholders ' ongoing right of redemption did not result in a stock split 's being taxed to the shareholders ) . <p> If a shareholder receives a taxable stock dividend , the amount of the dividend is the FMV of the stock ( Regs . Sec. 1.305-1(b) ) . This FMV becomes the basis of the new stock to the shareholder . <p> The following are considered distributions of stock ( i.e. , stock dividends ) : <p> Distribution of rights to acquire stock of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bargain purchase of additional stock of the corporation by a shareholder to the extent of the excess of the value of the shares over the consideration paid ( Rev. Rul. 68-43 ) ; and <p> Reduction of par value of stock accompanied by a reduction in the amount due from shareholders on their stock subscriptions ( Whiting , T.C. Memo . 1984-142 ) . <p> If stock distributions do not result in taxable income to the shareholders , E&amp;P is not reduced . E&amp;P is reduced only if the shareholders have taxable income ( Sec. 312(d) ( 1 ) ) . <p> If the new stock is identical to the old stock , the basis of the old stock is reallocated to both the old and new stock ( Regs . Sec. 1.307-1 ) . If the new stock is not identical to the old stock ( e.g. , preferred stock distributed for shares of common stock ) , the basis of the old stock is allocated between the old and new stock based on their respective share of the total FMV of both types of stock . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period as the old stock ( Sec. 1223(4) ) . <h> Taxation of Constructive Dividends <p> Corporations sometimes enter into transactions that are not typically dividends but may be considered so by the IRS . The following are examples of potential constructive dividends : <p> Payments made to others for the personal benefit of the shareholder ; <p> Payments to family members of shareholders ; <p> Excessive compensation/purported loans to shareholders ; <p> Loans to shareholders at " below-market " interest rates ; <p> Improvements to shareholders ' property ; and <p> Bargain purchases of corporate property/free use of corporate property by a shareholder . <p> Constructive dividends do not have to be declared formally or designated as a dividend . They need not be paid pro rata to all shareholders . Legally , they do not even have to be a dividend under state law ; all that is required is a finding by the IRS that a shareholder received some benefit from the corporation . From a tax point of view , there is no difference between a formal dividend and a constructive dividend . <h> Distributions After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations are treated as dividends to the extent of the corporation 's current or accumulated earnings and profits ( AE&amp;P ) . However , a special rule provides relief to the shareholders of a corporation that has terminated its S corporation status . During the post-termination transition period ( PTTP ) , any distribution of money by the corporation to its shareholders is first applied to reduce the basis of the shareholder 's stock to the extent the distribution does not exceed the corporation 's accumulated adjustments account ( AAA ) ( Sec. 1371(e) ( 1 ) ) . Generally speaking , the PTTP begins on the day after the last day of the final S corporation tax year and ends on the later of one year later or the due date , including extensions , of that year 's tax return . <p> Example : H Inc. terminates its S election on Dec. 31 , 2014 . On that date , it has $21,000 in AAA and $12,000 in E&amp;P . ( The AAA represents undistributed net income that has been passed through and taxed at the shareholder level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholder without causing additional shareholder-level tax . ) J , the sole shareholder , has stock basis of $30,000 when the S election terminates . <p> Nontaxable cash distributions up to the amount of the ending AAA balance ( $21,000 ) can be made to J during the PTTP " in this case the one-year period following revocation of the S election . This is true even though H is in C status and distributions would normally be distributions of AE&amp;P . The distributions reduce H 's AAA balance and J 's stock basis . <p> The PTTP represents a last chance to bail previously taxed cash and basis out of the corporation in a tax-free manner . When a corporation has terminated or will terminate its S status , a distribution eliminating the previously taxed AAA should be considered , either in the final S corporation year or during the PTTP . However , the PTTP allows access only to AAA . If a distribution during the PTTP exceeds AAA , it first is considered from current C corporation E&amp;P before being allowed as a return of stock basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Federal income tax law governs how corporate payments to or for the benefit of shareholders are taxed for federal income tax purposes . However , state corporation statutes govern the property rights of a corporation 's shareholders and creditors . Although applicable state corporation law and the federal income tax rules are sometimes compatible , they do not necessarily yield identical results . For example , state law generally requires that dividends be declared by the board of directors . Also , dividends may be allowed only if the corporation has a positive net worth . <p> For federal income tax purposes , state-law formalities are irrelevant . For example , a nonliquidating distribution paid by a C corporation to a shareholder will generally be a taxable dividend to the extent of the corporation 's E&amp;P , whether or not the distribution meets the state-law definition of a dividend . On the other hand , a corporate distribution might not be a taxable dividend for federal income tax purposes , even if it is designated as a dividend for state-law purposes . @qwx64575 
@@1074796 <h> Election to Treat Qualified Revocable Trust as an Estate and the Separate-Share Rules <p> A qualified revocable trust ( QRT ) is any trust ( or part of a trust ) that was treated as owned by a decedent ( on that decedent 's date of death ) by reason of a power to revoke that was exercisable by the decedent ( without regard to whether the power was held by the decedent 's spouse ) . Although many practitioners are familiar with the special election to treat a QRT as an estate under Sec. 645 , they may not be aware that this election can result in some complicated accounting and tax consequences as well as some interesting tax planning opportunities because of the separate-share rules . This item outlines the mechanics of the election and the treatment of items under the separate-share rules . <p> Most people seek the benefits of a revocable living trust ( RLT ) to avoid probate , though the RLT can afford additional benefits not covered in this discussion . When a grantor of an RLT dies , the RLT becomes irrevocable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form 1041 , U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts ) to report trust income earned after death . Trusts are required to use a calendar year end , no matter when the tax year begins . <p> In some instances , the decedent may not have been diligent about retitling assets into the RLT and may end up with a probate estate . The probate estate would have to file a separate income tax return ( Form 1041 ) to report estate income earned after death . An estate may use a fiscal year end of its choosing , not to exceed a one-year period after death . <p> Example : A person dies Feb. 10 , 2013 " the estate can choose to end its fiscal year at the end of any month after death , including , but not after , Jan. 31 , 2014 . <p> Most RLTs are QRTs because the grantor retained the right to revoke the trust . When the decedent has both a QRT and a probate estate , the Sec. 645 election allows the trustee and the executor to effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filed as an estate . Further , even if there is no separate probate estate , this election can be used to file the trust return ( or several separate QRTs ) as though the trust were an estate . Note that this election is valid for only two years following the decedent 's date of death , so the practitioner must also consider the anticipated length of trust and/or estate administration before making the election . <p> In making the election , certain tax planning advantages are gained by filing as an estate , rather than as a trust : <p> The material participation requirement for the passive loss rules is waived ( i.e. , participation is treated as active ) ; <p> The charitable set-aside deduction under Sec. 642(c) is allowed ; <p> The estate may use a fiscal year end and possibly defer income to a future tax year ; and <p> Use of the fiscal year end may allow enough time to file only one tax return and finalize matters efficiently . <h> Separate-Share Rules Can Create Surprises <p> The tax return for a Sec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of reporting the income and expenses on the Form 1041 tax return . However , for purposes of calculating the distributable net income ( DNI ) deduction , the trust and estate are treated as separate shares ( Regs . Sec. 1.645-1(e) ( 2 ) ( iii ) ) . Under these rules , the distributions made from the estate and the trust can result in different allocations to beneficiaries and different amounts of income tax paid by the estate/trust . <p> Example : The estate has $10,000 of income , and the executor made zero distributions to the trust , which is the sole beneficiary of the estate . The trust has $20,000 of income and made a $30,000 distribution to Beneficiary A. Total income reported on Form 1041 is $30,000 . <p> DNI is calculated separately for the estate and the trust . The estate share of DNI is $10,000 , but the DNI deduction is zero because there were no distributions in the tax year . The trust share of DNI is $20,000 , and the DNI deduction is the lesser of the total cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the actual cash distributed , the DNI deduction is limited to $20,000 . The Form 1041 will recognize $10,000 of taxable income and tax will be paid accordingly , and Beneficiary A will report $20,000 of income on his personal income tax return . <p> If the estate instead distributes $10,000 to the trust , then the trust 's share of income is $30,000 ( $20,000 plus the $10,000 from the estate ) . In this case , the entire $30,000 of income is DNI of the trust , and the $30,000 distribution to Beneficiary A results in all $30,000 of income being reported to Beneficiary A with no tax at the trust level . <p> In summary , making the Sec. 645 election may be advantageous for the trust . However , the executor and the trustee should be aware that combining the two entities for tax reporting does not mean the two entities are combined for calculating the DNI deduction . Separate accounting for each entity should be maintained during the period of administration to follow the separate-share rules for the estate and trust , accordingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Gray LLP , in Westwood , Mass . <p> For additional information about these items , contact Mr. Koppel at 781-407-0300 or mkoppel@gggcpas.com . <p> Unless otherwise noted , contributors are members of or associated with CPAmerica International . @qwx64575 
@@1074803 <h> Electing S Corporation Status for a Limited Liability Company <p> In some situations , business owners have state-law reasons for wanting their business to be formed as a limited liability company ( LLC ) , but for tax purposes they would prefer S corporation ( rather than partnership ) tax treatment . For example , S corporation status may be desired because a partner in a partnership is subject to self-employment tax on his or her distributive share of the partnership 's trade or business income , while an S corporation owner is not subject to self-employment tax on his or her passthrough income or distributions from the S corporation . <p> An LLC can elect under the check-the-box rules to be classified as a corporation . If the LLC makes the election it is deemed to ( 1 ) transfer all of its assets and liabilities to the corporation in exchange for the corporation 's stock and then ( 2 ) distribute the stock to its owners in complete liquidation ( Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(g) ( 1 ) ) . The deemed transfer to the corporation is tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities do not exceed the basis of its assets . The LLC can then elect S status , assuming that its members are eligible to hold S corporation stock ( Regs . Secs . 1.1361-1(c) and 301.7701-3 ) . <p> The entity normally files the election to be taxed as a corporation on Form 8832 , Entity ClassificationElection , in accordance with Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) . However , if an LLC that is eligible to elect S status timely files an S election ( Form 2553 ) , the entity is considered to have elected to be taxed as a corporation ( Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) ( 1 ) ( v ) ( C ) ) . This means that the entity does not have to file the Form 8832 if it timely and properly elects S status . <p> Under Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) , the effective date of the classification election specified on Form 8832 can not be more than 75 days before the date on which the election is filed and can not be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retroactive for up to 75 days before the entity files Form 8832 . Under S corporation rules , however , a newly formed corporation must file the S election on or before the 15th day of the third month following the corporation 's activation date , which is the earliest date that the corporation has shareholders , acquires assets , or begins conducting business . <p> If the entity plans to elect to be treated as a corporation and become an S corporation on the same date , only Form 2553 is filed , and it should conform to S corporation rules . The authors recommend that the entity file the Form 2553 by the earlier of 75 days or two months and 15 days after the date the S election is to become effective . In this way , the entity will have filed Form 2553 within both the Form 8832 and Form 2553 filing limits . <p> Planning tip : An LLC that elects to be treated as a corporation and become an S corporation on the same date is not required to do so on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be retroactive or prospective within the time limits surrounding the date the LLC files Form 2553 , as outlined above . Allowing an LLC to make a midyear S election makes sense because a newly electing S corporation can begin its first S year at any allowable date . To conform to S corporation rules , however , the authors recommend that the effective date of the S election should not occur before the earliest date that the LLC has members , acquires assets , or begins conducting business . <p> An entity that makes the deemed election to be taxed as a corporation by filing the S election , Form 2553 , will be classfied as a corporation on the date the S election is effective and will continue to be treated as a corporation until it makes an other entity classification ( Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) ( 1 ) ( v ) ( C ) ) . If an entity elects to change its classification , it can not do so again during the 60 months after the effective date of the election without the IRS 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iv ) ) . <p> Since no actual incorporation takes place and no shares are issued , how does an LLC complete the S election Form 2553 ? While the instructions offer some guidance , they do not divulge how an LLC shows the effective date or state of incorporation . It would seem , the authors recommend that a copy of the Form 8832 be attached to the Form 2553 , along with a statement that the entity has made the check-the-box election and is now making the S election . If the LLC has not filed Form 8832 , the effective date of the S election could be entered . The instructions say that the number-of-shares and date-acquired sections of Form 2553 should show each individual 's percentage of ownership and the date(s) acquired . <p> If the LLC does not file Form 8832 , the authors recommend that a statement be attached to the Form 2553 that the entity is electing to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation under Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) ( 1 ) ( v ) ( C ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013-30 , the IRS updated and consolidated the procedures for requesting relief when taxpayers miss the deadline for making a number of S corporation-related elections , including the election to be treated as an S corporation under Sec. 1362(a) and the election to treat an eligible entity as a corporation under Regs . Sec. 301.7701-3(c) ( 1 ) ( v ) ( C ) so that it can elect to be treated as an S corporation . The relief available under Rev. Proc. 2013-30 is in lieu of requesting relief via the letter ruling process , and user fees are not charged . <h> Electing S Status by LLC Treated as Partnership <p> When an eligible entity classified as a partnership elects to be treated as a corporation ( or converts into a corporation under a state-law conversion statute ) , the partnership is treated as contributing all of its assets and liabilities to the corporation in exchange for stock . It is also considered to have liquidated by distributing the corporation 's stock to its partners immediately before the close of the day before the election is effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , the deemed contribution and liquidation are treated as if they occurred immediately before the close of the previous tax year . If the corporation makes a timely S corporation election for its first year , the corporation will be an S corporation for that year , and there will be no intervening period during which the entity was a C corporation ( Rev. Rul. 2009-15 ) . <p> Planning tip:Partners may want to incorporate their partnership to obtain personal liability protection and ensure the business 's continuity . If S corporation status is elected , the business can continue to pass through its gains and losses to the owners . Because of the S corporation passthrough rules , however , special allocations will not be allowed . <h> Potential One-Class-of-Stock Issues <p> When an LLC elects S status , it is imperative that its operating agreement and other documents conform to the S corporation eligibility requirements . Any prior documents based on the LLC 's treatment as a partnership must be amended or replaced . If , for example , the LLC 's operating agreement allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to members , the LLC is not eligible to be treated as an S corporation because it would be considered to have more than one class of stock . ( An S corporation has one class of stock only if all outstanding shares ( which , in the case of an LLC , would be membership interests ) confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds . Differences in voting rights are ignored . ) Allocations based on anything other than percentage of ownership breach the one-class-of-stock rule and are not allowable in an S corporation . <p> S corporation shareholders must be of the same class , except for the ability to hold voting and nonvoting shares . The operating agreement of an LLC operating as a partnership , on the other hand , might specify that certain members are general partners and that others are limited partners . The IRS has ruled that the general and limited partnership interests that confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds satisfy the one-class-of-stock requirement ( see IRS Letter Rulings 9739014 and 199942009 ) .

@@1074805 <p> Several provisions in the Code provide tax credits to individual taxpayers who install energy-efficient property in their residences . One such provision , Sec. 25D , allows for an income tax credit for a taxpayer 's expenditures for residential energy-efficient property . Originally enacted in 2005 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 , P.L. 109-58 ( Section 1335(a) ) , the credit has been modified and extended several times since its inception . Before Sec. 25D , no credit existed for these expenditures ; however , under Sec. 136 , a taxpayer could exclude from income the value of a subsidy a public utility provided to purchase or install energy conservation measures . <p> The current version of Sec. 25D(a) provides for a credit against a taxpayer 's income tax equal to 30% of the expenses incurred for installing certain energy-efficient property in a qualified dwelling unit . The energy-efficient properties eligible for the credit include qualified solar electric property , qualified solar water heating property , qualified fuel cell property , qualified small wind energy property , and qualified geothermal heat pump property . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2016 ( Sec. 25D(g) ) . Although Treasury has never issued regulations under Sec. 25D , the IRS has released notices , in question-and-answer ( Q&amp;A ) format , detailing the procedures and certification processes to use the credit , and the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has released rules under the Energy Star program defining the property requirements and specifications . The following aims to cover the myriad rules from all sources and present them in a concise and comprehensive format while focusing specifically on geothermal heat pump property . <p> A taxpayer can claim the credit for expenses associated with geothermal heat pump property if the property is qualified geothermal heat pump property and the expenses meet the expenditure rules of Sec. 25D(d) ( 5 ) . If the taxpayer meets these requirements , he or she must also comply with the special rules for labor costs , cooperative/condominium rules , allocation requirements , and basis adjustments . <h> Qualified Geothermal Heat Pump Property <p> Sec. 25D(d) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) defines a geothermal heat pump as a piece of equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source to heat a structure and/or as a thermal energy sink to cool a structure . For the geothermal heat pump to be a qualified heat pump , Sec. 25D(d) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) requires that it meet the eligibility criteria of the EPA 's Energy Star program in effect during the time the expenditures are made . <p> Notice 2013-70 limits this definition by stating that any distribution systems for the home , as well as backup emergency heating or cooling systems , are not considered qualified geothermal heat pump property and are therefore not eligible expenditures for the credit ( Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 31 ) . Although the Energy Star guidelines specifically preclude a heat pump intended for commercial use from the definition of a qualified geothermal heat pump , Sec. 25D provides for the allocation of expenditures in certain cases where the property is used for both business and nonbusiness purposes ( see below ) . To qualify as an Energy Star geothermal heat pump , the pump must be tested and pass minimum performance and energy-efficiency ratio ratings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) a manufacturer 's limited warranty is offered , as standard , for all parts and labor for a minimum of two years , and ( 2 ) the major refrigerant circuit components are warrantied for parts and labor for a minimum of five years . <p> Certification:Although a taxpayer may still qualify for the credit without a manufacturer 's certification statement from an Energy Star certified partner , the taxpayer must then prove that the property meets the required efficiency standards . The taxpayer would need to obtain and retain sufficient documentation to establish the qualification for , and the amount of , the available credit ( see Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 16 ) . <p> Notice 2009-41 ( as amplified and clarified by Notice 2013-70 ) provides guidance on how a manufacturer of geothermal heat pump property can certify to the purchaser that the heat pump property is qualified under Sec. 25D . The notice delineates that a manufacturer of geothermal heat pump property can establish the property 's eligibility for the credit by providing the taxpayer with a certification statement that contains specified required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification statement can be provided to the taxpayer by including it with the packaging of the heat pump property , by providing a printable version on the manufacturer 's website , or by any other method that allows the taxpayer to retain the certification statement for tax recordkeeping purposes . A manufacturer that makes this certification must retain documentation that the property meets the requirements and provide it to the IRS if requested . <p> The manufacturer certification statement is required to contain the manufacturer 's name and address , identify the property in question as geothermal heat pump property , and provide the make , model number , or other identifying features of the property . Although not required , the statement may also provide that the heat pump property meets the requirements of the Energy Star program that are in effect at the time the expenditures are actually made . The final requirement necessitates that the manufacturer acknowledge that the statements made are true and complete under penalties of perjury . If the IRS determines that a manufacturer 's certification is erroneous , the manufacturer will no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taxpayers that received the certification before then will continue to be allowed to rely on it . <h> Qualified Expenditure <p> Sec. 25D(d) ( 5 ) ( A ) defines a qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditure briefly and broadly as " an expenditure for qualified geothermal heat pump property installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence by the taxpayer . " However , Notices 2009-41 and 2013-70 provide more comprehensive guidance . <p> Dwelling unit:Notice 2013-70 clarifies that a qualified dwelling unit can be either an existing home or a newly constructed home . In the case of an expenditure that is incurred in connection with either the construction or reconstruction of a dwelling , the taxpayer can not claim the credit for the eligible expenditures until the year the taxpayer uses the constructed or reconstructed dwelling . For taxpayers that own more than one dwelling , the credit is available for qualifying expenditures for a dwelling that is a taxpayer 's second home or vacation home , as long as the dwelling is not investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially for business uses if the taxpayer follows the allocation rules contained in Sec. 25D(e) ( 7 ) . Under this three-prong rule , no portion of the credit is available for property used solely for business purposes , a corresponding percentage of the credit is available if the business use of the property exceeds 20% , and the full credit amount is available if the business use of the property is 20% or less ( see Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 7 ) . Secs . 25D(e) ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) provide that taxpayers who own their dwellings as tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations or as members of condominium management associations may also take the credit equivalent to their proportionate share of the expenditures . <p> Accounting for the expenditures:Qualified geothermal heat pump property expenditures eligible for the credit are limited to the costs of the heat exchange equipment located in the ground outside the dwelling and the labor costs incurred to install the equipment . Under Sec. 25D(e) ( 1 ) , the labor costs must be properly allocable to the on-site preparation , assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The taxpayer may request and rely on the homebuilder to determine the reasonable allocation of the credit-eligible expenditures or use any other reasonable method to determine the cost of the property eligible for the credit ( Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 21 ) . <p> Expenditures for piping or wiring used to connect the equipment to the dwelling can also be included as a cost eligible for the credit . However , any costs for distribution systems inside the home or backup emergency heating or cooling equipment are not eligible for the credit and should not be included as qualified expenditures ( Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 31 ) . Also includible in the amount of the expenditures eligible for the credit is the amount of sales tax paid on the qualified geothermal heat pump property , including labor costs ( Notice 2013-70 , Q&amp;A No. 9 ) . Under Sec. 25D(e) ( 8 ) , expenditures are generally treated as being made upon completion of the installation of the heat pump property or , in the case of a constructed or reconstructed dwelling , when the original use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for geothermal heat pump property is claimed by filing Form 5695 , Residential Energy Credits , and attaching it to the taxpayer 's individual income tax return . The credit is a nonrefundable personal tax credit and , as such , is limited solely to reducing the amount of the taxpayer 's income tax liability . Sec. 25D(c) allows the taxpayer to carry forward the unused portion of the credit to the succeeding tax year and add it to any credit allowable in that year . Upon using the credit for the qualified geothermal heat pump property , the taxpayer must decrease the basis in the property by the amount of the allowable credit . <h> Termination and Planning Opportunities <p> The current version of the credit terminates after Dec. 31 , 2016 ; therefore , the taxpayer must install all property , or , in the case of a new or reconstructed structure , begin his or her original use of the structure in which the property is installed , by Dec. 31 , 2016 , to take advantage of the credit . If a home containing geothermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxpayer does not begin use of the home until 2017 , the credit will not be available for the expenses incurred during the 2015 " 2016 construction period . Because of this strict timing requirement , it is important for the taxpayer to begin using a newly constructed or reconstructed structure no later than Dec. 31 , 2016 . Not all parts of the construction must be finished , but the original use of the structure must begin and the qualifying expenditures must be made before 2017 . <p> The taxpayer should also aim to use the services of a manufacturer that can certify the property is Energy Star-compliant for the year at issue . Although a taxpayer may claim the credit without a manufacturer 's certification that the property meets the qualifications , extra caution should be exercised when no certification is present . The taxpayer must be able to demonstrate that the property meets the required efficiency standards and must retain documentation sufficient to prove entitlement to the amount of credit claimed . <p> To confidently claim the credit for residential energy-efficient property , specifically the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an in-depth understanding of the various rules and regulations that delineate how to use the credit and how much of a credit can be taken .

@@1074828 <h> The VITA Program : Vital to Communities , Campuses , Students , and Employers <p> The urge to " give back " by volunteering time and talents to solve local problems is a value deeply embedded in the American psyche , and the societal benefits of volunteerism are well-known . They include strengthened communities , engaged citizens , increased civic responsibility , and significant contributions to the public good . In addition to helping others , the volunteers themselves benefit through increased connection with their fellow community members , expanded skill sets and networking opportunities , and improved social skills and self-confidence . Volunteers often also have increased levels of happiness , reduced incidence of depression , and , in older adults , even a decreased mortality rate . <p> The advantages to businesses that hire employees with strong volunteer backgrounds may be less well-known . In particular , businesses that hire those who have volunteered in a quasi-professional capacity through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance ( VITA ) program may recognize substantial benefits . <p> This column articulates the numerous benefits students , universities , employers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how to start a program , how to recruit and train volunteers , and how to best ensure a successful experience for all constituents . <p> VITA Background <p> VITA is sponsored by the IRS and various community partners such as the United Way . VITA uses volunteers to prepare and electronically file free low- and middle-income federal individual income tax returns . According to the IRS , nearly 96,000 volunteers prepared over 3.6 million federal income tax returns during the 2014 filing season ( see the IRS Tax Volunteers page ) . Student volunteers at Stetson University in DeLand , Fla. , and in other university-sponsored VITA programs reinforce classroom learning while gaining practical , professional experience in working with clients that will be useful to them and to their future employers . <p> These experiences should enable the VITA volunteers to transition more easily to a professional work environment as new hires . In particular , employers can expect to receive some or all of the following benefits from hiring VITA volunteers : <p> In this era of increased corporate social responsibility , many businesses desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those who have volunteered for more than one tax season , have already demonstrated a strong work ethic and a strong sense of civic involvement that may be attractive to prospective employers . <p> VITA volunteers go through a structured training and certification program that teaches them not only how to prepare tax returns and how to interact with clients , but also to expect that their work will be reviewed by a site coordinator for quality-control purposes . If problems are discovered through this process , they learn to accept feedback to improve future performance . This commitment to quality service and to accepting feedback is also enhanced by site visits from the IRS regional VITA coordinator and by occasional " secret shopper " visits by IRS personnel . <p> VITA volunteers are carefully instructed in the importance of client confidentiality , and they must keep those confidences throughout the tax preparation season and beyond . At Stetson 's VITA program , any verified breach of client confidentiality would result in immediate dismissal from the VITA program . <p> VITA volunteers also gain confidence and learn the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize when required information is missing is an important business skill , but unfortunately academic education sometimes conditions students to believe that all information needed to solve a problem will be neatly provided to them . VITA volunteers must recognize when information that is needed to prepare a client 's return is missing or is problematic , and they must take the initiative to attempt to remedy either situation in a professional manner . <p> VITA volunteers begin to perfect their interpersonal skills as they work with a diverse group of clients . They develop the interviewing skills necessary to elicit missing information or to clarify information that is problematic or unclear . They learn to develop a rapport with their clients while retaining a healthy level of professional skepticism . <p> While they do not have to wear formal business attire , VITA volunteers must have a professional appearance and must maintain a professional demeanor when dealing with clients . This experience will make the transition to the " real " world easier than it might otherwise be . <p> VITA volunteers are trained to prepare income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions . This teaches them the importance of adhering to policies and procedures , and it should accustom them to expect to have and to follow policies and procedures in any new workplace . <p> Students are often reluctant to ask questions when they do not understand something , because they fear embarrassment . Similarly , newly hired employees are often reluctant to ask questions because they mistakenly believe that employers expect them to already know everything and to be able to solve any problem on their own . As a result , they often spend many unproductive hours on a problem that could be easily resolved by asking the right question . Asking the right question let 's the employee get back to work . VITA volunteers are trained to asked for assistance when they encounter a difficult situation for which their knowledge and other resources are insufficient . <p> VITA volunteers have hands-on experience with a professional tax preparation software program ( TaxWise ) . Mastering this software should decrease the learning curve that inevitably results when a new hire attempts to get up to speed with the software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student volunteers with an opportunity to develop and to demonstrate significant leadership skills . Volunteers , especially those who return for a second year , can be trained as site coordinators , assistant site coordinators , or quality reviewers . This teaches them not only to prepare returns , but also to review the work of other volunteer preparers . <p> Data on VITA Benefits <p> Many institutions and universities host the VITA program , arguably because of the benefits postulated above , and several have conducted research to identify those benefits . For example , Southern Utah University in Cedar City , Utah , has served as a VITA site for over 15 years and recently published a document presenting the results obtained from a survey-based study outlining the benefits that accrue to VITA constituents . The study revealed that the VITA experience significantly increased students ' interpersonal communication and interviewing skills , as well as students ' ability to properly identify and gather relevant information , discard irrelevant information , ask relevant and appropriate questions , and understand the meaning , purpose , and content of information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillman , " VITA Experiential , Service-Learning , Learned Competencies , and Changed Mindsets , " Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning- ( 2014 ) ) . These results suggest that the VITA program successfully develops an array of skills that employers are likely to desire in new hires . <p> University administration may also see VITA as valuable interaction with the community . For example , Texas A&amp;M University " Corpus Christi issues a VITA press release at the start of tax season to announce its participation and the availability , dates , and times of services at multiple community sites , and a VITA press release at the end of tax season , announcing the season 's results . An excerpt from a draft of the body of a press release issued at the close of the 2013 tax filing season is below ( all numbers are for federal returns since Texas has no state income tax ) : <p> CORPUS CHRISTI , Texas " The 2013 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program , a joint program between Texas A&amp;M University " Corpus Christi , the United Way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners successfully prepared 3,102 tax returns , returning a record $4 million to low and moderate income households . <p> This year , 49 volunteers served nearly 1,200 hours . Thirty-eight of those volunteers serving more than 795 hours came from Texas A&amp;M " Corpus Christi , with five students/alumni working as site or program coordinators. - . . . <p> In addition , taxpayers and the community benefited from the program . VITA returns yielded more than $1,435,716 in earned income tax credits , which is new money to the Coastal Bend community . . . . The following are summary comparative statistics for 2012 and 2013 : <p> April 2012 " 2,543 returns <p> April 2013 " 3,102 returns <p> April 2012 " Total EITC $1,055,056 <p> April 2013 " Total EITC $1,435,717 <p> April 2012 " Total refunds $3,187,220 <p> April 2013 " Total refunds $4,113,844 <p> Getting Started <p> In deciding whether to begin participating in VITA , a university might first look at whether it can partner with other local agencies already involved in the program . For example , the United Way is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalitions often use commitment letters to explicitly outline each partner 's responsibilities . A key decision for VITA sites is what services to offer . Sites may decide to either specialize or refuse to do returns in specialized areas such as military returns , returns with foreign income , and taxes for the elderly . Planning for tax season is nearly a year-round process , with most of the time needed during September through May . <p> It helps if there is a commitment to volunteerism or community engagement as a core value of the institution . A process for recruiting , training , and supervising volunteers is also essential as is a commitment to using this opportunity to develop student leaders . And a strong faculty champion is essential for the program to succeed . Following are some lessons learned from the VITA experience at Stetson . <h> Recruiting Volunteers <p> A VITA program can not function without a substantial group of strongly committed volunteer tax preparers , so finding those volunteers is a necessary precursor to success . Stetson University has a long tradition of encouraging student participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history is confirmed by Stetson 's inclusion in the Community Engagement Classification of the Carnegie Foundation . At Stetson , students can choose to earn a Certificate in Community Engagement by taking four units ( about 16 credit hours ) of community engagement courses , spending 100 hours on community-engaged learning ( which could include volunteering for VITA ) , and writing a capstone essay . <p> In fact , although the VITA program is directly sponsored by the Accounting Department at the Stetson University School of Business Administration , it is coordinated by the university 's Office of Community Engagement ( OCE ) , which assists in recruiting volunteers and coordinating with the United Way as the university 's local sponsoring partner . The OCE also provides a student volunteer greeter to assure a warm and consistently welcoming environment for clients . <p> The VITA program has also been adopted as a service project by the Stetson chapter of Beta Alpha Psi , a business honorary society , as its annual service project , thus providing another major source of volunteers . <p> Finally , volunteering for VITA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes and by other accounting and business professors . <h> Training <p> A VITA program is improved by providing convenient on-site as well as online training . On-site training is desirable because the software volunteers use can be tricky . Also some students feel more comfortable in their university environment with a trainer on hand . However , the timing of the on-site training can be challenging because the spring semester is often just starting as volunteer training is ending and tax season is beginning . It is helpful if students have been exposed to TaxWise or some other professional tax preparation software in their coursework or have a chance to practice with the software on campus . <p> TaxWise is a CCH product with a relatively low share of the professional tax software market . Stetson students who have used both TaxWise and ProSeries note that TaxWise is easier for the beginning tax preparer than ProSeries , but they find that having proficiency in more than one type of professional software is beneficial . Kevin Holbert , a Stetson student , told one of the authors in comments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , TaxWise takes the preparer through the return preparation process in a more logical , step-by-step basis . It does n't overwhelm the preparer , especially one who is new to professional software for the preparation of taxes . On the other hand , ProSeries allows the preparer to view the return in a broader overview , which gives the preparer a much better sense of how entries affect the return as a whole . <h> Facilities <p> A typical site location would include an area for individual taxpayers to be greeted and prescreened to ensure that they have brought complete information , including proper identification . In this area , taxpayers normally complete an intake sheet . From there , they go to a work station with a PC that has access to TaxWise . Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader are also required . Generally , at least one printer and a copying machine are also available . The layout of the room is less important than keeping the clients ' information confidential . A large , open room would be adequate if taxpayers were sufficiently far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone is also helpful because volunteers can call an IRS liaison for direct help on difficult tax questions . <p> The IRS will provide some materials such as training supplies , intake sheets , sign-in sheets , and required posters , and partners normally contribute what they are able to . Other typical supplies include name tags , large envelopes for client records , calculators , writing utensils , printer paper , and local signage . <p> The number of preparers , and hence workstations , needed depends on demand . As an example , the Stetson VITA site provides one greeter , five preparers ( workstations ) , and one site coordinator during each night of tax preparation . <h> The VITA Experience and Problem-Solving <p> In general , each client arrives and is met by a greeter , who signs the client in and gives the client Form 13614-C , Intake/Interview &amp; Quality Review Sheet , to complete . If the client meets the qualifications for free tax preparation , the client is directed to a computer station staffed by a tax preparer ( and interpreter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an in-depth interview from information on the intake and interview sheet and , using the client 's forms , works with him or her to complete the tax return . The return is then quality-reviewed by another certified volunteer , who uses a checklist to ensure the return is accurate . When the return is complete , a copy is printed for the client , who signs all necessary documents before e-filing . During the process , the client may also receive information about savings bonds , checking and debit card accounts , and financial education classes at some VITA sites . Most ( but not all ) clients appreciate the help . VITA volunteer Tresa Roberts , a Stetson student , told one of the authors , <p> Once the return is done , most clients are extremely thankful for your help . However , once in a while you do get a client who is not happy with their refund amount , and there is nothing you can do about it except try to explain to them why their refund is what it is . <p> According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it probably will . VITA programs need to have a mechanism in place for solving problems as they arise . Often , the first line of defense is to have one or more well-trained site coordinators with recent tax preparation experience . This role may be filled by instructors , local tax practitioners , and/or VITA volunteers with previous experience . In addition , the IRS provides easy access to a regional VITA coordinator who can provide answers and assistance with unusually complicated situations . <h> Faculty Involvement <p> Strong faculty support is also essential to a successful program . While generally one faculty leader or contact point is enough , that faculty member will need the support of other faculty in recruiting student volunteers and securing on-campus resources when a VITA site is located on campus . For example , where there is an on-campus VITA site , campus computers , phone systems , copiers , and incidental supplies might be used . Because a site is generally open several hours per week , release time for a faculty member or an overload stipend might be appropriate , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a specialty in federal income tax , although that may help a site run more efficiently during operating hours . As such , a site can be run by committed adjuncts or non-tenure-track faculty for whom service is rewarded or at least does not come at the cost of research time needed by faculty seeking tenure at universities that highly value research . <h> Other Considerations <p> At the end of tax preparation season , it is important to have a wrapup function to celebrate the success of the program and to show students that the university , the community , and the taxpayers appreciate them . Additionally , the completed returns are evaluated and analyzed at the conclusion of tax season for quality control . <p> In the offseason , it is important to follow up on the program 's success and to include student leaders in the planning process . This is also the time to identify the following year 's potential leaders and to nurture those skills that will help the students grow and develop . <p> The university or its sponsoring partner may wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and/or general coordinators and to cover the cost of program supplies where possible. - Each year , the IRS awards matching grants to organizations that participate in VITA , primarily to extend services to underserved populations . More information on applying for an IRS grant can be found here . Other state and federal cash and in-kind supply grants may be available from grants.gov , financial institutions participating in the Community Reinvestment Act , local governments , corporations ( especially local businesses ) , and other not-for-profit or faith-based organizations . <p> Conclusion <p> A properly administrated student VITA program is a win-win-win-win for the university , the community , student volunteers , and potential employers . The university wins by providing opportunities for students to develop and mature in their commitment to community engagement and by demonstrating its commitment to being a good citizen of the community in a valuable and tangible way . Low- and middle-income members of the community win by receiving professional tax preparation services at no cost .

@@1074840 <h> Opportunity to Eliminate Certain Intercompany Gain <p> Sales or distributions of assets within a consolidated group may result in gain recognition that is deferred under Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13 . If the intercompany gain relates to stock of a subsidiary member , Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13 generally requires the taxpayer to take into account the intercompany gain if the transferred entity is liquidated in a Sec. 332 transaction . Before 2008 , taxpayers had to include the intercompany gain in their gross income without exception when the intercompany gain was triggered . <p> Previously dormant intercompany gain often caught unwary taxpayers off guard during business planning and restructuring . However , recent IRS developments may provide an opportunity for groups to effectively eliminate the intercompany gain in certain circumstances , thereby reducing the possibility of inadvertently triggering intercompany gain and freeing taxpayers from the need to plan transactions so as to avoid a trigger . <h> Background <p> Prior to the issuance of temporary regulations in 2008 , an intercompany gain that was recognized and deferred under Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13 generally would be taken into account if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buying member 's gain or loss on the liquidation would be subject to nonrecognition under Sec. 332 , the selling member 's gain would be taken into account . This result is intended to prevent consolidated groups from using intercompany transactions to dispose of assets without recognition of gain that would be taxable at the corporate level . <p> Although the regulations prior to 2008 allowed the IRS to issue rulings to exclude a selling member 's gain from gross income , the principles set out in the rules allowing this exercise of discretion were not clear and relief was limited . This was especially true when the regulations had specifically contemplated possible gain duplication in situations involving a Sec. 332 transaction . <p> Example 1:S , T , and B are members of the same consolidated group . B owns all the stock of S , and S owns all the stock of T. S sells all its appreciated stock of T to B and has an intercompany gain from its T stock that will be deferred under Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13 . B subsequently liquidates T and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken into account and not redetermined to be treated as excluded or nontaxable because B 's unrecognized gain or loss on the transferred stock is not a permanent and explicit disallowance under the Code . <p> The IRS recognized that the application of Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13 may result in the effective duplication of gain within a consolidated group when the intercompany gain is not reflected in basis after the transaction and does not provide the taxpayer with some other tax benefit . Accordingly , in 2008 , the IRS issued temporary regulations ( Temp . Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13T(c) ( 6 ) ( ii ) ( C ) , in T.D . 9383 ) that provided an exception to recognition if five requirements were met ( the automatic relief rule , or ARR ) . The IRS retained the then-existing rule ( the commissioner 's discretionary rule , or CDR ) allowing a taxpayer to seek a letter ruling granting an exception from the income inclusion , but it noted in the preamble that it did not believe the rule would be necessary any longer , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate the CDR . <p> In 2011 , the IRS finalized the regulations ( T.D . 9515 ) . The ARR remains the same under the final regulations . If a group can meet the five enumerated requirements of Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13(c) ( 6 ) ( ii ) ( C ) ( 1 ) , the gain triggered will be nontaxable . Based on comments it received , the IRS decided not to eliminate the CDR and included it in Regs . Sec. 1.1502-13(c) ( 6 ) ( ii ) ( D ) . Under the CDR , if a taxpayer can not meet one of the first three of the ARR criteria with respect to the gain but does meet the last two criteria , the IRS may still determine the intercompany gain should be excluded from gross income . The final regulations apply to intercompany items taken into account on or after March 4 , 2011 . The temporary regulations ( which included the prior versions of the ARR and the CDR ) apply to items taken into account on or after March 7 , 2008 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Assume the same facts as Example 1 , except that before B liquidates T , S liquidates or merges into B , with B as the successor member to S 's assets and intercompany gain . When B subsequently liquidates T , the transaction triggers S 's intercompany gain . Immediately prior to the liquidation of T , B is the T stock 's owner and is also a successor to S. Because T 's stock is eliminated and B is not afforded any other tax benefits , the ARR applies , and the gain triggered will be nontaxable under the ARR . However , if the ending result is the same " in other words , a single entity remains and the T stock is eliminated " but the sequence of steps differs , the ARR may not apply , and the gain triggered will be taxable . However , the group should consider whether the gain may be excludable from gross income through exercise of the CDR . <h> Opportunity <p> The ARR and CDR may provide an opportunity for taxpayers to eliminate intercompany gain that otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may offer a means to eliminate intercompany gains on stock when to do so would not frustrate the purposes of the intercompany transaction rules by permitting circumvention of corporate-level tax . Since the CDR 's finalization in 2011 , the IRS has issued two letter rulings exercising its authority provided by the CDR for taxpayers that could not meet the ARR 's requirements . <p> In Letter Ruling 201210018 , the IRS exercised its authority to exclude intercompany gain with respect to a member stock that otherwise would have been taken into account as a result of a proposed downstream merger . The taxpayer did not meet one of the ARR 's enumerated requirements , namely , the selling member was not a successor to the buying member prior to execution of the proposed transaction . However , because the basis in the stock was eliminated and not reflected in any other asset and the intercompany transaction did not otherwise provide the taxpayer with a tax benefit , the IRS redetermined the intercompany gain to be excluded from gross income . <p> Similarly , in Letter Ruling 201312027 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to multiple member stocks that otherwise would have been taken into account as a result of multiple proposed upstream reorganizations or liquidations . The taxpayer did not meet at least one of the enumerated requirements of the ARR . Because the transferred stock 's basis was eliminated as a result of the proposed transactions , one entity remained as the successor to the selling and buying members , and the transaction otherwise did not afford the taxpayer with any tax benefits , the IRS redetermined the intercompany gain to be excluded from gross income . <p> In each favorable letter ruling , the IRS allowed the taxpayer to eliminate intercompany gain that was deferred but that otherwise could have been triggered , possibly inadvertently , upon subsequent intragroup restructurings . The IRS 's focus in each instance appears to be whether the taxpayer reflected the intercompany gain in the basis of any other stock or assets , or whether the transaction provided the taxpayer with any other tax benefits . <h> Conclusion <p> While previously , taxpayers with deferred intercompany gain had to remain vigilant to plan around a liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ARR and CDR now offer taxpayers an opportunity to plan for elimination of the intercompany gain . If used properly during business planning and restructuring , these relief provisions may serve as a useful tool in efficient tax planning . <p> EditorNotes <p> Annette Smith is a partner with PwC , Washington National Tax Services , in Washington , D.C. @qwx64575 
@@1074843 <h> Beware of Sec. 382 When Issuing Stock Warrants or Convertible Debt <p> Corporations raising capital may issue either preferred stock with warrants to purchase additional stock at some future time or debt that is convertible to common stock in an effort to make the investment more attractive to would-be investors . If the issuing corporation is a loss corporation under Sec. 382 , there is risk that the warrants or conversion features will trigger an unintended ownership change when they are issued . It is important for loss corporations to understand the rules surrounding the treatment of warrants and equity conversion features under Sec. 382 . <h> Background <p> Sec. 382 applies to loss corporations , which are defined as corporations entitled to use a net operating loss ( NOL ) carryover , having an NOL or a net unrealized built-in loss ( aggregate tax basis of assets in excess of their aggregate fair market value ) for the tax year in which a testing date ( the issuance of stock , convertible debt , or warrants ) occurs . Sec. 382 also limits the ability to deduct certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If an ownership change occurs under Sec. 382 , the limitation may result in an NOL , capital loss , and other credit carryovers expiring with no tax benefit . Sec. 383 effectively extends the rules of Sec. 382 to corporations with current-year capital losses , as well as capital loss or tax credit carryovers . <p> In general , a Sec. 382 ownership change occurs when , on a particular testing date ( here , the date the stock or warrants are issued ) , the percentage of stock ownership of one or more 5% shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock ownership held by those shareholders at any time during the testing period . The testing period is generally the three-year period ending on the testing date . This period is shortened if there has been a prior ownership change in the three-year period or if the losses subject to Sec. 382 arose after the start of the three-year period . For Sec. 382 purposes , ownership percentages are based on the value of equity characterized as stock . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sec. 382 is beyond the scope of this item . ) <p> Common stock and preferred stock generally constitute stock for Sec. 382 purposes . However , under Sec. 382(k) ( 6 ) ( A ) , preferred stock meeting all of the requirements of Sec. 1504(a) ( 4 ) ( often referred to as pure preferred stock ) , or any option to acquire pure preferred stock , is not treated as a stock interest for ownership change purposes and is not counted in either the numerator or denominator of any ownership percentage computation . The following are the Sec. 1504(a) ( 4 ) requirements : <p> The stock is not entitled to vote ; <p> The stock is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent ; <p> The stock has redemption and liquidation rights that do not exceed the issue price of the stock ( except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium ) ; and <p> The stock is not convertible to another class of stock . <p> Additionally , per Regs . Sec. 1.382-2(a) ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sec. 1504(a) ( 4 ) criteria , but for voting rights granted in the event of dividend arrearages , does not lose its characterization as pure preferred stock . <h> Options , Warrants , and Conversion Features <p> Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 9 ) provides that generally any contingent purchase , warrant , convertible debt , put , stock subject to a risk of forfeiture , contract to acquire stock , or similar interest is treated as an option for Sec. 382 ownership purposes . Under Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 1 ) , an option generally is treated as not exercised prior to its actual exercise . However , under Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 2 ) , an option is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance or subsequent transfer if , on that date , it satisfies any one of three tests : the ownership test of Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 3 ) ; the control test of Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 4 ) ; or the income test of Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 5 ) . ( Application of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) . ) <p> If any option is deemed to be exercised immediately upon issuance or transfer , it must be tested for Sec. 382 ownership change purposes as if it were stock . For purposes of the remainder of this item , any reference to options includes traditional options or warrants as well as convertible debt . <h> The Tests : A Prohibited Principal Purpose <p> A common element to all three tests is whether a principal purpose of the issuance , transfer , or structuring of the option ( alone or in combination with other arrangements ) is to avoid or ameliorate the effect of an ownership change on the loss corporation ( a prohibited principal purpose ) . Note that this only needs to be a principal purpose , not the principal purpose . In fact , the preamble to the regulations ( T.D . 8531 ) states that " an abusive purpose can be a principal purpose even when it is outweighed by the non-tax reasons ( taken together or separately ) for the occurrence or structure of a transaction . " Among the factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business purpose for the issuing , transferring , or structuring of the option ; <p> The likelihood that the option will be exercised , taking into account any contingencies to its exercise ; <p> Transactions related to the issuance or transfer of the option ( such as concurrent issuances of other stock ) ; and <p> The consequences of treating the option as exercised . <p> For the consequences of treating the option as exercised factor , an option is not treated as exercised if a principal purpose of its issuance , transfer , or structuring is to avoid an ownership change by having it treated as if it were immediately exercised . This might be the case , for example , if , in connection with issuing stock and warrants to a new major shareholder , warrants also are issued to existing shareholders to prevent dilution of their ownership and to keep the new investor 's ownership below 50% ( if all warrants were treated as immediately exercised for testing purposes ) . <p> Conversely , if treating the option as exercised either itself causes , or contributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be treated as having a prohibited principal purpose will be enhanced . ( Per Sec. 382(l) ( 3 ) ( A ) ( iv ) , except to the extent provided by regulations , an option to acquire stock shall be treated as exercised if the exercise results in an ownership change . ) In those cases , it will be critical to determine the effect of the other factors relevant in applying each of the three tests . <p> Ownership test : Under Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 3 ) , the prohibited principal purpose of the ownership test is satisfied by providing the option holder ( or a person related to the holder ) , prior to option exercise or transfer , with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock , which could include voting rights or rights to receive dividends . Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 6 ) ( ii ) describes relevant factors to consider in applying this test , including : <p> The relationship , at the time of issuance or transfer of the option , between the option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , a warrant with an exercise price below , at , or just slightly above the stock 's current fair market value is more likely to be exercised than a warrant with an exercise price that is 200% of the current value of the company 's stock , increasing the likelihood that the option holder will become a stock owner . <p> Whether the option provides the holder , or a related person , with the right to participate in management or with other rights ordinarily afforded to owners of stock . For example , if , as a condition of purchasing pure preferred stock with common stock warrants , the investor requires representation on the issuer 's board of directors , the warrants could be viewed as conveying the rights of ownership . Similarly , it could be problematic if the option holder , or a related person , is a member of the corporation 's management team . <p> The existence of reciprocal options ( such as a call option held by the prospective purchaser and a put option held by the prospective seller ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder to share in future appreciation of the stock , an attribute present in actual stock ownership ; however , the regulations indicate that this factor alone is not sufficient to cause the option to satisfy the ownership test . Conversely , the fact that the option holder does not bear the risk of loss due to declines in value of the underlying stock does not preclude the option from satisfying the ownership test . <p> Control test : The control test of Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 4 ) is satisfied if both the prohibited principal purpose is present and the holder of the option , together with all related parties , has an aggregate direct and indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation of more than 50% . This percentage is determined as if exercise of both the option in question plus any other loss corporation options of the holder , and any other intended increases in that person 's percentage ownership interest , all occurred on the date the option in question was issued or transferred . Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 4 ) ( ii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . Related persons include any persons having a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock , within the meaning of Regs . Sec. 1.382-3(a) ( 1 ) ( i ) . <p> Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 6 ) ( iii ) also requires consideration of the option holder 's economic interest in , and influence over the management of , the loss corporation , either directly or via related persons . Either economic interest or the ability to influence management could be attained through ownership of the option itself , through a related arrangement , or through rights in stock . Thus , an option holder that already sits on the board or owns significant amounts of voting stock is more likely to satisfy the control test . <p> Income test : Under Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 5 ) and Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 6 ) ( iv ) , the prohibited principal purpose of this test is satisfied if the structuring of the option facilitates the creation of income or value ( including unrealized built-in gains ) before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to avoid causing an ownership change until carryovers are used or to reduce or eliminate an unrealized built-in loss that would exist at an ownership change date . <p> Factors to consider are whether , in connection with the issuance or transfer of the option , the loss corporation engages in extraordinary income acceleration transactions " in other words , transactions that are outside the ordinary course of business that are entered into purely to accelerate income in periods just before the exercise of an option or that defer deductions to a period after the exercise of an option . <p> Also problematic here is whether the option holder ( or related persons ) purchases stock ( including pure preferred stock ) or makes a capital contribution or loan to the loss corporation that can be reasonably expected to avoid or ameliorate the effect of an ownership change . The larger the stock purchase , capital contribution , or loan , the more likely the option will satisfy the income test . However , these transactions generally are not taken into account if they are made to enable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examples of basic operations are to meet monthly payroll or to fund other operating expenses . <h> Safe Harbors <p> Regs . Sec. 1.382-4(d) ( 7 ) describes certain options that are not treated as exercised under the above tests . This list of safe-harbor options includes : <p> Contracts to acquire stock . This includes a stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement , the terms of which are commercially reasonable , in which the parties ' obligations to complete the transaction are subject only to reasonable closing conditions , and which is closed on a change date within one year after it is entered into . However , such a contract is not exempt from the income test solely by being described in this regulation . <p> Escrow , pledge , or other security arrangements . These include options that are part of a security arrangement in a typical lending transaction , if they are subject to customary commercial conditions , such as an agreement for holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or security agreement , or an option to acquire stock contingent upon a loan default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon death , disability , mental incompetence , or retirement . <p> Options constituting a right of first refusal , with customary terms . <p> Options designated by the IRS in an Internal Revenue Bulletin as being exempt from one or more of the ownership , control , or income tests . <h> Conclusion <p> The rules of Sec. 382 and its accompanying regulations are very complex . It is extremely important for loss corporations issuing preferred stock with warrants or convertible debt to be aware of the option rules to avoid inadvertent and unwelcome ownership changes that could limit a corporation 's realization of tax attributes . @qwx64575

Ellentuck , Esq . <p> Related <p> TOPICS <p> Uncategorized Article <p> Tax Section <p> Although converting a C corporation into a limited liability company ( LLC ) allows the C corporation shareholders to continue to have limited liability while acquiring the advantages of passthrough taxation , the heavy tax cost of the conversion normally will be prohibitive . However , in certain situations in which the corporation has depreciated assets or significant net operating loss ( NOL ) carryovers , conversion to LLC status may be beneficial . See the checklist to ensure that the significant issues have been addressed when converting to LLC status . <p> Conversion of a C corporation into an LLC involves the liquidation of the corporation , which results in a double tax " one on the corporation 's distribution of assets ( Sec. 336 ) and one on the distribution to the shareholders ( Sec. 331 ) . <h> Taxation of C Corporation Liquidation <p> Under Sec. 336 , a liquidating C corporation must recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the property had been sold to them for its fair market value ( FMV ) . The character of the gain recognized ( capital versus ordinary ) depends on the character of the property the corporation distributes . ( Depreciation recapture and similar rules may also affect the character of the gain recognized . ) <p> Generally , Sec. 361(d) allows corporations to recognize losses when property is distributed to shareholders in complete liquidation of the corporation . However , a corporation making a liquidating distribution to a related person ( under the rules of Sec. 267 ) can not recognize the loss if the distribution is not pro rata or disqualified property is distributed . Disqualified property is any property the corporation acquires in a Sec. 351 transfer or as a contribution to capital during the five-year period ending on the distribution date , or any property whose adjusted basis is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property . <p> In Letter Ruling 200613027 , the IRS ruled that the conversion of an LLC to a corporation followed by a rescission of the incorporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the entity was treated as an LLC for the entire tax year , and the incorporation transaction was ignored . <p> Sec. 331 governs the tax treatment of liquidating distributions at the shareholder level . The Sec. 331 rules require the liquidating distribution to be treated as full payment in exchange for the shareholder 's stock . The shareholders must recognize gain ( or loss ) equal to the difference between the FMV of the assets received and the adjusted basis of the stock surrendered . If the stock surrendered is a capital asset , the transaction results in the recognition of capital gain or loss . The shareholder 's basis in the property received in the liquidating distribution is its FMV at the time of distribution if gain or loss is recognized on the receipt of the property ( Sec. 334(a) ) . <h> Determining If Conversion Is Desirable <p> Because of the tax cost of converting a C corporation , practitioners will probably want to consider conversion only if circumstances limit the gain that will be recognized by the corporation on the distribution of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders on the receipt of the liquidating distribution . In general , a corporate conversion may be desirable if : <p> The corporation holds assets that have not appreciated or that have depreciated . In such situations , the FMV of the property distributed does not exceed the basis of the transferred assets , and the corporation does not recognize gain . In addition , the FMV of the assets distributed to the shareholders most likely will not exceed the basis of their stock , negating any gain recognition at the shareholder level . <p> The corporation and/or its shareholders have NOLs or capital loss carryforwards that absorb any gain recognized on the liquidating distribution . Shareholders may have capital loss carryforwards from other activities or investments that they can use to offset the gain . <p> The corporation holds assets that will appreciate rapidly in the future ( such as intellectual property or real estate ) . If rapid appreciation is expected , it may be preferable to recognize the gain on liquidation of the corporation now , rather than continuing to operate as a corporation . <p> Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losses on the liquidating distribution will not be limited because of the related-party rules , the conversion of a C corporation to an LLC may actually have beneficial tax effects . <h> How to Structure C Corporation Conversion <p> There are three basic ways to structure the conversion of a C corporation into an LLC . All three result in the liquidation of the corporation and potentially a substantial tax cost . However , the choice may affect the shareholders ' bases in their interests in the LLC or the LLC 's basis in its assets . <p> Option 1 : The shareholders form the LLC by transferring their stock to the LLC in exchange for membership interests . At that point , the shareholders own interests in the LLC , and the LLC owns the stock of the C corporation . The corporation then liquidates , which results in the LLC ( as the sole shareholder ) receiving the liquidating distribution . Generally , the shareholders recognize no gain or loss on the contribution of their C corporation stock to the LLC ( Sec. 721 ) . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax on the difference between the FMV and the tax basis of the distributed assets . The LLC recognizes gain on receipt of the liquidating distribution , which it passes through to its members . The shareholders have a carryover basis in their LLC interests equal to the basis they had in the C corporation 's stock , increased by the gain passed through from the LLC . ( Sec. 704(c) requires each member of the LLC to be taxed subsequently on the gain or loss inherent in their stock at the time of its transfer to the LLC . ) The LLC will have a basis in the corporation 's assets equal to the FMV of the assets on the date of liquidation . <p> Option 2 : The C corporation transfers its assets ( subject to liabilities ) to the LLC , and the shareholders transfer cash or other assets . The C corporation then liquidates and distributes its membership interest in the LLC to the shareholders . Again , under Sec. 721 , neither the corporation nor the shareholders recognize gain or loss on the contribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the liquidating distribution of the LLC interests to the shareholders equal to the difference between the FMV and tax basis of the distributed interests . The shareholders recognize gain on receipt of the liquidating distribution equal to the difference between the FMV of the distributed LLC interests and the basis in their stock . The LLC has a carryover basis in the corporation 's assets equal to the basis of the assets in the hands of the corporation prior to contribution . ( However , the distribution of ownership interests in the LLC constitutes a transfer within the meaning of Sec. 743 , and the LLC can adjust the basis of its assets if a Sec. 754 election is in effect ; see Letter Ruling 9701029 . ) The shareholders have a basis in the LLC interests distributed by the corporation equal to the FMV on the date of liquidation . ( The basis of the shareholders in their LLC interests acquired by contribution is the amount of cash and tax basis of property contributed for the interests . ) <p> One advantage of this type of transaction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed to the former shareholders , since the Sec. 2701 " 2704 limitations apply only for gift and estate tax purposes .

The corporation recognizes income equal to the difference between the FMV and the tax basis of the distributed assets .

Under Sec. 721 , the shareholders do not recognize gain or loss on the contribution of assets by the shareholders to the LLC . <p> The results of this conversion structure are the same as option 1 .

@@1074853 <h> Latest Stories <h> Using Loans to Extract Cash From a Closely Held Corporation <p> Lending corporate cash to shareholders can be an effective way to give the shareholders use of the funds without the double-tax consequences of dividends . However , an advance or loan to a shareholder must be a bona fide loan to avoid a constructive dividend . Further , the loan must have an adequate interest rate to avoid deemed dividends under the below-market loan rules of Sec. 7872 . <p> Establishing a Bona Fide Loan <p> Whether withdrawals from a corporation are loans or distributions depends on whether , at the time of the withdrawal , the shareholder intended to repay the amounts received and the corporation intended to require payment . It is not enough for a shareholder to declare that he or she intended a withdrawal to be a loan . There must be more reliable evidence that the transaction is debt . Some of the factors used to determine whether an advance should be treated as a loan or a dividend include : <p> The extent to which the shareholder controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , it is likely that loans will not be arm's-length transactions . Therefore , a greater potential for disguised constructive dividends exists . In determining control , both direct and indirect stock ownership must be considered . <p> The earnings and dividend history of the corporation . A corporation 's history of not paying dividends despite the existence of sufficient earnings and profits may indicate that loans to shareholders should be considered constructive dividends , particularly where other evidence of indebtedness is lacking . <p> The magnitude of the advances and whether a ceiling existed to limit the amount . The lack of a ceiling limiting the amount a shareholder can withdraw from the corporation is indicative of a constructive dividend rather than a loan . In addition , sizable advances in relation to corporate profits or shareholder salaries may also be evidence that a distribution is not a loan . <p> How the parties recorded the advances on their books and records . The fact that distributions are recorded on the corporation 's books and/or the shareholder 's personal financial statements as shareholder loans is some evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court has stated that this factor is not determinative without further evidence substantiating the existence of a bona fide loan ( Baird , 25 T.C. 387 ( 1955 ) ) . <p> Whether the parties executed notes . While a formal note is evidence that a shareholder distribution is a loan , the lack of such a note or certificate of debt is not a determinative factor . The true substance of the transaction is the key factor . <p> Whether interest was paid or accrued . The failure to charge interest on shareholder loans or advances is normally an indication that a true debt arrangement does not exist . However , in closely held corporations , non-interest-bearing notes may be intended . In such cases , the below-market interest rules of Sec. 7872 come into play . Also , if interest charges are merely recorded on the books and added to the loan balance , such amounts likely would give little weight to substantiating the existence of a true debt . <p> Whether or not security was given for the loan . The existence of collateral or security is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lack of collateral or security indicates that the transaction was not a loan . However , the lack of security has not been a major factor in various court decisions in this area . One arrangement that might be considered is placing a provision in the corporation 's bylaws stating that any shareholder loans are considered to be secured by the shareholder 's stock in the corporation . <p> Whether there is a set maturity date . A fixed maturity date for a shareholder loan can be a strong indication that a true loan is intended . However , where term loans are regularly renewed without payment , with interest charges added to the note balance , little weight will be given to the maturity dates . Shareholder advances without set maturity dates can still be considered loans if other factors indicate that the arrangement is a true loan . <p> Whether the corporation ever enforced repayment . Such action on the part of a corporation would indicate that a true debt arrangement exists . However , this factor is unlikely to be present in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances . The fact that a shareholder actually has the financial ability to repay a corporate advance is some indication that a true debt may exist . On the other hand , the fact that a shareholder may not be able to repay the advances would certainly indicate the lack of a true shareholder debt . The fact that a shareholder has a good credit rating will have little weight if the shareholder is never asked to repay the advances . <p> Whether the shareholder attempted to repay the advances . The repayment of corporate advances by a shareholder is an indication that a debt relationship exists . However , the repayment must be bona fide . Occasional repayments through bonus payments , or the application to the loan balance of other corporate payments to the shareholder while the loan balance continues to grow , probably will not be a strong indication of a bona fide loan . <p> Whether the advances were in proportion to stock ownership . Advances proportionate to stock ownership may be an indication of constructive dividends even where no one shareholder is in control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three shareholders may agree to advance themselves an amount in proportion to their stock ownership rather than pay salaries or dividends . If other indications of a bona fide debt arrangement do not exist , the IRS would probably hold that such distributions were made to avoid income and/or employment taxes . <p> To help ensure that amounts owed to the corporation by its shareholder(s) are bona fide loans , the corporation and shareholder(s) should sign a written note with commercially reasonable terms . The corporation should pass a resolution authorizing the advances , and the loans should be authorized in the corporate minutes . Advances should be properly recorded , and the notes should include repayment schedules and maturity dates . Also , limits should be placed on the amount of shareholder advances . The notes should bear interest at a rate that is not less than the short-term applicable federal rate ( AFR ) on the date of the note ( or blended AFR for demand loans outstanding for the entire year ) . The shareholders should repay principal and interest according to the terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For 2014 , the tax rate on dividend income is : <p> 15% for taxpayers with a marginal tax rate of 25% or greater whose taxable income falls below the levels for the 39.6% regular tax rate ( $457,600 for married filing jointly , $406,750 for single filers , $432,200 for heads of household , and $228,800 for married filing separately ) ; <p> 20% for taxpayers with taxable income above those levels ; and <p> 0% for taxpayers with a marginal tax rate on ordinary income below 25% , to the extent the gain would be taxed at ordinary rates below 25% if it were ordinary income . <p> Because of the low dividend tax rates , a corporation can issue dividends to a shareholder that are used to repay a loan due the corporation by the shareholder . This is more advantageous than forgiving the loan , which results in **28;205;TOOLONG income that is taxable as ordinary income . However , there are some risks with this strategy . The IRS may claim that the loan was really a dividend that is subject to the shareholder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , dividends should be paid proportionally based on ownership interest . When more than one shareholder exists and the loans are not proportional to ownership , this strategy may not be feasible . <p> Furthermore , a 3.8% net investment income tax applies to the lesser of ( 1 ) net investment income or ( 2 ) the excess of modified adjusted gross income over $250,000 for married filing jointly , $200,000 for single filers , and $125,000 for married filing separately . This means that the top tax rate on qualified dividends for higher-income individuals is 18.8% ( 15% + 3.8% ) or 23.8% ( 20% + 3.8% ) . <p> Borrowing From Retirement Plans <p> When the shareholder or employee is unable or unwilling to borrow from the corporation , a bank , or other source , funds that have accumulated within a qualified retirement plan may be a good alternative . IRS guidelines permit limited borrowing from corporate qualified retirement plans , including 401(k) plans . <p> As a general rule , loans between a participant and a retirement plan are prohibited transactions ( Sec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exemption for loans to participants that meet the following requirements ( Sec. 4975(d) ( 1 ) ) : <p> Loans are available to all plan participants or beneficiaries on a reasonably equivalent basis and are not made available to highly compensated employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other employees ; <p> The loan is made in accordance with specific loan provisions set forth in the plan ; and <p> The loan bears a reasonable rate of interest and is adequately secured . <p> The loan must be evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement ( which may include more than one document ) . The agreement must specify the loan amount , term , and repayment schedule . It must be in writing , but it does not have to be signed as long as it is enforceable under applicable law ( Regs . Sec. 1.72(p)-1 , Q&amp;A-3 ) . <p> In general , borrowings are limited to 50% of the participant 's account balance up to a maximum of $50,000 and must be repaid within five years ( unless the loan proceeds are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms are limited by the individual plan ) ( Sec. 72(p) ( 2 ) ) . <p> Hardship withdrawals ( which are different from a loan , which must be repaid to the plan ) from 401(k) plans may also be possible in certain circumstances .

@@1074868 <h> Using Debt to Leverage a Taxable Gift to a QPRT <p> A wealthy client recently wanted advice on how the purchase of a vacation home might affect her estate plan . She was 66 , a widow , and in good health . She had a large taxable estate and had a little less than half of her applicable unified estate and gift tax credit remaining . The property she planned to purchase was expected to appreciate significantly in the long term , and she was concerned that the property could trigger significant estate taxes . While she wanted to enjoy the property during her life , she also wanted to pass the property on to her adult children . Given her situation , a qualified personal residence trust ( QPRT ) could help her achieve her goals . <h> QPRT Basics <p> A qualified personal residence trust is a trust created to own a personal residence of the grantor for the benefit of the grantor 's spouse , children , or charity . The grantor makes a gift of a personal residence into the trust while retaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the term is up , the grantor relinquishes the property to the beneficiaries , and the asset is gone from the grantor 's estate . <p> When the grantor contributes the property to the QPRT , a taxable gift has been made to the beneficiaries for the remainder interest in the property . To determine the amount of the gift , one has to calculate the value of the retained interest by the term holder . The value of the term has an actuarially determined value that consists of two components : a reversionary interest and an income interest . The reversionary interest is the value of the chance that the property might revert to the estate if the term holder does not outlive the term of the trust . The income interest is the value of the retained right to live in and use the property during the term . Both interests are calculated using the applicable Sec. 7520 rate and valuation tables . <p> Planning tip : As the applicable Sec. 7520 rate increases , the value of the remainder interest goes down , as does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grantor decreases the value of the remainder interest , as does extending the term of the trust . A client with a large estate who is in good health and is older ( and if the Sec. 7520 rate is favorable ) might be a good candidate for a QPRT . <p> A QPRT can own only one personal residence of the grantor and certain other assets . A personal residence for purposes of a QPRT is one for which the " primary use " is for that of the term holder when occupied by the term holder ( Regs . Secs . 25.2702-5(b) ( 2 ) ( iii ) and ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) ) . Primary use is satisfied provided that the property transferred to the trust meets the residence definition under Sec. 280A(d) ( 1 ) , where the grantor must use the residence for the greater of 14 days or 10% of the days rented . <p> Certain other assets a QPRT can hold include appurtenant structures used for residential purposes and adjacent land that can reasonably be attributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash to pay for expenses , improvements , or the purchase of the initial or a replacement residence . <p> There are several other restrictions that must be adhered to within the governing instrument for a QPRT to maintain its status . <p> The trust must cease to be a QPRT if the residence is no longer a personal residence or if it is damaged or destroyed and not replaced within two years ; <p> The trust must pay all income and excess cash to the term holder annually and quarterly , respectively ; <p> The trust must not allow for distributions of corpus to nonterm-holder beneficiaries ; <p> The trust can not sell the residence to the grantor or the grantor 's spouse at any time during or after the QPRT term ; and <p> The trust must prohibit the exchange of the term holder 's interest ( Regs . Sec. 25.2702-5(c) ) . <p> The agreement may also allow for improvements to be made to the residence , but this would create additional taxable gifts . <p> A QPRT converts to a grantor retained annuity trust if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another residence within the shorter of two years or the remaining term of the trust . If the QPRT loses its QPRT status or the term holder dies within the term , then the trust comes back into the estate . However , adjusted taxable gifts are also reduced for any gifts brought back into the estate , so the individual is no better or worse off as a result . <h> Leveraging the Taxable Gift to the QPRT <p> As mentioned earlier , the ideal client for a QPRT is someone with a potential estate tax problem , good health , advancing age , and a desire to pass on his or her wealth . <p> Example : J fits all of the above criteria . J is 66 at the time of the creation of the QPRT , in excellent health , has a large taxable estate , and wishes to pass her wealth on to her adult children . The one complication is that she has only $160,000 of applicable credit remaining , and the vacation home she wants to purchase costs $1.675 million . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the QPRT , but the value of the remainder interest would use up all her remaining applicable credit and generate a large gift tax liability . <p> To solve this problem , J should take out a $1.35 million 10-year interest-only loan and structure the term of the QPRT over 10 years . The remainder interest is calculated based on the $325,000 equity in the vacation home , the prevailing Sec. 7520 rate , her age , and the 10-year term . The gift of the remainder interest in the QPRT is approximately $140,000 and is much less than her remaining applicable credit . By utilizing the debt , J is able to leverage the gift to the QPRT and get a highly appreciating asset out of her estate at a very low gift tax cost . <p> Planning tip : It is important that the debt be structured as an interest-only loan . If the debt is a typical mortgage , then each payment of principal is considered a taxable gift . <p> J 's adult children will ultimately inherit the debt , but they will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the term of the trust . However , in true leverage fashion , the rate of return on the initial equity will be much larger than it would have been had debt not been used . Therefore , this is an excellent technique to maximize one 's applicable credit . <p> In addition , the mortgage interest and the property taxes J pays are expenses of the income beneficiary of the trust ( J ) , so she can pay these expenses without any gift tax consequences and still take the income tax deduction for both . <h> Disadvantages of a QPRT <p> QPRTs do not come without drawbacks and may not fit every client 's situation . Once the term of the trust is up , the grantor must relinquish ownership of the property or pay fair market value rent to the trust if he or she intends to still live in or use the residence beyond the term . In addition , the grantor 's basis in the residence carries over to the beneficiaries , so there could be adverse income tax consequences to weigh against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property can create some severe administrative and gift tax complications . If the debt is not an interest-only loan and the grantor is making principal payments on the mortgage , an additional gift is made each time a principal payment is made and new QPRT calculations will have to be performed every time a payment is made . Therefore , it is advisable to carry interest-only debt on the property , pay off the debt before gifting the property , or structure the mortgage payments as a loan to the QPRT. @qwx64575 
@@1074870 <h> IRS Guidance Shows Risks to Nonguarantor LLC Members <p> As the limited liability company ( LLC ) form of business continues to proliferate , lending institutions are frequently requiring LLC members to personally guarantee the debts of these entities . The extent that such guarantees affect the amount of losses available to be deducted has been uncertain in the past , but recent IRS guidance clarifies the treatment of both the guarantor and the nonguarantor members . While the guidance generally benefits the guarantor member , it also highlights the potentially unknown effect on at-risk amounts for any members who have not personally guaranteed the debt . <p> Practitioners looking for guidance in this area previously had to look to regulations written well before the LLC form of entity became available under state law . Those rules focused on general partners versus limited partners and generally did not allow " limited partners " to treat personally guaranteed debt as " at risk " because , under state law , a limited partner has a right to seek reimbursement from the general partner and the partnership if the limited partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 465(b) ( 4 ) ) . However , in the case of an LLC , all members have limited liability for the LLC 's debt and generally do not have the ability to seek reimbursement from the LLC or other members . <p> To provide clarity on this topic , the IRS Office of Chief Counsel issued Legal Advice AM 2014-003 on April 4 , 2014 . The memorandum addresses the tax consequences under Sec. 465 of a member 's guaranteeing the debt of an LLC classified as a partnership ( or a disregarded entity ) , the consequences when the debt of the LLC is classified as " qualified nonrecourse financing " under Sec. 465(b) ( 6 ) ( B ) , and the consequences to other members of the LLC when a member guarantees qualified nonrecourse debt . <p> For an LLC member who guarantees an LLC 's debts , the memo indicates that the member will be treated similarly to a general partner who had personally assumed the partnership 's debt and who had no right of reimbursement from other members ( such as the general partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.465-24(a) ( 2 ) ( ii ) ) . In that situation , the member is considered to be " at risk " for the LLC debt guaranteed , regardless of whether the member waives any right to subrogation , reimbursement , or indemnification against the LLC , but only to the extent that the member has no reimbursement right from persons other than the LLC , the member is not otherwise protected against loss , and the guarantee is bona fide and enforceable by the LLC 's creditors under local law . The treatment is the same for LLCs treated as disregarded entities . <p> For LLCs owning real property , one exception to the general rule that nonrecourse debt would not be considered " at risk " was the treatment of " qualified nonrecourse financing . " To the extent allowed under Sec. 465(b) ( 6 ) , LLC members generally can include LLC liabilities as amounts " at risk " if the debt meets four qualifications : The debt is held for the purpose of holding real property , it is borrowed from a " qualified " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable for repayment , and the debt is not convertible debt . Therefore , losses from real estate LLCs were typically deductible by members to the extent of their share of the qualified nonrecourse debt . <p> The new memorandum clearly points out the risks to those LLC members if one of the other members guarantees the LLC debt . When the member makes the guarantee , the existing debts will no longer qualify as " qualified nonrecourse financing " because they fail the third leg of the test for qualification ( i.e. , a member is now personally liable to repay the debt ) . <p> Accordingly , the nonguaranteeing members of the LLC , who had previously included that portion of the qualified nonrecourse financing in their amount at risk and who have not guaranteed any portion of that debt , may no longer include that amount of debt in determining their amount at risk . If such a reduction causes a member 's at-risk amount to fall below zero , it will trigger immediate recapture of previously deducted losses under Sec. 465(e) . <p> This creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of the guarantor status of members whose tax returns they may not see because those members are not clients of the preparer of the LLC 's income tax return .

Bob Keebler is a partner with Keebler and Associates . His practice includes family wealth transfer and preservation planning , charitable giving , retirement distribution planning and estate administration . <p> We 're always thrilled to have him bringing the latest information to our members , so without further ado , Bob , I 'll let you take it away . <p> ROBERT S. KEEBLER , CPA : Well , thank you Sarah . It 's an honor to be here today . Before we get started , if you have n't done this already , please print form 8960 . I think for most of us , it 's going to help to have the form in your hand when I go through today 's materials . <p> Now also I want to mention to everyone , we just moments ago concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulations , and that 's going to be hosted on the AICPA 's website too . So even though this is very hands-on tech-schoolish , that was very , very good from both a practical and theoretical perspective . They brought a lot of wisdom . Their knowledge is incredible on these regs that they spent the last two years of their life working on . <p> Let 's jump up to page four . So right in front of you , if you have n't seen it yet , is the 8960 . This is a draft form , but Dave and Adrienne just told us that this form will not change a lot when it eventually comes out . So they 'll be some tweaking , but not a lot . <p> You are going to have to pay close attention . Up on the front , part one , there are some elections that are kind of nestled in between those first two lines . The election , when you 're -- they call it a 6013(G) election . It involves individuals that are married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one is not a US citizen . <p> There is also regulatory election , which we 'll talk about a little bit under 1411-10(G) under the regulations . Now when we start our form by -- our line-by-line looking at this , basically taxable interest , if you think about this from a computer perspective and if you were writing a computer program to do this , you would just grab taxable interest from the form 1040 . Okay , line 8 or form 41 , line 1 . <p> Now that 's not always going to be correct because there will be adjustments that are made a little bit later . So that 's going to be very easy . Now line one does include self-charged interest . Then you 're going to subtract that out later when we get to line 7 . So if you 're looking at line 1 , now look down to line 7 . You can see that 's the other modification . You would put a subtraction modification or a contra-income modification in at that moment . <p> Okay , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ordinary dividends . You 're going to grab that number off the 1040 , but you are going to have to make modification adjustments on line 7 . A great example out of the regs on modification would be someone that worked for , say , Procter &amp; Gamble . They had Procter &amp; Gamble stock . They have currently Procter &amp; Gamble stock in their plan . They take the dividend out of the plan and now it 's called a 404 dividend , and now that is not subject to the net investment income tax because the genesis of that is inside a qualified plan which is specifically exempted from the net investment income tax , or what I will call the NIIT . So the acronym for net investment income tax is the NIIT . <p> Line 3 , we have annuities , annuities from non-qualified plans , and you 're going to enter the taxable amount . That is going to come directly off the 1040 typically , and , you know , basically what you 're going to do is pick up the taxable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but $25 of that was basis , you would only pay tax on $75 . <p> Now on line 4 , we take from line 17 of the 1040 and we report all our real estate royalties , partnerships , S-corporations , trust distributions , etc . Now that is only half the story . Then on line 4B is where the real world happens , is where you make all your adjustments . For example , if you 're a real estate professional , you would subtract your real estate income . If you 're active in a partnership or an S-corporation that has a trade or business , you 'll just subtract that out . <p> If you had distributions from say a charitable remainder trust or grandfathered distributions from the net investment income tax , you would subtract that out . Those are all areas that we need to pay very close attention to . <p> Now on line 4B , that 's where we enter into our adjustments , and we 've kind of laid that out . But again , it 's trade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate professional . It 's royalties derived in the ordinary course of a section 162 business that is not a passive activity . Passive losses , former passive activities , other allowed as a deduction the current year by virtue of 469(f) ( 1 ) ( a ) . So those would be our adjustments at that point in time . <p> So far , this is fairly easy . Okay ? It 's understanding when you are allowed to make these adjustments under 4B that 's going to be the hard part , more of the regulatory side of things . Now line 4C you just combine those two . That 's just math . <p> Now 5 deals with capital gain , the gain or loss from the disposition of property . I sell $500,000 worth of Wells Fargo stock , a fairly easy transaction . I would put the number on line 5A . Then basically -- so you 're basically going to be combining 1040 lines 13 and 14 or 1041 lines 4 and 7 . <p> Generally , the income tax rules in IOC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these regulations has been a great deal of parallelism between the existing tax law under chapter one we 've worked with for years and the new tax law under chapter two that 's brand new to us . <p> Generally , the term disposition means a sale , an exchange , a conversion , a cash settlement , a transfer , and we have kind of laid that out . Now if you incur a gain or loss that is for whatever reason not reported on those lines , you 're going to have to make an adjustment and still have to report that . Okay ? You 'll report that on line seven . So you 'll report that on line seven . <p> Now line 5B is very similar to 4B . This is where you 're going to make modifications . For example , if you have a gain on the sale of a home , you 're able to pull that out , or a 1031 exchange . If we have a gain on the sale of a business , if we have a gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate professional , none of that would be subject to the net investment income tax , and we will subtract that out . <p> Now line 13 , all we 're doing -- I 'm sorry , line 5B , slide 13 is where we are right now . But line 5B , again , is where we 're making these modifications , and line 5C is nothing but math . So far , so good . <p> Basically , under C , we made an adjustment for the disposition of partnership interest or S corporation stock , basically items that are exempt -- items that are exempt from the net investment income tax . And then you have to attach a statement as described in the required statement section of the instructions to your return explaining what you did . <p> Now this will be hard , and it 's going to be very hard the first three or four times we do this when we basically have to figure out how much is excluded . Many times , not all of a business sale will actually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Okay , let 's go over to the next slide . Now on line 6 , we have adjustments attributable to controlled foreign corporations and a PFIC . If you own stock directly or indirectly in a CFC or a PFIC , you 're going to use line 6 to make adjustments necessary to calculate your net investment income . <p> If there is enough demand for it , we will evaluate -- the AICPA will evaluate whether we can put together another podcast just dealing specifically with the international aspects of the net investment income tax . <p> Line 7 and 8 , what we 're doing on line 7 and 8 is this is other modifications to investment income . These could be positive or negative . We 'll use line 7 to report additional net investment income modifications to net investment income that are not otherwise specified in lines 1 through 6 . We want to look at the instructions or examples of additions for examples of additions and modifications to net investment income that would be reported on line 7 . <p> Reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now one item is a deduction recovery . What is a deduction recovery ? If I took a deduction in 2013 , on my 2013 return for state income taxes , and then part of that was refunded to me by the state , that would be an example of a deduction recovery . That would be a real good example of a deduction recovery . <p> Now on line 8 , line 8 is nothing but math . It 's where I add everything up to come up with my total investment income . Now that is not the entire story because , of course , I need to get to what ? I need to get to net investment income . <p> So now , I go to part 2 -- parts 2 and 3 of the form . Okay ? And part 2 deals with investment expenses allocable to investment income and modifications where part 3 jumps into the actual tax computations . Now the first thing we see is line 9A are investment interest expenses . Now so I would take off of my itemized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line 9A . That would be interest expense you paid or accrued during the year from schedule A. <p> Generally , you 're going to be on the cash basis of accounting , so it 's going to be interest you actually paid . Now observation -- you are using the same cash or accrual basis that you used to prepare your 1040 . There is no going to a different accounting method for the NIIT . You 're going to be using the same method . Okay . <p> Now you enter form -- you basically will put this -- your interest expense on here . Now observation , it 's not always that easy . Okay ? It 's not always that easy because many times you are going to run into a -- either the 2% floor limitation under section 67 or the 3% PEASE limitation under 68 . <p> Now remember interest expense is not subject to those things , but items like state taxes would be . Okay ? So we have to be very cognizant of that . Okay , now let 's jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interestingly enough , is this were not complex enough , state income taxes are deductible to the NIIT to the extent that they are attributable to net investment income . <p> Let 's make this real clear . I earned $1 million worth of interest , dividends and capital gains . That 's my only income for the year , and I paid $80,000 worth of state taxes . At the end of the day when all is said and done , I 'm going to get to deduct that $80,000 on line 9B , reducing -- which will eventually reduce my total investment income . <p> Now I 'm on the cash basis of accounting . You know , I 'm thinking I 'm a real smart guy . I 'm not going to pay that until April 15 . Maybe you 're not so smart . What if in year one , 2013 , you had $20 million worth of income from the sale of your business , of which you paid $1.8 of California tax and in year two your income was $300,000 . Now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not going to work . You 're not going to get that benefit . Okay ? So you want to make sure you 're matching those up very , very carefully . <p> Now this may be all or part of the amount you reported on schedule A , line -- form 1040 , line 5A . It just depends on how much other income you have . Normally for individuals that are working or retired , it 's -- you 're going to have to do some math here because I 'm going to have income tax to pay on my IRA distribution . I 'm going to have income tax to pay on my wages . <p> Now for purposes of line 9B , sales taxes are not deductible in computing net investment income . We 're talking about state income taxes . Now state income taxes are subject to the 3% PEASE limitation , but they are not subject to the 2% floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions . <p> So that is what 's happening on line 9B . Actually , I think part 2 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , let 's jump up to the next slide , please . <p> Lines 9C and 9D , those are miscellaneous investment expenses . These are miscellaneous investment expenses is allowed -- is subject to the 2% floor for section 67 or the 3% PEASE limitation . So that 's -- that 's where we are right there . <p> Now that 's important for all of us to have our mind around because you 're not going to be able to go right to schedule A and grab those numbers from your schedule A on your 1040 and bring those over to line 9C . We 're going to have to make some adjustments . <p> There is a very extensive worksheet . What Dave Kirk and I agreed to do is we are going to interview him and Adrienne again and go through that worksheet , just so that everyone that is actually maybe preparing these returns can have the opportunity to hear directly from the author of the regulations how that worksheet works . <p> David Kirk is very , very good with math and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to listen to that when it comes out . <p> Okay , line 10 , additional modifications . So basically , we 're going to use line 10 of form 8960 to report additional deductions and modifications to net investment income that are not reflected on these first lines . Okay ? So that 's going to be what we pick up . <p> Now -- so you 're going to enter those . Typically , those are going to be positive numbers when we put that together . Now in line 11 , will be total deductions . So line 11 is going to be total deductions , and then finally we get to line 12 , which is nothing more than taking line 8 minus line 11 . That can not be less than 0 though . <p> This is one thing from a planning perspective we 're going to have to watch out for because it is possible because of a mismatch from an accounting perspective that we are not going to have enough . For example , you pay your state income taxes on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes are $1.8 , but your net investment income that particular year is only $800,000 . You 're going to have negative net investment income . You ca n't do that , okay ? You 're going to enter a zero on that line and you will have lost that benefit . So we want to be very careful with that from a planning perspective . <p> Now for individuals or estates and trusts , individuals -- when you get into the payment section or computational part , individuals would do lines 13 through 17 . Estates and trusts are going to work from 18A through line 21 . That 's fairly mechanical . <p> On the individual side of things when we start looking at line 13 , basically , that 's your modified adjusted gross income and that is going to be the front page of your 1040 and then you 're going to make adjustments for income that you 've excluded under section 911 of the code . So basically , for example , foreign earned income . <p> There will be a number of other -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then you have to compare your modified adjusted gross income to the threshold amounts . So you 'll compare those to the threshold amounts . And after you 've compared those to the threshold amounts , you 'll take your modified adjusted gross income on line 13 , subtract out the threshold amount , and if that is less than zero , you can stop . You will not have to pay a penny . You will not have to pay a penny of net investment income tax because you have not exceeded the threshold . <p> Now on line 15 , we want to -- what we 're going to do is we 're going to just do the math . If it 's 0 or less you 're going to enter 0 . On line 16 , you 're going to enter the smaller of line 12 or line 15 . Now this is a lesser-of equation . So now , we have a number on line 12 , which is coming from line 8 minus line 11 and we have our threshold amount , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there . <p> We include on line 16 the smaller of line 12 , our net investment income , or line 15 , the amount our MAGI exceeds the threshold . Now if line 15 was zero or less , we put nothing on line 16 . It 's that straightforward , so it 's actually very easy . <p> Now once we get a little bit further , we multiply that by .038% and we enter that . Now when we 're working on estates and trusts , this works a little bit differently . We multiply line 16 . We do the same transaction again and then we multiply that and we enter it on form 1040 . <p> When we 're working with estates and trusts , we have to take net investment income from line 12 and then we have to subtract from that . I 'll walk you through that . Let 's go up to slide 30 , please . So on line 12 , we basically have net investment income . Okay ? So then , we subtract from that deductions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What are we talking about ? We 're talking about I have a trust that I set up for my children . The trustee pays my children $100,000 one year . That $100,000 carries out to them as DNI . They have to pick that up on their income tax return . Let 's say the trust had net investment income of $110,000 . There would be a deduction for $100,000 , leaving $10,000 of income trapped within the trust . Okay ? That 's typically the nomenclature when we 're doing this . <p> Now under -- then what we have is that our undistributed net investment income . Our threshold amount , of course , is going to be last year $11,950 . Okay ? So that is our threshold amount . So if we 're over that , we 're going to pay the tax . <p> Guidance on calculating an estate or trust AGI for regular tax purposes can be found in the instructions to form 1041 on line 17 . If the estate or trust does not own a CFC or PFIC , enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you own a PFIC , you may need to modify that . Again , if there is enough need , let us know and we will try to do something specifically on the international aspects of all of this . <p> Okay , when we jump up to lines 19 , that 's the highest bracket for estates and trusts , and line 19C is just a subtraction . Basically , that 's when we start to compute . Up on line 20 we multiply the income of the estate or trust by 3.8% . <p> Now this has been a very quick run-through of the forms . Let 's just go a little bit further . I have an appendix here , which talks about netting losses for NIIT purposes . We may come back and do that at some point in time in the future . And then on slides 38 , we go into more detail on 67 and 68 limitations . Again , I 'll come back to that . <p> I think what 's important for all of us to know right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our software together , those 100 or 200 companies that are in this marketplace , are scrambling to come up -- to create form 8960 and to integrate into that the section 67 and 68 limitations . So those are -- it 's very important for us to have our mind around the fact that many people are going to be working the next four or five weeks to make this work . <p> But once that comes out , once those forms come out , those forms can not be taken like the gospel truth because we need to look back and make sure we agree with the computations . At least for the first two or three years we 're going to have to be doing some hand testing to make sure that the software is handling this right , especially when there are a lot of dollars involved . <p> Now again , 67 is your basically your 2% adjusted -- excuse me -- 2% floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions of section 67 and the overall limitation on itemized deductions in section 68 . We 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very painful detail . <p> A brief example on page 43 , Gary and Barb have passive interest on a number of investments that generate investment income of $50,000 . Assume the surtax applies to the NIIT. $5,000 of the expenses attributable to the investments or miscellaneous expenses . $25,000 of expenses attributable the investments are itemized deductions not subject to the 2% floor . In total , they itemize $50,000 in exemption -- in deductions after taking into account the 2% limitation on miscellaneous deductions , reducing their deductions for PEASE . A reduction of $30,000 is then going to be allowed against the NIIT . <p> So what we have is that would be the number that would carry over to the NIIT . <p> Okay , let 's jump up to page 45 please . Before I conclude , there are a number of resources available for post-ATRA and NIIT planning . We have those on slide 45 , and the AICPA has asked me to mention this . <p> In conclusion , thank you for joining us today . The net investment income tax is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for this tax season it 's going to be a challenge . We have to get our mind around this .

Shareholders may be only individuals , estates , certain types of exempt organizations , and certain types of trusts . This item describes eligible shareholder trusts and the elections they must make . An S corporation election may be jeopardized when a shareholder dies and his or her interest is transferred to a trust that is not eligible to be a shareholder or has not made the proper election . <p> Under Sec. 1361(c) ( 2 ) ( A ) , the trusts that may be qualified shareholders of an S corporation are : ( 1 ) trusts treated as owned by a U.S. citizen or resident individual under Secs . 671 " 679 ( grantor trusts ) ; ( 2 ) trusts that immediately before the death of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resident individual under Secs . 671 " 679 , but only for a period of two years , beginning on the day of the deemed owner 's death ( provided , however , that if an election is made under Sec. 645 to treat the trust as part of the estate , then the estate may hold the S corporation stock for the entire election period ) ; ( 3 ) trusts to which stock has been transferred by a will , but only for two years ; and ( 4 ) trusts formed primarily to exercise the voting power of stock transferred to them . If the trust does not fall under the above categories , it may still qualify as an S corporation shareholder by filing an election to be treated as a qualified subchapter S trust ( QSST ) or an electing small business trust ( ESBT ) . <h> Qualified Subchapter S Trusts <p> Under Sec. 1361(d) ( 3 ) , for a trust to qualify as a QSST , its terms must require that during the life of the current income beneficiary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trust 's accounting income must either be required by the terms of the trust instrument to be distributed , or actually be distributed , to the income beneficiary at least annually . The trustee must distribute trust accounting income directly to the beneficiary or to a custodial account for the benefit of a minor beneficiary . In addition , the trust 's terms must require that corpus distributions during the current income beneficiary 's life can be made only to that beneficiary ; the current income beneficiary 's income interest terminates at the earlier of the current beneficiary 's death or the termination of the trust ; and , if the trust terminates during the current income beneficiary 's life , the trust 's assets are all distributed to the current income beneficiary . <p> Under Regs . Sec. 1.1361-1(j) ( 3 ) , a trust that has multiple beneficiaries can meet the QSST single-beneficiary requirement if each beneficiary has a separate and independent share of the trust , each of which is treated as a separate trust for federal income tax purposes .

@@1074878 <h> Depletion Deductions for Landowners Receiving Gas Royalties <p> Posted by Guest Blogger on Mar 25 , 2014 <p> It is filing season and landowners receiving natural gas royalty payments may be shocked by their tax liability if they have not been planning with their CPAs . Landowners who sign a lease with a gas company own a royalty interest . When royalty income is received , the landowner is entitled to depletion . Similar to depreciation , depletion is the cost recovery of a natural resource and , in the case of royalty owners , natural gas . It is provided for by IRC -611 and the rules governing it are IRC - 613 and 613A . <p> The Internal Revenue Service provides for two methods : <p> Cost depletion - allows the taxpayer a deduction based on the ratio of units sold to the number of units available at the end of the year plus the units sold during the year . <p> Percentage depletion - allows the taxpayer a deduction based on the gross income of the gas producing property . <p> The IRS requires taxpayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percentage depletion is limited to royalty owners and independent producers who produce 1,000 barrels of average daily production of domestic crude oil or an equivalent amount of domestic natural gas . <p> Landowners , in a majority of situations , are going to be using percentage depletion on the royalty income . This normally entitles the royalty owner to a statutory amount of 15 percent depletion based on the property 's gross income . <p> The percentage depletion deduction is subject to two limitations : <p> The 100 percent taxable income limitation on the property - the property 's taxable income is the gross income less allowable deductions such as severance taxes and other administrative expenses . <p> The taxpayer 's 65 percent taxable income limitation - the taxpayer 's taxable income is computed without regard to any depletion on production , any IRC -199 deduction , net operating loss carryback to the taxable year or capital loss carryback to the taxable year . <p> The 65 percent taxable income limitation could come into play if the taxpayer has a loss in another business that is offsetting the royalty income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowed as a deduction in the following year . Tax preparers should be sure their software tracks any disallowed percentage depletion carryover amounts . <p> Percentage depletion is also not available on lease bonus payments , advance royalty payments or any other amount payable without regard to production from the property . This prevents upfront bonus payment from being eligible for percentage depletion . <p> For partnerships , the depletion allowance is calculated separately by the partners and not at the partnership level . For S corporations , the depletion allowance is calculated at the shareholder level . <p> Gas royalty owners also benefit by not having the percentage depletion considered a tax preference item for Alternative Minimum Tax purposes . <p> There have been many proposals to remove percentage depletion since it was introduced in the early 1920s . It ended for big oil producers in 1975 when IRC -613A was enacted . In President Obama 's fiscal year 2012 proposed budget , the repeal of percentage depletion was proposed . Other proposals include the Sustainable Energy Act , introduced in the Senate on Feb. 14 , 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House on Jul. 31 , 2013 . It is important for CPAs to ensure that their clients take advantage of percentage depletion while it is still available . <p> Ed Kollar , CPA , Senior Manager , ParenteBeard .

In that case , the employee does not have additional compensation or a deduction for the expense , but the employer deducts the expense and is subject to the deduction limit . If the employer treats the reimbursement as compensation , the employee may be able to deduct the expense as an employee business expense . In that case , the employee bears the expense and is subject to the deduction limit . The employer deducts the expense as compensation , which is not subject to the deduction limit under Sec. 274 . <p> Sec. 274(e) ( 3 ) ( B ) applies if the taxpayer performs services for a person other than an employer and the taxpayer accounts ( substantiates , as required by Sec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subsection in the Transport Labor case . In that case , the taxpayer , a leasing company that provided truck drivers to its clients , charged the clients for the wages and the per diem allowance it paid the truckers .

The final regulations contain a new definition of reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of Sec. 274(e) ( 3 ) , independent of the definition for accountable plan purposes in Sec. 62(c) . The regulations also clarify that the rules for applying the exceptions to the Secs . 274(a) and ( n ) deduction limits apply to reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements with employees , whether or not a payer is an employer .

@@1074891 <h> Earnings and Profits Computation Case Study <p> Earnings &amp; profits ( E&amp;P ) is the measure of a corporation 's economic ability to pay dividends to its shareholders . An up-to-date E&amp;P calculation is important for many corporate transactions , including determining whether a distribution to shareholders is a taxable dividend . <p> Calculating E&amp;P after the fact can require advisers to go back many years to examine all of the corporation 's records , sometimes taking into account the financial , transaction , and tax return information for the corporation since its inception . <p> In general , a corporation 's current-year E&amp;P is calculated by making adjustments to its taxable income for the year for items that are treated differently for E&amp;P purposes . <p> A distribution from a corporation is a dividend to the extent of the corporation 's current-year E&amp;P and accumulated E&amp;P . A distribution will be treated as a dividend to the extent of a corporation 's current-year E&amp;P , even if the corporation has an accumulated E&amp;P deficit . <p> It is important for businesses organized and taxed as regular corporations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing corporate tax treatment ) to maintain a current , accurate accounting of their earnings and profits ( E&amp;P ) . Almost every corporate transaction affects E&amp;P , and many transactions require an accurate accounting of the corporation 's E&amp;P to determine the appropriate tax treatment . <p> Although corporations are not required to report corporate E&amp;P on Form 1120 , U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return , they are responsible for knowing the company 's E&amp;P when it is relevant to determining the correct tax treatment of a transaction . As will be seen from this case study , maintaining an up-to-date accounting of a company 's E&amp;P is much easier than preparing the calculation after many years of neglect . A company with a current E&amp;P calculation is in the best position to respond to business transaction opportunities . <p> The E&amp;P operating rules generally require an accounting of a corporation 's current-year E&amp;P and the accumulated E&amp;P ( i.e. , generally the cumulative E&amp;P balance at the end of the prior tax year ) . These two E&amp;P balances must be determined and taken into account separately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E&amp;P allocation , or deemed distribution . <h> When E&amp;P Is Needed <p> Although the tax laws do not define E&amp;P or provide specific rules for how to compute it , there is authority for when E&amp;P affects a transaction and the adjustments that must be made to determine E&amp;P . The basic E&amp;P concept is not difficult to describe and understand " it is generally viewed as a corporation 's economic ability to pay dividends . Actually applying the mechanics of the existing E&amp;P rules , however , may be challenging for many practitioners . <p> Determining E&amp;P is not a simple process , or one in which the calculation can be performed quickly when and if needed . It is best performed when working from a carefully considered work plan , by a practitioner or project team with a sound understanding of the relevant authorities and with the detailed source records readily at hand ( this last point often is one of the more difficult aspects of an E&amp;P study , particularly for foreign corporations ) . <p> This case study describes , in general terms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothetical fact pattern to illustrate how the calculations are performed and provides a process and format to facilitate the efficient calculation of E&amp;P . <h> Facts <p> AnyCo Inc. is a midsize manufacturing company that has been in business for six years.1 The company has a single class of nonpublicly traded common stock outstanding held by a small group of unrelated shareholders . The company has primarily domestic U.S. sales , has been profitable in all but its second year of operations ( during the recession ) , and made a distribution to its shareholders only in its second year of operations . The company is planning a distribution to shareholders this year ( year 6 ) . Exhibit 1 shows the income , tax , distribution , and other adjustments for the six years of company operations , assuming net operating losses ( NOLs ) will be carried forward ( not back ) and a federal tax rate of 34% applies . <p> The primary rules governing the determination of E&amp;P and shareholder dividend treatment are contained in Secs . 301 , 312 , and 316 . These Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of regulations , rulings , cases , and other guidance setting forth the rules controlling what items and adjustments must be taken into account ( and when ) in determining E&amp;P . Even a practitioner who knows how the computations are made should nonetheless develop an organized process for performing the E&amp;P study to streamline what can otherwise be a time-consuming and complex project . <p> Determining a stand-alone corporation 's E&amp;P takes into account the financial , transaction , and tax return information for the company since its inception.2 The determination of E&amp;P for any given year generally starts with the company 's final adjusted taxable income for that year , taking into account the taxable income reported on the originally filed corporate tax return and any adjustments to the original taxable income amount , including amended returns or changes resulting from an IRS audit . Any changes to a company 's taxable income are often accompanied by a change in the tax liability for that year , which must also be taken into account in the computation . <p> Almost every corporate transaction has the potential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation 's E&amp;P is being determined , the company 's transaction history must be analyzed to determine any changes to E&amp;P resulting from a corporate transaction such as a merger or the liquidation of another corporation into the corporation for which E&amp;P is being calculated.3 The transaction history must start with the company 's formation and include all transactions from inception through the end of the year for which E&amp;P is being computed . <h> Increases to E&amp;P <p> Other current-year income and loss items that increase a corporation 's E&amp;P must be accounted for in the analysis . Often , these E&amp;P adjustments are amounts that are recognized for financial accounting purposes but are not income for income tax purposes . Adjustments that increase a corporation 's E&amp;P include tax-exempt income . Although it is not taken into account in determining taxable income , tax-exempt income increases a corporation 's ability to make distributions to shareholders and , accordingly , must be factored into a corporation 's E&amp;P calculations as an economic accession to wealth.4 Another example of a positive adjustment that increases E&amp;P but not current taxable income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be recognized as if the corporation did not use the installment method of accounting.5 <p> Additionally , amounts the corporation received that are subject to special deduction or exclusion , such as the Sec. 243 dividends-received deduction , must be included in the E&amp;P computation.6 <h> Decreases to E&amp;P <p> Expenditures of various types that are recognized for financial accounting purposes , yet are nondeductible and noncapitalizable for income tax purposes , will impair a corporation 's ability to make distributions and , therefore , must be deducted in computing E&amp;P . For example , the 50% portion of nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses7 must be taken into account as a reduction to E&amp;P . <p> Other examples of negative E&amp;P adjustments include the payment of nondeductible fines and penalties , 8 interest expense related to tax-exempt income , 9 club dues , 10 legal lobbying expenses and political contributions , 11 excess charitable contributions , 12 and capital loss carryforwards.13 This is just a sampling of the types of nondeductible expenses that must be deducted when computing E&amp;P . Note that the nondeductible expenses taken into account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not subject to capitalization.14 <p> It should be noted that the corporation 's NOL15 will be reflected in E&amp;P when incurred , without regard to any carryforward or carryback.16 The NOL represents an economic loss to the corporation and correspondingly impairs , in the year incurred , the corporation 's ability to make distributions to its shareholders . A current-year NOL will generally represent , after any appropriate E&amp;P adjustment as discussed below , a current-year E&amp;P deficit.17 <p> The payment of federal income taxes must also be taken into account as a reduction to E&amp;P.18 Corporations reporting taxable income for any year must pay the federal government the taxes , net of credits , owed . Payments of federal income taxes reduce a corporation 's ability to make distributions to shareholders and , accordingly , must be taken into account as a negative adjustment to E&amp;P.19 <h> E&amp;P Depreciation <p> To compute E&amp;P , depreciation deductions generally must be determined under the alternative depreciation system ( ADS ) .20 Under the ADS , depreciation calculations use a straight-line method and depreciable lives that are generally longer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the accelerated cost recovery system ( ACRS ) or the modified accelerated cost recovery system ( MACRS ) method in computing depreciation for regular taxable income purposes , Sec. 312(k) requires them to adjust E&amp;P for the difference between the two methods . <h> Distributions <p> Finally , a corporation 's distribution history must be taken into account when preparing an E&amp;P study.22 All current- and prior-year distributions of money , property , and corporate obligations must be considered . Generally , the E&amp;P analysis must consider the full amount of every corporate distribution ; however , only the distributions made from current or accumulated E&amp;P will reduce E&amp;P.23 In addition to reviewing the Schedule M-2 , Analysis of Unappropriated Retained Earnings per Books , from a corporation 's annual Form 1120 , a detailed analysis of year-to-year changes in the corporation 's stockholders ' equity accounts is recommended to assure that all distributions and any other adjustments to stockholders ' equity have been taken into account and analyzed for their effect on E&amp;P.24 The accumulated E&amp;P determination will take into account as a negative adjustment dividend distributions made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not factor in current-year distributions as a negative adjustment.25 Note that distributions may not create a current or accumulated E&amp;P deficit . <h> AnyCo Example E&amp;P Calculation <p> The dividend definition rules under Sec. 316(a) ( 2 ) provide that a distribution is treated as a dividend to the extent of the distributing corporation 's current-year E&amp;P . If the distributing corporation has no current E&amp;P ( e.g. , a current-year E&amp;P deficit ) , the distribution will nevertheless constitute a dividend to the extent of the corporation 's accumulated E&amp;P from prior years . <p> Exhibit 2 illustrates AnyCo 's E&amp;P calculation for its first five years of existence . <p> As the dividend ordering and tracing rules reflect , if a corporation is currently profitable and its current-year distribution is less than the current-year E&amp;P , dividend treatment will attach to the distribution without regard to a corporation 's accumulated E&amp;P ( or accumulated E&amp;P deficit ) . For many taxpayers , this treatment is an unexpected result . When a corporation experiences a series of loss years , such as in the case of a startup company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders in that year , the dividend rules require the distribution to be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of current-year E&amp;P , despite the accumulated E&amp;P deficit ( losses ) . <p> The dividend rules further clarify that E&amp;P for the current year is determined at the close of the year without reduction for distributions paid during the year . The rules that define what a dividend is under Sec. 316 are designed to address varying distribution and E&amp;P fact patterns to include distributing corporations with current but no accumulated E&amp;P , no current E&amp;P but with accumulated E&amp;P , and no current or accumulated E&amp;P . The distribution will be sourced to the distributing corporation 's E&amp;P , whether current E&amp;P , accumulated E&amp;P , or both . A distribution a corporation makes to its shareholders is a dividend to the extent of the corporation 's current-year and accumulated E&amp;P . <p> Sec. 301(c) requires a shareholder to recognize the receipt of the corporate distribution as a dividend to the extent the distribution is paid from E&amp;P as described in Sec. 316 . Distributions in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shareholder as a return of capital , and any excess distribution will generally be recognized as capital gain.26 <p> In the AnyCo example , applying the E&amp;P rules results in the entire distribution 's being treated as a dividend . A $400,000 distribution in year 6 will be sourced first from the current-year E&amp;P , as shown in Exhibit 3 . Of the $400,000 distribution , the current-year E&amp;P will cover the first $117,000 . The remaining $283,000 distribution amount will be absorbed by the accumulated E&amp;P balance of $356,800 . <p> Accumulated E&amp;P following reduction for the year 6 distribution will be $73,800 , which will be the accumulated E&amp;P balance at the beginning of year 7 . <p> Determining a corporation 's E&amp;P requires a detailed investigation into the corporation 's earnings and transaction history . The full scope of the rules governing corporate taxation must be taken into account when performing an E&amp;P study . The conceptual and mechanical complexity of the analysis will often challenge even the most seasoned corporate tax adviser . Add to that the fact that many corporations do not maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go back many years to complete the E&amp;P analysis and potentially begin the analysis with the date of incorporation ( which could be many decades ago ) , and the task seems even more daunting . A successful E&amp;P study requires an understanding of the relevant corporate tax rules and applying them to the large amount of data and information that must be obtained and organized . <p> Footnotes <p> 1This case study involves a single corporation . The consolidated return regulations include special rules for E&amp;P calculations involving members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return , treating the affiliated group as a single entity ( see Regs . Sec. 1.1502-33 ) . These regulations are complex and must be studied carefully when preparing an E&amp;P determination for a consolidated group member . A detailed discussion of consolidated return E&amp;P is beyond the scope of this article . <p> 2 An E&amp;P study must generally take into account all earnings and profits of the corporation from the earlier of Feb. 28 , 1913 , or inception of the corporation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 381(c) ( 2 ) identifies E&amp;P as a corporate attribute that will transfer to the acquiring corporation and must generally be taken into account in a carryover basis transaction described in Sec. 381 " generally a merger or liquidation . Where either the acquirer or target in a Sec. 381 transaction has a deficit in E&amp;P ( i.e. , negative E&amp;P ) , special rules may apply to account for the deficit . Further discussion of the E&amp;P carryover rules and related restrictions is beyond the scope of this article . <p> 6 Regs . Sec. 1.312-6(b) . For example , the receipt of a $100 portfolio dividend would be reflected in taxable income only to the extent of $30 ( $100 dividend income less a $70 dividends-received deduction ) , but E&amp;P must be increased by the $70 dividends-received deduction amount to accurately reflect that the company has a full $100 economic accession to wealth . <p> 7 Sec. 274(n) generally restricts deductions for meals and entertainment expenses incurred in a trade or business activity to 50% of the otherwise allowable amount . <p> 9 See generally Sec. 265 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E&amp;P and should be accompanied by any related expenses or interest costs incurred to acquire or hold the tax-exempt asset ) . <p> 14 Generally , many E&amp;P adjustments taken into account as increases and decreases to E&amp;P can be found in the corporation 's annual tax returns , Form 1120 , on Schedules M-1 , Reconciliation of Income ( Loss ) per Books With Income per Return , and M-3 , Net Income ( Loss ) Reconciliation for Corporations With Total Assets of $10 Million or More . <p> 23 It should be noted that while corporate distributions are taken into account when determining E&amp;P , corporate capital contributions are not . Capital contributions generally do not increase E&amp;P . <p> 24 For example , another equity-related adjustment that may be revealed by reviewing the stockholder equity accounts is the exercise of company stock options issued as compensation for personal services . See Rev. Rul. 2001-1 , 2001-1 C.B. 726 .

The process is typically coordinated by an NFP 's leadership team and officers . Some organizations have a dedicated nominating committee that collaborates with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board members and assist in recruitment and orientation . <p> During recruitment , you can meet with and share information with your prospective board member , provide an overview of your mission and business strategy , and help them understand your expectations in terms of time commitment and participation in meetings and activities . Think of this as a two-way interview where you find out whether the individual has the expertise and leadership skills needed by your organization . This is a good time to discuss fundraising goals and expectations concerning board member involvement . Meeting one-on-one will help you gauge their level of interest and passion for your organization 's mission , which helps make sure there are no misunderstandings later on . <p> Once an individual is officially appointed to the board , they should then receive the information and tools they need to successfully oversee and advise the organization , such as : <p> Bylaws <p> Financial statements <p> Form 990 returns <p> Audit reports <p> Strategic plan <p> Budget reports <p> Organizational policies <p> Do n't just share the policies and documents , take an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@1074922 <h> Tips to Make Your Not-for-Profit Clients ' Next Audit a Success <p> Posted by Guest Blogger on Jan 04 , 2016 <p> Times have changed significantly from when I started performing audits over 20 years ago . U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards have evolved , and now emphasize the auditee 's responsibility for financial reporting . Today , not-for-profits are in charge of identifying and recording the adjustments necessary to close their books , gathering the financial statements and designing control systems needed to prevent , detect and correct errors that may occur . As a result , the cost and efficiency of the audit is directly impacted by how well your clients prepare . Here are some best practice tips to help them prepare : <p> Create a detailed timeline . It is a good idea to meet with clients at least three months prior to the start of the audit to identify key dates and milestones , such as when the client-prepared information will be completed , when the audit will start , when draft financial statements will be provided to management , and when meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place . If your firm is also providing tax services , the timeline should include the expected completion date of the client-prepared tax schedules , as well as the delivery date for the IRS Form 990 . All parties should agree to , and receive a copy of the schedule containing these items . This will define each party 's responsibility in meeting the final deadline . <p> Involve those charged with governance in the planning process . US Generally Accepted Auditing Standards clearly state that it is the responsibility of management , and those charged with governance , to develop a system of internal control capable of detecting and mitigating fraud risk . As a result , the not-for-profit 's audit committee ( or a similarly functioning governance team ) should be involved in audit planning . Take the opportunity to advise the audit committee about best practices . Inquire about the process in place to train new audit committee members and to educate them about risks , internal controls and other risk response strategies . Also , take the time to discuss the organization 's Audit Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee will lead to a lower-risk audit " and , hopefully , a more efficient one . <p> Encourage clients to honor their commitment . I recommend asking for client-prepared schedules at least one week prior to the start of field work . This ensures that the not-for-profit is ready for its audit , and allows the auditor to perform a preliminary review of the prepared schedules . Once you 've received your client 's information , you can verify that schedules have been prepared in the format needed , that they tie to the trial balance and that the trial balance rolls forward from the prior year . You can also identify potential issues that will need to be addressed during the audit . <p> Explain that the audit is a team effort . Once the audit has started , you will still need assistance from your clients . They will be able to supply any additional documentation you need , and answer any questions you might have . Your client should plan to have its accounting staff available to answer questions , pull additional documentation needed and assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your clients work together to plan the audit and adhere to the established timeline , the result will be a more efficient and cost effective audit for your firm and your client . <p> My Experience <p> The first time I tried this with my client , I was nervous about how it would be received . After all , the process places a higher expectation on the client . To my surprise , 95% of the clients really liked it , because our expectations regarding field work timing and performance were much more clearly defined . Additionally , the client was more clearly able to visualize the process from start to finish . Now , clients ask me when we can start working on the timeline . The result : increased efficiencies and increased client satisfaction . It 's a win/win . <p> The AICPA Not-for-Profit Section offers auditing and accounting resources , including illustrative financial statements , account work papers in Excel and a checklist of required auditor communications .
