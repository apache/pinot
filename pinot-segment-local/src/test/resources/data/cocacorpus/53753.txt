Mark has been passionately and dynamically involved in the evolution of Australian dance music since he jumped head first into the Australian music scene back in the mid nineteen-nineties . Unprecedented for any other Australian dance artist , he has a staggering twenty-nine mix CD 's , ten original releases and numerous remixes which have catapulted his worldwide sales to nearly two million to date . At the height of his globally renowned alliance and undyingly popular Ministry of Sound association , Mark 's " The Annual 2007 " mixed alongside John Course , became the highest selling compilation in history on Australian shores .

Consequently , as has been witnessed by his longevity , Mark Dynamix is as timeless an artist as they come . <p> What Mark is exceptionally good at , is predicting trends and managing to stay ahead of the times . So , with a little initiative and fair amount of courage , Mark recently decided to chair his own music label , Long Distance Recordings , which currently features a roster that includes the cream of Australian tech and house talent alongside his own releases . Why , you ask ? That 's simple ; to bridge the gap between the underground Australian and renowned European dance scenes . So let it be known ; it 's no secret that Long Distance Recordings is effectively bringing you closer to the style of beats you can be blessed with across the seas - the name is definitely no coincidence . And with 2008 witnessing the first few releases off the newly formed label , 2009 saw the independent institution step up it 's game tenfold . Mark showcased more production prowess with original tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Flipper " and " Moment of Confusion between Man and Dog " , alongside a tour of Europe late in 2009 . <p> Mark kicked off 2010 with a national tour ( Big Day Out no less ) , and followed on with gigs in Japan and New Zealand alongside his many Australia slots including Chinese Laundry ( Sydney ) , Brown Alley ( Melbourne ) and Family ( Brisbane ) . 2011 has already seen an ARIA charting single release " I Gotcha " produced with Nick Galea and an iTunes chart topping album " The Annual 10 Years " under the Ministry Of Sound banner , for which he has just completed a nationwide tour on the mainstream club circuit . As one of the very few DJ 's in Australia who manages to balance the mainstream sounds with his trademark underground flavour , Mark enjoys being able to play a variety of music to different crowds , without prejudice . On the cards for the remainder of 2011 is a full double artist album collecting all his tracks and remixes from various labels around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time some of them have been released commercially and will be available on iTunes and all online music stores near the end of the year .

We should see this available in September . <p> With the addition of number 1 DJ in Australia as voted by popRepublic magazine alongside his number 1 and number 2 DJ accolades with 3D World magazine and InTheMix Top50 number 2 positioning for 3 years in a row , Mark has proved time and time again , he 's a once in a lifetime figure within the Australian EDM scene , with plenty more to ignite our senses . <p> JOHN COURSE <p> When you start your DJ career by winning a couple of DMC mixing competitions you get noticed ... but to still be around more than two decades later takes more than vinyl juggling skills ...

A resident of super club One Love from opening night until the last record played there , he has literally DJ 'd too many gigs to mention . In 2015 John is a resident at two of Melbourne 's newest venues ( Friday Nights at MsCollins , Saturday nights at The Emerson ) and still plays regularly across Australia &amp; in party spots such as Koh Samui in Thailand , the Paradise Club in Mykonos and Scorpio 's Beach club in Mykonos . <p> From the skills learnt early in his career scratching and mixing vinyl , John 's technical prowess is still visible as he manipulates today 's digital sounds via a bank of CDJ 's .

Best described as simply a House Music DJ , no matter the style , in the age of the bedroom and promoter DJ , John 's technical skills are only surpassed by his experience in programming the right music for the crowd in front of him , one of the basic principles of a good DJ . It is probably that trait alone that ensures he is still one of the most in demand DJs in the Australia .

@@71984123 @684123/ <h> Code One &amp; Rhythm Section Presents 80480 @qwx700480 <p> Chess Records is the most famous record label in Blues History . It created the ' Chicago Blues ' sound , and released classic recordings by Muddy Waters / Howlin ' Wolf / Little Walter / Bo Diddly / Elmore James / Sonny Boy Williamson / Chuck Berry and many more . English bands such as The Rolling Stones / John Mayall / The Yardbirds and Manfred Mann copied their music and created their own style during the Blues Boom of the late 60 's . <p> Brothers Leonard and Philip Chess were two Jewish immigrants from Poland who came to Chicago in 1928 . They were involved in the liquor business and by the 1940 's , they owned several bars on the south side of Chicago . Their largest establishment was a nightclub called the Macomba . The Macomba had live entertainment , many of those being blues performers that had migrated to Chicago from the Mississippi delta in the ' 30s and ' 40s . They realized that these performers were not being properly recorded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 they entered into a partnership with Charles and Evelyn Aron inAristocrat Records.The Arons had just formed Aristocrat Records to record blues , jazz and rhythm &amp; blues . <p> The most important artist to record on Aristrocrat was McKinley Morganfield , who recorded as Muddy Waters and had several successful singles on the label in 1947 and 1948 . He had migrated from Mississippi to Chicago a few years before and was working semi-professionally until he met the Chess brothers . Initially his records contained only himself , a piano and bass and his raw singing style reflected the spirit of the bars he played in . Through their connections with radio stations and local clubs , the Chess brothers were able to build Muddy Waters into Chicago 's leading blues singer . <p> In late 1949 , Leonard and Phil Chess purchased the interests of the Arons and became the sole owners of Aristocrat Records . On June 3 , 1950 , they reorganized the company and changed its name to Chess Records . Chess Records flourished in those early days of both rhythm and blues and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specialty , Imperial , Modern and King were giving the public music that they could not get from the larger , established " major " record companies . <p> With the success of Muddy Waters , other young Mississippi bluesmen were drawn to Chicago , many joined Muddy 's band . One of the most brilliant musicians to play with Muddy was Little Walter Jacobs , whose outstanding harmonica made the band even better . In 1952 , Chess formed a subsidiary label called Checker , and Little Walter recorded in his own right for the label . His first release was an instrumental called " Juke " which topped the Rhythm and Blues charts . He was able to top the charts again in 1955 with the vocal " My Babe " . <p> A young record producer in Memphis Tennessee named Sam Phillips was recording a 300 pound farm worker named Chester Burnette , who became known as the " Howlin ' Wolf " . At the time he recorded Howlin ' Wolf , Phillips , who later established Sun Records , did not have a record company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chess brothers . " How Many More Years " backed with " Moanin in the Moonlight " was a hit in 1951 . Soon , Howlin ' Wolf migrated to Chicago and signed with Chess Records . In 1956 , Chess was able to recapture the intensity of his earlier Memphis recordings with the hit " Smokestack Lightnin ' " . Howlin ' Wolf recorded for many years on Chess and was one of the most influential bluesmen in history , his influence can be heard in the music of many of the young British and American blues players that became so successful in the ' 60s and ' 70s . <p> In addition to Muddy Waters , Howlin ' Wolf and Little Walter , Chess recorded many other giants of post- war American blues such as Sonny Boy Williamson , Lowell Fulson , Memphis Slim , Jimmy Rogers , John Lee Hooker and Willie Mabon . Later , they recorded the next generation of Chicago blues artists with Buddy Guy , Little Milton and Koko Taylor . <p> In 1954 , Chess recorded two black vocal groups , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had appeal to the white record buying public , also . The songs were " Sincerely " by the Moonglows and " I 'll Be Home " by the Flamingos . Before the records could become big hits , though , they were covered by white singers , the McGuire Sisters with " Sincerely " and Pat Boone with " I 'll Be Home " who took most of the record sales . Even though they did not get the sales , the Chess Record company became known to record distributors as a company that could produce hit music . <p> In 1955 , on a vacation trip to Chicago a young singer and guitar player from St. Louis named Chuck Berry met Muddy Waters , who encouraged him to see the Chess brothers . Chuck Berry auditioned for them with a song he had written called " Ida Red " , Leonard and Phil liked the song but suggested a name change , the song was renamed " Maybellene " and became the first of his many Top 40 hits . With Chuck Berry , Chess Records had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records by white recording artists . Chuck Berry recorded for the Chess brothers for many years producing hit after hit . The songs he wrote and recorded for Chess include many of the signature songs of rock and roll ; " Roll Over Beethoven , " " Johnny B. Goode , " " Sweet Little Sixteen , " " Rock and Roll Music , " " Memphis , " " Brown Eyed Handsome Man " and " School Day " among them . He is one of the giants of Rock and Roll and was one of the initial 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . <p> Another singer/songwriter who could not be duplicated was discovered by Chess in 1955 . His name was Elias McDaniels , who had moved from Mississippi to Chicago with his family as a boy . He auditioned for the Chess brothers with a song he had written called " Uncle John " . Again , they liked the song but not the title , so McDaniels changed it to his own nickname , one that he had used as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo Diddley to a long term contract . His distinctive " Shave and a Haircut " rhythm was a staple on Checker Records for many years . His biggest hit was the self titled " Bo Diddley " backed with " I 'm a Man " in 1955 . <p> In 1956 , Chess established a jazz subsidiary called Argo , and built an impressive stable of influential jazz artists like Sonny Stitt , James Moody , Yusef Lateef , Gene Ammons , Lou Donaldson , Lorez Alexandria , Ahmad Jamal and Ramsey Lewis . The catalog of albums on Argo was extensive . Even though Argo was primarily a jazz label , it also contains the work of Etta James , one of the finest female rhythm and blues artists ever , who is still making excellent albums today . In 1965 the name of the label was changed to Cadet , because of the existence of another record company called Argo in England . <p> Also in 1956 , Chess began taking a bigger interest in music from New Orleans by signing veteran Paul Gayten to represent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a hit " Ai n't Got No Home " in 1956 and " ( I Do n't Know Why ) But I Do " and " You Always Hurt the One You Love " in 1961 . Gayten also recorded Bobby Charles and Eddie Bo for Chess . <p> The Chess religious and gospel recordings are also extensive . Chess devoted an entire series to the sermons of the Rev. C.L Franklin , pastor of the 4500 member New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit Michigan . They were also the first company to record his daughter Aretha Franklin , when as a teenager she recorded gospel music for the label . Their gospel catalog is almost exclusively contained on the Checker 10000 series and includes albums by the Five Blind Boys , Soul Stirrers , Alex Bradford and the Violinaires . <p> During the early years of the label , Leonard and Phil Chess did everything . They were the quintessential ' 50s record men : they owned the label , they produced the music they loved themselves and managed the financial end of the business . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the creative side of the business to employees . In 1959 , they were able to hire the veteran producer Ralph Bass away from King Records in Cincinnati to serve as A&amp;R Director . Bass continued to record blues , gospel , and rhythm and blues . He brought in a young black producer named Billy Davis who expanded the company into soul music , Davis revived the career of Etta James and turned her into Chess Records ' first soul star . A group called the Dells , which had formed in Harvey Illinois in 1953 went back and forth between Chess and another Chicago label Vee Jay several times , but when they came back to Chess in 1967 , they recorded the fantastic album " There Is " which contained six hits , " Oooo , I Love You " , " Stay in My Corner " , " Run For Cover " , " There Is " , " Show Me " and " Wear It on Your Face " . The Dells recorded many more albums for Cadet but never again reached the pinnacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a native of Washington D.C. first came to Chess in 1956 through Bo Diddley . Stewart played piano and sang with Diddley 's band . In 1962 , Stewart returned to Chess with his unique vocal style , which involved a stuttering , rapid-fire explosion of words . He recorded a string of soul hits for Chess , including " I Do Love You " , " Sitting in the Park " and " Summertime " . Other soul hitmakers for Chess were Fontella Bass who had the great hit " Rescue Me " , Sugar Pie Desanto , Mitty Collier , Jackie Ross , Little Milton , the Radiants , Laura Lee and Jo Ann Garrett . <p> Chess Records was the great American blues record company . There is a story we 've heard , perhaps even true , that when Brian Jones first saw Keith Richards , he started talking to him because he noticed he was carrying a copy of Chess LP-1427 , " The Best of Muddy Waters . " Jones wanted to find out where he got it . When they formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' songs , " Rollin ' Stone . " The Rolling Stones later came to Chicago to pay homage to the company by recording much of their album " The Rolling Stones Now ! " at the Chess Ter Mar studios . <p> The late ' 60s were banner years for Chess , which makes the decline and fall of Chess Records hard to understand . In 1968 , Billy Davis , the producer responsible for much of the soul music output , left to join an advertising agency as music director , and Leonard Chess , the creative force behind the company became more and more involved in a radio station he owned , WVON . When Billy Davis left , much of the cohesion in the creative staff was lost and many other producers and songwriters left . Ralph Bass stayed , but most of the talent was gone . In 1969 , Leonard and Phil Chess sold Chess to General Recorded Tape ( GRT ) for 6 million dollars plus 20 thousand shares in GRT stock . In October 1969 , the company suffered a devastating blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the summer of 1972 , the Chess Chicago offices were almost empty , the distribution company and pressing plants had been closed , and only the Chess Ter Mar studio was operating with a few employees . By the summer of 1975 , GRT was dismantling what was left of Chess . In August 1975 , with all of the GRT record operations closed down , what remained of Chess Records , was sold to New Jersey-based All Platinum Records . Although originally intended to be run as an active label , shortage of capital reduced the great Chess Records to a reissue label . When the Chess building in Chicago was sold , the new owners brought in dumpsters and chain saws and destroyed 250,000 records that had been abandoned there . It 's sad to think of all that great music ; Chuck Berry , Howlin ' Wolf , Little Walter , Bo Diddley , Etta James and Muddy Waters being hauled away to a landfill . Even though the records were destroyed , the master tapes survived and are now the property of MCA , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1990s . <p> Chess Records got into the long play record business relatively late , never having made any 10 inch albums as their contemporaries Atlantic , Aladdin , King , Imperial and Modern did . Their first album releases were in 1956 with several Argo jazz releases , all of them in the 12 inch format . The first album on Chess itself was the soundtrack of the movie " Rock , Rock , Rock " , which came out in December 1956 and may be the first commercially released rock and roll motion picture soundtrack . Most of the black label Chess and Checker albums by their major blues and rock and roll stars are now very collectable and in demand . Even more collectable are a few of the early white label promotional albums which were pressed on multi-colored vinyl , those known to be available in this form are Chess LP-1439 and LP- 1441 , Checker LP-2971 and LP-2973 and Argo LP-649 .
