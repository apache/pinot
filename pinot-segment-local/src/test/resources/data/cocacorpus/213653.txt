Also , what is the phone policy there . Can we have cell phones ? When can we use the phones ? Thanks for your help . It is greatly appreciated . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You can have cell phones , but you wont be able to use them until week 5 or later . I was in the oct 5 class and we did n't  get phones till damn near then end . so take it , but do n't  plan on using it . The phone will have to stay in your security drawer . As for the phone policy , you will get some phone priveleges in phase 2 . You ARE allowed a 10 minute phone call on sunday week one . Also , you can work with the chaplain ............... <p> Just keep in mind when your down there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut up . Try to organize and prioritize by what is really important ( test , briefing , memo ) then go from there . They are going to try and load you up with useless garbage that they themselves ( the staff ) do n't  even read . Just keep in mind the first day/week/2 weeks , that things will get better and believe it or not , you will have some fun and have some good memories to take home . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest flyer331 <p> Hello everyone .

" I do n't  think there is a set timeframe in which they have to get everything issued back out . Typically turn-around time is about 2-3 months . Some have experienced shorter , and others experience a longer wait , who knows .. My wait was only 2 months ... <p> Check out what others have posted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437700 <p> Plan on getting up at 5am everyday ( definitely for the first 2-3 weeks ) and marching to the DFAC for breakfast . Then plan on having classes for the rest of the day along with a few drill practices within the first few weeks . After dinner you 'll be on your own the rest of the night with 11pm curfew during phase 1 and midnight during phase 2 . During the evening , you will have plenty of meetings and academic work to keep you occupied till curfew . The first few weeks suck but get much better as the weeks go on . The last week is a lot of fun with a lot of flight/wing dinners along with graduation .

Are you even able to go to bathroom if need be , or are they sort of laid back . Are you in ABU 's throughout the day , or do they require classroom work to be done in blues ? Also , what kind of work do they assign you ? I 've heard that it is mostly busy work , but what sort of busy work ? Thanks for the information , anything helps when you 're amped up to get there . <p> They will give you a break every hour or so during the classroom setting . You will be drinking a ton of water while you are there , so breaks are frequent . Most often , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will give you a 5 to 10 minutes break for the pisser . <p> 99% of the time , UOD is ABU 's . You will only wear your blues a handful of times , or when you phase , you will wear blues to go off campus or base which ever you choose . <p> Yes , a ton of busy work . When you start , you need to learn to prioritize ! What is important and what is not so important . If you get there on Sat morning and start setting up your room with a fine tooth comb , it will make it easier for you to prioritize your busy work . Examples : type your memo that 's due , or type the 2 page reflective assignment on why it 's important to lock your security drawer . Obviously , the stuff that 's graded takes priority . Yeah , you may get yelled at or even given another assignment to do because you did n't get it done for the very reason of graded academics , but in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and allow you to graduate . Focus on whets graded , everything else is just to clog you up . You will hear them say " take a risk , " well that 's a perfect example of one . You took a risk on getting your ass chewed because a graded assignment is more important than a two page BS assignment that he/she gave you to teach you a lesson . Get it ? <p> Use your time wisely . I ca n't stress that enough . When you get released for the day , relax for a little break and then get to it on studying . The material is not hard by any stretch , but there is a ton of it . The tests are not " rocket surgery " ( that comment will make sense when you get there ) however ( comma ) ( so will that one ) you need to know the material well enough to distinguish between answers . <p> Best advice : Make the best of it , realize that the first week and second week will end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep your cool AND **PLAY THE GAME**** <p> Oh and when you get phase 2 , do n't freak out and turn stupid . We did , and got phased back to 1 ..

Do we know when those start ? <p> I would appreciate any help or information you can provide . <p> Thanks . <p> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through AMS before you continue on to you technical school to learn your job . AMS is not that bad honestly , the first 2 weeks suck but after that , its all academics and the " mind game . " AMS is at Maxwell AFB in Montgomery , Alabama . ( Right in the fuggin ghetto ) You 'll get there and have no idea what you are supposed to do ; believe me dude , its a cluster fvck . Find your room and get started on setting it up . Like I said , the first two weeks suck . You cant do anything right , no matter how well you do it . You will get yelled at . When week 3 starts , you will see the instructors back off a lot . Just remember that they ca n't touch you , cant even cuss at you , and the worst they can make you do is 5 pushups . Remember that going down there . The yelling will intimidate you no doubt at first , but after a few hours it just gets annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while your down there , do all your work and help out your bro where needed and you will graduate with flying colors . Its mainly geared toward academics . It 's not set up to " brainwash " you like you have heard about military training so many times before . Just get through it . <p> As far as the training classes left this year in 2010 , that 's going to be up to the guard bureau . You should be submitting a packet of info to your respective unit in order to process you into training classes . Chances are that if you have n't already done this , you may only be able to make the last class for 2010 , if you 're lucky . They will tell you when your classes and training are , its not up to you to find out . they are SUPPOSED to do it all for you , but often in the guard we end up making many phone calls trying to get the information we need pushed along . <p> Hope this helps .

We technicians are members of the Guard who are also employed in full-time support roles as Federal Employees . We wear the uniform and play the military game but get paid as Fed GS/WG during the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay from the military . <p> To get a job like this you need to be in drilling Reserve status with the unit . So yes you do have to go to AMS and become a military officer to do it . You can go through AMS just fine without military experience , there were people in my class who did it . <p> Once you get commissioned through AMS , you can start your job . Technicians only work 40 hours a week ( we get comp time if we need it ) , we get all the regular Fed Employee benefits . You will do whatever is called out in your job description ... look up GS 0810 series if you are interested ... you will probably oversee construction projects as a COR ... do a Google search for SRM , MILCON , etc . You will also perform work as needed to support the part timers of your squadron ( ie. plan UTA training , Silver Flag , etc ) . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Viper Style 09 <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the vulnerability of it in the unlocked rooms ( especially if it is brand new ) .

If it 's being advertised as a GS-12 , it 's most likely a " dual status " job that , as you mentioned , requires you to be a traditional guardsmen as well . These full-timers still wear the uniform every day , but get paid through a vast/complex pay system that I wo n't even begin to describe now . The full-time positions are fairly competetive , but are open to people such as yourself with no prior military experience . I have seen hundreds of civilians get hired into Officer positions , altough honestly getting hired directly into a full-time slot is rare . <p> AMS has changed a lot recently , so take this with a grain of salt , but the classes used to start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and August . Sounds like they will be getting rid of at least the May class due to ROTC conflicts at the new base . To get a class date , you have to first be hired by whatever ANG base you are considering . Once that happens , they will get the ball rolling as far as forwarding your information to Guard Bureau and getting class dates . For a non-rated career field like CE , it should be a little easier to get through this system , but a safe bet would be to plan on it taking nearly a year from interview to AMS class date , if not longer . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have been told not to bring my own computer to AMS due to the vulnerability of it in the unlocked rooms ( especially if it is brand new ) .

The computer access system was all jacked up in more ways than Nick Nolte after a night on the town . Again , I was a non-prior , so I wanted to make things as simple and easy as possible . Take the shiny cheap shoes , just a quick wipe and you are good to go . Honestly dude , I would n't worry about the squegee or anything like that . You are going to have to get 15 gigs to fail a room inspection ... Save yourself the trouble by making sure your room ( drawers and closet ) are good and it will make life easy on you . If the shower is dripping wet , 1 gig . If there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save yourself and your roomate the grief of wiping it down after every use and just take the hit . A good tip to remember is to take your showers at night and leave all doors open . Ususally the shower will be dry by 0500 . Room inspections are a joke at AMS.

From January to June , they are going to conduct the test and apply the results to the old standards , and then they will measure how that person would have scored with the new standards . After this trial period , they will begin officially scoring using the new standard in July . So the Jan and March AMS classes will still be graded based on the old standard . <p> As far as to where to find the fitness requirements , I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are non-prior and do n't have access to the portal , I googled and found http : //www.airforce-pt.com/ , which shows the old standards .

Earlier in the tour he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked nice ( actually some early Japanese digital watches they got cheap in Bangkok ) . - Upon asking , they told him that they were " Lockheed U-2 watches " given by Lockheed to pilots who had flown operational missions .

The other guys told him that Travis did have the watches , but was just slow to respond and you had to bug him a lot to finally get one. - Then came the " flies sideways " write-up and the Travis/Big John relationship went downhill from there. - Big Jonn did n't really care , but Travis almost would n't stay in the room or talk with John by the end of the tour . <p> 3 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> A long while ago before Kenny Powers even had wet dreams about being a FAIP there was a BFM shootout with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And I 'm sorry you 've never experienced leadership that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't at the actual mission - and then awards strats , recommendations , etc based upon same . Everybody 's experiences are going to be different - every community has a slightly different culture - and god knows we seem to go thru waves of having good guys leading the pack to jackasses . <p> I do n't know if you dudes lived thru the snapshot of time when AADs were masked and met promotion boards with the policy in effect . AADs were not a factor in any step of the promotion process - Squadron , Group , Wing , etc were prohibited specifically for using the lack/accomplishment of a Masters in determining jack and shit . Maybe it was just my experience - but that 's how it worked . In fact I think you might still be prohibited from mentioning work or accomplishment of a AAD in OPRs - same for correspondence PME ( not 100% on that ) . <p> F++ck - back in the late 90s/early 2000s a policy came down talking about how we needed tactical level experts sticking around to 20 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command track to make LtCol . You could ' track ' into staying at the ops squadron and remain flying for 20 and still get promoted . Guess how many dudes wanted that ? That is also gone the way of Friday T-shirts and moral patches . <p> Now - I 'm not saying the leadership was behind the whole " AADs have no factor in promotion " policy - hence the reason it changed . And I think education is a good thing - at the proper time . My very humble and uninformed opinion of why they took it out of the promotion process was to put an emphasis on force shaping - we 'll send you to get a degree if you need it , increase in school opportunities , etc . This was around the same time the DT boards/ODPs were starting to take off and we had ' stop practice bleeding ' guidance reminding commanders to not be stupid requiring guys to do correspondence PME prior to going in-residence . It was also acknowledging how a AAD was becoming the sole go/no-go factor in promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weight . <p> The memo from the current AF/A1 is echoing some of those same sentiments . Comments on these boards shows how much of a factor AADs are having on promotions and if you read between the lines this is senior level AF leadership telling Wing Commanders to KIO ( kind of - it should be worded stronger if you ask me ) . I 've posted on this subject before in another thread - I thought masking AADs was a policy we got right - till we did n't - and the current trend is worse - I would n't be surprised to see it go masked again . <p> More interesting ( at least to me ) is that I thought this was something Welsh was taking up - and it sounds like some of his feedback might be actually gaining some traction . <p> This is just an indicator - specifically on the AAD factor and more generally on ' what 's wrong with the AF ' problems we all bitch about - that the every swinging pendulum may be at an extreme and starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Simple solution , instead of every officer being a line officer unless you are a doctor or a lawyer we divide it out like the Navy .

And I 'm sorry you 've never experienced leadership that could dope thru the BS to know who excels and does n't at the actual mission - and then awards strats , recommendations , etc based upon same . <p> Sorry , bro , but that leadership does n't exist in the AF . CCs and SRs have just gotten too used to the convenience that the current policy affords them - rating and ranking dudes based on a SURF vs. reality - to ever go back to the way things used to be . If you read through some of these threads you will even see how they are coping with the fact that pretty much everyone has resigned themselves to getting an AAD to be competitive ... by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it , they 're actually going to care what the degree is in ! I do n't think that pendulum has reversed course yet . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Does anyone know the actual percentage of DPs each wing is allocated or , if you do n't know the percentage , do you know where that is listed ? <p> I read above that 75% of promotables are given DPs ... that seems way too high . I 've heard that it 's between 10% and 20% . <p> Also ... if someone has SOS DG and a DP , what are his chances at getting a school slot ? <p> Thanks in advance <p> Depending on the board , the DP allocation can vary from 80% for Major to just 40% for Lt Col. The SR will usually stratify the top 20% of the eligibles which may explain why you thought the number of DPs was 10-20% . <p> Being an SOS DG and having a DP can not hurt , but the board should/will look at the whole record . <p> Edited November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I think that another problem with our promotion process is that it is essentially a " one look " process . That leaves way too much up to timing . Sure , you meet a Lt Col board 1 and 2 BPZ , but those who get selected BPZ in that less than 1% scenario were identified far in advance so it is n't like it is a realistic shot for everyone else . That means the rest of us , in reality , get one shot at it ... because we all know that the chances of APZ are about as good as BPZ . This if one case where the non-rated guys may have a huge advantage over the rated guys , especially at the Wing level . Let 's say you are at a Wing where 5-6 guys are up for O-5 which means that the Wing CC most likely has 2 DP 's to give and a " Super P " . Well there are a lot of Sqs out there ( FSS , Finance , MX , Comm ) where the Sq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boss had 2 DPs to give , he pretty much has to give it to his sitting Sq CC 's ! Now these are usually pretty sharp guys who may very likely already be in res school grads so it 's hard to argue them getting the DP because they look much better on paper , but I 've seen way too many guys fall victim to this bad timing . That just meant they became the gray beard line pilot that everyone knew as the MWS expert and they retired as a crusty Major , but from what happened last year with the non-continuation and the recent RIF it looks like that crusty O-4 may soon be a thing of the past . <p> You put me head to head with all of the Pilots and Navs in my year group and let 's start comparing FEFs as at least one factor . If I do n't make Maj or Lt Col because I did n't make the mark than at least I know where I stand and I also know that we were comparing apples and apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for specific accomplishments vs. just looking for how many #1 's they have on their OPR . A non-rated O-6 recently told me that any Sq or Gp " of the Qtr " awards on a PRF are almost useless as far as board members are concerned and are seen pretty much as filler . Well if you are a MX officer and there are only 6 CGO 's in the Group that makes sense , but if you are in a large flying Wing and you had to beat out 325 other CGOs in your Gp that Qtr then I think it actually means something . <p> I do n't ever see them splitting up the promotion boards in my career by AFSC or even rated/non-rated and I 'm not even sure that is the right answer . Maybe having a legit 2-3 yr promotion zone where raters are n't forced into a corner with DP 's and P 's just based on numbers ?

Some of that was from guys ing around . Much of it was because the training was more demanding/higher risk and there was less/no magic on the airplanes . <p> There 's truth in that statement ... not all of it was from ing around , which is why I said part of the reason was due to that . But there 's a lot of other factors that led to the high mishap rate , and among them was just generally pushing things too far . I know of a guy who spoke to my pilot training class about the time he flew a T-33 somewhere cross country , figured he 'd just wag the gas , and wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway but back then all he got were some stares from the fuel truck guys , probably thinking " holy shit this guy was low on gas " . There was no real oversight on that kind of stuff , and pilots/crews did n't have the standards that are currently in place now ... much of what you read in 11-202 and 11-2MDS was developed from past mishaps like that . <p> There 's risk management and risk aversion . Risk aversion is telling the Army that landing a Herk on a dirt LZ in Iraq is " too risky " despite the fact they have dudes running IED-laden roads every day to do stuff we could have been doing in that theater . Risk management is " rolling this MC-12 has no purpose and only raises the chances of a mishap for no reason " . <p> The FCIF was n't based on one event .

Manning , deployments , assignments , retention , toxic leaders , scandals , just to name a few . The Guard has its problems too , however it was always on a micro level and much easier to handle , especially for those that were part timers and could just walk out the door middle finger held high and come back a month later as if nothing had happened . <p> As far the Reserves , I put their QOL between AD and the Guard , as I have heard of some shady stuff going on there lately like 365 deployments and crap like that .

I 've never been anywhere where guys turned into dickheads for a strat or DP. 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> First , BolterKing is right on about this mishap being partially due to a systems indioscyncracy that almost no one knew about previously . <p> Second , I do n't think I agree that the Navy " values rank over experience . " It is true that the SAR contingency is usually briefed that the highest ranking crew will be the OSC , but I ca n't think of any other examples of that mindset - and I think the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are airborne , they immediately start taking responsibility for their people . Personally , I always brief that SAR OSC will go to the highest ranking crew unless someone else has higher SA or a more suitable fuel state and I 've never been told to do otherwise . Also , in my experience , it 's exceptionally rare for the highest ranking aircrew to not also have a very high experience level , especially on a tactical event . The only exceptions to that are usually if some guest VIP is trunking a flight for some reason . In general though , I would say the Navy ( or at least the Navy fighter community ) values expertise over rank or experience - as anyone who is familiar with TOPGUN and their sway in the community can attest . <p> I also think it 's worth mentioning that Navy aircraft operating at sea are in a very peculiar situation in regards to who has responsibility for them . In almost every other scenario I can think of in aviation , the pilot-in-command is the bottom-line decision-making authority . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the case . The captain of the ship or the commander of the strike group ( said rear admiral , in this case ) has the authority to make your decision for you , and you had better be prepared to pay for it if you disobey his orders . Like I said , I do n't know of any other situation in the airplane-flying business that 's like this . That 's not to say there 's no reason for it - among others , there 's the fact that we routinely operate in places and at fuel states which leave us no option to divert ashore , with one runway ... that 's short and moving on all axes . A bad decision by one aviator can place the rest of the air wing in extremis in a unique way . In this case , several poor decisions by the leadership put their aircraft in extremis . <p> The two most memorable examples were committed by flyers ( see " availability bias " ) . <p> I signed comsec gear over to an EA-6 NFO , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take inventory , rather than look for it , he tried to make it look like I lost it . Fortunately , I had the paperwork . <p> After a deployment , when my joint decoration got lost , my helicopter-pilot boss did n't return my phone calls or reply to my email requesting assistance . He had a chip on his shoulder , because he thought I was too casual with him . Fortunately , an army officer to whom I reported via dashed line had a copy of the paperwork and resubmitted . <p> While I was working as an LNO from a joint task force HQ to an OGA , I saw a lot of selfish behavior . Again , best example comes from a flyer ( P-3 pilot ) . Since he 'd been there longer than I , he thought he knew everyone in the OGA . Whenever he did n't like the products I provided , he would directly contact people in the OGA and attempt to discredit me , both with the TF staff and the OGA leadership . Eventually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home without a decoration . ( I came home w/ 2 ) The majority of the Navy officers on this staff were SWOs , but I did n't work with them as closely . In general , most of them appeared out to make themselves look like they were winning the campaign by themselves by singlehandedly creating enormous piles of worthless staffwork . <p> Hope this does n't sound bitter .

Most SWOs are back stabbers , and most P-3 pilots/NFOs are just SWOs with wings . <p> That said , I know some epic dudes from the P-3 community , and very few of them stayed past O-3 , on active duty anyway . That definitely is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Good to know as well . I do n't want to derail this thread anymore , but it would be interesting to know why SWOs are backstabbers ( i 've worked more closely w/ flyers , so all my anecdotes were related to flyers , but I felt it was more of a SWO characteristic ) . Also would be interesting to know why you say P-3 pilots are SWOs w/ wings .

@@43194656 @3194656/ <h> Lifestyle of Helicopter Pilots <h> 237 posts in this topic <h> Guest Jollygreen <p> Could someone post a little more on what the flying/training and lifestyle is like for the CSAR H-60 's . What 's a typical day like ? <p> I 'm not sure if anyone can really say what a " typical " day would be for any weapon system . That goes for F-16s to B-52s to HH-60s ... each day can tend to be a little different . <p> But a generalization for HH-60s ( and many other airframes out there ) is that the units tend to work around a 1200 to 2400 cycle ( as opposed to 0600-1800 ) due to the emphasis on night flying . Not a rule , just a generalization . <p> The number of hours put in on a single day also seems to vary greatly . Is it Friday and you flew the night before ? You might come in at 1200 and leave at 1600 . Is it Tuesday and you did n't fly yesterday , but have a 0900 go today and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0600 , fly from 0900-1300 , and not get out of there until 1800 or later . <p> In comparison with a fighter pilot , the training missions tend to be fewer in number per week , but also tend to be longer in duration with 3.5 hrs seeming to be the norm ( though many airlift/bomber crews would call 3.5 hr sortie a ' short jaunt ' at best , vibrating in a seat for that long does get a little tiring ) . <p> The deployment rates really are n't the horror stories that may be floating around , but there certainly are flyers , through either their desire or bad luck , can point to 220+ days deployed in a year . The HH-60 is considered a Low Density/High Demand asset , so the 90 ( and now 120 ) day deployments are flexible with most units opting to send folks for 45-60 days to allow them time to return and retrain before the next rotation . Please keep in mind , as with all other airframes , there are assignments that are heavy in deployments ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight training , some overseas assignments ) . During a career , you will see both ends of the spectrum . That is why an AFSC 's opstempo rate might be 60 days ... but there are crewmembers out there doing 120 or so ( of course , that means someone is doing zero days deployed ) . <p> As with any aircraft , you will have aditional duties that are the bane of all new pilots , but they are also a constant that must be done to keep a unit ready to fight . As a younger pilot , you 'll probably find 1/2 of your time spent either flying or conducting flight related duties ( flying , studies , planning , testing , flt safety meetings , learning falconview , etc ) and 1/2 of your time doing non-flight related duties ( paperwork , ATSO training , filling in work requests , etc ) . <p> As with other crew-served aircraft , you 'll have to learn to work with and around other Airmen and their specialties to include flight engineers , gunners , and PJs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a problem , others will find it may take a little time to get into synch and learn to read another flyer . <p> So I ca n't really say what a typical day is . Anyone can probably tell you what they did on any one particular day ... but if you ask the same question a week later , chances are you 'll get a very different answer . <p> Hope this helps . But remember , any job that let 's you fly ... is a good job . <p> 21 .

In other words , could I get helos if I did n't fully commit to them ? Often times people put fighter/bomber as their #1 pick and get heavies . Could this also be the case with helicopters as their " runner up " pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> During some drops , Vance and Laughlin might each get a helo , but Columbus , for example , might not . <p> There have been cases where a guy who really wants helos ca n't get one ... similarly , there have been guys who do n't want one get one . The reason for letting folks know that you desire one is for your leaders to lobby for one of the helo spots ( so your class/base does not get left out ) . Unless AFPC and AETC gets some other inputs , the distribution will be blind and seem arbitrary . IF YOU WANT A HELO , LET SOMEONE KNOW . If you DO N'T want a helo , there is no way you would be forced into one as a #2 or #3 guy , simply because there are so few dropped ( there would be lots of stiff-wing assets available in the drop ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest FlyingBeef <p> Howdy all , I 'm currently in UPT and seriously considering trying for the helo track and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AF helos are usually stationed with the Army rather than the AF on deployments , any truth to this ?

I have seen the AD folks perform the same types of missions and in foreign lands they do render assistance as well if called for ! Good neighbor policy I suppose . Anyway , all units can deploy if needed during wartime or other contingencies , but they do deploy to other training areas for practice - Red Flag and international excercises and whatnot .

I am interested in flying helicopters . As you already know , if you want helicopters you have to request a slot and put it for your first choice ( at least that is what I was " unoffically " told ) . Flying helicopters has always interested me , however I would like to know what roles USAF Helicopter Pilots have outside of flying and officership ? Do you go to Airborne , or get other speciality training , etc ? What do most helicopter pilots do after the flying stops ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Like dewey said there are lots of opportunities.There are tons of bases to choose from.If you go Hueys you wo n't be deployed much.If you go rescue or specops you will probably be gone six months.Definitly sounds like fun . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> I have some idea how the Army side works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly , there are plenty of 2Lts at Mother Rucker in training right now . Second , according to my neighbor , high school to flight school still exists , for how much longer I do n't know . So , you do n't have to enlist and then go to Warrant OCS . But once you are in flight school , everyone goes to Ft . Rucker . The first more or less 4 months are primary in the TH-67 ( a Bell 206 ) . Then you go to Basic Combat Skills in the OH-58D . Then you get your MDS and train up in that , total time of about 12-18 months depending on aircraft . This too may change as they are going to a new program called flight school 21 , which will cut out basic combat skills . Hope this helps , any other questions , feel free to ask . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest HueyPilot <p> CG : Commissioned officers only ... must go through CG Academy or CG OCS . I think ( but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or admin tour before they go to flight school . Some OCS grads go straight to Pensacola , others do a boat/admin tour first . <p> Basically , if you 're medically qualified , do reasonably well in the USCGA or OCS , and have some civilian flying experience , you 'll attend flight school at some point . <p> CG mission is what 's cool ... helicopters are nice too , but an HH-60J is n't too much different from a Navy HH-60H . The HH-65 is unique to the Coast Guard ... it 's a neat little helicopter , although short on power . Then they also have the new MH-68 , basically an Augusta A109 Power . Cool aircraft , but a small outfit , so you 'll likely fly either HH-60s or HH-65s . <p> As for the Army , no you do n't have to be a Warrant Officer . Commissioned officers can fly to , but I 'll warn you that you wo n't fly as much as the WOs do . <p> TH-67s are both VFR and IFR models ... you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then around 20 or so in the IFR version . It 's a nice helicopter , but again short on power . <p> The news that they were doing BCS in OH-58Ds is news to me ... it used to be the UH-1 and OH-58A when I went through ... then they cut out the UH-1 and just sent kids through the OH-58A . And if they cut out BCS , I 'd imagine that Primary would have to be longer , or the various AQC ( Aircraft Qualification Course ) courses would have to be longer ... I ca n't imagine sending someone to an AQC course with only 80 hours of flying time . <p> Anyways ... basic airframes you can fly in the Army include the AH-64 , CH-47 , OH-58D and the UH-60 . None of them are very fancy aircraft ... very utilitarian ... they get the job done . My own personal preferences would be to fly UH-60s or CH-47s . Just more variety in the missions you 'll fly . But if you want to sneak around in the grass and kill things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . <p> If you fly for the Army Guard , you might have another choice in the LUH ... the helicopter that will replace the UH-1 Huey . I do n't know much about this program , but I think the A119 Koala ( a version of the A109 from the USCG ) is one of the contenders . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest waxgoblin <p> This is an subject rarely touched here , and I 'd love to hear more about it . I always read peoples websites with their journey through UPT , and there 's usually somebody in the class that goes to Hueys. after huey training , what does that person do ? I see that there are 64 AD pave hawks , 38 AD pave lows , and 62 AD hueys. do any of the huey graduates go straight to pave lows , or are they pretty much fed into hueys and pave hawks ? does anybody have a link of a journal of a guy or gal that went the chopper route ? thanks , i 'm kinda interested now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery channel , with pave lows doing rolls and loops and all this crazy stuff 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> 1 . After you finish up at Mother Rucker , you go to Kirtland AFB . This is for everyone , Hueys and Pave guys . <p> 2 . The way a typical drop works is one Pavelow , one or two Pavehawks and the rest of the class gets Hueys . After a 3 year Huey tour most guys will move into a tactical aircraft , sort of like a C-21 for the heavy guys . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> 2 . A typical Air Force Helo class is about 6 people , I have seen as few a 2 , but for the most part they try to keep it around 6 folks . <p> 3 . I do n't know how much previous Helo experience would help . As far as I know , only one person has had any and he was a guard baby . The best advice I can give is work hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will put you in a position to track helos and then give you a better shot at a Pave . The program is designed for people with zero helicopter time , but any hours are good hours . If you have the time and money go for it , but do n't live on Ramen so that you can get helo time . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest rotorhead <p> Forget buying helo lessons ... unless your last name is Trump , you ca n't afford it ( at a few hundred dollars an hour ) , and any little piston/direct control R-22 or Schweitzer 300 is so different from a turbine/hydraulic Huey .... just pay attention , study , and chairfly at Rucker ... if you 're really eaten up , get a copy of Army FM 1-203 Fundamentals of Flight ( or purchase Principles of Helicopter Flight from BaseOps ) . Rotary wing aerodynamics are WAY more complicated than basic stiffwing aerodynamics ... but do n't get deep into the math angle , just the concepts and terms ... Rucker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUPT phase II classes have a base or two ( not all ) that gets a helo for track select phase III ... then usually a couple of classes from phase II merge to form a Rucker class of 4-6 studs . These studs are part of an Army class of several dozen . There are a little over 50 flingwingers produced each year for the USAF . <p> The 38 PaveLow number is now probably reduced ( by SEVERAL ) due to crashes in the recent couple of years . If you are sure you want a CV-22 , I 'd suggest H53 , otherwise , I suggest H60 . If you get an H1 , that 's cool , too , because you will fly a lot , get quick upgrades , and in the small units you can get exposure in a variety of areas , like safety , training , curr ops , stan/eval , etc . Then you can move to H60 or H53 , or stay H1 as mentioned above . In the old days , you could not go from Rucker to Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against that . One of the cool things about the helo track is you can get the airframe you want either out of the chute or on the next assignment , and the WORST helo assignment is still fun ! Quick history : <p> I 'm currently an H60 IP at Kirtland ... was a Rucker IP at one time ... ran AFPC pipeline assignments last assignment ... so I may not know the answer , but I can get it for you . Search for some of my other posts from several months ago ... I gave some " advertisements " of how awesome flying helos is . Fire away with more questions ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> To answer your questions . PJs generally ride around in H60s , since that helos primary mission is CSAR . As far as the Pave Low/Pavehawk thing , there is no bad assignment in the rotorary wing world , NONE . The way tracking generally works is that one guy wants helicopters and makes it known from the day they get to Phase II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more guys want it , it is a very tough deal because you both know you are going head to head for it . Helos fly around in heavies because that is the quickest way to get where you need to be . We travel as much as or more than anybody , unless you are a huey guy in which case you will travel , but stay in the CONUS . The Pave Hawk is a UH-60 that has had all the avionics upgraded ( it has been Paved ) . The problem here is weight . That being said , it can do things no slick 60 would ever dream of doing like AR . <p> Rotorhead , I will defer to your experience on the rest of the questions . One thing for you . Since we went all blue , we do everything from day one with just the AF . The changes from when you were here are really that we learn out of AF pubs and the Hueys are ours . The IPs are probably still the same ones who were here when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest rotorhead <p> " ... Do you hope to fly a pave low one day or are you happy with the hawk ? ... " <p> Funny question ... that 's like asking a C-17 pilot if he hopes to fly a C-5 or is he happy in the C-17 ! ! ! Different aircraft , one bigger , one newer , etc. etc . H53 pilots love H53s and H60 pilots love H60s . I have NEVER met an H60 pilot say " he 'd rather fly H53s . " Different communities , different missions . <p> " ... Do you have your own chopper with your name taped on the side or do you share choppers ? ... " <p> There is a likelihood that your name may be painted on one side of a squadron helo , but it is not " yours " ... you 'll fly that one , and all the others in the squadron , and all the other aviators in the squadron will fly the one with your name on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's danger level was a 10 ( not a 1-10 scale , its just a 10 ) what danger level would a helo pilot have ? 15 ? 20 ... " <p> Too generic a question . I can tell you that passengers ( even AD military members ) are not allowed on most helo missions , ( like 99% of H60 training ) which means that most folks only think helos fly H1s from point A to point B on a ROTC/USAFA camp fam ride . Other aircraft communities can take you out and show you most of what they do ... we ca n't . In FY 02+03 , we had 13 helo class A 's .... 5 year average class A rates : <p> H53 15.44 <p> H60 3.9 <p> F16 3.3 <p> C5 0.27 <p> C135 0.19 <p> Helos do n't move particularly fast , but we are allowed to train in formation , at night , zero moon , 50 feet AGL , 2 miles vis .... so time to obstacle is VERY minimal . Also , helos can not " bump " each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so a " bump " between two helos could have a Mach 2 relative closure rate between parts . Never pretty . Our playground is the playground for SA7/14/16/18 and RPGs ... cheap , everyone has one , and Intel ca n't tell you where they are . The squadron CC has been in a class a/b , so has the DO , so have I , and we pranged a 53 here last Friday . You 'd better have your feces consolidated 100% of the time . <p> " ... Is getting helo track very competitive ? in the past i kinda regarded helo track as the track that the kid at the bottom of the class gets ( sorry heh ) ... " Depends . If you are number 4 in a phase II class and the number 3 guy wants a helo ( rarely more than 1 is dropped per class per base ) you 're outta luck , so YES , it would seem competitive . There have been #22 out of 22 that got " stuck " with the helo , and there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , until recently , there have been almost no UPT phase II pilots who had ever flown a helo , so they bad-mouthed the idea from a position of complete ignorance . If anyone steers you away , ask them how many helo assignments they 've had ! And BTW , promotion rates for flingwingers is AT LEAST as good as stiffwingers through 05 . <p> Cool missions , cool equipment , no autopilot , lots of goggles and guns , and the newest copilot is not a checklist reader ... he flies all of it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest waxgoblin <p> so if your flying around the PJs , are you a member of the special ops , andi guess you would have that top secret clearance ? <p> if the 60s fly the PJs , what do the 53s do ? i saw a video clip of a buncha PJs jumping out the back of a 53 with a black raft into the ocean , that looked exciting <p> ive seen a lot of black and gold hueys flying over DC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomats ? when i went to DC , i was told that when you see 3 choppers flying in formation , the president is in one of them , and if there 's just 1 chopper , its not the president . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest rotorhead <p> Marine One is the callsign of the helicopter with POTUS aboard ... near DC , this is usually an H-3 ( about to be replaced ) and usually when POTUS visits other states , a VH-60 blackhawk is used .

We differ from the two seat Driver/WSO model in that regard . The guy who is pulling e trigger and driving the fight , is n't looking outside . That means rounds are coming out of that gun or missiles off the rails at the trust that what your gunner sees in the sensor is what he is supposed to be shooting at . And we have done it that way since our inception . Weapons off the rail based on what we see in a sight not what we see outside the glass with our eyes .

I think a few things can be said . 90% of the time , any aircraft that has CAS as a sub-sub-sub mission will suffice in Afghanistan . When shit hits the fan , its is best to have the guys who do it for a living flying an aircraft built for CAS . Again , does n't matter , USAF leadership has sold its soul to the F-35 and that bill will be paid with CAS capability and blood in the future . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I think you are missing the point , no one sees any of that " nifty IR shit " unless they look outside , through their NVGs . CAS is a an endevour grounded in looking outside and visually acquiring among other things , targets , friendlies , and trps . <p> Tex , I 'm pretty sure Lawman knows that , he was talking about future systems requests being submitted to the respective project managers . I agree about the looking outside part , there 's no replacement for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good plan . <p> What Lawman is getting at is they want image intensifier technology like that on goggles to be integrated with thermal systems . As it stands right now , the Apache 's Pilot Night Vision System has an integrated Image Intensifier that sees the " nifty IR shit " , it 's called VNsight and I flew with it in Afghanistan . Still no replacement for goggles entirely , but is much safer than just having FLIR . They 're trying to integrate it with the TADS now as well . If they could put that technology into targeting pods , it would be much safer . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I stand corrected in my use of broad stroke generalities . My intent was to point out , the pods currently in use do not see IR markers/strobes and none of the traditional strike platforms that carry them have a magic software patch to change that fact . The assumption that the crew could see IR energy was wildly off base and never should have been made , because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go back to the peanut gallery now . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So what missions/advantages does the B-52 have over the B-1 then ? Maybe cutting the Buff instead of the A-10 would free up the money and maintainers that the brass says are needed for the F-35 program . I mean , they wan na make the LRSB soon , and all of the Buffs are 54 years old . B-1s have a larger payload , higher top speed , and nearly the range of a Buff anyway . I know they 're talking about replacing the Buff 's engines right now to get even better range , but the same could be done for the Bone . I 'm no expert but I would imagine that the RCS is better on the Bone too . <p> I mean it 's still messed up that we 're cutting anything , but I think the A-10 would be missed much more than the Buff . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So what missions/advantages does the B-52 have over the B-1 then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the money and maintainers that the brass says are needed for the F-35 program .

I think he has done a great job moderating through the years and I 've learned a lot from him . <p> My comments are not to further any agenda , burn any witches , or cast a holier-than-thou attitude . I 'm stating a view-point on sexual harassment that many do n't agree with , but my point is that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone agreed on everything . That said , I personally do n't think that 's the image we want to give off here at Baseops or in the Air Force . <p> Did you ever see the South Park about the war in Iraq ? The moral of the story is that we need to go to war to protect ourselves , but we also need protests and dissenters so that our country does n't just look like war hungry assholes . That 's what makes our country , and these forums , great . <p> Also , I think this horse has been dead a while now , and we 're still kicking the shit out of it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The ### words are FPhcking Khunt ( BODN blocks the words from my posts , but Rainman had special authority to call females Khunts using proper and unblocked spelling . Nice job mods ) <p> Nice try , but this is n't some special treatment we gave Rainman , it 's a function of the control panel . The CP will block any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of posts or time as a registered user . <p> Is BODN not designed for officer aircrew ? <p> Asked an answered ... No . This is designed for prospective , current , soon to be gone , separated , retired , and wannabe military members . The focus is obviously aircrew , be we have a small pockets of other AFSCs to include cyber , medical , and the all-encompassing " shoe clerk " . Some of those folks have been the greatest contributors to our discussions based on our limited knowledge of those areas , just as we are great contributors of knowledge to the college kids seeking out a flying career . <p> Another problem you have is that the BODN " squadron bar " is not a squadron bar . A squadron bar is a very limited number of like-minded individuals without recording devices . BODN " squadron bar " is an open internet forum for all the world to see ( not even a login required to view ) and some of the postings are even more disgusting than what you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar is where people go at the end of the day to relax and shoot the shit and not talk about work queep , and that 's what our squadron bar is . Since I know that you were not around when the BODN squadron bar was created , I 'll give you some background . Many years ago , this entire forum was almost exclusively a flying forum and had a significantly fewer number of sub forums . The occasional non-flying topic would come up and many times it would devolve into arguments . There was a proposal - which I was completely opposed to - that we create the squadron bar as a location to divert that discussion . It has for the most part been successful , with the occasional bad apple that drags topics into the mud . The squadron bar is n't the kind of stuff you would see at work - hence the overt labeling of NSFW . I personally do n't go to about 90% of the recurring squadron bar threads unless I 'm notified via a report . It 's not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly care about them . I suggest you do the same . <p> I 'll say this , Rainman did have one good piece of advice : Never talk to the media . Guess what you dingleberries are doing with every single post on BODN ? Showing your ass is what you 're doing , and it ai n't  pretty . Recommend either eliminating the sexist NSFW drivel from BODN or making it login-required . You 're not doing yourselves any favors by fighting for a Tailhook website . Too many of the mods are stuck in some glorified , olden days AF , which most of them never even experienced . Too many BODN members fight to maintain the status quo or to even move things in a direction the public and government will never return to . Not a whole lot of leadership in that ... <p> You continuously miss the point that while many members of this website are military members , this is not a military website and it is in no way affiliated with the Air Force . The fact that the Air Force Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't highlight anything unprofessional on the Air Force , it highlights the fact that the Air Force Times has hack reporters who ca n't or wo n't get somebody to go on the record to make a quote supporting their inflammatory articles . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> This person 's obsession with the forum extends back several years . He wrote a paper for his Master 's degree , largely about the forum . He hired someone to data mine the forum for incriminating examples of the " fighter pilot culture " he disapproves of . <p> His competing forum , " wantscheck " or whatever ( complete with pinup girl logo ) , never drew the attention that he craved for himself . He tried to engineer the forum in his own image , and no one ever visited because the better alternative was BO.net . Rhino , were you just a mod there or what ? I du n no , never visited there because " you have to register " . Anyway , he tried to create it in his own image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to do in this situation ? Obviously , you would troll BO.net . Bring it down . You would create controversial threads , selectively document posts that can be construed as incriminating , shout down the membership and the mods . Then every time you would get banned , you go bitch about it on a blog no one reads and create a new screen name and start over , trying to win a following and each time failing . <p> It 's not just sexism and fighter pilot culture . These little crusades include video taping cops , building spy cars , accusing people of not upholding the constitution , criticising JQP , etc , etc , etc . When he saw JQP post what could be viewed as a critical remark about BO , you better fucking believe he was giddy as a school girl to make an issue of it . Perhaps the only thing I ever agreed with Rainman on was that this guy is a mental basketcase . A point that apparently hit so close to home that he 's still bringing up Rainman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is graduate level trolling at it 's finest . Keep it up Rhino , it 's going to be great for page views . Surely you realize the controversies you create also boosts site traffic and you can claim it is all because everyone likes you so much . <p> USAF , if you want to address specific remarks made by individuals that do not conform to your values , have a nut . But your ridiculous generalizations and consistent leveling of vague and unspecific accusations against the entire forum and all the mods just because it 's more likely to get people to engage you and give you the opportunity to soapbox .... is n't going to go well . <p> Edited October 22 , 2014 by gearpig <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Your writing style , word choice , and argument structure are nearly identical to a previous poster on this forum , PYB/CannonCrashPad .

Three years ago , and that thread is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bunch of others either piling on or condoning Rainman 's comments , and y'all successfully eliminated a cadet from the forums . Nice job ! I doubt those mods would make the same comments today , out of political correctness . That 's how fast this stuff is changing . <p> Is BODN not designed for officer aircrew ? Sure , we also have Steve Davis and Scoobs and BQZip 's mom and random journalists lurking on here , all the more reason to have some standards of decency . BODN is not keeping up with the AF , not even close , yet if this is supposed to be a forum for Air Force Officer aircrew ( and others ) , and if your intent is to provide some mentorship , maybe , just maybe you guys need to make some attempt at reflecting good officership . <p> Another problem you have is that the BODN " squadron bar " is not a squadron bar .

The 455th Air Expeditionary Wing hosted a ruck march , remembrance ceremony and celebratory barbecue to honor the 10th anniversary of Pararescueman Senior Airman Jason Cunningham 's sacrifice for his country . <p> Cunningham was posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross Sept. 13 , 2002 , for his extraordinary heroism while engaged in combat against an enemy . He provided medical aid to wounded service members while under fire and relocated them to three different casualty collection points , after each one was overrun . His actions saved 10 lives and allowed the bodies of seven fallen warriors to return home with honor . Bagram dedicated a compound in Cunningham 's memory . <p> The day started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 270 supporters showed up in the early hours of a misty day to take part in the march . Airmen , soldiers , sailors , Marines , Coasties and civilians strapped on 35 pounds of gear and marched 7.6 miles through puddles and rocks to show their appreciation for Cunningham 's dedication to duty . <p> Bagram service members then assembled for the Senior Airman Jason Cunningham Remembrance Ceremony . The ceremony featured a retelling of the events at Roberts Ridge , the mission in which Cunningham gave his life , and the reading of his Air Force Cross citation . <p> Lt. Col. Spencer Cocanour , 21st Expeditionary Special Tactics Squadron commander , was the narrator on the day Camp Cunningham was originally dedicated to Cunningham . Fittingly , he was present to speak at the remembrance ceremony eight years later . <p> " The motto of Special Tactics is ' first there ... that others may live ' , " said Cocanour . " Jason followed a quick reaction force and gave everything he had , including his life , so others may live . <p> " Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " When they called his name , his heart beat faster , his adrenalin was pumping ... he was in the zone . He went in knowing it was dangerous . He knew the enemy was there , on the attack , and knew there was U.S. wounded and dead on the battlefield . He knew all of this , yet he never faltered ... never hesitated . He was all in . " <p> Cocanour went on to explain that the reason we name camps , streets and buildings after our true professionals and fallen heroes is to honor their memory . He said it serves to remind us of those who gave everything right to their last breath . <p> To emphasize the example set by Cunningham , Cocanour cited a famous quote to the audience . <p> " George Orwell said it well , " he said . " People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand in violence on their behalf . Jason Cunningham was one of those men . We should all strive to be the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Deale . " He made an impact . He truly embodied our Air Force corps values . Integrity first , service before self , and excellence in all we do . When you listen to that remarkable story on that day , on that ridgeline , you see that we lost great airmen . Airmen who were n't afraid to stand up and answer the call when it came . I am proud of them . " <p> Deale commented that Cunningham , being one of the most junior ranks , set an example of getting the mission done that Deale , as a brigadier general , follows . <p> He then issued a challenge to the audience . <p> " I ask you to reflect on your service , look at those corps values and bring it every day , " Deale said . " It 's what we need . It 's the only way we are going to get the mission done here . Senior Airman Cunningham knew that . And when you see it out there , and you recognize it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then placed a wreath in front of Cunningham 's shadow box and rendered a ceremonial salute .

My point is that even top performers have to distinguish themselves amongst other top performers . That is n't done by performing " just a little bit higher " than your peers . <p> Promotion and IDE selection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . A personal relationship with your boss is the most important factor in opening opportunities and earning high stratifications on your OPR and PRF . Hard work/top performance is a given . However , the boss is going to push folks for opportunities that reflect his/her leadership style , strengths , and interests . Without those opportunities ( be it exec , proj-o , WIC , or ALFA complete ) , earning a high strat is impossible because you 've done nothing ( in your boss 's eyes ) to distinguish yourself amongst your peers . It comes down to trust and Confirmation Bias ( they did what I did , I got promoted , so I should promote them ) . That accounts for the , " How on earth did that guy get school , " and " I ca n't believe that guy did n't get school , " which seemed very prevalent when my year group 's major board was released . <p> Generally , the people who get school deserve it , but a lot of really strong swimmers miss out because of timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big fish in a pool of really big fish . If I could do it again : do n't waste your time being like the boss , be someone who the boss wants to be like . Discover what 's important to your boss and excel at it to the point that they admire you . If that 's SOS DG , then yeah , SOS DG is important . If it 's Exec or mountain biking with the boss on the weekends , well , you know what you have to do ... <p> I always thought " go golfing with the boss " was cliche .

This is pretty damn impressive , especially considering that he was British and everything . <p> Rescorla 's first deployment in Her Majesty 's Service was as a Military Intelligence officer on the island of Cyprus , where he spent the period from 1957 to 1960 digging up intel on Communist activities and doing a bunch of other presumably-badass clandestine shit that I was n't able to dig much info up about . After that ended , he transferred to British Rhodesia in 1960 , where he spent the next three years running through the bush with an assault rifle battling Communists in Angola and Zimbabwe as a member of the British South African Police . <p> After transferring out of Rhodesia in 1963 , Rick Rescorla suddenly found himself in something of a dilemma : He 'd run out of asses to kick . This was only a temporary problem , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seemingly-never-ending British blood feud with the forces of Marxism , ( according to him , Britain was simply " fresh out of wars to fight " ) , Rick Rescorla went out and did the rational thing , which was of course to move to the United States and enlist in the American army so that he could ######ing ship out to Southeast Asia and fight in the goddamned Vietnam War . <p> Rescorla was on the ground at the very beginning of the Vietnam Shitstorm , and as a platoon leader in the 7th Cavalry Regiment , 1st Air Cavalry Division , he ended up participating in the first major American battle in ' Nam " the bloody Battle of Ia Drang in November of 1965 . <p> According to Hal Moore , the Vietnam vet author of We Were Soldiers , Rescorla was , " the greatest platoon commander I have ever seen , " but it was the crazy stories about this guy that really made him a semi-mythical entity among the American troops . <p> Rick Rescorla died almost exactly 10 years ago today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center Tower 1 on September 11 , 2001 , when a psychotic madman flew a passenger airliner into the building .

This is why in my earlier post I said that although I believe the original mission of the JSF program has been a failure , cutting it is a completely different argument . It is seriously all we have now , and the economic fallout of cutting it would be devastating .

You ca n't just get out on a whim over a chick . SIE does n't mean you are cut loose . You will simply go to missiles . Then you will be sad and lonely underground . In North Dakota . With no chicks anywhere . And it 's fuking cold there . <p> Read some of the highlights of what you wrote and then think very carefully about what is really important to you--and I do n't mean job versus girl . I mean just how much of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She told you she did n't want to be second place , but she 's putting you way lower than that in her life . Just how far down her list of life priorities are you happy to sit ? So far you 're at least below her career , state of residence , and her mom . You may love her . That does n't mean you will be happy with her . <p> Like many it has been a long road to even get where I am right now . <p> Well when i found out last february that i finally had my class date to go to OTS , I of course called her and she was devastated . So you finally took a step towards your dream and she 's " devastated " ? WTFO ? <p> Only problem for her was me being in the air force . <p> Nevertheless , she thought she would be okay with the lifestyle but in the back of my mind i knew she would not be . Read this line over and over and over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to admit it . <p> She wants to have a real relationship and not always have me gone all the time . Lot 's of us have " real " relationships and are military pilots all at the same time . " Real " has nothing to do with traveling a lot or being home all the time . <p> she really only ever wanted to live and NY and so that she could be close to her mother , especially when having kids . <p> So living close to her mother is more important than being with you ? If this is n't motivation for you to run at full sprint away then I do n't know what is . If you ca n't compete with her mom , then I swear to God you will hate your life with her . <p> As far as trying to marry a professional woman , yes it can be done and both dude and chick can be happy in life . I know military pilots married to doctors , lawyers , accountants , PhDs , nurses , teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite successful and happy , even though it did cost them some career stability to move around for their marriage . However , they would not be happy at all if those chicks had put career before their marriage . <p> If she is so tied to her specific marketing gig that she is n't willing to take her MBA and do something else with it in order to be with you , then it wo n't work . <p> If you SIE for this chick , then I guaran-fukin-tee you there will be a time in your life that you will grow to hate her because she made you give up your dream . You will always feel like you sacrificed for her , but I promise she wo n't give you full credit for that . And that will make you bitter every day for the rest of your life . <p> Edited October 12 , 2009 by Danny Noonin <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Sandlapper <p> I knew a dude that SIE 'd back in the days of the Hondo Flight Screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to her , she eventually realized what a tool this guy was for giving up so easily on his dream and dumped him .

She ends up finding a strong man , not some pussy that would give up his life long dream for a few tears , and leaves your ass . She takes half your shit and all of your manhood . <p> Best cas senario for SIE- you SIE and get married . She does n't leave you . Everyday , you play the what if game in your head . 2.5 kids , a dog and a mortgage , and some crap job . You 'll be the guy that always tells you how they could have been a pilot , but ( fill in the blank ) . Your blank will be filled in with wifey 's name instead of a DUI , bad eyes , heart problems , Flt CC rating , or whatever . <p> Here 's what you need to do .

Nevertheless , she thought she would be okay with the lifestyle but in the back of my mind i knew she would not be . She said she has really had trouble making friends and does n't want to live in the middle of nowhere for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always coming second . She wants to have a real relationship and not always have me gone all the time . And she is worried that i wo n't come back at all . So we talked alot and she is afraid I will miss the birth of my child and be deployed during it , miss their first words , first steps , concerts etc etc . She is afraid i wo n't be around for anything and that she will be left on her own to fend for herself and raise her kids . I have told her that I was sure many of the wives worked together and helped one another out . But she just says she feels so out of place and that she really only ever wanted to live and NY and so that she could be close to her mother , especially when having kids . The only two places for her career field is really NYC and LA . So nonetheless that does n't leave me many options ? Obviously there is no guarantee what plane I will be flying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NY is Dover and Macguire and i am sure it would be doubtful to get what you want . I would love a way to make this work for the both of us . This because over the last 5 years i have worked towards nothing but being a pilot in the AF . I have a math degree from Boston University but I have no background using it . It took me so long to earn it that I worked as a temp driver for 3 years for UPS where you work 6 months and then you are laid off after the holidays every year , no benefits . So even if I gave this all up I have no idea what i would do . Financially i would be screwed as I had a good chunk of debt coming in from school , car loan etc that I am dependent on the pay check . What I do know is that I want to marry her and that she is the only one I will ever want to be with ? She says the same but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NY and living somewhere in the middle of no where ? So my question is really , does anyone have any options or ideas ? Has anyone gone through this ? What advice can i give her ? I know I can not live without her and at the same time she is afraid should i quit that i will always resent her ? What happens if you DOR or SIE ? do you just leave the AF ? For those who say i should just find another fish in the sea or dump your gf or whatever , its not that simple and i do n't think i could get through this wihtout her even if i wanted to . I know i am one of a lucky few to be in the position i am in . I just want to have a good life where the both of us are as happy as we can be together . Thank you for listening and any help you guys can offer . <p> 1 : think paragraphs , man . You CAN go back and edit your post ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be moving a lot . That does n't mean she needs to give up her old friends , but she will need to make new ones . My wife had some issues initially getting into the military lifestyle , but once you get involved , friends come naturally . The key is to get involved in SOMETHING . <p> 3 : Middle of nowhere ? ! ? My dad 's been to the middle of nowhere ( well the edge of it anyway : Shemya AFB , Alaska ) and the vast majority of bases are n't close . I 'm in Mino and there is still plenty to do . <p> 4:She certainly CAN have a career , it just needs to be more flexible than most . Spouses have some priorities for hiring on base , especially if they are teachers , but also for AAFES and you can progress through and make a career . Other local businesses hire too . If she 's eligible for the military , you could get join spouse assignments ( not a guarantee ) . <p> 5 : Gone all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you deploy more than others ( C-17 crew , some tanker crews , AFSOC , AWACS , and a few others pop into my mind as the high-end of deployments ) , but there are plenty that do n't deploy often or go for short periods of time : B-52s , RC-135s , E-4s , OC-135s , UH-1s , etc . Expand your selection and you might find some better options for NOT deploying often . <p> 6 : " ... afraid I will miss the birth of my child and be deployed during it , miss their first words , first steps , concerts etc etc . " If you have a job with ANYONE you could miss these things , but most employers ( including the Air Force ) WILL work with you and try to make that not happen . <p> 7 : " She is afraid i wo n't be around for anything and that she will be left on her own to fend for herself and raise her kids . I have told her that I was sure many of the wives worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feels so out of place and that she really only ever wanted to live and NY and so that she could be close to her mother , especially when having kids . " <p> My wife felt the same way in a lot of ways , but most AF bases are near airports , so mom can come in for the birth . As with the above , there 's no guarantee that she would n't be in upstate NY while her daughter suddenly went into labor in NYC . My second child was born with about 3 hours notice , so there was little chance for my wife 's mom to be there for her . My first was born during Hurricane Katrina and we were in P-Cola ; what do you think the odds were of getting a flight in there ? My point is that it is a risk , but the same thing could happen if you ARE N'T in the military . <p> 8 : " The only two places for her career field is really NYC and LA . " I find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some serious specialty of which I am unaware , maybe , but I have n't heard of anything like that . If it is such a case , perhaps it 's time to find a new career ? Most people change careers 3-4 times in their lifetimes . Hell , I 'm still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up . <p> 9 : " I have a math degree from Boston University but I have no background using it . " Computer science here , same result ... <p> 10 : " So even if I gave this all up I have no idea what i would do . Financially i would be screwed as I had a good chunk of debt coming in from school , car loan etc that I am dependent on the pay check . " Well , you need to consider that in your plans . <p> 11 : " What I do know is that I want to marry her and that she is the only one I will ever want to be with ? " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important if you have to choose between them . <p> 12 : " She says the same but is worried that she will be unhappy and bored away from NY and living somewhere in the middle of no where . " I 've been in the military/a military brat for my entire life ( except college ... but I went to a military school ... ) . I have learned that EVERY assignment is what you make of it . I can not emphasize that enough . I know people who are miserable down the road in Fort Walton Beach . I know people who LOVE Eielson in Alaska . You HAVE to find things to do/people to meet or you WILL be miserable . That means you have to get outside your shell and try new things ... both of you . Maybe your wife likes sewing ( mine does ) , so I ended up taking a quilting class with her . I was the only guy , but my wife met a lot of nice women in our area that shared her interests and I supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? What advice can i give her ? I know I can not live without her and at the same time she is afraid should i quit that i will always resent her ? " We 've ALL gone through this ( or many of us ) . She would n't be alone , I promise . But at the same time , you have to make the best of your situation and have a positive attitude . <p> 14 : DOR/SIE in UPT is a bad idea . I personally washed out and became a back seater , but still in the flying club . Those who SIE 'd did n't fare as well , except one who spoke 7 languages including Farsi , Arabic , Pashtun , and Mandarin Chinese ... she was an intel match-made-in-heaven and loves it . I can not guarantee you 'll get out of the air force either . They may keep you on as an acquisition officer , PA officer , or shudder comm officer . <p> 15 : " Its not that simple and i do n't think i could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know i am one of a lucky few to be in the position i am in . I just want to have a good life where the both of us are as happy as we can be together . Thank you for listening and any help you guys can offer . " You will have a good life ( it does n't matter where you are or what you are doing even after the AF , it will NEVER be ideal ) , no one can guarantee happiness , but I can guarantee the possibility of it . Where you can be together ? Man , you 're in the military . You 're probably going to deploy somewhere ( unless you are missiles or UH-1s ) . The question is how you manage those deployments . Set yourself up for success and choose an airframe that does n't typically deploy a lot ( do n't go AWACS ! ! ! ) . <p> Send me a message if you want . I would be happy to talk with you . My wife would also be pretty happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also strongly suggest talking with one of chaplains on base . They specialize in this kind of stuff and ca n't tell ANYTHING you say to ANYONE . <p> I also STRONGLY suggest living on base . Camaraderie seems to be a little higher there and built-in friends are a doorstep away . You sometimes have to put more effort into off-base living to get some of the same results ( sometimes not ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The right girl for you is n't going to ask you to give up your dream of becoming a pilot . <p> Shack . <p> You should accept the fact that you are a huge pu*sy and SIE from life . <p> SHACK ! ! ! ! <p> Dude , either quit being a complete dumbass and continue down the UPT road or completely ruin your dreams for some fucking broad that I can almost guarantee you will not stay with past 3 yrs ( and I think that 's being optimistic ) . If she does n't accept your dreams and at least willing to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road in on .

If you do , not only are you flushing your dreams down the crapper but she will have castrated you for life ( even worse than you are already ) . <p> Dude , no matter how sweet she is , she is killing you . Either dump her and get on with your dreams , or hand in your man card and start wearing the sweaters she will knit for you while you clean our her cat 's litter box . <p> Actually , in retrospect maybe you are better off that way ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Sandlapper <p> If/when you SIE , and subsequently get stationed at Minot ( playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with some turbo-nerds 2 miles underground in a silo ) , that 's the day she 'll decide that the military life REALLY is n't for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , you 'll have your crank in one hand and a 12-sided dice in the other , wondering WTF just happened . NUT UP , dude ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 1 ) Seriously you could do better and you should be mature enough to demand better . <p> 2 ) She needs a rough man to set her straight . Give it a hard yet gentle slap and hold her down a little by her hair . <p> 2 ) SIE does n't mean you are out of the AF . Just means now both you and her are unhappy . <p> 3 ) Motorboat her once . Kinda like a prop over speed scenario . This is where her emotion is stored . Think about it . Do it . <p> 4 ) You should be kicked in the nads for having low SA for a ) posting you are in API , and b ) posting this touchy feely crap . Do n't you have a male friend to talk to ? JTFC . <p> 5 ) Seriousness now and I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever considered during this episode to contact the NY guard or CA guard ? If this is where she wants to live and this is really what you want to do then try that route to make it happen . This may help you both re-evaluate time frames while you wait for applications etc . Talk to leadership to help you apply and be honest with them before you SIE . <p> That was tough to give a serious answer dude . I , like others , would have gladly sold my wife to get a pilot slot and my left beaner . A relationship should be very easy . My wife is n't even living with me while I train so she can further advance in her career while I advance in mine . We will meet up eventually . We see each other whenever possible and just plan things as they come . If I were you I would go to the chaplain and get someone to talk to . You obviously need some help figuring this out and he/she would be a good start . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a time in your life that you will grow to hate her because she made you give up your dream . You will always feel like you sacrificed for her , but I promise she wo n't give you full credit for that . And that will make you bitter every day for the rest of your life . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Maybe your wife likes sewing ( mine does ) , so I ended up taking a quilting class with her .

In my humble opinion , just getting the opportunity to fly for the military is a big enough privilege , regardless of what they tell you to fly . Given how competitive it is to even GET a slot , I would be ( and am ) happy with what I got , plain &amp; simple . Maybe I 'm the exception to the rule or something . <p> Again , good luck with all of your endeavors ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Ok listen . I totally agree with what you guys are saying about being happy with what you got . However , I have worked my butt off to get where I am . I have over $20,000 in student loans for all of my flying , and I did it to be more competitive for pilot and ENJJPT . ENJJPT is what I want and I have worked to get there . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sacrifice is what sucks plain and simple . Sure , maybe I 'm being a little conceided but I have worked hard and sacrificed A LOT to get the credentails that I have . Instead of being out having fun I spent a lot of time studying and flying and doing crap like that . I gave up my college fun to get where I am and for an idiot to misplace my PFT card and not get my right score in for the pilot board pisses me off ! ! ! <p> To answer a few questions . Yes my PCSM is 99 and if you want me to prove it I will . Yes , I do have a pilot slot FY06 . <p> rangerbob5 , <p> According to my calculations my OM would be a 95.45 with the 91.5 PFT and a 94.89 OM with the 86 PFT score . You seem to know what 's up , my scores are above at the beginning of this thread . Can you confirm my OM scores . ( I 'm not sure about the PFT calculations . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 91.5 is 9.15 points from what I figure . Is that right ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest sprint <p> It will tell you the same scores you 've added . However , I do n't think you have to worry either way . From talking to others , the usually AVERAGE OM for ENJJPT is around 90-91 . Good luck talking with your Cadre . IMHO , I think if you explained your point of view and why it matters so much , most people would be willing to go to bat for you and try and get it changed if it is possible . <p> By the way , my cadre did n't finish 2 cadets paperwork ( both would have gotten slots ) before the board and just told them there out of luck and to pick another career . So there are worse things that could happen . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just thought I would let you all know . My Det actually screwed up everyones OM that retook the PFT for categorization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not the only one at my Det that had to bend over which really sucks . <p> However , the good news is that HQ told my Det that myself and one other cadet are in the top 10% of pilot selects and said that both of us will get ENJJPT and not to worry about our lower OM 's because of this . YEAH ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Congrats and good luck with ENJJPT ! I 'm only a freshman but pursuing the same thing ( an ENJJPT slot ) . I would kill ( not literally ) for a UPT slot , but like you , I 've always dreamed of flying fighters so I am working my butt off to hopefully make it to ENJJPT.

But at the end of the day , if you want to wear a flightsuit , do a job that wears flightsuits . If you want to grow a beard and wear Merrells , sign up for special forces .

Either apply some type of objective criteria across the board or shut up and color . Insecurity and hurt feelings are poor foundations upon which to build policy . <p> Culture and leadership are the two main reasons I separated . Chalk this up to a sub- bullet under culture . I do n't bitch about berets , badges/tabs , cords , weapons that I am not authorized to wear . I chose my path and live within the confines of that path .

When I was at Vance , we had 1COs that had wings made . Did n't wear them obviously , but had them sitting on their desks . Full-up radiator badges . How does that look to the dude that washes out in phase 3 ? Out-processing and seeing some 1CO with the wings you could n't earn on her desk . Or how about the grads ?

The PACE can really only affect the last third of their own vision , which is Developing Airmen . Recruiting and Retention are primarily dependent on individuals determining the value of their benefits and weighing them against their patriotism . Obviously Recruiters have some discretion in who they process and send to MEPS , and Commanders have authority to separate folks at the end of their terms . However that can only remove the bad , it does n't keep the good . ( see these threads for more discussion : <p> And <p> ) . <p> So PACE 's own program for molding Airmen into the Profession of Arms / Warrior Ethos leadership mentality subconsciously acknowledges their limitations in benefits and then ignores it .

The problem is that the Air Force is constantly pitting Air Force members in a position where they are forced to choose between their family and Active Duty , and too many times it is due to deployed kingdom building or pointless tasking that some O-6 or higher refuses to get rid of . In those cases I see people become disillusioned with AD and choose to take their talents elsewhere , mostly to the Guard or Reserves where they feel they can better shield their family from AD careerism and the bloody trail it leaves behind .

If you go to Andrews , it is a 4 year controlled tour . If you go to Yokota , it is a 2 year tour . Even if they do n't send everyone to Hueys , the odds are still good that half you class will get a Huey . Right now it is about one cross-flow slot per unit per year , again , give or take .

How many of these do you think will be dropped per rucker class , and do you think they will be in high demand ( top 3 people going osprey ) or low demand ( you got osprey ? ouch ) ?

I 'm a Warrant and I love it . The difference between the Army and Air Force is night and day . Now I never flew in the Air Force but I have experience there and can tell you there are a lot of differences . In the Air Force Helo Pilots are unfairly classified as sub-par or lesser aviators especially by single seaters ( there are exceptions ) . In the ARMY the Aviation community is 95% Warrants who are very tightly knit and generaly held in high regards or at least envied by the real ARMY . The other big difference I can tell is the mission you will fly . If you go Blue you will more than likely fly SPEC OPS in 53 's or 60 's and might fly VIP/missle in Hueys ( AF Helo guys correct me if i 'm wrong ) . If you go Green , SPEC OPS guys fly for the 160th and they are all seasoned aviators with AT LEAST 4 or 5 years under their belts , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ARMY you have a lot of choices . **32;317;TOOLONG , attack , scout , medevac , trash hauling you name it the mission dictates the aircraft .

The more you are deployed ( as a pilot ) the more you will fly . That is straight across the board for any type/model/series in any service . Specifically for the Air Force ...

My commander said something about going on active duty when I start AMS , and staying on active all through training . I 've never heard of this before , is this true ( or possible ) ? Or will it be the case that I 'll be back to playing the waiting game for a while once I finish AMS ? <p> I 've got a lot going on in my civilian life right now , so I really want to get a feel for what I 'm going to be doing in the near future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> Based on what I saw from the folks I knew , two from the 106th , one from California . You will go to AMS , I have no idea how long that takes . You the may or may not go to ASBC for 6 weeks . You will then do some form of IFS , figure on a month for that . Then off to pilot training at one of the three UPT bases for roughly 8 months ( with possible casual time thrown in ) . Then a 3 to 6 week break in training to PCS to Ft Rucker with a 3 day TDY to Fairchild for dunker . Training at Rucker is 6 months . Then another break in training , length depends on when the next class starts at Kirtland . There should be a 3 week TDY enroute to Kirtland for SERE . Roughly 6 more months at Kirtland depending on a number of factors . All in all , figure on at something like 28 months from the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do and where you go on casual is men 's freestyle . You might be as the snacko at your unit , you might be making copies at your UPT base <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest hoke82 <p> ruckerstud is right on . Fortunately for you the 60 guys are getting out of Rucker quick after graduation , and the Gaurd guys go to Kirtland even quicker . It has been about a month or two for the last few guys at Rucker . Most of the gaurd guys here did SERE before starting UPT . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Talk to the folks in your unit ... especially the ones that have recently gotten back from Kirtland . PM me if nobody will help you from your unit . <p> Unlike what the other posts said , I had a week between my graduation from Laughlin and when my Rucker class started . I had about 10 days between my Rucker graduation and the start at Kirtland . The dudes in my unit now that are starting UPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time they had to wait between AMS and UPT varied from person to person . Just be patient cause when it 's all finished and you are done with your 90 days home seasoning orders , you 'll be scrounging for work . <p> Basically , Tweets/Texans were fun but there 's not much practical application in being proficient at doing barrel rolls to doing a live hoist off a mountain top 7,000 ft in the air . Just put up with stuck-wing stuff and get through it ( you do n't have to be the top in your class ... I used to joke by saying that I had to hook rides cause if I did n't finish in the bottom of the class , they would n't let me fly helos ) . Flying the huey was a blast . So much history behind that aircraft . Your first auto will feel much more like a rollercoaster than any acro in a T-37 or T-6 . Maybe by the time you get there , they 'll have the TH-1H huey ( glass cockpit , new engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rucker . Then you go to Kirtland ... no comment from me there . Then you go home , get 90 days of home seasoning . <p> It 's awesome flying and being in the rescue business is rewarding . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest stewartfish <p> Thanks guys . I had the training part pretty much mapped out for me by Base Training , what I have n't been able to get a feel for is how much time I 'll have in between the different parts of training , and what I 'll be doing with that time . <p> Rescue , you said the time your guys were home varied . Do you know about what the average time home was ? <p> Also , I 've heard something to the effect that Helo UPT slots are less frequent and therefore there can be a bit more of a wait . Anybody know anything about this ? <p> If I do have breaks where I 'll be coming home during training , will I be expected to work at the unit during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide if I want to work at the unit during my down time ? Or is it possible that there may not be any work availible at all at my unit , and I 'll be on my own while I 'm waiting to go to the next step in training ? <p> During our next drill I 'll ask around at the unit and see what guys have been through , but until then I wo n't have a chance to talk to anyone that 's been through UPT recently ( in the last 5 or 10 years ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> ren - What unit are you going to ? The average time studs were home varied from a couple of weeks to almost a year . From what I was told ... Yes , helo slots are fewer than fixed-wing ... only about 4 each year for the guard . Once you start in the pipeline , ( Phase I , I do n't think IFT or AMS count ) you stay on active duty orders until you are done with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long break between pilot training bases , they 'll keep you at that base ( or PCS you to the next base ) doing admin-type work . I was halfway done with Phase II before I got dates to Rucker ... and halfway complete with Rucker before I got my dates for Kirtland . Basically , you 'll just have to be patient . <p> Rainman ... I do n't know exactly why only 90 days . We come out of Kirtland ( equiv to FTU ) fully MQT . It 's a 6+ month long course so they throw a lot at students . Studs start tac training ( very basic ) while at Rucker now ( NVGs and tac form ) too . So , maybe that 's why only 90 days home seasoning to get LMQT ( slings , day water , night water , etc . ) . It 's hard to get/stay proficient with only 90 days . Plus , there 's only one place with a Pavehawk sim , so we ca n't even practice at our home unit . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue , I 'm getting a better idea of what 's coming now . I do wish I had some way of find out the Helo UPT start dates , so I could start guessing at when I might start training . Not so much because I 'm in a hurry ( its taken 3.5 years to get this far , I can be patient ) , but it would be nice to be able to guess at when I 'll be entering the " pipe " and plan the rest of my life accordingly . Like I said , I 've got a lot going on in my civilian life right now , and I 'm really wondering when the time will come to start winding it all down and commit my time fully to the Guard . So far I 'm pretty sure I 'll be going to AMS in October ( I 'm told the August class is full ) , but after that I 'm in the dark . I do n't know if I 'll be going back to the civilian world after AMS , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have to go to Brooks for more medical screening at some point , and I 'll be skipping IFT since I 've already got my private pilots licence . I 'm in the 129th RQS at Moffett Field in CA , by the way . Thanks <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ruckerstud <p> I think you need to caveat that , the Huey is fine machine , an Air Force Huey is a war horse that has been castrated . No guns , no counter measures , no RAWH ( or whatever the term is ) gear , no armored seats , and the list goes on . Yes , the Air Force has more or less lost the heavy lift SOF mission to the green machine , but rescue is still our ballgame , and with the number of aircraft going up with the CSAR X , they have already started ramping up pilot production to have the manning to fill it . Plus there is the CV-22 , which has a lot of potential . So , if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , keep pressing , just know that there is about a 50/50 shot you will have to do a tour in the Huey with all that that includes . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest waxgoblin <p> I 'm totally fine with doing a tour in the huey . In fact , I was planning on trying to go huey for a few years , but not 20 . I guess I 'm just wondering if I 'll be able to fly CSAR and move PJ/CCT in pave hawks or if that dream is pretty much replaced with flying hueys at a space base . The osprey looks fun , I 'd fly that : D

From that point , it became very clear to me that I would not be able to pass a depth perception test without some practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass a DP test is to learn to see Magic Eyes . http : **33;351;TOOLONG <p> For my entire life , I thought the Magic Eye thing was an elaborate hoax , and everyone who claimed to see them was lying . Well , they actually work . I spent a couple of weeks mastering Magic Eye , and then went to talk to my NCOs about how I could change my status . They told me that it was n't possible . After that , I decided to take matters into my own hands . I went to Dobbins ARB and told them I needed a DP test . I printed out the eye exam sheet from the DoDMERB website and brought it with me to look official . I looked into the machine and none of the circles jumped out at me . Then I started doing the Magic Eye thing , and went line by line . Eventually , I made it through every line and passed . I had the doctor sign the form , and I mailed it to DoDMERB with a paragraph stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter back telling me that they wanted a test done by an Air Force doctor . So , I called up Robins AFB , and scheduled a DP test . When I got there , they had me do the same test I had done at Dobbins , and I used the Magic Eye method again . <p> I mailed in those results , and about 3 weeks later , my NCOs got a letter saying I was PPQ . They were kind of mad because I had done all of this without them knowing , but they told me it could n't be done , so I had no other option . <p> A few years passed , I got a pilot slot , and headed to Brooks for my Initial Flying Class 1 . Sure enough , it was the same test I had taken so many times before , so I had no problems . A lot of the other people there that passed originally were having a lot of trouble .

I went to a civvy doctor and got signed off for 30 seconds of arc on the Randot test . He did a full blown exam and wrote me this prescription : <p> -0.50 DS <p> -0.25 DS <p> I think that 's right and left , respectively . I read that the test is already setup to stimulate depth so performing MagicEyes techniques does not yield any results . Supposedly the best thing for depth perception is having equal strength in both eyes . I was wondering if some of you guys could clear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my FC1 in February . <p> Should I go ahead and get the prescription for glasses and just take them with me ? I do n't  need them for every day visual enhancement . He said they would just " sharpen " my distant vision .

A few years later , I ended up passing the distant vision test 20/20 , and not needing the glasses for depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't require them for flying duties .

Waiver was written , medical package sent off ( MAJCOM-AETC-ACS ) but came back denied due to failure of OVT . How is that so ? ! What can I do ? ! How come I have great vision , have DP but get denied just because I cant pass that stupid shadow box ! ? Ridiculous ! I will include a few of the info off my waiver . I hope you Flt Docs can help me out. ! Please give me some sort of info/feedback on what to do or to take back to my Flt Med Office . Info is as follows : 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm a rising senior and have already gotten a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NC to renew my physical . Everything was well and good until the dreaded depth test . I 've taken depth tests before and had no issue with it but when I got to the part none of the circles beyond row B would pop out at me and I panicked . To make matters worse it was freezing in there and the tech was n't very friendly and was trying to rush me through it . <p> Because I failed and need the depth perception clearance on my physical to go to Freefall on 5 June I 'm retaking the test on this Tuesday ( 27 May ) . I jumped on here and to my relief saw that other people have experienced trouble with the same test . <p> Taking the magic eyes advice I went out today and got a book . My question is this : <p> There are two ways to view the magic eye images , one is diverging your eyes and the other is converging ( crossing ) them . I find the convergence way to be MUCH easier to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as looking past the image . Anyone who has any idea please drop me a line ... really biting my nails for this retake ! ! ! <p> Edited May 24 , 2008 by laserEYESflyer <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Voodoo1 <p> if you noticed in my previous post , i had the same question . after some research , i found that the OVT machine is already setup to stimulate the depth . diverging your eyes slightly is what allows you to hone in on the different levels of depth . also , if you realize , converging your eyes makes an inversion of the image so the circle would be further away , not closer . i went in for my IFC1 in February and passed without my glasses ..... barely and to be honest I guessed on a few . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Okay .

If that means you need glasses then after you get glasses the depth perception test becomes exponentially easier since you can now see .

I think I only got 4 correct , and even one or 2 or those were a SWAG . The following day when your with the optometrist ( before you get your eyes dilated ) he/she will determine your prescription and a tech will make a quick set of glasses for you ( very stylish by the way ) . Then you 'll retake whatever test(s) you failed without the glasses ( I think I got 5 correct that time ) , then while wearing the prescription ( aced it ) . If all goes well and you 're within the allowable uncorrected limits you 'll be good to go . <p> Also , when you get your approved FCI paperwork back it 'll probably say something about needing to wear corrective lenses in performance of flight duties , or something along those lines . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am just wondering if you can get a excessive refractive error , depth perception and possibly a lattice degeneration that is well within waiverable limits ?

The red lens test is a screening test that detects misalignment of the eyes in different directions of gaze . If you fail it , more testing is warranted to identify if there really is a problem or not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the test ) will determine where you stand with regards to waiverability , or if you even need a waiver . Red lens failures that are due to true eye misalignments are rare , but do happen . If this is confirmed , a waiver is unlikely . <p> A true failure on the visual field test is also very unusual . Again , a retest or further evaluation is required to confirm that accuracy of this result . As with the red lens , if this is a correct finding , waiverability is unlikely . <p> Bottom line is that a couple of flags have been raised on screening tests and warrants a closer look . <p> GD <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest guccieng <p> I have been flying as a flight engineer for 5 years now .

My flying class III physical is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft on the ground or in the air . I have 20/15 vision uncorrected and they were unable to find anything else wrong with my eyes other than me not being able to pass the depth perception circle test or the optometrists tests . My functional manager is saying that I have to find a new job . However , I have a buddy back at Travis with the exact same waiver that is still allowed to fly . Furthermore , I also have a buddy at Tinker who says there are 3 guys in his squadron ( that he knows of ) that have this same exact waiver as well . I can understand not being able to fly rotary on count of the real scanning that goes on with calling down the aircraft into a site etc ; but on a fixed wing there is n't that much actual " scanning " that goes on .

Most people who are post strabismus surgery still have problems with binocular vision and many are not waivered . It all depends on how well your eyes function .

It would be nice to see heritage make a comeback . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Great , now when will strippers and hot local civilian chicks be allowed back in the O'Clubs as legend has it ? <p> HAHAHA ! Yeah , that would be great ... for all o-clubs except DLF . Hell Rio does not exactly have hot local civilian chicks . On the binary scale , they are all 0 . I am sure plenty of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent connection to this sh**hole . <p> My 2 cents on this now . GREAT on General Welsh for doing this ! This is definitely a step in the right direction . Only problem is that this is going to follow the typical bulls**t bureaucratic road that all policy changes do . By the time morale patch wear guidelines arrive at the group or squadron level it will be so restricted that it will not even be worth approving them again . Holy crap , I could only imagine what the E leadership will do . Leaders are just too worried about getting in trouble or what their superiors think of them .

So , here 's a GREAT idea : We should have CGOs and junior FGOs ( preferably those who have n't supervised more than a 3 to 5-person space , missile , or aircrew in their career ) give presentations to AWC , NWC , and CAPSTONE classes so that Lt Cols , Colonels , and Generals will understand the " correct " way to command . Wish I would have thought of that ... <p> K <p> That 's the beauty of this message board .

The cynical view says this is leadership trying to placate the masses with simple things to keep their minds off of the major issues .

In most cases , the answer is B. <p> You trust me enough to step up during war and make life and death decisions as an officer , but when it comes down to knowing that a picture of BQZip 's Mom 's Flaming Hot Box on a morale patch is inappropriate , you think I 'm incapable of figuring that shit out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it does not address the challenge CSAF just presented Sq CCs and Wg CCs . You naively think that broad " go do the right thing " guidance equals leadership . One reason we trust officers to go execute combat missions is because we are confident that they understand their mission , they are trained to competently execute their portion of the mission , they are properly resourced , they understand the constraints and restraints required by relevant authorities , we are confident in their leadership abilities and there are appropriate C2 mechanisms to adjust the mission when the planning assumptions are wrong or the enemy changes the environment . We do n't just trust officers to kill without making sure they understand the standards , expectations and mission and that they are prepared to make those important decisions . We also continuously assess the judgement , performance and leadership of the officer ( we should probably do more of this ) . <p> CSAF changed the AFI to give Wg CCs the authority to allow morale patches on Fridays and special events , but requires Sq CCs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the leadership pros at BODN what they thought the standard should be and how it should be enforced . You reply with a cheap shot about email leadership and the simplistic " act like officers " . <p> I 'm no longer a wing commander , so I really do n't have a dog in this fight . I am curious to know what advice , guidance , intent , standards the Wg CCs are going to give Sq CCs about acceptable morale patches . I think written supplemental guidance ( MFRs on the wall ) and emails are overused and ineffective . Personal mentoring , where your subordinate commanders understand your intent and expectations , is much better . However , you would be surprised how many people ask " where is that written " when given feedback on how well they are meeting a standard that officers should know . <p> I think the Friday morale patches should be authorized by all Wg CCs and the Sq CCs should approve patches that balance unit pride , humor , cleverness and professionalism . I think Sq CCs should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the freestyle expression of individual taste and humor . We wear a uniform , not walking billboards . Sports teams , offensive material , and commercial product endorsements should not be allowed on our uniforms . <p> You say this is common sense and we should trust our officers to make the right call . I agree , but there will still be a need for Wg CCs and Sq CCs to talk about where we draw the standards line and how we will enforce the predictable deviations from common sense . What we wear on our uniforms transmits information to those who see us . Our joint partners , civilian leaders , allies and subordinate Airmen make leadership and competence assessments when they see these patches . There are plenty of examples of officers wearing morale patches that do not belong on a uniform . The leadership challenge for our officers is creating a force that knows how to make the judgement and has the courage to enforce the standards , without specific written guidance from above . <p> And I agree . This is the easy shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define the expectations . We have much larger and more complex leadership challenges we should all be concerned about . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> And I agree . This is the easy shit . It should not take more than a few minutes to define the expectations . We have much larger and more complex leadership challenges we should all be concerned about . <p> There in lies the rub , 15 years ago we absolutely policed ourselves with respect to the easy/small stuff . Now we have removed most decision making from lower ranks that they have no no perceived experience to be accountable ( we have created a military of AFI following robots ) . Those that did make unilateral decisions got schwacked when their decision did n't perfectly match how the guy 3 positions up would have done it . However , i have no doubt that that skill set is still there it just needs a chance to be broken out ... What better way but with insignificant , easily correctable rule changes that can be implemented/enforced at the lowest level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in Flight Med get to wear sports jersey 's during football season , then I do n't see why we should n't get to wear tabs with a sports team name/logo . Though I 'm sure those who root for the DC NFL team will get a call from MEO ( just joking ... or am I ? ) . <p> As for who decides what is acceptable , it sounds like from the AFI that it is up to the Sq/CC ... which means that anybody above the Sq/CC can tell him/her that it 's not acceptable ( since that 's how it goes for everything else ) . And as for enforcing the standard , well of course you will be required to take a picture of the tab , make an eSSS and route the tab for approval to your Sq/CC , and then will have to keep the signed copy of the approval letter on your person at all times . I 'm sure a new form will be developed specifically for the process . <p> Bingo . It is n't that hard to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squadron patches , sports teams , colleges ... those all seem like they fall firmly on the proper side of the " health and welfare " border . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You naively think that broad " go do the right thing " guidance equals leadership . <p> I think it shows a profound lack of trust in your people if you automatically believe they wo n't do the right thing . <p> When I fly , I usually wear a baseball cap under my headset .

@@43194697 @3194697/ <h> 2,434 posts in this topic <p> I 'm just spitballing here , but I think there may be a few considerations . A FAIP is still doing basic AF airmanship and teaching it ( fundamentals of flying , pubs , comms , etc ) . Even with 4 years of heavy flying and an MC-12 mixed in there , I 'm already losing some of those things . There are flghts , even months were some units do n't even talk on a radio . For example , unless you do LR , you are n't going to have checked a real set of aircraft forms or beat up the traffic pattern ; you take an IRC , but you 'll never look at the -217 and remember how to hold in ICAO ; I bet everyone here has been on 6-8 hr flights where you did n't even change the nav mission and just stared at the same dirt compound as yesterday . Some RPA guys might get really good in an airstack , relaying comms , and helping plan weapons effects ; but there are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help out unless you were a -38 guy going to a B-1 or a Toner guy that gets a rare AFSOC assignment . My advice , if you drop an RPA save up for an RV-4 , split it with your buds and keep flying in normal airspace . If nothing else go do Launch and Recovery . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Why do n't they just save us all a waste of time and money training these students at UPT phase 3 and take the two bottom students out of the T-6 phase and track them over to UAVs ? I too do n't know how they can say that they wo n't automatically pick the bottom two out of phase 3 . How is that fair for anyone ? Why work hard to pass check rides and daily rides if they wo n't assign you based on ranking ? <p> Basically your questions and points are exactly why this whole idea is terrible . It is indeed a waste of money , and there really is no way to do it right . <p> Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other political reasons for this . Some RPA operators may be qualified as pilots but operating an RPA is not piloting , especially considering the kind of flying RPAs do . Like FUEL was saying , it really makes a difference what kind of flying you 're doing . Us " manned " aircraft guys ( including FAIPs ) still have to routinely train in all kinds of piloting that drones just do n't do . Not only is it a waste to take people out of their trained pilot status and put them into generously and politicaly titled Remotely " Piloted " Aircraft positions , its just a bad idea in general , functionally speaking . <p> If the AF was serious about getting these guys back into manned positions , they 'd give them regular proficiency in manned aircraft , and although that would be expensive , there would still be a return on investment when they went back to a manned position because of their proficiency levels . Still this would be very expensive and it would certainly be better to have Drone-specific guys from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the whole TAMI 21 thing ; ( if I 'm not mistaken ) , the AF did n't even provide a single T-38 for those guys to maintain basic skills . Imagine trying to zoom through federal airspace in a single seat fighter after years of automated orbits around a tent if Afghanistan . <p> Drones need to be a separate track , that 's it . <p> Edited July 19 , 2015 by xcraftllc <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You keep using that word .

Graduates and now has a service commitment of 10 years because of Wings . He goes over to his RPA squadron and does his 3 year tour ( best case scenario more likely he gets nonvol 'd to do more ) . He finally gets his manned aircraft assignment ( most likely a less than desirable aircraft and not fighter type even if he was T-38 Fighter/FAIP qual 'd ) . He is 3 years behind his peers in that MWS and is probably not upgrading on the Letter of X 's in a timely rate because he is n't one of the new young guys . Maybe he finally gets on the Letter of X 's for things so he is not completely new and does not look like a giant sack of shit on his Majors board compared to his peers who are IPs in their MWS since they had three more years experience . Our RPA direct out of UPT friend can kiss Weapons School chances or Test Pilot chances out the window . Perhaps maybe he does n't even have the hours to go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reality and not best case . The RPA direct guy probably does 5 years min in the RPA gig . The Air Force does n't even guarantee you a manned cockpit but let 's say our RPA stud is lucky and gets his ass in some type of seat 5 years later . The rest of the above situation still plays out . Still owes a 10 year commitment . <p> Now how about this .... Stud gets RPAs on drop night . Realizes he has not graduated UPT yet and therefore has not incurred his 10 year commitment yet but knows his drop because drop is a month before graduation . If this stud SIE ( self induced elimination ) he does not owe 10 years now but 5 years ( only 3 more after UPT really ) and does not have the raw deal of flying drones . Now this guy who SIE can possibly go to an Army or Navy Guard/Reserve unit and get hired by them and sent to their flight school to actually fly . Pretty sure you can do that even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is actually true if you are eligible for a formal flying training with another branch if you SIE from the Air Force ? ) However if the stud SIE 'd that late in the game after drop night , Big Blue would probably make him pay for all the money spent on him for training back since they would probably put 2 and 2 together and see he is probably SIEing because he got drones . <p> Dudes this is no kidding the discussion some older grey beards are having with some of my younger LT studs . IMO , it really does seem like if you are a UPT stud who gets sent to RPAs , you have a death sentence as a military aviator in terms of hours , Letter of X 's , promotion opportunities , airline flying compared to your year group peers . Even if you tried to SIE because of the raw drone deal , they would make you pay all the money back for training most likely . <p> Still the chances are pretty low for a stud to get RPAs out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 600 student pilots minimum at all the bases combined for the current year and they need 80 RPA guys , you guys can do the math behind the statistics of getting the shit sandwich . Even so , that memo posted by the Wing King at XL said that Columbus , Laughlin and Vance are the ones that are looking to drop RPAs and out of the T-1 track as well ( no mention of T-38 track ) . Who knows , we will know more Friday with this next drop and the picture will get clearer then . <p> Edited July 19 , 2015 by Razor666 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> IMO , it really does seem like if you are a UPT stud who gets sent to RPAs , you have a death sentence as a military aviator in terms of hours , Letter of X 's , promotion opportunities , airline flying compared to your year group peers . <p> Let me start by saying I am in no way advocating for this RPA drop out of UPT - I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total waste of time and money .

I just would n't be really shocked if somehow the AF figured out a way to make someone pay some type of money back ( education/training ) for something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay back the AF for their school since they quit USAFA early ( but that is entirely different from UPT obviously ) . <p> My info may be dated but money for training payback does not exist ( at least it did not exist in 2011 ) . Had a guy who still had multiple years of UPT ADSC who wanted out . MAJCOM/CV tried hard to force him to pay back money for the training and finally figured out that it could not be done .

The only thing is that we are making the big assumption that they get manned after their tour and I for sure hope and pray that they do because that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of a 38 Fighter/FAIP quald dude who got RPAs back in the 09 times getting assigned to a single seat . However , they did get a manned aircraft . Any more legit success stories I can tell my studs would be appreciated because they for sure feel the sky is falling and I 'm not educated on the subject enough to tell them its going to be okay . <p> Just to throw my two cents . I am one of those dudes that got rpa 's back in 09-11 fiscal years . Fighters were never going to happen they said that day one . Ok whatever but you could still get a jet . Most 98% got there first choice of plane and location . Some got screwed , again and some of that was due to attitude in the sq not hacking the mish , tactically DNIFing . However , plenty of dudes are upgrading to AC quickly . Although that does depend on airframe and how hard that guy works . Plenty of guys have done fine out of there respective school houses I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And many more that are going to Maj board with no problem getting a DP . <p> A lot of UPT-D were coming out of the RPA world with a Q code and at least a K code in an mws . <p> More than anything it depends on your attitude and want to push through the queep and perform in your manned aircraft . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> One of the biggest things that can be gained from the very informed discussion in this thread is ; even those who can lend some perspective and experience on how this can still work out totally think the idea is bad , that 's when you know this needs to not happen . Especially considering that this is just a temporary patch and not an actual solution . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just to throw my two cents .

( Can anyone confirm the actual cost ? ) . How do you figure " big blue " would recoup that money ? Do you know many 2Lts millionaires ? <p> When students put in their dream sheets at the bottom it says for their assigned IP to mark whether or not they should be Fighter/FAIP qualified . Below that is the same container for their Flt Comm to mark answering the same question . Out of the 100+ sheets I 've laid eyes on , only one was ever not recommended for Fighter/FAIP . <p> For the second question easily well over a million dollars .

Now for some facts : <p> If you quit the Academy , you fall under AFI 36-3504 para 16 , and you are liable to either serve your ADSC enlisted or pay back your education expenses . <p> If you quit UPT , you never have a flying ADSC . There is even a specific note in AFI 36-2107 Table 1.1 note 2 that says you 'll have either a 2 year ADSC or the ADSC for the program you quit , whichever is less . <p> There is another section in 36-2107 2.19.1 that talks recoupment of bonus and incentive pays for non-completion of the associated ADSC , but since you never get an ADSC if you quit UPT , it does n't apply . <p> I personally saw one person SIE over their aircraft drop ( non-RPA ) in 2009 and another over their track select in 2004 .

I did n't go to UPT until I was a Capt and did n't get to my first flying assignment until I had 6.5 years under my belt . Upgraded ahead of several dudes to AC , IP , EP . Was a flying Sq/CC and am currently a flying Group/CC . It 's not all rainbows and sunshine but this hyperbole about the sky falling is over the top . <p> This in no way makes UPT direct RPA a good idea . <p> Which base ? <p> ...

I know of no dude that has 400,000 laying around unless he 's a grey beard . <p> Academy recoupment is for education costs . The $400K number is a clever pat-on-the-back number for high school students to quote that is pretty much based on the cost to run the USAFA base ( including the 10th ABW ) divided by the number of cadets . The actual number is closer to $120-140K for education recoupment . <p> Several 2009 USAFA grads ended up self-eliminating in UPT . The " workaround " to make them pay was to force them to separate . They could n't recoup the UPT training cost , but they could get the pro-rated USAFA commitment back . One of my best friends got slapped with a $120K bill from the gov't . It got even more shady . The gov't sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The debt got classified as both education debt AND gov't debt which means that A ) he could n't get rid of it in bankruptcy and B ) they can garnish wages without a judge 's order . As of today , he has a decent job and he is happy . But his wife has to keep her finances separate from him as much as possible since his credit is trash now from the gov't debt . Trying to get anything that needs decent credit is not possible for him alone without exorbitant fees . 
@@43194698 @3194698/ <h> Air Battle Manager ( ABM ) info <h> 84 posts in this topic <p> I very much enjoy being an ABM . I 've been lucky with my timing . I deployed right after Sept 11 and got to fly the first night of OIF . I think I 've earned the respect of the fighter pilots here on base by knowing what I 'm doing , admiting when I 'm wrong , finding a way to fix the problem , and not making the same mistake again . I also get involved in mission planning , briefing , and debriefing . I 'm not afraid for me or my crew to be a DFP and I 'm not afraid to defend my crew when we are right . As far as no one wanting to be an ABM , I 'm not sure that 's true . I was n't pilot qualified and turned down a nav slot . I think most jobs are what you make of them . Bloom where the Air Force plants you . It is hard to enjoy your job if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't very good for a variety of reasons ( not enough experience , poor debriefs , not asking the right questions , and not learning lessons from their mistakes ) . Utimatley , it is up to you to learn the lessons of your job and apply them . Being an ABM is extremly fun once you get to know the pilots and are able to make the right call at the right time . Nothing like going to a debrief and have a SQ/CC WIC grad say " Mickey good work today " or having the wing weapons officer say " your dudes have been providing really good control ... better than most " . Any job is what you make of it . If you sit around bitching and complaining of how being an ABM sucks and you wish you were a pilot , you never will enjoy being an ABM .

Being vectored nose-to-nose , co-altitude with a tanker . We got an RA on TCAS , got out of his way , and then the MCC on AWACS calls us up on VPN and asks us if we 're going to file a HATR on him . It was embarrassing listening to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been focusing on the bad guys we were looking for on the ground . For the life of me I can not understand why they are over there ...

Or will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pets and furniture ) ? Will I have time for anything ? What 's the weather like ? What should I expect when I go to Tinker/Robins ? Are any bases preferable over others ? I have so many questions and am just looking for someone to answer them and kind of clear up the uncertanties : ) <p> Thanks for any info you may have . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Not an ABM , but used to be on E-3s . There really needs to be an ABM forum like there is for CSO and RPA ... <p> Anyway , location-wise Geilenkirchen ( NATO AWACS ) , Kadena and Elemendorf are typically sought-after first assignments but they only drop to a small percentage of UABMT grads . Most will go to Tinker . Have n't been to Robins , but on the plus side their mission is more interesting , and on the negative side I always hear people say Robins is two hours from everything , but there is n't much in the local area . If you go to USAF E-3s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... First to the 552 TRS who owns you during contract academic/sim instruction , then to the 966 AACS for flight training . At the 966th you 'll do some of your " sorties " in the sim , and for the flights you 'll sit on the ground and step to the spare a lot . I 'm trying to remember how many rides were in the ABM syllabus when I left ( I was a nav instructor at the 966th ) and I want to say about 10 . Hopefully someone who knows better will speak up . After that , you 'll do 2-3 weeks of MQT culminating in a cert brief , then graduate to your gaining squadron . At this point , in the old days , you would have finally gotten your wings and started earning your gate months . I understand that now you graduate from UABMT with wings which is since you do n't even know if you 're a puker yet . <p> As far as Tinker goes , people b***ch about the 552 ACW but I think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and underfunded/undermanned , there is leadership flail going on everywhere , it 's just even harder to manage **31;414;TOOLONG training/etc. for squadrons of 330 vice 30 or 60 . Have a good attitude and you 'll do fine . Morale does not seem noticeably higher in bombers , fighter pilots b***ch on here all the time , so do the AMC bubbas ... Bloom where you 're planted , you 'll do just fine . If you want to do something else after a while , I know two ABMs from my old squadron that just got picked up for UPT . It can happen if you work for it . I think in most squadrons you get two over the shoulder rides before you get signed off Combat Mission Ready . Then it 's fly , sim , work in scheduling or SNACKO , and go deploy using a skillset different from what you 've spent most of your training focused on ( think more " battle management , " less controlling ) . The OKC location is fantastic . AFAIC , it 's one of the best cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Congratulations ... You 're stepping into an underrated career field with the potential to do a lot and have a lot of fun along the way . The spears you get from fighter dudes , tanker dudes , and your own flight deck ? Take them and learn from them . Seize every opportunity you can get to control and get a good debrief . Seize every opportunity you can get to interface with non-fighter dudes and learn their needs ( did you know bombers have " fighter " timelines too ? ) . Good luck . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> All the info is pretty spot on , you will start at Tyndall and learn the basics of controlling . I 'm not sure how the syllabus at Tyndall is set up these days but I know it involves a mix of sims and live control . I can only speak to AWACS because its where I 've been but if you stay with a U.S. AWACS squadron you will go through the process that DiscoNav talked about starting in the TRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use the system on the jet . Unfortunately what you are taught on a nice windows based system at and the system on the jet is very different . Make sure you really study through this part and learn the system . Once you get out the 966th you have 7 flights then a check ride . Of your seven flights two can be accomplished completely in the sim usually done on rides 2-4 and on rides 1-5 if you do n't control live on the jet can be completed in the sim . The MQT part is exactly how DiscoNav said . Once you get out into the line try to get as many flights and sims as you can because hours are getting shorter every year . Any chance you get to de-brief with the pilots you worked with take it , if the mission goes bad fess up to your mistakes and learn from them . If you have an specific questions shoot me a PM. 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You 'll start training fairly quickly now as the pipeline does n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the Air Force FIFTEEN days prior to starting class . <p> Where do I live ? <p> You wo n't be required to live on base in dorms but if you 're married there is new housing available . Most of the LTs live in either Waterstone , Eagles Landing or the Enclave . College with a paycheck . I lived at Enclave when I was a student and I live in Mexico Beach now . Mexico Beach is a small town on the beach east of base .

Yes , they 're flying and it 's legit . Since the introduction of basic military aviation into the syllabus ( April 2011 ) there have been a few upchuckers identified ( maybe 3 or 4 total thus far ) , but in each case the student was seen by the flight doc and overcame it . The ABM gate month structure has two years built in where one can accrue " ground gate months , " and has some slack so after the ground gate months are up , one can afford to lose a few extra gate months . Ground gate months mean the individual is on inactive AOs and categorized as " ground radar " in the aviation resource managment realm . <p> Parker , <p> abmwaldo said it all .

Even though it 's UNCLAS , it 's not openly available , so the first time you 'll see it will probably be at Tyndall . Do n't sweat it , though ; honestly , if you do n't have prior C2 experience , most of the concepts and terminology will require someone to explain it to you anyway , and there will be plenty of time to study it once you get to Tyndall . For now , probably the best things you can do are enjoy your time off , drink plenty of beer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and getting safety briefed to death , etc . <p> Also , it never hurts to look on the internet and see what the housing situation is like down there . When I went though Tyndall , I lived in Mexico Beach , which is a small beach town to the east side of base . The rest of my classmates lived in Callaway or Panama City north of the base . There 's also Panama City Beach which is a little farther , usually like a 45 min drive to work given the traffic and horrible stop light timing . <p> If you really wanted to work on something , try improving your ability to listen to multiple conversations at the same time . Try visiting a site like LiveATC.net and listening to two streams at the same time ; set one a little bit louder than the other and see how well you can keep track of what 's happening on both frequencies . A typical AWACS ABM is expected to listen to 5 radios ( 4 working freqs plus guard ) and 4 intercoms ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , so you can see how important this skill is to develop . Of course , not every radio will be active at the same time , and some are more important than others , so the technique most people use is to prioritize frequencies by volume . <p> As for what ABMs do in theater , the very quick and simple answer is airspace deconfliction : making sure the various players get the airspace they need and they do n't run into other airplanes , keep away from artillery fire , etc . Back stateside , the focus is more on the traditional air-to-air skillset of controlling fighters , providing a picture call , pointing out threats , and that sort of thing . As for ALO , I have not personally done an ALO tour so perhaps others can chime in , but the opportunities are definitely there ; I believe there were something like 5 or 6 slots on the last ABM bill that Tinker had . <p> Please feel free to send me a PM if you 'd like more info and welcome to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437700 <p> Just a bit of helpful advice from a guy who used to fix and fly on E-3 's for 13 years . At crew show at the jet bring your own cream and sugar for coffee and handiwipes/hand sanitzer to clean your O2 mask . Do n't  ask the crew chief for any of this because he will be busy fixing one of your guys chairs that they just broke . Mx does maintenance not catering . Have some common courtesy for your fellow female crew dawgs and not unleash a out of control fire hose in the lavatory . Also learn early that the flight deck will never like you and if you whine more that means more transitions ( practice takeoffs and landings ) at the end of a 8 hour sortie back a Tinker , their evil like that . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Let me caveat one thing Prosuper just said ...

" Goats ABMS saying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't worry , you are not fated to have them not like you ( especially if you are female Lt AWO Yummypants ) . Just have some SA and do n't self-marginalize by only hanging out with the weapon bros when you get to your squadron just b/c you 've been hanging out with them through Tyndall and the FTU .

You know its bad when you hate each other . Read what you guys just wrote ... it 's chock full of hate and bitterness . In MC-12 's , we typically get along great . On the Cobra Ball , we got along great too . ABCCC ... yep , we got along there too . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't have to fly the E-3 , for reasons like what you typed above .

Like that Major that just loves to fly . <p> I would argue to say that a flying training squadron filled with 49% majors , 50% captains , and 1% Lt Cols is probably lacking a little balance .

Certainly , not all Ops guys still have that <p> I do n't know about everyone elses experience at UPT , but some of our best instructors were FAIPS . As a matter of fact , our class voted a FAIP for our " best IP " awards in T-37 's , T-1 's , and T-38 's .

Unlike UPT , this is 100% commanders ranking .

When you get your orders for PIT , you should also get the ADSC letter that goes along with it ... it will be more specific as far as dates are concerned , and the outbound assignments office should be able to answer any questions that come up . <p> As far as the T-6 is concerned , you would n't actually be going back to PIT to become an instructor , per se -- you would just be going to get qual 'd in the T-6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spells it out , but I have n't heard any transitioned FAIPs ( i.e. , those at Laughlin ) that have complained about getting screwed after ramping up ops in the T-6 as far as commitment is concerned . <p> There may very well be some ADSC involved in getting qual 'd in the T-6 , but it may be shorter than your FAIP commitment and/or concurrently served -- so you may never see the commitment because you still have to finish out your initial 36 month instructor deal . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> When does the three year commitment for a FAIP start ? Is it right after you graduate , or not until you return from PIT ? <p> It 's 36 months from the day you take your last PIT checkride at ENJJPT .. that 's why I busted my a** off to finish on Jun 30 instead of 1 Jul last year .... that 1 day bought me 1 less month until I finish my FAIP assignment . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ViperDriver98 <p> I left DLF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had me for about an extra 3 months ( but I also was able to do SOS- and I definately recommend pushing to get this done if possible ) . My 38 Bro 's currently there are approx 120 days overdue getting their assignments which in turn delays orders and when you actually get out the door . Another factor is how many slots FTU 's have available . Some of the A-10 assigned guys actually left 2 months before their 3 years would 've been up , another A-10 person got pushed back 3 extra months . I have n't heard any stories from guys going to heavies , so I assume they are getting on with their lives on the proposed timeline. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For the pro side , you 're given a ton of responsibility as a young pilot . You are going to be an instructor , aircraft commander , and possible even an evaluator as a young lieutenant . On the con side , you have to stay in the AETC world for three years . Also , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> FAIPs are n't guaranteed a follow-on like they used to be . Now they have to compete with other FAIPs for their follow on . And your follow-on will be comensurate with your SUPT track . <p> The best guys to go to on this are Toro and ENJJPTIP . I 'm sure they can hook you up . <p> HD <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> - As a T-38 FAIP , I got just over 1000 hours in three years . As I 've heard many times - it was n't so much 1000 hours of flight time , it was one hour of flight time 1000 times . That flight time definitely got me better at tac formation , rejoins , and landing , but the airmanship and general flight knowledge is something that hits a plateau in less than three years . <p> - If you go fighters you can upgrade to flight lead faster at your Ops unit ( FAIPs require 200 hours versus the normal 300 to begin ) . <p> - If your first choice is not available at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your next chance three years later ( there were no Strike Eagles in my UPT drop ) . Along with this , your UPT performance plays no part in your post-FAIP assignment . In theory you could finish at the bottom of your UPT class , then get your first choice after your FAIP tour . <p> - If you 're married , it 's a great first assignment for the family . The hours are long , but you only ' deploy ' for cross countries , and those generally had plenty of volunteers . Along similar lines , it 's a great opportunity to get your Masters degree . <p> Cons , <p> - By the time you get to your Ops unit , your buddies will all be 4FL instructors . Guys who you gave dollar rides to could be writing your gradesheets in the MQ program . That 's not something that bothered me , but some guys do n't dig it . <p> - If you 're interested in Weapons School , being a FAIP will make that tough due to three years taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rank ) limit of applying for Weapons School . <p> - I mentioned in the Pros that you could get a better aircraft three years later . This can be a double-edged sword ... I have a friend who graduated top of his class and chose a FAIP to remain at Columbus with his AD wife . Three years later he got his last choice of assignments . <p> I personally enjoyed my time as a FAIP . I like being an instructor , I liked the T-38 and if I had a choice I would do it again . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Scoobs , do n't forget the lovely town of Columbus as well . To answer your question yes you can get more than 1000 hrs and as a matter of fact it is rather difficult to not get more than 1000 hrs as a Tweet FAIP , but you will have to ask someone else for definitive answers about T-1 and T-38 FAIPs . In my opinion the only reason FAIP always seems to be looked down upon is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest part for me has been reading all the emails from my UPT buddies out there doing all kinds of cool operational stuff while I try to explain to Stan why you need to abruptly move the stick forward after one full turn in the spin recovery procedure for the 69th time . Based on the fact I am still currently a FAIP I suppose I do n't have the best answer but I definitely agree with TORO about the pros of the job . As most of you know and would probably agree , FAIPs all but run the squadron in UPT , especially the Tweet squadrons . Along with that comes lots of responsibility both flying wise and in the squadron . Here at Columbus they shy away from FAIPs being examiners but everytime you fly a student sortie you are logging IP time which is invaluable and your airmanship just grows on a daily basis which will be nothing but a good thing no matter what your follow-on is . Just as a side note I did not put FAIP anywhere near the top of my dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an IP will make for memories I will never forget and an experience that ca n't be replaced . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll be nearing my 29th B-day when I get my wings , I know there was a recent thread on weapon school , but Toro you mentioned the age/rank issue with Weapon School .

If you are , I would n't expect you to be much longer with an attitude like that . The Air Force will come and go , but your family is supposed to be there forever . You have to take care of them too becuase without them , you would n't be able to do the things you do in the first place . Whether it be right out of UPT or after an Ops-to-Ops assignment , dudes look for an assignment that will allow for a little more quality family time . It does n't mean he hates the fighter lifestyle , it just means the family need a little care and feeding . <p> unlike UPT , which for the most part , assigments are based on how well you did . As a FAIP your assigment has nothing to do with how well of an instructor you are , how much you fly , or flying talent and skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names out of a hat ? It 's all about making the effort . Guys like Toro got their first choice out of UPT with 1 ) some luck , because there is no guarentee to be a Strike Eagle in every drop , and 2 ) because he worked his ass off . He was an instructor controller in the RSU , check pilot , FCF pilot , etc and not every FAIP upgraded to those positions . On more than one occasion , he was voted Favorite IP from a graduating class , not favorite FAIP , favorite IP . There were some FAIPS that did the min run , skated by , and got MWS 's that were not their first choice . Bottom line , it 's a combo of luck and your hardwork , and that goes for any assignment , whether it be straight out of UPT or after a FAIP tour . <p> Try to get what you want now , there is NO guarantee you will get it after a FAIP tour . <p> You 're not guaranteed your choice out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have just a much chance getting an A-10 out of UPT as you do out of a FAIP . <p> That way they can actually teach the student something about being a pilot in the Air Force <p> FourFans130 . The T-38 side of UPT , at least when I was a FAIP , was all wrapped up in having students lead 2-ship low levels , leading formation landings , etc . In actuality , Phase III is training the product of our customers , which is IFF , followed by FTU 's , followed by their first Ops Squadron . From the time they leave UPT , the average graduate is going to be a wingman for the next 2 years . Can a FAIP teach a dude about notching and threat reactions ? No . Can he teach a dude to fly in position off lead , stay visual , maintain element deconfliction , and say " 2 " on the radio ? Yes . <p> Razorback , <p> Some other things you need to think about are things like going to Weapons School , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to WIC , you have to be an IP in your MWS with at least 50 hours of IP time . The average path to WIC is a young guy right thru the pipeline into his first Ops squadron . During that tour , he starts getting groomed for WIC , and will complete 2FLUG ( Flight Lead Upgrade ) then 4FLUG , then onto IP . Most dude are finishing the IP upgrade on there way out of the squadron to their next OPS tour ( grooming = preference for Opt-to-Ops assignments ) . They hit their new squdaron , rack up the 50 hours , submit their package ( STS ) and off they go . The point being it normally takes a guy into his second operational tour in the MWS . <p> If you FAIP first , you would be hard pressed to finish 2FLUG , 4FLUG , IPUG and get your 50 hours within the average 2yr , 8 month tour , although their is a certain F-15E pilot who was a FAIP that did it and is currently commanding a squadron . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ? Yes , but it is friggin difficult . <p> I enjoyed my FAIP time . I flew my ass off ( over 1,000 hours in a 3 year tour , ca n't say I 've gotten that many hours in the Mud Hen during the last 3 years ) and the quality of life was good for the family . I definetly enjoy the F-15E more . You ca n't turn camel jockeys into hair , teeth and eyeballs in the T-38 . <p> Whatever your get , I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and the wife will be there right beside you .

You have to progress through Two-Ship flight lead , then Four-Ship , and eventually Instructor Pilot upgrade before you are a candidate for WIC . <p> If you end up being a candidate for Weapons School , your age or prior enlisted time wo n't be a liability . They do look at your date of officer rank .

You get left in the dust by your classmates you got commissioned with , some of mine were in WIC when I was getting my F-16 IQ check . You will end up as the wingman for your former students , which is actually really cool . However , when you 've got a major 's board coming up you have to wonder how you will stack up with the rest of them .... <p> If I had to do it over again I 'd go out to the CAF . ( Only having children would change my mind on this . ) You will always have time later to go back to AETC and maybe it would be at an RTU instead of UPT . You just never know .

As for the family , that was my number one reason for FAIPing and yet another instructor told me if you FAIP then after that you will have at least 2 back to back MWS tours . If you have a family then a lot of guys like to use the instructor slot ( and from what I understand you only get one ) between MWS as a ' break ' or at the end when the kids are a bit older and they could interact more with them than just diaper changes and such . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As a current T-6 FAIP I can tell you that it is n't a bad deal .

@@43194701 @3194701/ <h> Non-Availibility lodging/letter <h> 189 posts in this topic <h> Guest BAM <p> I 'm sorry if this question is already answered in this topic , but I am having trouble putting together the puzzle . I am TDY enroute to Mcconnell at Altus for 135PIQ . I showed up and was given a non-availability slip for five days . I think I understand correctly that since I already tried to get into the VOQ and was given a non-availability slip , I am not required to check again for VOQ availability . I also understand that I am allowed to stay off-base under normal circumstances if my lodging costs do not exceed that of the Altus VOQ daily rate . <p> Here is my confusion . Let 's say Altus VOQ rate is $40 dollars a day and the hotel they forced me to go to on my non-availability slip says $70 a day . <p> Am I going to be responsible for the $30 more a day if I stay past the five days on my slip ? <p> I guess my confusion arises from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't force you to stay on base , but they are only responsible for reimbursing you up to the govt lodging rate . I also read on here that once you have checked for govt lodging availability , you are not required to check again . <p> The disconnect for me is that it says your not required to check back for gov't availability , so who is responsible for the difference between the govt lodging rate and the actual hotel rate after the five days I was authorized on my Non Availability slip ? <p> Also , do I have to go to the hotel on my non availability slip ? <p> They only reg I found that addresses this is U1045 in the JFTR . Is there another reg I should be looking at ? <p> Thanks for all of your help ! I hope my post is n't too confusing , but if it is , it just reflects my confusion . <p> EDIT : <p> Upon further research in 34-246 there is a special clause about tdy-to-school . I think I fall under that but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back on base after 5 days , but they can only move me once ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You are only required to check in once ... once you receive a non a it is good for the duration regardless of the number of days on the non-a slip . <p> You are n't on the line for the cost above the VOQ rate on base . As long as your lodging rate is at or below the max lodging rate for that locality . $70 is the max for Altus so you 're right there . You 'll be reimbursed at that $70 rate . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm going on a long TDY soon , and was told told by my future TDY boss that he is setting up either an apartment or hotel for me ( OCONUS ) .

No big deal . <p> I decided instead to get an apartment out in town that was cheaper than the lodging rate at the base so it will all be reimbursed . Now I hear that this weekend they will be completely full both on base as well as their contract lodging hotel , and for the first time in a long time they will be giving out non-availability letters . <p> So what 's to stop me from " trying " to move on base this weekend and scoring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal rate for my per diem ? ? ? <p> Am I missing something ? <p> Edited June 24 , 2010 by Duck <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Touch &amp; Go Rentals <p> I am on a longer accompanied TDY enroute . When I checked in , the lady at the desk did n't have a place for us to stay and offered us the contract lodging till we could get on base . I asked her for a Non-A but she would n't give me one . No big deal . <p> So what 's to stop me from " trying " to move on base this weekend and scoring a Non-A , staying in my apartment and pulling a higher meal rate for my per diem ? ? ? <p> When you first attempted to check-in were there bachelors quarters available ( non-TLF , basic lodging rooms ) ? <p> If not , you should n't need a physical non-availability letter . You should be reimbursed up to the full per diem lodging rate for your costs thus far . Document the time/date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on your voucher , and you should be good to go ( see for more information ) , but read on ... <p> What do you mean by contract lodging ? <p> There is some confusion over this term . If you 're talking about a hotel in town with which lodging has coordinated a reduced rate , you 're not obligated to stay there . You are free to make any arrangements you choose and are authorized reimbursement for lodging up to the full per diem lodging rate . <p> If you mean actual contract quarters in which you would n't have paid at all and the government would have paid for your lodging directly , disregard the statement above--you would be limited to the on-base rate for apartment rent up to this point . See the for more information . <p> Do your orders direct accompanied travel ? <p> If your orders directed accompanied travel , then even the availability of bachelors quarters would n't limit your reimbursement of full per diem--and I 'd be very surprised if any contract quarters ( lodging paid for directly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question , it sounds like the base billeting was full , and lodging offered to set you up with a room at a hotel off-base with which they had negotiated a rate below the per diem rate . The room off-base would have been a room you would have paid for with your credit card and been reimbursed on a travel voucher . If this is the case , you should n't try and work any system , just document some information regarding your first visit , returning to the hotel to get the lady 's name , if necessary ( see JFTR Para U1045-C.1.b ) . In fact , if you ca n't get the information , if you merely certify quarters were not available , JFTR considers this sufficient documentation ( see JFTR Para U1045-C.1.b ) . <p> With regard to your original question , I do n't see anything which is preventing you from doing what you propose ; however , if someone looks into the situation and it looks like you manipulated it , I do n't think I 'd want to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud , a " wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain " ? ) . On the other hand , if you can legitimately make the case you intended to move onto base ( spouse left , wanted to save money , in a position or had discussions to terminate apartment lease , etc ) , you may be in a position to demonstrate you were n't just taking advantage of the situation . As mentioned before in this thread , the JFTR obligates the traveler to exercise prudence in travel and exercise the same care in incurring expenses as they would if they were traveling at personal expense ( U2010 ) . <p> Edited June 25 , 2010 by Touch &amp; Go Rentals <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Here at Randolph they are full on base but handing out letters that say to stay at the La Quinta Inn at $70/night . Per diem for lodging here is $106/night . The letter does n't actually say non-availability on it though . Based on what I 'm reading in this thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinta but am I only eligible to receive $70/night ? Or can I stay anywhere up to $106/night ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> When you file your travel voucher , do you submit that letter with it even though it specifies that you were to stay at another hotel for a certain rate ? The base lodging staff is convinced we would only get paid the $39/night ( base lodging cost ) if we do not stay at the La Quinta Inn in which case we would get $70/night to cover the cost for that hotel only . They will not hand out non-availibity letters since they claim La Quinta Inn is a contract lodging facility even though we 're paying for it on our personal GTC . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The Randolph Lodging staff are morons . I 've had this fight with them multiple times . The bottom line is they do not understand the definition of ' Contract Lodging ' . Stay where you want to and you 'll be reimbursed up to the local rate , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and just do what I want . No problems yet , so I would n't worry about it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Randolph has an MOA with the La Quinta for reduced rates since they send so many people there . The folks at Lodging interpret that as Contract Lodging . The memo that Finance Guy posted earlier in this threat specifically mentions this type of situation and states that it is still considered Commercial Lodging . However , it notes that the traveler is still obligated to exercise prudent judgment and not incur additional cost for the government . The folks at Lodging use the plain english definition of Contract , not the AFI version . That 's where the confusion is . <p> That being said , there are multiple hotels in the San Antonio area that offer Government Rates that are competitive with the La Quinta and are better quality establishments . You should n't have any problems finder a better hotel at similar rates . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm heading to school at Keesler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me I must stay in one of the hotels on their list . I 'm certain I have seen regs stating they can not force you to stay in their commercial lodging list . My school is 4 months and my wife will be with me most of the time so I 'm looking to make sure I have a place that has a kitchen . There are countless options but none on their list and they are giving me a hard time and wo n't give me the non-A letter unless I book with one of their hotels . Anyone have the reg that says I can pick my own hotel as long as it is under the maximum per diem rate for lodging ? Or does anyone know a way around them literally withholding this Non-A letter ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So I 've read all the memos posted about non-a 's ... and I think I know the answer but the scare tactics are getting the best of me . <p> I 'm at Altus and just received a memo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are issuing non-a slips downtown . I asked about them and they said as of right now they are only good for 2 hotels ( Best Western and Microtel ) . They further said that if those rooms fill up the will then , and only then issue " Unrestricted " non-a 's that will be good anywhere in town . Based on what I 've read there is no such thing as a " restricted " non-a and I could take their Best Western non-a anywhere I want and not be charged anything below the local Altus maximum lodging rate .

But I 'd imagine since your dependents are on your orders your government rate ( which is what they will reimburse up to when you decline government quarters ) should be higher than the standard $39 a day . Even if all you received was the standard $39 a day ( which equates to about $1,170 a month ) I 'm betting you could find a place to rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family . At the worst you may have to eat into what you are making per diem or your base pay , but even that is likely to be less than the cost of kenneling . Now how far that $1,170 goes is also going to greatly depend on your TDY location . Good luck ! 
@@43194703 @3194703/ <h> 61 posts in this topic <p> I think that DG out of ROTC or USAFA are some of the only ones worth recognizing . Each indicates exceptional performance over a lengthy period of time . Plus , pretty much everyone is on a level playing field from the start . These two factors give a better look at an individual and take a lot of the guess-work out of the equation . This is why an ROTC DG will follow you but one from Field Training will not . <p> I can do without other DGs .

I gave up ... that was 1.5 yrs ago . Anyone recently get this shit figured out ? Will it even make any difference to me ? If not , I could care less . <p> Ok , I did n't ever see this fully answered , so here is EXACTLY what I did to take care of this exact situation . <p> I took note that people were finding out out that DG was n't listed on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , when I actually did recieve DG , I also figured I may as well look into the scenario . Turns out , sure enough , my DG was not recorded in my SURF , while I had a friend from the same Det who had his recorded . Same graduation year , I graduated in Dec , he graduated in May . Only reason I can think of there being a difference is that the Det specifically applied for an extra DG to be awarded for me ( and maybe others for all I know ) , and AETC gave me one . Evidently they have a few left after all the oddball people are added up ( IE dets with 22 people getting 2 DGs , but those extra 2 get added into an AFROTC pool for extras ) . SO maybe mine was n't recorded cuz i got it that way . <p> What I did : I took the congratulations letter I got from my Det/CC down to Formal Training ( at Sheppard ) . I asked the guy who worked there how to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it should be in my Surf . It was n't . So he went into the system and did this : <p> In a program called " MILPDS " he went to " Customer Service/Promotions and Testing/Commissioning Agreement/ROTC Code " <p> He then changed my code to I think it was " Code R " . It was a letter or a number , and that is the random letter that is written on the notes I took , so I think that 's why I wrote that letter . <p> That is all I think should need to be done . You wo n't be able to see the update in your surf for a few days because they only process the updates every so often . <p> Whether or not this will help me in the long run , who knows , am I a tool for doing it ? probably , but if it does help , whatever ... can it hurt to have it updated , no , and it 's probably better to have things be as correct as possible in your history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Most likely the same thing .

While UPT is a year long , which would normally make me lean towards a DG program , there is a huge difference in student skill at the outset . A 50 hour C-172 dude will never compete with a 1,000+ hour corporate King Air pilot . Sure everyone kind of normalizes in the end but the corporate dude 's awesome scores on early rides are pretty hard to overcome . There is no way a heavy FTU student should ever get recognized as DG . With the limited number of flights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next there is just no legitimate way to compare students . Fighter guys can probably make a reasonable argument in favor of having DGs since they fly a lot more rides and invest much more time in the program . <p> I 'll give you WIC .

Downgrade ! " <p> If a lot of wing commanders have ROTC DG on their records , it is simply because they continued to perform at a high level . But you 're going to have to work your ass off throughout your career , consistently outperform your peers at each level just to be a flying Sq/CC .

Should Academy grads be putting on their PRF that they were a Cadet Squadron Commander for a 120 person squadron bigger than most ROTC dets ?

The mental sensation of taking the TBAS was mysteriously equivalent to the brain workload of flying my first solo XC . Flying into the pattern , talking on the radio , thumbing through the AF/D , checking the winds , working the E6B , and watching out for the a$$hole who cuts you off on downwind all at the same time is IMO the best practice . Though kind of cheesy , I also psyched myself during the test that I was actually flying a plane , chasing down a Mig , and that my life was on the line .

I reviewed the Cliffs Notes AFOQT guide before taking the AFOQT , but did n't take the timed tests- I know this is what killed me- the material was easy , but I took way too much time . Certain sections- block counting , table reading , and hidden figures , I barely could get halfway through before guessing in the last minute ( hidden figures , I guessed on 3/4 ) . I assume taking timed tests , in addition to review will help me out tremendously on the AFOQT retake . The TBAS though has me at a loss- how could I get a 39 with 81 flying hours and a 65 Pilot score ? ? ? I have never heard of anyone doing that poorly . I felt pretty good after taking the TBAS , but judging by the score , I must have bombed the thing . I do n't really play video games , but I will go out tonight and buy a damn joystick or whatever is recommended . What can I do to improve tremendously on the TBAS ? Even with flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCSM . I wo n't give up on my goal of becoming an ANG/AFRC pilot , but I realize I need to make the most out of my next 6 months and get my scores way up . Have any of you or anyone you have known , improved a PCSM by 50 points or so ? ? ? <p> Thanks for any help/info . <p> After the longest 7 months of my life , I retook both exams last week , and have already received my scores . I went up 51 points on my PCSM ( 90 ) and 32 points on my AFOQT Pilot score ( 97 ) . I really appreciate all of the advice on here , and it was great to hear from a couple guys who had improved their scores- that really encouraged me to make it happen .

I 've yet to get a good answer . <p> This is a repost of a bunch of quotes from numerous sources about the UPT washout rate . As was said previously , the overall SUPT washout rate is something in the 10-20% region and I remember reading in an article that the actual historical UPT washout rate was 14% . <p> - A 1996 paper by Thomas R. Carretta which considers the validity of the AFOQT , shows that of 14,403 officers who attended UPT between 1981 and 1995 , " 88.3% of the pilot trainees successfully completed UPT. " ( meaning an 11.7% washout rate ) <p> - " Over the last several years , UPT attrition rates have been steady at about 22% .

Carretta , 1997 ) <p> - A report which was looking at the impact of T-3/IFT showed that initial classes going though UPT after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw an increase in attrition from 6% to 19% . ( Source : " The pre-Pilots Fly Again " , Air Force Magazine , June 1999 Vol. 82 , No. 6 ) <p> - The " US Air Force Pilot Selection and Training Methods " study by Coretta in 1999 said that the washout rate from T-37s alone during the two data periods they used was between 7.8% and 8.8% . <p> - " Approximately 15-20% of Undergraduate Pilot Training ( UPT ) students are eliminated each year . " ( Source : United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine ( USAFSAM ) website ) <p> - " The academy has a 50-percent lower attrition rate for pilot training than Reserve Officer Training Corps or Officer Training School . During the moratorium , attrition rates at UPT jumped to more than 20 percent at some bases . " ( Source : ' The Officer ' Magazine Sept , 2001 by Jennifer Brugman ) <p> - " General Welser said the Air Force 's goal with the expanded IFT was to maintain an acceptable attrition rate . " Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-3 , we 're finding the attrition rates within 1 percent of each other , " he said . " 7.8 percent for the T-3 and 8.8 percent for IFT .

When I went through UPT they were well over 30% , most of them in the T-37 phase . That being said , my class did not lose ANYONE . <p> Do n't go to UPT with a percentage in your melon . You will have other things to worry about . Go there with a good work/study ethic , a great attitude , and use the desire that go you in the program , to get you to your wings . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> we have made sacrifices to get here .

It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well you are doing , you ( and everyone else for that matter ) are always three rides away from a progress/elimination check . That 's just because of the way the syllabus is built . If you start getting up in arms about how hard you worked to get there and how much is riding on getting your wings you 're going to stress yourself out . <p> Just go in ready to learn . Help your classmates . Ask questions . Soak it up like a sponge . That 's all you can do . Everything else will fall into place . Do n't stress yourself out , that 's the IP 's job . Thousands have come before you and thousands will come after you . <p> About 90% of the people who wash out are either self-eliminated or medical . <p> HD <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest trossetti <p> I have read all of your responses and will take it to heart . This is what I am hearing in a nutshell : Do n't stress or focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key ... work and study with my classmates . I appreciate all of your input . I am guard so I am not competing for T-1s vs . T-38s ; I just want to do well and graduate with the best training possible . The advice you have given is exactly what I was looking for . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest b18onboost <p> Hello everyone , thank you for reading my post . I would like to know if someone wash out of UPT for academic or health reason , does that person have to pick a different job in the guard or or can he or she leave ? The reason I asked is I am interested in the guard and flying is my dream . Although , it would suck if I go through the training and get disqualified or fail a check ride then have to be stuck in the guard doing some desk job rather than flying . If someone can answer this question that would be great . I have use the search function but could n't come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Generally speaking the answer is no . If you do n't complete training you are released as your position was contingent upon successful completion of said training . To wash out academically at UPT , you have to bust three exams and be recommended for disenrollment . I think it is straight up buffonery to fail academically out of UPT but there is a weather test that a lot of people historically fail , and has put a fair share of folks over the magic number and into the elimination process . FWIW that weather test is on it 's way out for that particular reason , it was a worthless test anyways . So nowadays it is even more clownish to fail academically . <p> Medical washout is a more realistic way of disenrolling , but even then they 'll work with you . The most common reason is airsickness and it has to be BAD for it to disqualify you . I 've seen guys get washed back twice , sent to the voodoo doctor in SPS or RND , come back and puke their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAVY but it was at VN in AF training , so the example stands . Others with chronic sinus problems that eventually require surgery get put on a looooong DNIF and still make it . Then again , there are others that do not , but my point is that barring a really bad problem , so long as you pace yourself and give your honest best effort you should be fine with airsickness and/or sinus problems . <p> Hope that helps . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest LocoF16 <p> Hello everyone , thank you for reading my post .

I have use the search function but could n't come up with anything rock solid . <p> What a great segue ... I know of a few units who just so happen to be hiring this fall ... and this is the kind of thing that really boils my blood . I 'm gon na make some generalizations here , so if I make you angry ... well sorry . I can not stand the standard professional aviation graduate who just made Captain at one of the regionals , has about 2000 flying hours , and is fishing for a Guard job ... and , this dude ABSOLUTELY would not enlist or entertain the idea of doing anything in the military except be a pilot . Now , I 'm not saying that these dudes do n't make good military pilots because there are plenty of them out there . But I can also tell you that I would rather have the guy that busted his ass in the unit for six years , has all of 100 flying and will continue to serve even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's worth , the next time someone asks you a question about this topic in an interview . <p> To answer this guy 's question ... yes , our unit would let you leave if you did n't want to be there . Our fault for hiring your ass ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Well that 's what happens when you generalize , you can over-reach . By your standard , you just called out 75% of the Guard Reserve bubbas out there , and practically all the airline dudes . If it makes you feel better , the above specimen ( the regional dude fishing for Guard slots ) is the minority in terms of getting hired , these folks are historically behind the hiring power curve because of age mostly , as they spent their 20s toiling at the regionals , in that regard I do agree with you . I have no sympathy for the 29 year olds out there who had the " come to Jesus " moment last week , and decided their regional job , or 80K/yr desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waive their sh$t and get in the door . it pays off to do your homework early about the Guard , and if somebody chose the RJ job because of a bad case of SJS , or you partied too hard during freshman year and last week you realized the benefit of getting the freggin ' degree done and over with , then sorry you 're turning 30 tomorrow . Now , that said , I 'm not about to agree with you that everybody who chose not to be ' just anything ' for the sake of being enlisted is somehow lacking in their character . I never considered the AD precisely because I had no interest in the qweep that is involved in being a ' pilot ' in the active military , and we forego the salary for that decision . That 's what being in the AFRC/ANG is about in the first place ! That does n't mean the work we pursue does not have merit , and in my experience Guard/Reserves bubbas chuckle at anything the AD folks have to say about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart goes out to the TAMI-21 crowd , but you have to do your homework in this world , I never did a day in ROTC while in college and yet I fully understood how someone can go from signing the pilot commitment to sucking sand in a non-flying billet for years , or ending up permanent partied at the Tyco airplane show . Being a crew chief has nothing to do with the self-valuation of your skills ; you set the price , I knew that 's what I wanted to do and busted my a$$ to get there , and in proper fairness a lot of crew chiefs got jobs at their units in my time interviewing with said units , and I also watched some of the same get non-recommended from IFF in my time at UPT , which is why I try not to generalize . <p> Besides , I can point you to a couple million american 20-30 yo who sit at home with their 9-5 jobs and generally stay away from the fight and have no intention of giving an ounce of their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and more commonly , feel economically able to avoid it . That classy bunch are yours and my neighbors btw . We 're still here voluntarily , in spite of not ! GASP ! having been a crew chief before getting hired . <p> Sure , there are plenty of dudes who hang around the unit when the hours are low , and min run the unit when SWA calls , some are not 100% transparent with their fellow civilian FOs at the civi gig and that 's a shame , but that 's the nature of the beast . Otherwise , nominally speaking , most dudes in the Guard have an honest appreciation for the work they do , and not having enlisted to get that job generally does n't get many people riled up . That at least has been my observation so far . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest columbus2LT <p> So , there have been many rumors and talks by the senior officers here that if you wash out of UPT nowadays , you will be booted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stipends .. du n no about your actual pay ) <p> Anyone confirm/deny or have heard anything relevant ? ? ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So , there have been many rumors and talks by the senior officers here that if you wash out of UPT nowadays , you will be booted from the AF and have to pay everything back ( scholarship money , stipends .. du n no about your actual pay ) <p> Anyone confirm/deny or have heard anything relevant ? ? ? <p> Do you have something to be worried about ? <p> Caveat , I 'm out of my lane here but I have n't heard anything official .

If they are early in their career ( have n't served the 4-year officer committment , ) they are recatagorized into another AFSC . If they have already served a couple of years on active duty , they are given the opportunity to get out of the AF or stay in and recatagorize . They still ask studs to fill out a " dream sheet " of AFSC 's that they would like , but needs of the Air Force still reign supreme .

@@43194707 @3194707/ <h> Letters of Recommendation <h> 7 posts in this topic <p> I 'm currently putting together my packet for the applications , and I had a couple questions about the letters of recommendation : <p> 1 .

Does anyone have experience with obtaining a waiver for any form of eczema and if yes how difficult was it to get one ? <p> It also depends on what your status is right now . Are you already enlisted ? Are you already a cadet somewhere ? Or are you trying to enlist/commission/obtain flying status/etc . Two different regulations at work then . AFI 48-123 governs standards for continued service . DoDI 6130.4 governs appointnment , induction or enlistment , which includes commissioning if you were not commissioned within the last 6 months . Oh , and for flying , <p> I ca n't comment on your individual case here , nor should you post details about your medical conditions on an ' anonymous ' forum . I will say that in general , case waivers are approved if the condition relapsed after the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is less than 10% , you do n't get frequent exacerbations which could hinder you in the field , and has not required frequent topical or systemic glucocorticoids , UV phototherapy , or Topical immunomodulators like pimecrolimus ( currently a great area for flying , but i digress ) ...

My last piece of advice , when something is disqualifying do n't  act like its the final word . You just need a waiver . Waivers are given out for enlistment/comissioning for things like this all the time , otherwise we would n't any non rated officers , Just bring your paperwork and make sure its legit before going for the entrance physical .

A Dermatologist/Doc can objectively determine you have eczema/Atopic Dermatitis via physical examination . The waiver guide for Dermatitis was updated just this month ( Jul 2014 ) . Though the guide states that the condition is not waiverable for IFC I , it appears that more than half of teh IFC I applicants were approved ( 48/67 = 72% ) . Push the FSO to submit a waiver , even if they intend to write it as a " DQ " waiver ( meaning a waiver with the intent to get you permanently DQ 'd ) . You 've got a good chance to surprise them and get a waiver regardless . <p> The most important thing to remember about the Waiver Guide is that it is a GUIDE . Sometimes it 'll say a patient should be approved but they get DQ 'd . Sometimes it 'll direct a few specialty consults but then the member will go TDY to WPAFB for further eval . Sometimes it looks like an applicant will have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member has command support so they 're approved .

@@43194709 @3194709/ <h> Shut down Air War College <h> 90 posts in this topic <p> All of your last questions are valid and you seem to share the same opinion on PME and DL masters degrees that the rest of us do . The system should evolve from one that promotes based on box checking to one that both incorporates legitimate educational opportunities that are applicable to strategic thinking ( and strats based on those ) , but importantly , also includes more emphasis on primary job excellence . The more I 've discussed this overall issue in various settings the more I 'm starting to believe the core of the problem is simple : the AF assumes everyone is excellent at their job and thus has to move to " secondary " factors to rack and stack folks . We all know this is false in two ways , A ) there is often a wide spread ( STS ) between the guys who are sh*t how and the dudes who ca n't fly ( or finance or contract or turn a wrench ) their way out of a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obviously bad at his job , his OPRs/PRF will often be compiled in a way to minimize that so not to have one of the Commander 's guys " left behind . " <p> There 's not an easy fix to either of these problems ( realizing not everyone is a winner and writing honest assessments ) , but to me the problems are at least becoming increasingly clear in my eyes . As OverTQ alluded to , no , the CC does n't need to continually be the best pilot in the squadron and I 'd much rather have him be good at Commander business rather than crew dog business , but the idea that a person can rise to the position of Commander without ever having been even decent at crew dog business is a foul on the entire system . I 'd argue it is exceedingly rare where a person is a sh*tty pilot but would make an excellent commander of a flying squadron based on other " officership " type qualities , and even then that person would have a credibility problem leading troops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current assigned duties at any level of responsibility should be an absolute requirement to move on to the next higher level , bottom line . <p> In the ideal system , if you suck at your job you do n't get promoted ; there 's no amount of boxes you should be able to check ( PME/MA/volunteer/d*ck sucking/execing/etc. ) that should allow you to escape the fact that you ca n't flourish where you 're planted . As your level of responsibility becomes more and more strategic and less and less tactical , your job follows suit so at a certain point if you ca n't move beyond A+B=C of the tactical world then you will not command or make strategic positions . At that point perhaps relevant , useful PME and Masters-level strategic study are factors that should influence the decision of whether to promote or not . <p> In today 's system it seems to me and to a lot of other that those " strategic thinker/well **31;621;TOOLONG " considerations are coming up when a dude is a f*cking lieutenant trying to plan ahead for getting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a school slot on his first-look major 's board .

Those seem to be valuable and CH already spoke to his very positive experience .

Why are CGOs , the supposed tactical experts , doing practice bleeding for something that is n't even that valuable ? Do CGOs need to get " strategic breadth " or do they need to be in the vault studying their weapons system ? Assume " both " is not a viable option ( that is the AF 's current stance ) because time and effort are finite factors and you ca n't make two different things your #1 priority . That 's the rub . Why are masters degrees , no matter what they are in or how hard they were to obtain , valued above being good at your job ? The current system assumes everyone is good at their job and thus discriminates based on who also has that AAD done .

It might be worth a shot to pay for it myself , but I am not sure anyone is doing that anymore . <p> A few years ago ( after the PDT cuts ) we had a pair of cadets fly out to Langley and shadow some raptor guys at the 94th on their own dime , so cadets still do it . Its worth it if you can afford it , just let your cadre know you 're interested and they should be able to get you some contact info . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We setup a briefing to the Pensacola nav students last year , as its a short drive from Eglin/Hurlburt . Hoping to do it again this year . It 's a little harder with the pilot schools since none of them are near any test bases . There have also been pushes to roadshow to the ops units but even before the budget cuts that was difficult . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying test have any insight into how sequestration is going to affect the DT world ?

With that being said , does anyone know the relative success rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential insight . <p> There have been some reductions in non-test flying ( flying done to maintain currency or for upgrades ) , but the DT&amp;E budget is different from CAF FHPs . They already reduced the class size from 24 to 20 starting with 13A . This was done largely because the throughput in many ways exceeded capacity . However , with the current budget issues , I would not be surprised if this continues as opposed to going back to 24 like there was a rumor of after 2-3 classes . <p> Regarding the change to the AFI : even though the old version stated the TAFCS was 10.25 years , the last 3-4 boards all had the same restriction as the current AFI ( the AFI revision process just took a while to catch up to reflect this reality ) . There is no published success rate . I can tell you that in my class , about half of the pilots were over the TAFCS limit , but that changes from year to year based on upcoming DT programs and the types of pilots they desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply more than once to get in . <p> It really depends on what you fly . I know of one guy who was an alternate one year , then the next was denied a waiver for TAFCS . I surmise it was largely due to having enough heavy pilots apply . Generally , being an alternate one year can be viewed as a stepping stone to getting in the next . <p> Edited April 20 , 2013 by Muscle2002 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> My personal view is that AFMC should not even broach the thought of TAFCS waivers . The timeline is way too short for guys anything beyond the 10 year mark . After selection , you 've got to get through a year of TPS , serve a couple years as a line test pilot and go to school before your command years .

Remember that when the assignments are given out at track select , there is one spot for everybody . So if you really want T-1s but T-38s are the only thing left ( I 've seen it happen ) , you 're getting a T-38 .

Most students will have one or two 86 sorties ( those are somewhat freebie rides after a break of 5 days or more in the jet ) or have to repeat a ride for an incomplete or an unsat . The T-38 syllabus ( at least when I was a student about 2 years ago ) required 117 hours . Do n't know for sure about the T-1 side but I think they had less sorties but more hours but some of those hours sitting in the jump seat ( from what I know during the Transition phase , or first portion of the syllabus , you fly with an IP and another student and split the time at the controls with the other student but log all the time ) Hope that helps and sorry it took 3 or 4 posts to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I feel it was a valid question . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll have about 100 in the T-34 when I 'm done at Whiting ( next week ! ) That 's with about 4-5 mandatory 86 rides for being out of the plane longer than 5 days prior to solo flights .

At that point you can go T-1s , T-38s , T-44s , or UH-1s . Everyone who tracks is still part of the same class but of course are flying different things . The studs who go to T-44s and UH-1s are not really in the same class though because their timelines are a little different and since they 're switching bases , they will have a delay in their training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II ( which will end eventually thanks to BRAC , but anyways ) you will leave after you track because that base does n't have follow-on aircraft for Phase III . If you 're at any other base besides Moody , you 'll stay where you 're at if you get T-1s or T-38s . <p> It 's usually a little less than 30% T-38s , with most of the rest being T-1s . There 's usually 1 UH-1 and a few T-44s . I 've seen it vary quite a bit from those numbers before though . You 're correct , you wo n't know what aircraft you 'll fly until the end of Phase III .

Based on my experience ( I 've flown all the Cessna , Piper and Diamond single engine aircraft discussed here plus several others ) , and what I know about the AF training process ( as a former T-38 IP ) and IFS , I really do n't think it matters much what aircraft you fly . The whole point of IFS is to introduce you to the Air Force training system ... the way they do things . Much of the stress is on the ground procedures ... classroom learning , flight standups and EP exercises , customs and courtesies , etc . Certainly you have to be able to fly to the satisfaction of the civilian instructor corps , but that 's only a part of the process , and their standards are pretty much basic FAA PPL standards ( with perhaps a little more emphasis on precision ) . The fact that you have time in the DA-20 is nice for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the aircraft does not fly that much different from either the C-150/152 trainers or the C-172/Piper PA-28 series ... the latter only being slightly " heavier " on the controls due to their slightly heavier construction . Any flying time will help , any right seat time will help slightly . Switching from yoke to stick will not be a significant issue and I seriously doubt success at IFS will be significantly affected by which aircraft you fly prior to arrival . If you can , fly a Diamond ( 20 or 40 ) just for a personal comfort and familiarity , but if there 's no Diamond , any light aircraft will do . Books , people ... get in the books ! ! !

And for all of our planning and grooming , we ( the AF ) still compete poorly with the other services . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> di1630s post was so incredibly spot on . - The facts are undeniable after 15 years of losing wars : we suck. - Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our force , at every level , needs to accept the reality that we are not accomplishing the tasks set before us. - - There should be a firestorm of debate about why , and a willingness to examine and scrap all aspects of our institution that have brought us defeat . - Instead no one is talking about this , they all want to preserve the system that did them a solid despite the fact we are failing. - The careerists all keep chugging along " mentoring " younger people to be like them . - Disgusting . - <p> I get what you 're saying , but I do n't see how failures in Iraq and Afghanistan ( the 15 years of losing wars you refer to ) indicate failures within the Air Force . Somehow , I do n't think the strategic decision to put a helluva lot of boots on the ground in Afghanistan , in order to try to turn it into a modern Jeffersonian democracy , was driven by Air Force leaders . Likewise , was it not the ground planners ' responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraq invasion , in order to forestall an insurgency ? Somehow , during all this , I do n't recall the CENTCOM commander billet being filled by an Air Force general. - <p> I absolutely believe that we need to have competent Air Force senior leaders in positions of authority in the joint arena--and we need adequate numbers of quality folks in- value-added joint- FGO billets--in order to keep our civilian masters and morons in other services from dragging us into more quagmires ( which no amount of airpower--whether A-10s or F-35s--can unscrew ) . <p> GC/our overall senior leaders ' approach to growing/placing leaders--not ones who fit a magical formula and timeline , but folks who truly get the proper employment of airpower and who understand that the social justice and square-filling- culture they 're implementing is antithetical to- taking care of people--ai n't helping our cause . Neither is the- failure- to provide adequate incentives to keep people in , nor is the failure to- eliminate the many needless irritants that drive people with better options away from the service. - <p> Beat up our senior Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see how they can be blamed for getting- and keeping- us in- ground force-centric- quagmires . <p> TT <p> 2 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> TT , I was expecting that reply . - But we 've treated these expanding wars as a sideshow for years , to our national detriment . - The USAF is leading the preponderance of KS activity . - We do n't get a pass on the outcome . - Vietnam was a war plan authored with fail above our level , but we still have tons of L2 about our own failed implementation practices . - <p> If we 're being tasked incorrectly , and we are , where are the GOs advocating better usage ? - It 's a cop out to blame politicians when our leaders are the ones championing shitty practices . - Where is the AT-6 or equivalent ? - Where is the advocacy for better intel analysis practices ? - Where is the equitable distribution of work load ? - Why do I see so many O4/5 's who have n't deployed at all while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we suck , and it 's our fault . - Until we have done everything in our power to be better , it 's wrong to blame politicians . - Yes , building a Jeffersonian democracy in a culture thousands of years entrenched in tribalism is stupid. - Where are the GOs saying that ? - I could go on and on , from streamlining the strike approval process to ending dumb ass wasteful 365 's , to constantly sending brand new know nothing BPZ never deployed types to command units downrange allowing them to check the command box without ever judging the merit of their work . - WTF are we doing ? - From strategy to administrative implementation , we suck . - The line guys are kicking ass . - The institution is failing . - And there is value in saying that fact , because until we acknowledge our failures we ca n't hope to fix anything . - It 's past time for us all to be on the same page : we are losing wars , the enemy is gaining ground , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? <p> 8 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We send B-1 's at a cost of $69k plus per flight hour to do XCAS in Afghanistan .

Hence my " Beat up our senior Air Force leaders all you want--they provide plenty of material " comment . I disagree with you on one major point--it is right to blame politicians for the stupid political decisions they make , and the other services for their failures to convince politicians to stay out of quagmires , - while we simultaneously look internally at the many things we 're screwing up all on our own. - <p> I do n't know which our our GOs are saying or not , since I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know that- Deptula was plenty vocal , and still is , about the insanity of the LOBOG ( Lots of Boots on the Ground ) we pursued/are pursuing . He retired as a three-star , even though he's- helluva lot smarter and had/has more experience than those who pinned on 4 stars instead of him. - Others will have to give insights as to what our senior leaders are doing to fight the stupidity at the joint level . Streamlining strike approval ? I dunno--talk to the CAF- guys . Better intel analysis ? Hmm ... talk to the CAF guys. - I don't- have a good answer for why we have n't bought a bunch of Super Tucanos ; of course , I 'm a tanker guy ... again , talk to the fighter guys who mostly run the Air Force . Of course , that would require providing adequate incentives for them to want to remain on active duty or at least not driving them out through- queep and- stupid social justice policies . I can't/wo n't defend the stupid 365s , nor will I- attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-4s/O-5s who get protected while others get kicked in the teeth with deployments , been there/done that ... contrary to TC 's arguments on JQP , I'm- not sure CCs should be allowed to protect their shiny pennies from deployment- taskings. - <p> Having done a full 3-year joint tour , I am convinced that some folks from other services simply don't/wo n't get airpower . Whether due to good old fashioned service parochialism or being blinded by their paradigms , it can take a huge amount of effort before they get a clue . Personal example : try telling a long-tab Special Forces guy that , no , you ca n't just launch a plane , get dip clearances to overfly Country X- while the plane is en route , and get those dips communicated to the crew in a matter of a few hours ( at which time the plane would be entering Country X's- airspace ) . Even talking really slowly and using simple words did n't help. - Motivation and effort can get people to do some pretty amazing things , but--barring something truly extraordinary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff like that . To some extent , the only way to prevent stupid ideas is to put air-savvy folks in positions of rank/responsibility , so they can tell those from other services to shut up and color when they push horribly bad ideas . <p> What to do about it ? Since this is the SOS/ACSC thread , I 'll suggest the following : - <p> - The only requirement for teaching a PME program- should be having attended that PME program ( think- ACSC &amp; SAASS ) .

Just read through this thread and figured I 'd save people the trouble of culling the new from the old about what the expect from p-cola . This is accurate as of when I graduated in January , but the syllabus there is changing faster than you can blink . <p> So you got selected for CSO , here 's what to expect . <p> Casual status : The pipeline has not been very backed up for a while , so do n't expect to be spending months laying around on the beach . That said , this will be the most time you have to enjoy p-cola , so make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Perdido Key is better than p-cola beach , but it depends on how many people you are looking to be with ) enjoy your time off . There will be job opportunities that come along , volunteer for some of them , but do n't go hog wild thinking that it will look great on your record , no one will care after you get your wings . <p> As far as housing , you can live on or off base for the time being . If you live on base you will be in base housing ( privatized , so they take your BAH and you sign a lease ) sharing a place with two others . If you choose to go off base there are lots of good options within about 15 min of the back gate that are very nice and are a good price . There are dorms under construction , once they are done ( sometime next year I think ) then all singles will have to live there . <p> IFS : While on casual you will go to IFS in Pueblo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks long depending on your aptitude and the weather . The first week will be academics , pilot , CSO , RPA ( or whatever the hell they are calling themselves today ) all together learning the same stuff . Once you begin flying you will have several rides straight our of the pilot syllabus where you learn basic aircraft control and aviation , how to talk on the radio , and some basic navigation . The last few rides are visual navigation where you visually navigate a given route adjusting the speed to hit the turnpoints on time , the focus is on your awareness of where you are and where you are going , so no need to worry about things like flying the airplane , the IP takes care of that . <p> The key to surviving IFS is to study and chair fly like crazy . The volume of material that you are expected to learn and the rate at which you need to master it is deliberately crafted to challenge you , it 's a screening program . Make sure you are in the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ok <p> Begin UCT ! <p> Primary phase : Primary begins with a big load of classes , again it 's all about staying in the books , from here on everything counts towards your final ranking . <p> First comes some time with physiology where you learn just how not suited humans are to flying . Then you learn about basic aeronautics , simple navigation ( instrument and dead reckoning ) , flight planning , working as a crew , and a huge load of T-6 systems . Finally you get a couple of sim rides to get comfortable with the checklists and watching all the instruments move as you do things in the back seat and then it 's off to the flight line ! On the flight line you will ( hopefully ) fly almost every day , and your job is to plan the flights and brief the pilot on what you will be doing . You start with instrument flights on which you go up and do an IFR flight from place to place , usually with a stop to do a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing your air sense and telling the IP what to do , they will attempt to be a " voice activated autopilot " that does what it is told . Once you have a handle on that you begin to fly low levels . Again , you plan them , you brief them , in the air you direct them . <p> Advanced : This is where the real CSO learning begins . In the advanced phase you will cover a new topic about every three weeks , from academics to a test , sim missions and a checkride . First is basic high level radar navigation , learning to interpret what you see on a radar scope and find yourself on a chart , and then putting that to use to get yourself somewhere on time . Next is the very EWO part of the course where you learn all about radar threat systems and how to identify them . The self protect phase puts the two together and you navigate to hit a target on time , while evading threats along the route . <p> Then it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-1 . You will again do several high level missions and several low levels , only now it 's as part of a crew . You and another student plan the flight together and each fly half , managing things between yourself , the pilot and the instructor CSO . <p> Back in simulator land you are again playing EWO as you plan offensive jamming against an enemy . Finally comes air to air operations , where you use an AA radar to run intercepts against a bogey . Then , the final integration exercise . You wrap it all up and spend days pouring through the 3-1 tactics manuals in order to plan , in it 's entirety , a day one strike against whatever bad guy is in vogue at that time . <p> Selection process : Because this is what it 's all about anyway . The drop will come sometime just before or during your integration phase . Everthing you have done up to this point is taken into acount and weighted accordingly . Tests are worth a lot , checkrides are as well . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rack and stack the entire class . Each instructor runs things a little different but in general you have no idea what aircraft are coming down the pipe , so you fill our your dream sheet from first choice to last . Remember that nothing has been determined prior to this point so you are also indicating your desire for NAV/EWO/WSO/CSO . Then your instructor starts with guy number one and sees if he can give him his first pick , and works his way down the list like that . Drop night comes , and you learn your fate ! <p> So , how do you get what you want ? Be the best you can at every step of the way , it 's incredibly competetive and the split between top and bottom of the class can be as little as 3 percentage points . If you put in the work , study hard , and rock every check ride , you stand a pretty good chance of being where you want to be , after that it 's all up to AFPC and what they decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available has been flogged to death elsewhere , so I shall call this a wrap . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Looking at post AF gigs .

You get 15 points per combat mission ( and mission rehearsal sorties in the combat zone -- more for the CSAR folks who would n't fly much if we did n't do mission rehearsals to keep our skills sharp ) , which means 20 missions .

A mission that flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking passengers from Kuwait to Qatar ) , but does not enter Iraqi or Afghan airspace , is a combat support mission . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest paulpetro <p> Not sure I agree with your assessment the the Air Medal and Aerial Achievement Medal are " awarded the most " <p> You 're correct . I may have made an inaccurate statement . I read an article ( perhaps in Air Force Times ) that showed the percentages for particular awards . The AM and AAM seemed to be the two awarded with greater frequency . I did n't mean to discount any of the other awards that you mentioned .

What would they award him , had they actually been shot at , let alone survived it . I truly hope this is not the standard in that community . I 've seen some of my buddy LMs get AMs for a single mission in AFSOC , but the above mentioned was probably the easiest and safest part of their mission . <p> I know some old craniums at the VFW and they would have a heart attack if they even knew what was written of in this thread ! <p> As far as helping out the E 's in your crew , I understand the predicament .

I work in Sq awards and decs and our crews do n't track or write their own AM or AAM . Someone long before me made a database that all sq missions are logged into and it tells us when someone has enough points to earn either . It then merges the data into the Form 1 and 3994 and all that 's needed is a quick QC and the citation ( which for the most part is canned , just add significant event ) and off it goes for signatures . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box then you earned it no matter what your job is . Yes it is our job and yes some of the significant events that get used are but earning the medal is based on the number of missions you fly , not the type of mission you fly .

Whether that is right or wrong is subject to opinion but that is the way it 's written . like it was stated before it 's the AC 's job to take care of the crew .

That falls under the single event Air Medal or a DFC . Whether that is right or wrong is subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's the mentality that makes most medals worthless . I 'm sorry , but the crap our crews do on a basic combat sortie where nothing crazy happens , is a way more intense than anything you do in a C-17 on a " combat " mission . Hey , alright , you landed on a dirt strip . I 've flown into the AOR in a few C-17 's and have to laugh when you guys yank and bank on approach and departure . I sat up in the cockpit with a crew one time and the AC asked me if I wanted to help them scan for threats , I said okay . I guess it 's good and important for every airframe to take their jobs as seriously as they can because then they 'll be prepared for the moment when something crazy does happen , but what 's crazy in a C-17 or a Herk seems pretty laid back compared to some of the stuff other airframes have seen . Do n't get me wrong , dodging a manpad or a SAM is crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see mirror flashes and think they 're getting shot at , and sometimes it the misreps sound more like attempts at getting medals . <p> I 'm not trying to start a pissing match , but it is what it is . Some missions , although vitally important to the success of the overall mission just are n't that hairy . Medals are a waste of time . Saying that just because you flew 20 missions in the box where 95% of the time you are outside of the WEZ of everything in the country is the same as an A-10 pilot that flies 20 missions getting shot at is absolutely ludicrous . Go talk to an AH-64 or little bird pilot that get shot at all the time and ask them what they think of AF aircrew whining about not getting the " credit " their due . <p> Now , before all the heavy guys start yelling at me , saying I do n't understand , or it 's more difficult that I think let me say this . I 'm sure you 're right , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult than it looks . Then remember that you are n't the only heavy pilots in the world , and like everyone else here , I 'm friends with someone from virtually every other airframe in the inventory , and most of them are pretty realistic about the difficulty of their respective jobs .

Very laid back , 10 questions , &amp; I 'm an active duty guy rather than someone off the street . <p> What I can remember in no particular order is below : <p> 1 . Tell me about a time when you had to make an unpopular decision . <p> 2 . What 's your biggest weakness ? <p> 3 . Tell me about your written communication skills . <p> 4 . Tell me about how you prepare to give a verbal presentation to a group . <p> 5 . Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new or innovative project . <p> 6 . Tell me about how you seek advice when making a big decision . Who do you typically consult with ? <p> So yea ... only at 60% retention of that material only 2 days after the fact ... I 'll add the rest if I can come up with the rest after talking to a buddy of mine who interviewed right after me. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Interviewed with Savannah , Ga yesterday . 8 interviewees , I was next to last . 5 Officers on the board , no enlisted members , 6 questions total .

I sent out a lot of applications and as the record stands , I 'm batting 1.000 on interviews for units that I visited , and .000 for those I did n't . This may have been more important because I 'm from CA , and everyone automatically assumes you are a douche ( ca n't really blame them ) . <p> First interview was at an a-10 unit . I had visited once for a drill weekend and met most of the pilots . One of 14 I think interviewing , most were non-prior like me . <p> I was n't prepared for how INformal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were pretty new . It was a very casual atmosphere , and basically just a conversation , really do n't remember many interview-type questions . <p> -Tell me what we do/what is our mission ? <p> -How do you feel about killing people ( was told prior that the correct response was somewhere between the guy who said he was against it and would n't do it , and the guy who said he had a gun in his truck and would go kill anyone they wanted right now ) <p> I had prepared pretty thoroughly for all the tough questions , and walked out of there feeling like I left alot of my good talking points on the table . <p> 2nd interview was a c-130 unit . I had visited previously 3-4 times , one drill weekend and a couple short mid-week drop-ins . I developed a pretty good relationship with the guy running the board , and another LtCol who lived near me . I was one of 7 or 8 being considered , I think I was the only non-prior . <p> The interview was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the single chair in the middle of the room . <p> Most of the questions were what you would expect . A few that stood out to me were : <p> -Do you plan to move here , what will you do for work ? <p> -Would you consider a navigator position ? <p> -Why this aircraft/this unit ? <p> -If a fighter unit called after you were selected , would you go interview with them ? <p> -Tell me what leadership and integrity mean to you , and how they go together . <p> -Tell us a joke . <p> 1 or 2 questions I stumbled on , but felt I recovered ok and did n't completely bomb them . Ended up getting the alternate position . I got feedback from the guy running the board that it was close and I was his top choice . The advice he gave me was that I did a good job in the interview , but I could have kept the atmosphere a little ' lighter ' and to act more like a ' rockstar ' . Tought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers in blues grilling you , but take that for whatever it 's worth . <p> 3rd , successful interview was another c-130 unit . Visited once , mid-week met a handful of pilots . One of 5 interviewing , I think only 1 was prior service . <p> Interview had 7-8 pilots in flight suits , and was much less formal than the last . A few questions I remember <p> -How will you support yourself here if selected . This was a very big deal in this unit , and I had taken the advice of a Col. I had met during my visit , and researched some specific jobs in the area . Nailed the response by telling them I had started the application process for x , y , and z jobs in the area . <p> -We are only hiring pilots on this board , but why pilot and not nav ? Also nailed this response by telling them it did n't make much sense as a career move with the upcoming J-model transition . Probably would n't be a good response if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots and I remember seeing each of them nod in approval and start writing notes almost in unison . <p> -If you were selected , and for some reason ended up being DQ 'd for pilot down the road , would you consider a different officer position in the unit ? Told them I would because I was down with the mission of the unit , and by that point I would be too old to be applying for pilot spots anyways . <p> -Tell us about a great leader you have met , and what some of their traits are that you would bring to the unit . <p> The rest of the interview was just them asking questions about about my resume . I was able to take the feedback from the previous interview , and tried to keep the atmosphere more casual . The whole thing was more of a conversation than an interview , if that makes sense . I walked out of there feeling like I got the job , and 2 days later I found out I was right . <p> Every interview was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back they all wanted to see the successful canidate connect with them on a personal level . My advice is do n't be the ' I 'm honored for this opportunity/thank you for your consideration/If selected I wo n't let you down , Sir ' guy . You do n't want to be cocky , but you do n't want to be humble either . It 's kinda like meeting your girlfriends parents for the first time . You do n't want to be disrespectful and cocky , but you want to impress them and be confident . You have to know your place , but you want to walk away as friends at the end of the interview . I think working on this approach is more important than preparing for any specific questions . <p> Good luck to everyone , and have fun travelling around the country and hanging out with pilots . <p> PS- about showing up with booze : most units are stoked , but some are not ( maybe the commander does n't drink or something like that ) . My move was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 of hot Starbucks . It 's a safe play and they are n't expensive . Leave the booze in the car until you can gather some intel . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I interviewed at the 183rd AS this week and compiled most of the questions that were asked to me . <p> First the board was made up of 6 members , 5 pilots and 1 loadmaster all gathered around a conference room table with me at the head and the board leader at the other end . There were no formal reporting procedures in terms of addressing the board upon entry . It was very laid back and everyone was friendly but the questions were very standard and professional and it lasted about an hour . <p> 1 . Identify your biggest strength <p> 2 . Identify your biggest weakness <p> 3 . One word to best describe you <p> 4 . Tell of a time you had to disagree with a boss <p> 5 . Tell of a time when you had to make an unfavorable decision as a leader <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered you a position <p> 7 . Why this unit <p> 8 . What do you plan on doing to support yourself after UPT <p> 9 . Who is someone in your life that has made a big impact and why <p> 10 . At the end they gave me an opportunity to sell myself and tell the board anything I wanted then gave me the opportunity to ask the board any questions <p> I mentioned something humanitarian ... Which opened a can of worms about equipping C-130 's with guns or shipping guns and how I 'd feel about being directly responsible for killing someone . <p> A few scenario-based questions putting me in a position of authority . E.g. The navigator outranks you but you 're the one in charge of the mission , weather is at minimum he does n't want to fly what do you do ? <p> Ugh it 's all a blur now ... I could have done sooo much better .... <p> They were very laid back and friendly . Only three pilots on the board . Great guys . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a year ago . I 'm a Navy H-60 pilot going " Gold to Silver " . The board was for rated helo pilots looking to transfer to the HH-60 . The board was 4 pilots ( 2 O-5s , 1 O-4 , 1 O-3 ) The questions I was asked you can probably find on this thread already . The biggest piece of advice I can give to folks is that the board notices the amount of effort you put in and how much you want to be at that unit . They interviewed 9 or 10 guys , but only 4 guys interviewed in person , the rest did a phone interview . 3 of the 4 in person applicants got picked ( myself included ) . <p> How you answer there questions is important , but they definitely also take notice of how you conduct yourself before the interview and can tell how much you want to be at that particular unit and not just an ANG pilot at whatever unit will take me . <p> I might be an extreme example , but I flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to . <p> Edited April 28 , 2015 by Helopilot <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Got back recently from an interview at my unit of choice- and was offered the job ! The most unique of the " questions " was the first one , in which they said- " This interview is all about you , so spend 5 minutes and tell us about yourself and what got you here " . Most of the rest of the questions they asked fed on my answer- to that particular question , and in the end the interview lasted about 45 minutes . At the end they offered me the opportunity to- ask exactly 1 question of my own . I 've been to a handful of interviews and while the format was similar ( still sitting in a chair in front of a bunch of pilots ) , I felt the open ended nature of the interview resulted in a great dialogue that was beneficial to both me and the hiring board . It was very non-confrontational. - <p> I felt the real interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , but rather the- general interactions you have between not only the pilots , but the enlisted members as well as the other candidates interviewing . Say yes to every opportunity they give you , whether it is to grab lunch , to hang out at the bar , or whatever . Hopefully you have- strong test scores and good work experience , and beyond that , just be a good dude with a positive attitude and you will go far. - <p> My advice - be yourself and be laid back ! Do n't be afraid to joke around if you see the opportunity , and also do n't take things personally if they give you a hard time about something stupid you do or say . Also , if your interview is in a different city , I 'd highly recommend making a mini-vacation out of it and even taking your spouse with if you are married . Not only will it help you make an informed decision about living there , but it will also show the board that you are committed . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . However , although I am not on one of these boards nor am I in one of these units ... <p> - <p> I can smell a canned answer from a mile away . Be careful how you use this . <p> - <p> My Advice : Know your answer ... have the points ... do n't have a statement . <p> - <p> Except : <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> EVERYONE should have AT LEAST one in your pocket just cause . <p> - <p> Just humble advice . <p> - <p> BENDY <p> This is very good advice . I have conducted interviews for an AFRC unit for approximately 8-9 years , hired people from all kinds of backgrounds . In my experience I am looking for three things when I ask questions : <p> 1 . Can you make it through training ? <p> 2 . Will you stick around once we train you ? <p> 3 . Do you fit in with our culture ? <p> The last one is the most important for the interview questions . No matter what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someones character by the answers they give . Most of us have been in the same position and understand the awkwardness of answering interview questions . The best thing to do is answer confidently and honestly . <p> Beast <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Could n't agree more . Meeting the guys before the interviews helped , and they told me they 're looking for 2 things . First ; Will you make it through training ? Second ; Can we get along with you ? I 've had a couple different bases say when I asked for advice " We can teach you how to fly a plane , but we ca n't teach you to get along with people . " <p> I was just selected for- a 135 slot . Could n't be happier . Board was 4 officers , - Lt to Lt Col.- Questions were basically the same as what 's been posted . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was recently selected by a guard unit , and much of my success came from this thread alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The board was made up of 5 pilots , ranging from Captain to Lt Col. The most important thing for them was how well we would fit in with their squadron , since our backgrounds/resumes were all outstanding and could get us to pilot training alone . Below are the interview questions : <p> Tell us about yourself . <p> Name these aircraft ( 15 or so , ranging from heavies to foreign fighters ) . <p> Favorite movie ? <p> Why the interest in becoming a military aviator , other than it 's a cool career ? <p> What are the challenges of becoming an F-16 pilot , and how will you handle them ? <p> Explain what you do for your civilian job ( I am not in the aviation industry ) . <p> What would you do for a living after seasoning ? <p> Favorite drink ? <p> Do you own any guns ? <p> Did you play any sports growing up ? What was your favorite ? <p> When was the last time you flew ? What did you do ? <p> Are you aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tasked with gunning down an airliner and killing civilians ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was recently selected by a guard unit , and much of my success came from this thread alone .

If ya do n't mind my asking . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> How do you guys balance experience vs personal details in- your responses during the boards ? I have completed several interviews , but the feedback I receive is that I need to talk more about who I am as a person and not so much what I 've done . Which is confusing because what I 've accomplished reflects who I am as an individual and my work ethic . Thoughts ? 
@@43194726 @3194726/ <p> I respectfully disagree and see- a different message - he is not considering it because Stop Loss- is not his to consider , and not his decision to make ( his own words and true ) ; - however it is in CSAF 's lane to advocate for it to who does have authority to consider Stop Loss ( i.e. SECDEF and higher ) . He did n't answer that question of advocacy , instead he mentioned Stop Loss use in case of an emergency - which aviators know can be declared at any moment , as required . The CSAF 's comments about pilot shortages being a national crisis could mean emergency .. right ? Or perhaps I 'm irrational ... or something . <p> He 's certainly shaping the narrative , and definitely attempting to put-at-ease the masses . But everyone suspects- something is brewing ( ex. those warning on this forum ) and an educated man is anything but at-ease . Freedom is at stake , and there can be no service without self - I have lived that hell and know it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ) , it 's what makes us strong - diversity in every regard , but I 'm a firm believer a great work to life balance is critically important . What is missing is work to personal life balance ( too much , time to resurrect the USAF PERSTEMPO trackers and not simply deployed metrics ) , an energizing work-life culture ( yep , it 's dead ) , and small civilian-military pay gap ( it 's huge ) . <p> What gets me is our CSAF is advocating outside of the USAF that we as a nation have a national pilot crisis which is a bit out of his sphere of influence - I agree we do , but would appreciate- his/those efforts focused within the USAF . Introspection into the USAF is well within his sphere , why are we going external ? Why is that his strategy ? What affect does he think he 'll get from outside his sphere ? Is it simply diversion and informing ? <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Do n't get me started on Everhart 's screwup. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it only makes the fence-sitters run like hell . - But I disagree that a national pilot shortage is outside the CSAF 's lane . <p> - <p> You ca n't argue with his numbers . - Even if the airlines took ALL out UPT production , they 'd STILL be short . - We have a problem , and if the military has to lead the charge to fix it , so be it . <p> - <p> That having been said . . . we sure are n't fixing it on our end . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Stop Loss always has been ( and still is ) on the table . - It has to be . - U.S. citizens- are depending on military- pilots , some reading this forum , to defend this country and their right to L/L/PoH. - We must sustain an appropriate posture to our enemies in this interconnected world . - Stop loss , if invoked , becomes a patriotic duty . - I sincerely hope we have a few patriots left in the pilot ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest levels to solve this problem by any other means . - Those personnelists- are heroes in my book , and I believe they will be successful . - However , if they are not successful &amp; Stop Loss is invoked , it will be easier , and shorter , if service members remember their core values &amp; jump on the bandwagon . - Young people- do not be disheartened by the negativity on this blog. - The future of our Air Force and our country is bright , and you are the beacons . - Thank you for serving . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Stop Loss always has been ( and still is ) on the table . - It has to be . - U.S. citizens- are depending on military- pilots , some reading this forum , to defend this country and their right to L/L/PoH. - We must sustain an appropriate posture to our enemies in this interconnected world . - Stop loss , if invoked , becomes a patriotic duty . - I sincerely hope we have a few patriots left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night at the highest levels to solve this problem by any other means . - Those personnelists- are heroes in my book , and I believe they will be successful . - However , if they are not successful &amp; Stop Loss is invoked , it will be easier , and shorter , if service members remember their core values &amp; jump on the bandwagon . - Young people- do not be disheartened by the negativity on this blog. - The future of our Air Force and our country is bright , and you are the beacons . - Thank you for serving . <p> Thanks Dear Leader for reminding me that what is good for the Party is what 's good for me 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Stop Loss always has been ( and still is ) on the table . - It has to be . - U.S. citizens- are depending on military- pilots , some reading this forum , to defend this country and their right to L/L/PoH. - We must sustain an appropriate posture to our enemies in this interconnected world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . - I sincerely hope we have a few patriots left in the pilot ranks . <p> Your personnelists are working day and night at the highest levels to solve this problem by any other means . - Those personnelists- are heroes in my book , and I believe they will be successful . - However , if they are not successful &amp; Stop Loss is invoked , it will be easier , and shorter , if service members remember their core values &amp; jump on the bandwagon . - Young people- do not be disheartened by the negativity on this blog. - The future of our Air Force and our country is bright , and you are the beacons . - Thank you for serving . <p> I 'm guessing you *non gender specific individuals* get a propaganda class on those training days every second Wednesday ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Stop Loss always has been ( and still is ) on the table . - It has to be . - U.S. citizens- are depending on military- pilots , some reading this forum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must sustain an appropriate posture to our enemies in this interconnected world . - Stop loss , if invoked , becomes a patriotic duty . - I sincerely hope we have a few patriots left in the pilot ranks . <p> Your personnelists are working day and night at the highest levels to solve this problem by any other means . - Those personnelists- are heroes in my book , and I believe they will be successful . - However , if they are not successful &amp; Stop Loss is invoked , it will be easier , and shorter , if service members remember their core values &amp; jump on the bandwagon . - Young people- do not be disheartened by the negativity on this blog. - The future of our Air Force and our country is bright , and you are the beacons . - Thank you for serving . <p> Chang ... please stop with the rhetoric and oversimplification of the repercussions of stop loss . You challenge the patriotism of individuals who HAVE served and separated from the AF . You have no knowledge of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for conscription to fill the void of other such manning shortages ? What 's the difference ? Stop loss , for all intents and purposes turns an all volunteer force into a selective draft . I would argue drafting or applying stop loss to individuals to become power point rangers or bullet sponges is an effective technique because patriotism be damned their morale is likely in the crapper anyway . Now apply that logic to aviation , where individuals are FORCED into a position responsible for multimillion dollar weapon systems . Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me . Be sure to add a line to the ORM matrix for stop lossed aircrew members . Do n't put the past screw ups of your beloved personnel world on the shoulders of aviators who departed the fix for greener pastures . It is amazing that you can not see that YOU are the problem and the solution is NOT to ask more from those that you need .

I 'm not sure the techincal jargon , but I had to get my EKG redone too . I heard those machines are very sensative and may of not been functioning/ hooked up right . Mine came back abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local area not the afb ( because it was 2.5 hours away ) and faxed them copies of the new EKG and had it reviewed by the cardiologist here where i live , not at flight med . It was " sinus " normal . Keep in mind the machine at the afb , i have read and been told it is inaccurate some times and made me think i had a heart problem , when i really did n't  . Another thing to keep in mind is anxiety , stress , how much is riding on this one visit and how that can affect your heart . Relax take some deep breaths . Again , which i have read on this site also , if push comes to shove and there actually is a problem . 99% of EKG reading are waiverable . Keep in good spirits , i do n't  think you have anything to worry about ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ZackN <p> Any flight docs in cyberland willing to offer advice on whether or not a hemi fasicular block is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DD <p> I 'm not a flight doc , so I ca n't give you any concrete information .

There 's quite a few dudes around with houses that they rent out for $27/day . <p> Typical day ( early pit - AM lines ) : <p> 0500 show to print wx , notams , etc <p> 0600 brief time <p> 0800 Takeoff <p> 1100 Land/Debrief <p> 1200 Lunch <p> 1300 Schedule is usually fleshed out so you come back in to mission plan for the next day <p> Mission planning depends on the person . Especially for Qual phase there are very few options ( Brady - GRK/SJT or Kings5 - CRP/VCT ) so you kind of have your bag of tricks already . Proficiency/Instruction get a little more involved with the Form/AR/AD with AD being the most involved ... but even at that the charts are already prepared by the Navs so you just have to check chum and AP/1B currency ( The charts do suck though , a lot of turn points are airfields ... ) . Out and Backs will have their own special considerations ( Call ahead , check fuel contract , etc ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing called the magic kneeboard that does all your AR calculations ahead of time . I 'd say an hour to two to get your plan together if you do n't jack around bsing with people and stuff . For the form stuff you 're also expected to make up this white board thing with the mission plan on it . Most retarded thing I 've ever seen , but they all expect it so we all do it . You 're also forced to use BRI during Qual . <p> All in all , there are very few basic missions/profiles so once you have a good library of fuel plans/175's/data cards you 're good to go . I even have a word document with links that pull up all the NOTAMs we use day-to-day , weather , AHAS , etc so I can have everything ready to no-notice brief in like 20 minutes . Look on the share drive when you show up = ) . Most the IP 's here are pretty cool ... there are a few guys that people would rather avoid , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and want to help you out . Good luck ! <p> Is this a written policy , or somthing internal @ AFPC ? <p> It 's written . I saw it on some website on AFPC about the IP positions at Randolph and it was listed as a requirement . Sorry I ca n't point you to it , but I do remember seeing that it was listed as a requirement . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I went through back in 03 , but I imagine things have n't changed too much , with respect to the core nature of the program . First , on the T-1 side of the house , I never met a non-prior UPT IP , and at my base we had one of our most amazing IP/EPs who had been an IP in two jets try to go there as joint spouse , and in spite of his great record , could n't get a waiver with the OG and Wg/CC on his side . <p> The nature of the program is great . I went through as a faip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy . Academics were optional , almost . The LSI instructors basically made the tests group effort . Sims were two hours of flying approaches with a friend . The flight line was chill too . You could knock out three or four events on one flight , so it goes by super fast . The IPs were nice , as a whole . Not quite first names , but there was no saluting .... I was still a Lt at the time , so that was huge . There were one or two hook em all kind of tools , but they were far and few between . Unfortunately , the " picture " is very narrow , and focuses on the one right way to do things , the AETC way . They do a fair job of getting you ready for flying with students , and while I left very confident and at the top ( then ) of my game , I still barely got the gear up on my first real student ride . So , how well does it prepare you ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on things I learned as a huge part of my skill set years later . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Not sure what the future holds for me as far as my next assignment , however , I did have some questions as far as going to PIT from an MWS location . Anyone who has done this could probably explain to me how things are usually run when you have a family and 2 dogs ( assuming it 's a TDY enroute ) . Do they make you live on base ? If so , how does it work with the family and who do you argue to for funding off base , your losing unit or gaining unit ? How often can you talk your way into getting a TDY out and back ? I would imagine this is fairly a common scenerio , whether or not people bring their families may be the difference . Any info about this process would be great . Also , I 'm not sure what the daily life of PIT students are these days and if the gayness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sum that up too it would make my decision making process easier .

Thanks . <p> I am here right now for T-38 PIT and can help you out . First , they will not let you stay in a TLF , no way , no how . The rooms they give you here are shitty and the rooms stay about 80-82 degrees all day as the AC sucks in the room . The AF will only pay you $27 per day whether you stay on or off base . So , if you stay off base which is your only option if you are accompanied , its on your own dime over the $27 per day they allot you . For this reason I left my wife back home . I actually just got back from the billeting office complaining once again about how hot my room is ( its all the rooms in the 2 buildings they put you in , vintage 1940s rooms &amp; AC ) and asked for another room and they said nope , and they refuse to give me a non-avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pocket . Our SQ/CC is even involved in this process of trying to get us out of these buildings that should be condemned , but no luck . Even if you do a TDY and back , AETC is still the one funding the bill , so they are not going to budge on the $27 per day . I am not sure about the T-6/T-1 side of PIT , but the 38 side is far from UPT mentality , its a big boy program and everyone here is there to help you succeed . So for me PIT is fun , but work . The lodging I could go on for days telling you about it . If you want to come , I say do it , but if you want to bring the family you better look for a place off base and pay out of pocket or just leave them back home . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Finance Guy can expand , but do n't forget about BAH you still get paid if you are doing a TDY enroute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my previous duty station for the 6 months of my TDY enroute .

I still get BAH but since I still have my house it is paying for that .

I had a very nice 3 bedroom apartment with a 2 car garage in the Stone Oak area ( which is a nice area ) it was about $1400 a month ( I brought 3 pets along too ) . You get 27 a day for lodging and approx 27 a day per diem which more than covered it . Plus I was still getting BAH . So I was making an extra 1300 a month after all was said and done . My drive was about 25 minutes each way but was worth it to live in a nicer area . The area around base is not nice .

@@43194732 @3194732/ <h> 9 posts in this topic <p> Hey all ! First post on these forums , so let me introduce myself . I 'm currently working on a PPL ( solo 'd in a Cessna 172P on 8 Aug 2015 ) and I 'm enrolled at the University of Maryland ( College Park ) , I hold a Private Pilot-Glider license , and have been chair flying on video games since the age of six . I 'm a current AFROTC freshman cadet w/ a Type 2 AFROTC scholarship at UMCP and have n't been able to really get a nice straight answer from my Det on this : benefits and cool stuff about being a CSO . I 'm definitely looking at being a pilot , but vision is likely to let me down ( 20/80 w/o glasses at my last checkup ) , so I was hoping on still flying anyway as a CSO . There are some really cool platforms I 'd like to fly on , namely the Mud Hen , Bone , and MC-130 series , and I would just like to gain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircrew ) on those airframes and benefits of being a career CSO until the 2040s . In simple terms : <p> -Can I still have a good flight career as a CSO until the late 2030s-2040s ? <p> -Benefits/other stuff like traveling , work life , and camaraderie as a CSO ? <p> -Future of the F-15E , B-1B , MC-130 series of airframes until the 2040s ? 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So as a prior nav turned pilot - yes , you can definitely have a great career as a CSO . Unless you ca n't handle people giving you crap for being a CSO , then you 're going to hate life . <p> The airframes you mentioned probably are n't going anywhere anytime soon , but things can and do change , sometimes very quickly . So trying to plan out over a decade away for airframes , that 's difficult . <p> Marketable to civilian flight world ... nope . At least not from a flying perspective . Development/engineering definitely . Just do n't plan on being in the seat in the civilian world unless you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't count towards , so you have to account for that . <p> Do n't let people talk you out of it because you 're " not a pilot . " I obviously have n't experienced every community out there , but from my little corner of the AF , it was a great time . <p> Also do n't give up on being a pilot if that 's what you really want . There 's a waiver for just about everything , and it takes some digging to find something that will flat out disqualify you . If being a pilot is your dream , keep going for it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So as a prior nav turned pilot - yes , you can definitely have a great career as a CSO .

Somewhat of a second class citizen to pilots , but important all the same . <p> The previous poster covered most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that you need to consider is how infrequently and/or competitive those particular airframes are to get . I 'm currently a nav who graduated from UCT last year ( looking into UPT in the future ) and I can say from the numerous drop nights that I saw , the Bone and MC in particular are not so common . If a class is lucky enough to get one to drop , it usually is literally just one . The F15 almost always has at least 2 drop , but since they are the only pointy nose , there are a lot of people trying for them . My dad was an F15E driver and I know a couple dudes at each of those airframes and as previously stated , it does n't look like they are going anywhere anytime soon . Just work your ass off in UCT and you should n't even have to worry about getting what you want ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Go get your eyes cut ( with an approved procedure to- bring you to 20/20 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fly helos , P-8 's from the beach , or any of the lot of aircraft types from USS BOAT ..... take your pick ( actually it 's about- 10% desire , 50% grades .... and 90% needs- of the Navy ... yeah , the math is done incorrectly on purpose ) . <p> I 'm a little biased being a Navy NFO with some B-1B backseat time and a sh%t-ton of U-28 CSO time ....

I 've never felt like a second class citizen because I 'm a nav . The only time I 've felt like a second class citizen was when for the life of me I could not get fighter dudes at Red Flag to understand that the AGM-158 is not a magic wand you can just wave to solve all your tactical problems .

As I was filling out my US airforce drug and alcohol statement something caught my eye : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior marijuana use is not disqualifying for enlistment or appointment , unless you are determined to be a chronic user or psychologically dependent , have been convicted or adversely adjudicated for marijuana involvement . Preservice marijuana use may render you ineligible for certain skills . ) <p> I made the mistake of trying it twice in high school . My question is what skills are you ineligible for ?

I concur with your plan on going back to whoever you interviewed with and seeing if you can discuss it with the , you can play it as a " temporary lapse of memory " and hope they do n't see you sweating , or you can man up and simply tell them you screwed the pooch on this question and you want to correct your mistake . Honestly , I 'd advise the latter and hope for the best . <p> At this point , your one-time experimentation with marijuana is less of an issue than your knowingly lying during the interview ( whether you admit to it or not ) . Despite how well prepared you were , or how well you responded during the interview , all of that is of little value if you failed to be completely honest during it . <p> I am not talking about exaggerating the truth a little , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blatantly lie about something so minor makes everything you say or did somewhat questionable . <p> However , not fixing that mistake will only make things worse , so get yourself out of this whole before you dig yourself in any deeper ! It may be a minor hiccup , or it may be the end of your dream ; but either way at least you will have taken responsibility for your actions and that is more important than anything . <p> Additionally , please forgo the emotional blubbering in your posts , we do n't need that shit on here ! Everybody wants to be a fighter pilot , but you do n't have to sound like a 12-yr-old girl describing Justin Bieber when you talk about it . <p> Lastly , go read and commit to memory the Rules of the Forum , as well as the three " Read This " threads at the top of the General Discussion section . To date you posted three times and you 've fucked every one of them up ... we ca n't be of any help to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake away from that happening ! <p> So does this reg apply to current or prospective officers ? And does it apply to prospective ROTC applicants ? Maybe it 's just me but the wording seems to imply that if you are an officer and " illegally , wrongfully , or improperly ... " then you 're screwed but if it took place before you even joined an ROTC program and you no longer participate in any drug related activities then you 're fine . I 'm visiting my local det in a few days to go over this very issue . On occasion I smoked during my senior year in high school and summer following . I never smoked habitually and I never owned or bought any drug paraphernalia . All together I 'd estimate that I 've smoked more than 10 times but less than 15 .

( This was for the ROTC application ) . That may not still be true , but if you end up having to come up with a number at some point that might be something to keep in mind . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> When they ask you about drug use does that include your time as a minor or just since you turned 18 ? <p> Nope ... its from " birth " , but the farther back the better . BTW , here 's the quote from the AFRSI on accession rules ... <p> " 3.21.1 . In most cases , substance abuse is disqualifying . Self-admission of pre-service experimental marijuana ( including organic or synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to legal proceedings is not automatically disqualifying . However , any use over 15 times is disqualifying .

But I found an instance of someone being DQ'ed after getting his pilot slot , TS clearance , and passing his FC1 . here 's the link ( ) . So have policies changed recently or is this an uncommon occurence ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have n't taken the opportunity to bitch about this yet , so I 'll do that now - the TL ; DR version : drugs are bad , do n't do drugs , m'kay ? <p> The way I understand it : at the time my NGB package and waiver request were under review ( Sep 2013 ) , there was an inconsistency between ANG and USAF policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; 1x is DQing . My package was rejected ( sts ) due to confusion over the inconsistent policy , and my SQ/CC reattacked . The policies were brought into agreement and my self-admitted &gt; 1x DQ 'd me . <p> Not sure if my experience is common or just a one-off . The final explanation I was given for my DQ was that marijuana experimentation &gt; 1x , even if it was in high school over 10 years prior to commissioning , was behavior inconsistent with serving as an officer . 1x is waiverable ; anything beyond that is DQing . <p> I was fed several lines by officers and recruiters toward the end of the years-long process of applying , interviewing , enlisting , waiting around , FC1 , TS , waiting around , DQ , waiting around and separation : 1 ) I probably should have lied about it from the start ( poor SA on my part ) , 2 ) I never should have been interviewed by a single fighter squadron ( or 5 ) based on my honest reply to the prior use question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed up on alcohol , 4 ) at least I have a TS and 5 ) timing/luck is everything . <p> I honestly thought I could get the kill , but despite the ass pain , I 'm thankful I was n't waved off before making a pass at getting hired . I met some truly kick ass , amazing people and had some unforgettable experiences . <p> But ... I never got the chance to take the controls of a USAF aircraft , so I lost . 
@@43194735 @3194735/ <h> 31 posts in this topic <p> I am an Enabler so YMMV . On the vMPF homepage , top center I have an IDT counter .

Will that stoke the fire of hatred for the U.S. in the middle east as we once again try and force regime change ( the only real option here ) in a sovereign country ? Or will we be seen as good guys who saved they oppressed and brutalized Syrian people from their tryannic regime ? If we do n't intervene , will that make people hate us more ?

This is because the signal is subject to Doppler shift , so echoes from closing targets will show an apparent increase in frequency and echoes from opening targets will show an apparent decrease in frequency . Target velocity can be estimated by determining the average frequency shift of carrier cycles within a pulse packet . This is typically done by means of a 1D fast Fourier transform or using the autocorrelation technique . The transform is performed independently for each sample volume , using data received at the same range from all pulses within a packet or group of pulses . In older systems , a bank of analogue filters were used . <p> Velocity measurements are of course limited to measuring the component of the target velocity that is parallel to the beam ( radial ) , since tangential movement will not affect the received signals . A target is either closing or opening , or it will fall into the clutter notch ( a velocity range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single radar will therefore result in underestimates of target velocity . Complete velocity profiles can only be derived by combining measurements from several radars , situated at different locations . <p> The radial velocity of the target can easily be calculated based on knowledge of the radar frequency , speed of light , pulse repetition frequency and average phase ( frequency ) shift . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Scanner Glossary ; This glossary of code words and phrases used in radio transmissions around Area 51 may be useful if you monitor the airwaves . <p> spike - Aircraft has a RWR signal indication ; opposite to NAKED : " Snake one threat BRA 240 for 48 , 7000 " " Snake two spike " ( Snake one tells his wingman of threat and BRA and wingman ( two ) acknowledges indication of the threat on the RWR ) <p> notching - Flying through a gap ( notch ) in a mountain range <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks !

I do n't know what the time window is ; I also do n't know if you can claim an oil *change* vs oil *added* during the trip ( and I suspect it 's just the latter ) .

If you 're confident enough of your debate skills w/ the IRS if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; circumstances " decision on whether the oil change was incident to the DITY move , you could always itemize it as an unreimbursed business expense ( again , to me , not worth it ) . <p> *This is actually a better deduction than most realize , since DFAS ( ? ) makes the deduction prior to calculating your taxable pay--essentially making it a " front page " deduction for those who itemize , and a " built-in " itemized deduction for those who do not .

Only certain types of utility trailers count for household goods and thus towards your weight . Check out move.mil ... one of the pamphlets has the definition of this , but it 's something like single-axle 8x12 with no side higher than 28 inches and a gate no taller than 4 ft unless removable . If you claim the weight and the trailer does n't qualify , it might bite you if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you an estimate for what you 'd make doing a DITY or partial DITY .

There 's a difference between attaining understanding , attaining proficiency , and attaining mastery . I can know can and ca n't be done with a MWS without being a tactical master at it . If I 'm a general , I do n't need to have been a tactical expert at my airframe 20 years ago to understand how to employ it in the broadest , most high level strategic sense . That 's why I have a staff to bring that expertise . What I do need to know is how I can utilize the joint force to win a war .

Therefore , when a general is not working with their singular background , but a massive orchestration of moving parts that is also under their command , they can not be successful in employing said assets , because they do n't know what can or ca n't be done with them on a tactical mastery level . However , it makes sense that the general knows what can and ca n't be done on a strategic level , with advisors and liaisons that can help them out on a tactical level . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> And I did n't call anyone out , in fact I was defending the ability of Eagle and Raptor drivers to have tactical prowess yet not be deployed , at least to the desert .

I definitely learned this early on when teaching/advising the Iraqis as a relatively young guy instructing Iraqi pilots who were much older , who had been flying much longer than I have , and in quite a few instances , had more hours than I did at the time . Fortunately , I was able to establish some credibility early on , humble myself around those guys , and soon enough was able to see some positive results .

The amount of time you spend awkwardly changing radio freqs w/ the mouse , etc. could be better spent just closing your eyes and visualizing in your head . I 'm not just a " hater , " I 've BTDT , but my opinion is just different than Aloha 's . Best thing would be to form your own opinion , but I caution you to not spend a bunch of time on MSFS ... I really believe you 'll gain much less than what you would by just " old-fashioned " chair flying and studying the pubs .

All the switches/buttons function as the do in the real aircraft , screens display what they would in the real a/c , etc . During Phase 1 , it 's worth it 's weight in gold for you to practice starting the plane , flipping the right switches in the right order , looking at the screens for the engine displays , etc .

In my very humble opinion , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with studying , reading , getting gouge , or any of that . THE number one thing you can do is to make sure your life is in order . <p> Make sure your relationships are strong . If you are married , take time to talk to your wife ( or husband ) about what the upcoming year has in store . Do n't sugar coat it one bit . Come up what you think will be a realistic plan of how your daily tasks around the house will be re-divided . Commit to spend time with them . For me , this meant that from Friday night to after church on Sunday , NO studying ( unless I had a checkride coming up ) . You are about to spend a year reading thousands of pages about flying ; spend some time reading about how to make a successful marriage , or attend a marriage building seminar . Some people might think that this sort of thing is or for people with a bad marriage , but believe me , it is worth it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **40;863;TOOLONG relationship , try to figure that thing out before pilot training . <p> If there is bad blood between you and a family member or good friend , try to get it settled . <p> Get your finances in order . Get out of credit card and other debt to the max extent possible . You do NOT want that hanging over your head during pilot training . If you are starting in March , get your taxes done early . Make a realistic budget early , and include plenty of money for having a good time . <p> Stay in shape . If you are not in shape , get there . Pilot training is physically demanding , even if you never pulled more than 2Gs , simply because of the lack of sleep , poor nutrition , and high stress you will be subjecting your body to . <p> Make important decisions and promises to yourself ( ie , I will under no circumstances , drive if I have had more than 1 beer . etc ) <p> Get in touch with the Higher Power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was going to start UPT , I was struck with two horrible tragedies that I would not wish on my worst enemy , about 40 days apart . The best decision I made was to take a huge chunk of emergency leave , and get things taken care of ( as much as it was possible anyway ) . I started UPT two classes later than I would have , but in the long run that time was nothing . Looking back , I perhaps should have even waited longer to start , as the events affected my ability to train in phase II . However , in the long run , I got my dream assignment , so I guess things worked out . <p> So this is a little long winded , but what I am saying is that , you WILL have time to learn what you will need to know during UPT . But UPT is not a bubble , life , including the bad stuff , can still effect you there .

As far as studying before you get to UPT , BOLDFACE at a maximum , we will tell you how and what to learn , you 'll only start your own bad habits if you go further than that . Live on base , do n't drink off base , it 's only a year . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Does having Flying experience help or hurt you at UPT ? I know there is IFS but other than that . <p> Just recently finished up Phase II and this is what I saw in regards to prior experience ... <p> -Private with a decent amount of hours proved to definitely help in the Contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase . <p> -No amount of hours or ratings will help in the Formation phase . This is the true equalizer because 99% of the dudes at UPT have never flown formation . I saw some people who had only 25 hours at IFS struggle through the Contact Phase , but then really pick it up by the end and excel in the Formation Phase . <p> Aside from that I ca n't really tell you how it affects Phase III yet , but my guess is that the majority of the no time dudes have caught up to the experienced dudes . <p> my .02 <p> Also keep in mind no amount of hours will help you if you have a piss poor attitude and think you are better than everyone at UPT because of your experience . I really did n't see much of this though . Most of our high time dudes were pretty humble about it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Does anybody know off the top of their head how heavily the phase I academics are weighted toward mass score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weather test for example ( i 'm just saying , you know hypothetically ) how badly would this hurt them ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Does anybody know off the top of their head how heavily the phase I academics are weighted toward mass score ? ie. if somebody does n't do well on a Weather test for example ( i 'm just saying , you know hypothetically ) how badly would this hurt them ? <p> I would n't sweat one test . One test wo n't affect your mass score that much . What will affect your mass score is if you get worked up over one test and let it bring you down . It is just like daily and check rides when you screw up one manuever , let the bad stuff roll off your shoulder and press . If I remember correctly from eight years ago , academics is ony 10 percent of the mass . There are in excess of 500 questions ( including EPQs ) so if you missed 10 questions on that one test you dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact but you get the point . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Academics are the smallest part of your MASS ( including stan tests ) , but realize that doing well on these things looks good on you . So in the end , while they may be only 10% , they also might impact your flt/cc ranking ( positively or negatively ) . Academics is something you can control ... so do n't be the guy who barely passes test and/or keeps failing stan tests . There 's no excuse ... especially w/ all the " help " out there . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> how much of a part does previous flying experience contribute ? i think i want to fly fighters , but i have no flying experience whatsoever ... <p> I 'm just about to solo and I have about 200 hours prior experience with an instrument rating . So far , it has helped some but not an immense amount . Having the IFR rating definitely gave me a leg up in the instruments academics and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they expect me to be good at that stuff . In the presolo contact stuff it has n't helped too much , honestly . Maybe that I have a little bit of a clue what 's going on and a small amount of air sense ( not much SA yet though ) , but the flying is WAY different , the radio calls are totally different , and the expectations are just as high for everyone . <p> I ca n't speak to how it will contribute to my overall success or failure during UPT , but my previous flying experience has helped some . It definitely helped at IFS because that was essentially civilian flying with a different traffic pattern . IFS , however , is pass/fail so being the best with 6900 hours or showing up with 0 hours does n't matter . As long as you work hard and are n't UNSAFE you 'll do fine . That 's basically what they 've looked for at UPT so far , too . " Is this dude unsafe ? Will he kill himself or someone else if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MOA . " If you 're safe , you 'll succeed , if you 're unsafe , you wo n't . <p> Back to your question -- it depends . It definitely helped on some of the academics tests , but it has hurt in some other areas from using previous techniques that do n't work . For example , I had a bad habit of a high flare on landing . I flared early and settled to the runway just like I did in a C-152 and Piper Warrior . Problem is with the T-6 that 's not how to land . So , I had some negative transfer and got hosed on my first few flights for ending up in a sinking flare situation . After a few debriefs and clarifications I realized ( through some IP insistence and demonstrations while airborne ) that I was doing that from my previous flying . I did n't know it , did n't realize it , and now I do n't land like that anymore . So , weird things you did n't think would be an issue become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to recognize that you will be instructed as if you had 0 hours when you show up . If that chaps your ass and you get an attitude about the " remedial " instruction then you are doomed to failure . Having a good attitude and being humble about your previous flying experience ( and all other things ) as well as helping out the guys who are struggling in the flight is the most important thing , I think , about previous flying experience . but for you , with 0 experience , do n't worry about it . The program is designed for 0 hour dudes to succeed . There are lots of guys , some on this board , who showed up with 0 hours and got what their first choice out of UPT . You just got ta work hard and study up . If you know the procedures the IPs will teach you techniques . Do n't waste time you could be learning techniques having them teach you the procedures you should 've already learned . <p> HUGE CAVEAT : Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have n't soloed let alone earned my wings , so take what I said with a big grain of salt . There are many more experienced people here who will have better perspective than I do . I 'm just telling you my experience in UPT thus far . Whether you still want to track t-38s and MAYBE get a fighter after T6s depends on whether you a ) like pulling g 's and strapping into an ejection seat b ) like wearing a helmet , mask , harness , and g-suit every day to fly , c ) do n't suck at formation , and d ) want to be a fighter pilot after meeting some and learning what the days are like behind the glamor of it all . There 's a lot more to it than I ever thought there would be , and it 's way different than I expected . There is definite appeal to both sides . Do n't pigeon hole yourself to flying fighters because you saw Operation Red Flag or Top Gun and you think want to fly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know your question is relating to have no experience , but I kinda answered it from the other direction .

Phase 2 does a great job of making up your mind one way or the other . I personally was very gung ho fighters for YEARS , but now that i 'm a few weeks away from track I want to fly herks . Funny how that happens . The story is the same for most of my class . Those that still want fighters have always wanted them , those that do n't probably did at one point along the way . <p> Granted there are a few that will tell you that they 're heavy dudes through and through and that they 've never wanted to fly anything pointy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just do your best , keep your options open and do n't decide anything until after formation solo . <p> Good luck . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As far as flying experience goes , people get all wrapped up about it . Initially , the guys with tons of hours seemed to be ahead with switchology and general flying knowledge , but guess what , the majority of people eventually caught up . I 'm sure it helps with regards to air sense , etc ... but as far as final class standing goes ( at least in my class ) it did n't mean shit . The people that did the best in my class were the ones that picked up AF flying ( i stress AF ) quickly . That coupled with good attitude , being a good classmate , some luck , and some politics in your favor dictated your overall performance ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For the most part , as long as you keep a good attitude towards UPT , instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the exception of one guy , all of us who got fighters in my class had prior flight time ranging from 80 hrs to 900 hrs . I think it helps and strongly suggest anyone get time . Not only will it help you , but it will be fun . Obviously experiences differ between classes , but bottom line is it 's never a bad idea to get flight time . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm commissioning this coming June and will more than likely have a good 6 months before my EAD date comes around . <p> I have next to no prior flight experience and I wanted to ask you guys if getting 20 - 30 hours in a DA-20 prior to my EAD date would be beneficial for me going into IFS and UPT in general ... ? <p> Right now I have no intention of trying to go -38 's and honestly helos look really badass and most appealing to me .

Is this true ? <p> Thanks for all the info and I ca n't wait to get into the real Air Force and the f*** out of ROTC ... <p> First ... Nothing , NOTHING is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing in popularity ( No UAVs ... yet ) In T-6s everyone competes for their follow on training ( -38s , Toners , T-44s and Helos ) You can walk in day one and tell everyone you want Helos but at track select ( If you make it that far , again not guaranteed ) you had better done better than everyone else who put it higher than 3rd choice . Then maybe then you could say it is quasi-guaranteed . <p> As far as getting hours ... it could probably help some , but do n't break the bank doing it . I know plenty of guys that showed up to UPT with only IFS experience and finished top of their class . Also seen some with lots of time that do n't have wings today . Again ... <p> I showed up with hours and ratings . It helped and I got my dream assignment but in the end the only thing different between me and most of my bros is a lot more debt . <p> Hope that helps ... Good Luck <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to go through pilot training twice ... once with the Army and once with the AF . Both programs are similar in overall mindset ( as opposed to Navy training ) in that they run heavy on a timeline . I 'm sure you 've read often that a good attitude will lead to good things . That is true , and the best thing you can do is simply try your best , have a good attitude and ask questions . Do n't be afraid to do that last thing ... your IP wo n't think you 're stupid for asking questions , in fact they 'll be glad you care enough to ask about the things you are n't sure about . Do NOT sweat whether you 're going to make it . Worrying will only degrade your performance , and just believe that if it 's meant to be , it 's meant to be . Focus on the phase of training you are in , do n't get caught up worrying about the next year 's worth of tasks or else you 'll feel overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before you know it you 'll be finishing Phase I , Phase II and Phase III just like that . <p> Do n't get caught up in class rankings , who 's better than who , etc . Just realize that everyone who graduates gets to wear the same wings . Do n't show up wanting to only fly one type of airplane . Show up prepared to fly ANY airplane . If you have that attitude , you 'll stress less and you 'll be happier with the outcome . Have a few choices from each track as your goal . Nothing like watching the " fighter-or-bust " types practically cry on track select night because they got a T-1 . Me personally ... I liked the A-10 , C-17 and C-130 ... those were my top picks in each track ( I had already flown helos so I did n't necessarily have a top pick for that track ) . Either way , whatever track I went , I had a goal to work towards . In the end , I put T-38s third , only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At some point in Phase II , you 'll decide for yourself if you 'd rather be a fighter guy or a heavy guy ... there were several that arrived at the start wanting to fly Vipers , Eagles , etc , and by track select were saying " screw that stuff " and opted for heavies . <p> Bottom line ... arrive with a good attitude and ready to fly any aircraft the USAF assigns you to , even if it 's an E-3 . I 'd rather fly AWACS than sit at a desk with the other shoe clerks , trust me on that . Having an open mind and a good attitude will reduce your stress level and you 'll actually be able to ENJOY pilot training ! It 's a fun , yet very busy year . Nothing they teach is rocket science , but there 's a lot of stuff to absorb . Finally , just accept that a small number of people are n't going to be cut out to do it , and if you 're one of them , then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they wash you out , well at least you can say you tried your best . If you have that mindset , you wo n't stress every time you fly or do a stand up . Anyways , hope this helps some of you ! <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ski&amp;fly fast <p> I know this has been discussed earlier , but how much does Phase 1 really matter in UPT ?

I do n't remember the exact breakdown but all of T-6 's is worth 25% of your total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up well over 50% . Academics make up 10% . That means that academics in T-6s account for 2.5% of your total score . The transition check which is the first T-38 check ride is worth 30% or your total grade so one day of flying in T-38s has more impact on your ranking than six months of flying T-6s . Daily rides and commander ranking are both very small percentages . That being said you need to work super hard and be well prepared for all your daily rides and academics so you can learn as much as possible . This will insure that you do as well as possible on your check rides . I also believe that commander ranking follows closely overall performance so if you learn quick and fly well you will get a good commander ranking ( this is because most everyone is a hard worker with a great attitude so in that regard almost everyone is pretty equal ) . <p> As far as ranking for academics is concerned most students will do really well on all the academics . I would estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of ALL T-6 academics so it may be only one or two questions separating the top couple of students from the middle of the pack . <p> In my opinion our flight has a couple of top performers that tend to standout above the rest but I would guess that number 3-8 are all really close and may be separated by just a couple of EPQ questions or daily ride grades . I would guess that this will continue to be the case in T-38s . <p> All you can do is to study hard and be as prepared as possible everyday . <p> Goodluck , <p> Pilotapplicant <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I know this has been discussed earlier , but how much does Phase 1 really matter in UPT ?

I was by no means an academics superstar and that hurt me with the flight commander ranking . If your right in the middle of where the other guys then you are doing a ok . <p> And do n't think because you failed a test your dream of a -38 is over , in my class we had one guy who failed 1 test and another who failed 2 also get one . Not ideal but it can be done . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Most of you have a gross misunderstanding of how academic scores go into the big picture . It does n't matter if your average is 1% away from the top dude . It does n't matter if it is 10% away . It matters where your average RANKS within your class . You might have a 95% average , but that does n't mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you the last dude in your class , then you get the min ... and the difference in points between the top and bottom dude ( sts ) in a class is way more than the difference in academic percentage . <p> The top guy gets the max points . The last guy gets the min points . Everyone else is in between . It 's COMPETITIVE and while it may look like close enough is close enough , it is not . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Danny Noonin is right ... the mass is all relative scores . And , your Phase 1 academics only count towards your track select . once you get to Phase 3 everything is a clean slate and you start all over with new academics and everything . <p> So , how much does academics count ? 10% of your T-6 MASS . Checkrides are 40% , daily rides are 25% and flight commander ranking is 25% . Those are all relative scores as well , but different downgrades count for different amounts on checkrides and daily rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aerobatics and someone else gets downgraded on Ground Ops , GK , and EP , even though you both got 3 downgrades you did better than he did because he made bigger mistakes that are weighted more . Except they do n't let us see that black magic math , so that 's just what IPs tell me . <p> Hope that helps . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Or you just forget about all this nonsense and put 169% effort into every damn thing you do . Whether that be a stan test , academic test , daily ride , sim , checkride , etc . Who cares what the event is or how the percentages work , just work your ass off and it 'll pay off . Now , it is smart to prioritize , such as having a checkride the next day is more important than the test you have in the morning . If chairflying more for your checkride and only get a 96% on your Instrument test vs. studying more for your test and getting a 100% , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice is obvious . Outside of these unique situations , I think you guys are better served by not worrying about the point breakdown and just put max effort into everything . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Some dudes are fat dumb and happy with their 95% academic average if it 's " pretty close " to the top guy . It does n't matter if 95% is a good score or a bad score relative to 50 years of UPT students . It only matters where it ranks in YOUR class . If the top guy has a 97% , most of the class has a 96% , and you have a 95% , then you get the min points . You do n't get 2 points less than the top guy . There is a curve . <p> Brabus is spot on about not worrying about it and about prioritizing the more important things like checkrides . <p> But every dude comes home dead tired one night with a test/EPQ the next day and has to make a choice ... watch Seinfeld reruns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe a couple questions over the course of a thousand wo n't make a difference . Maybe it will . I 've said it before : I watched a kid miss a T-38 by one spot . When we looked at the numbers , if he had gotten THREE QUESTIONS more correct , he would have gotten that slot . Do you think if he knew that going in he might have studied a little bit more ?

The key is to " get known " by the embryonic squadron commanders of these units standing up . <p> Another option that may be abhorrent to most is the Army National Guard . I was talking to a recruiter the other day that said I 'd be one of the " young " ones ( I 'm 39 ) coming over , and would be able to stay in until 60 ( all active duty time would count ) .

It is such a good deal that I am looking into coming back as a retired IMA reservist 04 . I have an 05 slot lined up , where I work as a civilian but according to the AFRC recruiter the fact I retired in 2005 still meant that my " commissioned years of service " marched along , so they claim that I am over 23 years commissioned service , even though I am age 43 and had 21 years commissioned service at the time of retirement-- has anyone heard about this ? Also yes it is much harder now that there are over 5,000 IMAs who do not have slots is what the recruiter told me .

I would like to have a shot serving again my boss is willing to request the wiavers for the IMA slot because as some of you know there are not many backfills for pilots so hopefully it 's just finding the right levers to pull , so any help would be appreciated . <p> I also have a guard unit interested in bringing me onboard , but not as a pilot : ( as I have another AFSC , but the Guard recruiter did n't flinch at all when we discussed waivers , she just said it would take about a year to make it all happen and the guard does n't have the same hoops as the Reserves it is just that I would have to commute . <p> PS As for joining the Army Guard , nothing against the Army brothers as I served 5 years in the Army Guard , but I would n't do it again , air conditioning and clean sheets spoiled me , ha ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee .

I have been thinking the last couple years but the last O5 board made the decision a bit easier . I 'm trying to learn everything I can about TR/ART/AGR etc but it 's overwhelming right now . My ultimate goal is to retire after my 20 years and immediately draw retirement , so obviously an AGR position seems like the best bet . And I 'm not picky .. I would accept pretty much anywhere doing anything to get an AGR . For anything other than an AGR AD service after 2008 is supposed to count towards reducing the retirement age from 60 . So by the time I leave I could draw retirement at 52 or earlier after 20 good years . The question I have is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were to go into the reserve with 14 years would I have 5040(ish) points immediately towards my 7200 ? And from what I have heard when I reach 7200 points I can immediately draw that retirement .. ? So if I find a job even as a TR that puts me on mandays/orders continuously I could reach 6460 and declare sanctuary .. do 2 more years and draw a full AD retirement ? Is it unit dependent whether this happens or not ? I have read posts saying they " watch your days like a hawk " and prevent this . What is my best bet is this situation ? Should I look for an AGR somewhere or take a chance as a TR at a unit that says they 'll give me all the days I want ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You may have to look into the 2008 rule , since you already on active duty , it may not count , if it does I will be pleasantly surprised .

If you are declare sanctuary when you are mobilized and have two years left you can be assigned to an AD unit instead of your Reserve/Guard unit . This rarely happens but they try to scare you into not declaring sanctuary saying Big Blue might shanghai you into going to some hell - hole for your last two years . <p> Sent from my SAMSUNG-SGH-I337 using Tapatalk <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> In regards to the early retirement for active duty days since 2008 ... no , active duty time does not count toward that .

When I was a young Capt ( and single ) I put it on my ADP hoping I would get tagged out of desperation because of all the 7-day opt and " forced " retirements . No dice , instead I 'm flying preds and those that do n't want it are being " DT 'd " into a job one has to want to be doing to be extremely successful .

Without buy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary risks or devote the required time to advance beyond the lacking language/cultural training provided . <p> It is a CJCS program ( Adm Mullen created and prioritized ) so the services are pressured to send their best and brightest to try and successfully engage with Afghanistan from citizens to policy makers . <p> It 's difficult to attract young promising flyers because it does n't fit our very specific career tracks , much like RAS can pull you away for too long to be " successful " ( SQ/CC and beyond ) . And with the relatively large amount of " promising " candidates needed to fill AFPAK Hands slots it is bound to fall on flyers too . It does n't help that it seems the AF is not actually giving the desired follow-on " career success " that chairman has directed the services to follow . A1 has not been known to be agile enough to accommodate something " different " or even successfully manage people period , as we all know .

It 's been a while since I 've bought a gun so my impressions might be somewhat out of date . Every time I looked at getting a new gun it seems like the choices are dominated by a handful of companies you see everywhere ( Colt , Ruger , S&amp;W , Glock , Springfield , etc. ) and when people ask online- for advice those same names always come up . But according to the ATF there are over 250 handgun manufacturers in the US plus all the imports each year . So who are all these small manufacturers and where are they selling guns ? Most of them have sprung up since 2004 ( only 79- manufacturers registered with ATF in- 2004 ) but I do n't feel like I ever see new guns from new companies on shelves . <p> If you think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the government approvals so it 's not that surprising that new manufacturers pop up when the gun market is doing well . And it 's pretty common for people to own multiple guns from different manufacturers . On the flip side , while I 'm willing to try anything from names I know I 'm not sure I would trust a no-name gun company I 've never heard of considering how badly things can go wrong with a poorly made firearm . So has anybody hear bought from a small company or even seen companies that make maybe 1 or 2 different handguns and that 's it ?

I am a current HC-J CSO at moody who flew the old P models for a few years as well . <p> Training is almost identical for HC and MC . Ops tempo including TDY and deployment is roughly 1-1 with deployments being in the 4-5 month range . The mission changes with AOR . Mission was CASEVAC in Afganistan , and rescue alert elsewhere . In some AOR 's it is easy to feel under utilized because they are primarily SOF . When the SOF guys do a high risk op , they usually have a SOF backup plan if it goes south leaving rescue as the backup to the backup , but we do get alerted and launched for pop up issues ( i did one such mission on my last deployment , we were even the RV , left the helo 's at home ) . In that AOR we also flew some overflow trash hauling missions since the single slick was not enough , and some overflow SOF infil/exfil/resupply since they often needed more airlift than they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter and bomber missions we pull airborne or ground alert for those guys as the primary rescue force . <p> As far as flying opportunities , we honestly get less hours than the MC guys especially since there is a lot of alert time while deployed . At home , it seems the typical schedule will be 7x 5hr sorties per week , which should translate to 1-2 flights per week for most . <p> As for job satisfaction , it depends greatly on your personality . If your satisfaction comes from being the center of the action and racking up hours , the HC may not be for you . For me the job satisfaction in this community comes from knowing that your presence makes all our guys safer , flying a highly rewarding mission that only occurs occasionally is needed , etc ... I really enjoy the launch and have to plan the whole mission on the fly aspect as well . It does take a certain mentality to really love rescue . <p> Valdosta , imho , is not bad . We are easy weekend trips from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bars in town , the locals are very pro military , but it is definitely country living ( pro or con depending on personal preference ) . If you are into cars there are plenty of activities from off road to autocross to drag racing , a few good gun clubs if you are into shooting , plenty of hunting opportunities . <p> Morale at the squadron seems to be steadily improving . It seems that a combo of more utilization , many of the bitter types getting out/moving , and the new J capes are having a very positive effect on the community .

If I come out of ABQ as an FP do I go through an in-house upgrade to MP once I get to my unit or can I expect to do that after the PIQ in ABQ before I PCS ? - <p> doubtful you 'll do anything additional in ABQ outside the formal IQ course. - Your PM could also tailor you specifically based on your circumstances , if in fact you were supposed to do a TX but got an IQ slot instead due to availability. - Could being the operative word. - Reach out to your gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if that expectation is something other than FP/MC , then they need to reach out to the PM at Kirtland before your arrival for any possibility of tailoring . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> After a phone call with base MPF found- they had me loaded up for a mission qual after PIQ , they just never notified me of it until I called and- specifically asked if I had anything projected for after PIQ . Little disappointing to be going back through PIQ starting with the power-up checklist and ending with a instrument fm8 , which i have and is current , but at this rate I 'm just ready to get out of AMC. - <p> I also wouldn't- recommend trying to finagle your way to an MP qual if you did n't already have one . - Even- if you do n't piss anyone off trying , - your ops unit will ignore it once you get there. - If you do n't suck , MP upgrade could happen quick and the syllabus is in house training anyways. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm inclined to not want to be stationed there . <p> ABQ does n't smell. - Major airline with direct flights around the country , great for that odd 4 day weekend while you 're in training. - Depending on time of year , 2 hr drive to excellent skiing ( Taos , Red River , etc ) . - 3ish hrs to Wolf Creek .

I 'm a bit dated - I did an ALO gig back in 2000-2003 . I had to qualify then compete to get to the unit that I ended up getting assigned to . Obviously , it was volunteer . Good experience , like I think Beaver said , a lot of leadership involved . For three years my boss did n't really know what I did . If I needed to be somewhere , I went . I think a lot has probably changed since then . <p> As far as career progression , I would say that being an ALO does not necessarily hurt your career . I want to qualify that by mentioning that I volunteered to be an ALO , I was n't handed the assignment . But from observing my career field , it has n't relatively put anyone behind . You are going to be behind the dude that does a fellowship instead of an ALO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing wrong with that , if the timing is right and you need to do an ALPHA , consider knocking out an ALO tour . Please do not show up to an Army unit unmotivated . That gives the AF a bad name . <p> Several years later after my ALO tour , I have a lot of spears to throw at the Army , but in a totally different context . After I left my ALO tour I said " never again " when it came to being surrounded by the Army . But , like all good plans , the enemy has a vote . So now I find myself surrounded once again by the Army . I have considerable compassion for ALOs , I know you are doing the Lord 's work , while not being understood or appreciated by the component that you are supporting . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 6 . Physical Requirements : All applicants must be medically qualified . ALO training involves a highly demanding physical program , that includes regular physical training events , obstacle course completion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted you must successfully complete the TACP Physical Ability and Stamina Test . All candidates must meet the following minimum standards : <p> -Run : 1.5 miles in under 11:41 <p> -Push-Ups : 39 push-ups in 1 minute <p> -Crunches : 45 crunches in 1 minute <p> -Pull-ups : 2 pull-ups in 1 minute <p> The TACP PAST is harder now , it changed in January of this year . ( unless ALO 's are n't held to the same standard as romad 's ) The run needs to be a 1.5 in 10:47 , more calisthenics , etc . Looks like fun ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Anyone have any info on the AMLO assignment at Yokota . Day to day schedule , deployments , can you still fly ? <p> When I was there several years ago , the guy in that billet flew ( CSO ... I 'm pretty sure we 're talking about the same position ) . Not a lot , so I assume he was pretty busy doing something , although I have no idea what ! The day to day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . But he got to go on pretty much every exercise so that was a pretty good deal . I think I heard he just made O-6 too .

Why you even thought it germane to this topic , I 'll never know . Other than being a little confusing , the IDL has no impact or bearing on jetlag or time-enroute . You argued that his flight took 24:45 ( 2000I to 2045I the next day ) and that it was because of the dateline . Both those times are INDIA or Japan Standard Time .

I think a comparison is sort of along the lines of apples and oranges , as someone else mentioned , but it 's still all fruit and both are healthy snacks , I guess . I 've never heard anyone use the term " single-engine mentality " with the Tweet . That 's a pretty big deal to the T-6 people . If your engine has a problem that 's fire , FOD or frozen , about all you can do is turn climb clean check and hope for the best until it comes time to eject . Here at Corpus we 've got people who came out of T-37s , T-6s , and T-34s . I do n't think any one training platform makes someone a better pilot than another one does . I think it comes down to the person , how hard they study , and how they develop their SA .

What exactly makes you think the Tweet does n't have good glide capability ? <p> Well , obviously I 've never flown the Tweet ( or the 37 ) and I 've never actually even seen one in person , so I was just speculating . That 's why I used the word " maybe . " Anyway , I had no doubt that someone would correct me if my guess was off the mark . <p> It still does n't make sense to me that it would be a better bet to eject rather than perform a dead engine landing , especially if there is a runway within dead engine glide range . Since I 'm not familiar with T-37 procedures , I 'll ask what may be an obvious question . Do the procedures give any direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get the jet pointed so that it wo n't kill anybody when it crashes , or do you just eject and not worry about the poor souls who may find themselves at the bottom of a T-37 crater ? I can understand ejecting to save your own life if it is the only remaining option , but to say the jet is not worth saving so we 'll let it potentially crash into someones house when it could be landed does n't seem logical . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> At CBM , there was also a " controlled bailout " area that was listed in the checklist that KoolKat mentions . It is an unpopulated area near Columbus that you are supposed to point the jet towards if you had control of it and were going to bail out . I believe they gave you the radial/DME to locate the area . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> PCOLA , I remember a guy doing stand up in my class . They gave him double engine failure on inside downwind . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base housing blah blah then eject . Our flight commander called BS . He told us F the people on the ground and just get the hell out of the airplane if it needs to be done . We had other instructors disagreeing right in class about that decision . I do n't believe there is any procedure to tell you what you should do or not in a time critical decision . There is a moral obligation in my opinion time permitting . This is a gray area . As far as trying to dead stick in a tweet . We would always ask in that situation during EPs " does it appear I will be able to make the field " They were looking for us to ask that question , and then say either yes or no . The tweet ejection seat sucks , and in reality if you are low at all you may eject , but you are going to land and come to a stop a few feet under ground . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I had a similar discussion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument was n't centered around the avionics or prop vs jet . It was based on the fact that the tweet is so energy deficient it requires more forethought to fly contact and formation etc . He stated that the T-37 was able to separate the quicker thinkers from the slower ones much easier than the T-6II . <p> To say that the tweet 's instruments provide UPT grads with a better scan is silly considering the cockpit layout of the tweet and the future of avionics . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Turtle , Vetter , Rocker , and kenblankenship - you can take your little kindergarten spat elsewhere .

Although the Navy is not flying them right now in flight school ( yet ) , there were compromises made to get the Navy to buy into this multi-million dollar contract . Here are some of my first hand observations as a former USAF IP at a NAVY base : 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Kabaam on the NACWS ( Navy TCAS ) what a piece that thing was . To touch on the paint job , they are currently trying to get the T-6s painted with the DDay stripes on wings and grey paint scheme like the old school P-51s .

I flew the T6 at moody , and having to master all three axis of flight gives you a better learning experience on how an airplane behaves . Talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't even know how to work the rudders ... they never put their feet on them . <p> The T6 may be a stable aircraft , but I challenge any Tweet IP to shack their first set of acro .... with the torque and p factor it makes for very challenging over the top moves mostly to due to power changes and that tail acting like a weather vane .... <p> Obviously the IP you talked to has never flown a prop ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Tweets still have a left turning tendency because both engines rotate in the same direction and produce a gyroscopic effect . It 's true that it 's not a pronounced at a T-6 though . But every student pilot has flown at least one prop job so the point is moot IMHO . And at least at Vance , you 'll be on the rudder plenty thanks to the hellacious crosswinds . <p> Master all three axis ?

I think that is what was ) , basically it is either set to each person pulls own cord to go or one person pulls cord and both go . <p> My memory my be fuzzy on this factoid , but I think of 4.5million dollar cost of the T6 , 2 million of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not write off p-factor just cuz everyone did IFT . It is offeset some by the TAD , but when you are at max power , at the top of a loop at 18 grand the thing is a challenge .... and cross the wind thing is kinda funny , becuase the p factor with cross wind and power changes ( for a student pilot ) can be eye opener . <p> In the end , prop flying is just different in some respects and may or not be benefical for airf force training . I liked the experience of the prop , and the T6 in general for avionics and performance . <p> Going into heavies myself , the IP/ACs get concerned when u start using the ruddder , but that 's mostly due to their fear of over controling and snapping that big tail off ... but that 's for a different discussion ... <p> 07 .

I know full well how it is , but the chiefs are not going to fix this - it 's up to ALL the officers . <p> All-in-all , even if you were mistaken on the rule on the wearing of the light , what you did was better than removing the light and conveying that the chief has authority to direct your actions .

He then told me not to wear it anymore , at which point i told him that I was sleeping in my thermals and pt gear becuase it was January , it was snowing outside , and my heater had been broken for 6-9 days and i was trying not to freeze to death and all the camp mayor would tell me was " the work order has been submitted " but as soon as he could get my heater fixed , i would be more than happy to stop sleeping in my thermals .... heater was fixed the next day . <p> 2 ) Was sitting alert ( sanitized uniform , no hats ) and took the alert truck to get chow . As we were taking our to go lunch back to the squadron , we walked past the MXG/CD and he lost his mind becuase we did n't salute ( hands were full ) , and the fact that we were n't wearing patches and hats ... he obviously did n't care that we might have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 minutes from the horn going off ....

The thing is , it 's not always the CMSgt 's fault but the guy he works for . I would say for the most part that if a WG/CC or whoever did n't give his ok to do it , that it would n't happen as often . There is certainly a culture right now where pointing out dumb uniform infractions is the norm , unfortunately it 's probably because the AF seems to think our mission is uniform changes/updates are the priority and not Fly , Fight , Win . And yes I just puked in my mouth for spouting the motto , but in essence we should be focused on killing bad guys and blowing shit up . <p> I guess in some way as a T.E.D .

I was just told about a Lt Col ( guard ) at the Deid who was told that " your zipper needs to be in the middle of your nametag " by some Chief . The Lt Col then took his name tag and moved it down so just the top of the nametag was attached to the bottom of the velcro square and then walked away .

His end around was to get it added to the 2903 Wing sup that we could wear our Friday " Heritage " patch and a matching name tag . Until the Friday shirt got banned it was added as well . I personally never saw anyone or heard anyone ever complain about the patches and T-shirts except when he brought it up in a staff meeting that he was catching flak for it from the Chief 's council .

" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we still have people who are ######ing up in their jobs . They know to tuck in their shirts for PT , but damn if I ask a basic question about pay and allowances and get a blank stare . Ok I got it , we want people to look good , that is the easy AFI to enforce , now put that much effort into making people know their own AFIs for their primary job so it does n't feel like I 'm the first person to ever ask about amendments to orders or how to renew a security clearance . <p> It 's not just the drool being taught at PME that is the problem , it 's the leadership mentality that a leader is ineffective if he/she is not continually doing SOMETHING . The fact of the matter is that by and large the Air Force is knocking it out of the park with regard to accomplishing assigned taskings . Leadership seems to think that they have run out of large rocks to crush , and thus have turned their attention to small rocks ( uniforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for the better within their organization , thus leading to a desire to fix what is n't broken . Uniforms are a quick and easy thing to change that has no mission impact ( aside from crushing morale , but that was shot YEARS ago , so no loss there ) . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Seriously agree .

@@43194764 @3194764/ <h> C-17 Globemaster vs C-130 Hercules <h> 200 posts in this topic <p> The biggest difference in the mission is Intra vs Inter-theater airlift . The 17s will bring stuff to and from the theater while Herks are in the theater taking bullets and beans to the troops . The biggest satisfaction in flying a Herk is knowing that by taking the army 's stuff from town to town in the air , they do n't  have to risk getting blown up in a convoy . 17s tend to go TDY more shipping stuff in the US and around the world . The Herk takes it to the smaller fields once it gets to the main hubs . <p> I love flying Tac airlift and the J has all the cool toys of the C17s with the mission of a Herk . Corpus was a ton of fun , live on the island if you can . The T44C offered a good mix of Navy style training with the avionics of a T1 . <p> Just remember ... at the end of the day , jets suck and props @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obviously there are a lot of 130 dudes on this forum . I guess I 'll speak up for the " pretty boy " C-17 . <p> When you 're deployed at the two stages you will fly the 17 as a tactical airlifter . I 've logged 10 minutes sorties in OIF carrying everything you can imagine - including the 50K MRAPS ( we usually carry two at a time ) . I 've landed in the dirt in OEF and airdropped bullets on the side of mountains too , just like a 130 . While the 130 does have a shorter takeoff and land capability ( 2500-3000 ? I believe compared to our 3500 ) , the 17 is certainly NOT relegated to 10,000 feet long " AMC hubs " as you might be led to believe ( that 's more of a KC-10/135 and C-5 thing ) . Yes , the 130 is more tac air , but that 's only due to it 's nature of being smaller . I suppose I could argue the CASA-235 is more tactical than the 130 . The 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is some crossflow especially between the 17 and the 130J . <p> 130 - You 'll find yourself in more varied locations in the AOR . You just might deploy TO the AOR . You 'll be trained in airdrop ; you will be a tactical airlifter . You 'll deploy a lot . <p> 17 - You 'll deploy to the stages for 120 around every 2 years . You 'll fly tactical then , but while at home flying missions you 'll be more strat . If you get a slot , you 'll be trained in airdrop . You 'll air refuel . <p> I certainly respect the 130 and it 's many variants . I wish we had an AC/MC17 . <p> Good luck with your choice and avoiding a UAV . If you go for the 17 and want the airdrop training , try to get CHS , TCM , HIK , or Elmo. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest C-21 Pilot <p> Regardless , here 's my $.02 ... and from a C-17 perspective . My only C-130 experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep the comparisons simple since I do n't claim an expert on the Herk . <p> Tac Airlift vs . Strat Airlift .... this is and has always been a in ridicuous argument . While we do not go to every little LZ in the theater , we do go to every little LZ in theater . Get it . If the airlift requirement to LZ " X " was 60K , you guys would n't be used . However , for the amount of airlift you guys do - it 's suitable for the situation . Bottom line , the C-17 is DEFINATELY more Strategic Airlift ( moving big shit numbers into theater ) than Tac lift ( moving small shit numbers ) around theater .... however , do n't get all spun up around the fact of the word " TACTICAL " .... such as Tactical Flying , because we ALL do that . <p> We can pop in at 502100 lbs and stop 3500 ' - Take off in about 3000 ' . We can airdrop up to 110000K . We have a continious 1A1 alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have inter-theater medical alerts , the list goes on and on ... <p> 1 . ) Airdrop . Been there , done that . OEF drops on our last deployment . I do acknowledge the fact that the C-130 is the work whore of the OEF AD mission , you guys are extremely limited in that capacity . On our 11 Sept 2007 drop , we pushed 38 CDS over 5 DZ ... 2 were " hot " . You guys do the same of course , just not the amount per pass capability . <p> 2 . ) Money . It 's all coming to the C-17 and C-130J model . Period . <p> 3 . ) Location . Per capita , you can not beat the C-17 locations . Try . <p> 4 . ) Deployment . Shit , I 'm glad that after 10 days I 'm home w/ my wife . However , I 've also been gone 310 out of the past 365 , or that 's what PEX shows . <p> There are plenty of threads comparing and contrasting airframes . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you do n't have a swingin dick to compare . I think the C-17 is a great assignment . You think the C-130 is great . Perfect . <p> Anyone want to compare and contrast .... I 'm 3 inches off of the floor in a pushup position . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> C-5 airdrop mission was discontinued . They used to have a SOLL group out of Dover ... <p> C-21 and Pirate , great replies . Only thing I 'd add is that while the C-17 does go to quite a few of the smaller off-the-beaten-path places like the Herk ( I 've got my dirt qual too ) , it just does n't stay the night there like the Herk does . It 's not always back to a 5-star place though , if you want that w/ ' defined AMC enroute network ' go C-5/KC-10 . No argument that the Herks are doing the majority of the BFE stuff , but it 's not like they have an exclusive monopoly on it either . <p> Native , if it is n't obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through life with a ginormous chip on your shoulder . This ' tac v strat ' bullshit that 's been going on forever and ever is fvcking pathetic . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just like someone said above , you really need to consider location .... at least that 's what I did . You need to analyze your own way of life and the fact that C130 locations suck , that 's no problem b/c you 'll be deployed all the time anyway . Doing the " cool " tactical crazy flying is fun , but just like anything else , it gets old , and before you know it the main objective is to just not get Q3 'd ( for all UPT guys that means " hooking " a ride ... any ride , not only checks ) . I personally think there 's nothing wrong with flying from point A to point B using a stick and a HUD , traveling the world and seeing cool places . No matter what you fly you 'll see the AOR , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our new POTUS select , I think we 'll all have jobs as we " pull out of OIF ! " <p> Another thing to consider ( not sure about C130 manning ) , but the C17 manning status is about 113% with efforts to shrink that to 99% sending people to U28s and RC12s . Chucktown and other bases currently has copilots PCSing b/c there is a push to fill these new airframes . So expect less C17s to drop in UPT if they hav n't already . It may get to a point for a while where if you do n't  put if first you wo n't get it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I am a C-130 guy . I think C-130 's rock . I think Herks are better than Barney . I have a ginormous chip on my shoulder , BFD . Look , the fact of the matter is everybody is doing some cool shit over there . Right now , if you 're an airdrop guy in the -17 , you 're going to do some airdrops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Udeid in a 130 , you 're going to do some airdrops . Everybody else is just a glorified bus driver . Five years from now , who knows ? Have you heard anyone here bash their own airframe ? No . Everybody loves the horse they 're riding , so the lesson here is this : learn as much as you can about all of your choices , pick one , and I 'm betting you wo n't look back . <p> We can pop in at 502100 lbs and stop 3500 ' - Take off in about 3000 ' . We can airdrop up to 110000K . We have a continious 1A1 alert backing up the POTUS and JCS . We have Antartica . We have inter-theater medical alerts , the list goes on and on ... <p> When the hell was the last time this happened ? It simply is n't needed more than once a year , maybe .

Lots of good info above as well as in the prior ops IPs , in your squadron . <p> From my point of view , it seems like you can go everywhere from the herk but it difficult to get into the herk from somewhere else . If you want a lot of options after your first assignment ( NSA , AFSOC , crossflow , etc ) go for the herk . The Air Force is always in need of good prop and rudder pilots , even if it 's not always advertised that way . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a C-130H1 guy , and as you can see , alot of C-130 guys have a chip on their shoulder . <p> Here are some of my thoughts ..... <p> The Airplanes ( Cargo models only ) : <p> - The legacy C-130 : Was mostly designed in the 50s ... produced in the 70s ( except for the engines and some other upgrades which were designed in the 70s ) ... There 's alot lacking in the plane for " human factors design " . It 's slow , low , and does n't refuel ( which is both good and bad ) . It has 4 people up front ... ( which is good or bad depending on the situation ) . It has props , which have many more moving parts and is more complicated .... I 'm not convinced it 's better for short field landings , though ... after the design of the " blown flaps " or whatever the C-17 has . The C-130 fleet , as a whole , are like frankensteins ... we have C-130Es , H1 , H2s , H2.5s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qual for each model ) then there 's the other variants of the herk ... ACs , ECs , HCs , LCs , MCs , WC - 130s .... and variants inside each vairant ( if that makes any sense ) . <p> - The C-17 : Was designed in the late 80s/early 90s . Was designed after " human factors engineering " . It can fly high , fast , and is air refulable ( which is both good and bad ) . When I flew the C-130AMP sim , my SA was 10x greater than the legacy C-130s , I imagine your SA is just as much in the C-17. 95% of what the " slick " C-130s can do , the C-17 can do better ( I know this sentence will cause controversy on this message board , but even as a herk guy , I believe it ) .... the only problem is , most C-17 crews are focused on Strat airlift ( as mentioned earlier ) , so most aircrews do n't take advantage of their toy ( because they do n't have the **27;1028;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about , because I do n't know it . But since this aircraft was designed in a later era , I believe the airplane can do almost everything better than the legacy C-130 airplane .... I just do n't think many C-17 crews are trained to do the types of missions/flying every C-130 crew does . <p> The Mission : <p> - The C-130 : Absolutely awesome or absolutely terrible .... it just depends . 4 months on 4 months off to a medium security prison ( you 'll know what I mean when you 've visited the Deid , or some other OIF bases ) .... well , it gets tiring fast . Most of the stuff in Iraq ... at least the times I was there , was n't very " C-130 specific " .... there were large built up runways/airfields . I do n't really know what it was like in 2003 , but I 've heard stories ... the herk was needed then . I 've never been to Afghanistan or much of Africa so I ca n't tell you much about that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know cause I 've never been ) . I 'm beginning to experience an overseas base , which absolutely rocks .... great off station missions , great exotic locations , great people ... pretty much great everything . Right now , I love my job . At my previous stateside C-130 base ... not so much . Of course , this is all very short sighted .... we could be doing things completely different in different regions of the world in 4 years . <p> - The C-17 : I have no idea ... part of me thinks it 's 1 ) " gear up " then 7 seconds later 2 ) " auto pilot on " then 16 hours later 3 ) 1 ILS to a full stop 4 ) collect massive per diem and tax free for the month 5 ) complain about hotels/meals in some fancy location 6 ) repeat .... but I honestly have no idea . <p> The location : <p> - C-130s : some very good places , some not-so-good places <p> - C-17s : I ca n't think of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more info from everyone else , but that 's some of my perspective about the herk . I love the ( NON-OIF ) C-130 mission and it 's a good community . But I wish I flew a C-130J C-17 JCA newer aircraft ( but I 'm a minority , most legacy herk guys like the aircraft ) . I wish we had people on here that flew the legacy C-130s and also the C-17 ... I know they exist .... I 'd really like to hear their thoughts . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> - The C-17 : I have no idea ... part of me thinks it 's 1 ) " gear up " then 7 seconds later 2 ) " auto pilot on " then 16 hours later 3 ) 1 ILS to a full stop 4 ) collect massive per diem and tax free for the month 5 ) complain about hotels/meals in some fancy location 6 ) repeat .... but I honestly have no idea . <p> You forgot .. 7 ) Good looking and 8 ) hot girls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27697 @qwx437697 <p> I have n't flown the C-17 , but I have flown other airframes ( C-21 and UH-1 ) . Like everything else , there 's good and bad about an airplane . The legacy Herk guys that grew up in the airplane and know nothing else ca n't speak from an objective viewpoint about other aircraft . Likewise for C-17 guys that have n't flown anything else . Those people are probably absolutely convinced that there 's nothing better than what they are flying . For example , I 'm going to move on to the C-130J in the future , and I 've gotten plenty of comments about how the J sucks , people that fly the J are gay , it 's stupid to have an airplane without a navigator or engineer , and so on . But I realize that the people that say those comments have n't known any other type of flying , so flying a 3-person airplane with glass is absolutely foreign . To them , they see it as " doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane does n't do everything for you , it just provides you with more information . <p> I look at it this way .... these days , you wo n't find many crews that WANT to fly a non-TCAS bird ... TCAS provides a lot of info about the traffic situation around you . The J and C-17 are a lot like that in that the airplane provides incredible SA to the pilots , and it 's moved beyond 1940s technology that requires an individual person to throw each switch to get an engine started or configure the airplane . <p> If you 're having a hard time trying to decide what you want to do , look more at the mission rather than the airplane itself . If you want to do more strategic airlift ( cross oceans , travel the world ) then go C-17s . If you want to deploy to a location and support the user , go Herks . That would be about the best advice I have . <p> Locations-wise , the Herk has some so-so and not-so-good locations ... Dyess , Pope come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clovis ) , but not all that great either . Then we have some above average locations ... Little Rock is n't too bad . Cheyenne is good if you like the outdoors , but it 's not a huge town . Colorado Springs should stand up soon , and that 'll be a prime location , as are Germany and Yokota . <p> The C-17 community , hands-down , has the best locations of any AMC asset . Charleston , McChord , Dover , Travis , Hickam , Elmendorf and McGuire ... not all are dream locations ( McGuire , Dover ) , but at least they are an easy drive to some cool cities . So take that into consideration as well . Deployment-wise , you will be gone on deployment often in the Herk community ... not quite as often in the C-17 , although you will be on the road a lot . Having flown C-21s and gone on trips , I 'd rather be on a several-day TDY than on a 120-day deployment . That 's just me . And that 's my .02 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'll add this ... <p> If you ca n't hover , you 're queer . <p> Go helos , you 'll sleep better at night knowing that you are a superior pilot , better looking and over all a better human being than those stuck wing weirdos. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If you have doubts about your stick and rudder skills , PLEASE stay out of the herk . <p> I know that ai n't the PC thing to say , but I do n't care .

I think I 'm qualified to make that statement . As a seasoned IP , yeah you could do pretty well air refueling . Basic AC ? Forget about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The location itself or leadership ? Beats the crap out of Dyess/ Pope/ Little Rock IMHO , not to mention a number of other CONUS bases . <p> It 's a to each their own kind of thing . Within the C17 world , those two ( and Altus of course ) are probably the least popular . While McGuire currently has amusing leadership issues , many of us do n't like the locations .

Let 's just say , every day I find something else to love about my plane . 
@@43194765 @3194765/ <h> UTA/Drill Weekend info <h> 41 posts in this topic <h> Guest CAVEMAN <p> I have had close calls on my way back from drill and I just said I was not going to be doing that stuff anymore . Trust me , getting off drill on Sunday night and heading into traffic either from people coming back into town or people going to watch the games at the stadium . I really think 2 hours is pushing it . Not only that , you start work on Monday morning . Actually by law , you are suppose to get a day off but who really wants to take a day off . It just means you will spend 2 extra hours everyday at work to make it up for the one day you got off . So for those that do not get paid proportionally for the hours they work , you might be talking of 14 hour days . <p> But that is SERVICE ; the life of a Guardsman . So who gives the AD guys the audacity to call you a WEEKEND WARRIOR ! Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cave <p> During the summer months , I have a 5.5 hour drive to drill . Let me tell you , when you get off duty at 5 PM Sunday night , and are facing a 5.5 hour drive home , it 's not pleasant . Plus , you have to consider that you may get back to base even later from a TDY or annual tour . ( For example , I 'm gettting back to base from my AT at 9 PM , and have my 5.5 hour drive to face . ) Is moving an impossibility ? <p> The 152 flight would be a lot of fun to do , but as my airline pilot dad says , " When you got ta get there ... drive .

' 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> No . If you do n't attend drill , your UTA pay period becomes a RUTA ( Rescheduled Unit Training Assembly ) . With the concurrence of your commander , you can schedule them whenever you like before the end of the fiscal year . <p> However , I attend drill , but burn my Ground AFTPs instead of UTAs . Grounders are good for ground duty only and expire quarterly . UTAs expire at the end of the year and can be used for flying or ground duties . It let 's me fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437700 <p> Caveat : What Unit 's can do versus what they are willing to do or usually do differs , check with your Unit folks for local policies . <p> Normally for the reserves , your UTA 's start the day you are gained if you come in off the street or from active duty . So if you come in halfway through the year you have half left . Also once a UTA is passed you ca n't reach back for it . So if you are going on orders that cover a UTA make sure to reschedule them prior to the UTA date sometime into the future or you 'll be counted constructively present and not be able to use it later . AFTP 's you still can theoretically do all 48 as long as you do n't exceed 16 per quarter . So of you come in the third quarter you have 32 available for the rest of the FY . Different Unit CC 's have different policies regarding UTA reschedules and I have had one that would n't let you reschedule a UTA if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen . Most want you to have max availability so they 'll punt your UTA 's forward . Especially with today 's lack of RPA funding they 're screwing themselves by not letting you do so . But its up to you to make sure it gets done cause once that original UTA date goes by , there needs to be a 40A in the system or it goes bye bye . Also some unit 's have mandatory UTA 's , a couple a year that you ca n't reschedule and are for big max training events like water survival or block training . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Oh the joys of mastering the ANG pay system . Some of our old part-timers ( especially the airline pilots ) are true jedi knights at maximizing pay days and are usually the best to ask . <p> Per Year : <p> 48 UTA <p> 48 AFTP ( Ground/AIR ) <p> *AFTPs are divided into Quarters . <p> *Max of 16 AFTPs/quarter <p> *Max of 6 Ground AFTPs/quarter ( 12/year ) <p> - UTAs are the most flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can be used for flying or ground . They do not need to be used on drill weekend . As gearpig said , burn a ground AFTP if you do n't fly . If I do fly , I burn a flying AFTP to save my UTAs . <p> - AFTPs can only be used in it 's individual quarter ( it 's true ... if you do n't use it , you lose it ) . <p> - Things can get interesting if you are on and off orders . If you 're on an AGR order for a particular month , you can not use your UTAs that month . I 'm not sure of all of the specifics as they change based on what type of order it is . All I know , is if I know i 'm going on orders for a month ( usually not AGR ) , I will burn that months UTAs PRIOR to going on the orders . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> AFI 2234V1 has them in the IDT chapter . They 're administrative TP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but OPR 's awards n decs and UTA prep . Some DO and CC 's keep them as a slush fund and do n't really mention them to anyone . That 's what they use for pre UTA meetings a lot of the time . Do n't know if it 's a Guard thing , you would have to check your training reg if it 's different than AFI 2254V1 . They are 4 hour blocks and pay like a Ground TP . Nice thing is if there 's RMP money you get them in addition to your other TP 's , up to 24 per FY.

UCR is 50% ( the big chunk ) GPA is 15 , the PFT is 10 and Filed trianing is 10 as of now . Last year I heard the lower end cutoff for pilot was almost an 83 OM which is about 10 points higher than it was in the previous years . If you are before FY-05 then it is conceivable to have a much lower PCSM and just be good in the other things and still make it fine . As of last year , if you did n't  have an above average PCSM , you would probably need to be like 1 or 2 in your class wth a very very good GPA , SP or DG in field training .. you get the picture . Those 15 points can or break you more easily now . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If your PCSM blows and you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit .

I did n't realize that the guard put such an empashis on it . I 'm an FY05 ROTC guy myself obviously , and I 'm pretty sure the other categories saved me from my PCSM score being low . Thanks for the info that was pretty helpful ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Has anyone had their PCSM dropped due to their retaking of the AFOQT ? I 'm trying to decide whether or not to retake the AFOQT . My fear is that if I do worse on the new AFOQT my PCSM will drop dramatically . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yeah , on one hand , I would n't f*ck w/ your stuff ... 97 PCSM is obviously practically perfect . I would 100% stay w/ that , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much harder at actual AFOQT scores ( instead of like us where it does n't matter as long as your PCSM ends up good ) .

Is that true ? I took the BAT this morning , got my score back , and the score listed at the top as my PCSM score is less than that listed if I were to have 41-60 hours . Does the board look at all the scores , and take the 40 hours score into account , or only look at the actual PCSM listed at the top ? Do they really factor in the 40 hours , or is that simply wishful thinking ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest priorAF <p> Ther is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Initial Flight Training . I am fairly sure the board looks at your actual PCSM score . YOu have to remember that someone with the actual 40 hrs would probably get the slot over someone with none-- with all factors even . <h> Guest Murdoc 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest WannabeLT <p> No way to tell for sure , because no one knows the exact formula to the PCSM . With that being said , once you have taken the AFOQT and BAT , you will be able to check your score online . The score sheet has a chart that shows how additional flight hours will change your PCSM score . For instance , I have a 98 PCSM and between 41-60 flight hours . My chart shows me jumping to a 99 if I reach the next category of flight time ( 61-80 flight hours ) . I 'm probably a bad example , so I 'm sure others will chime in the clear things up . Hope I helped you a little . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest USMCBill <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she 'd some light . I understand that a portion of this score accounts for prior flying experience . I have a my ppl with just under 50 hours , but I 'm also a CH-53 aircrew member with several hundred hours of flight time . We enlisted aircrew also have log books like our pilots . Would I be able to add this time to my score ? The Randolf website states this portion simply measures experience and I would think mine would cout . Any info will be greatly appriciated. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest waxgoblin <p> When I start flying at school , I think I am in a flight class of me , another student , and the instructor .

Could be considered a straw purchase . It 's a felony . <p> You can find used CZ-75s , which are 9mm for under $400 if you look around . If you just want to put holes in paper and are new to firearms , S&amp;W .38 revolvers are a good place to start and within your budget . <p> Remember , caliber does n't really matter if you ca n't hit your target .

( not trying to be a dick , but for some reason it irked me and since it was a repeaded thing not just a 1x typo I figured I 'd let you know ) <p> As for roles , it really does vary and you are better off asking about specific aircraft because it would be a PITA to try to list them all out , especially when you will learn all this at Pcola anyway , but I will address your examples plus aircraft I have personal experience with . <p> F-15E ( and only the E ) has a WSO , his job is weapons and navigation mostly . ( maybe a mudhen guy can chime in with better details ) <p> AC-130H and AC-130U have 3 CSO 's : a Nav , an EWO , and a Fire Control Officer ( you start as a nav or EWO and upgrade to FCO ) ... Navs navigate , EWO 's protect the plane , and the FCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spooky guy can chime in with details ) <p> the AC-130W is a whole separate animal and I am unsure what is involved . <p> now for what I had experience with : <p> The C-130H has a Nav , who runs the radar , does navigation , directs airdrops , directs Airborne Radar Approaches ( ARA 's ) which are approaches where the Nav basically finds the field on radar and directs the pilots in , operates defensive systems , and operates some other systems for things like flying in formation and such <p> on the HC-130P the nav does all that but with a few differences and additions , on the HC-130P the nav directs low level flights via radar predominately ( vs. visual on the C-130H ) , the nav directs rendezvous with the Helo 's for helo air to air refueling ( by finding the helo 's on the radar and guiding pilots in ) , and we do Self contained approaches ( SCA 's ) instead of ARA 's ( basically lower mins , and a different flight profile . We also have control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IR and TV cameras which help with searches and other things . Other than that its the same except we just use different tactics tailored to the different mission . <p> On the new HC-130J we are actually called CSO 's and the systems change , the plane does more of the navigation stuff , but ... the CSO also does comm and operates the refueling panel for refueling the helo 's , and such , but I have not flown the J model yet and wo n't transition to the J until 2015 . <p> Edited August 17 , 2013 by bronxbomber252 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> B-52Hs have 3 CSOs ... An EWO who defends the jet , a navigator who navigates , and a radar navigator who manages and delivers the weapons . Prior to 2008/9 , navigators would return to the schoolhouse for radar nav upgrade after ( if I recall correctly ) at least 400 hours . Since then , new navigators have graduated the schoolhouse qualified in both the nav and RN crew positions , but until you are signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local workbook ) you can only carry/employ weapons when supervised by an instructor or someone who is " Experienced . " ( In other words , what used to be a formal course has been replaced by a local upgrade with a lengthy radar nav " internship " ... There are advantages and disadvantages to both ways of doing things--to my mind , more disadvantages to the new way--but it saves TDY funds so I doubt it will change soon . ) <p> E-3B/C/Gs have 1 CSO ... A navigator who navigates . There is a glass cockpit upgrade called " DRAGON " coming ( that 's for Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation ) that will get rid of the nav on the jets that receive the upgrade . Problem is , the upgrade is so far behind that the Air Force may be retiring E-3s before all of them are upgraded . The upshot of this is that if you drop E-3s , you have a good chance of not losing your seat for at least the dozen years or so until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue like the KC-135 navs I 've met that hit school/staff just before the Pacer CRAG upgrade came online ) , plus E-3 navs regularly crossflow to the E-8 Joint STARS and RC-135 , and less regularly to AFSOC ( gunship FCOs and U-28 CSOs ) , HC-130s , and EC-130Hs . Additionally , a small number of CSOs have performed the role of Electronic Combat Officer ( ECO , usually an ABM position ) on the jet over the years , and that could become a regular thing if the ACC nav mafia ( is there one anymore ? ) throws their weight around . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> B-1B 's have 2 WSOs ...... further broken down into OSO ( offensive system officer ) and DSO ( defensive system officer ) . OSO 's primary duty is weapons employment , sniper pod operation , navigation , and timing . The DSO 's role is to defend the jet against enemy threats such as SAM 's and AI 's . However , B-1 WSO 's are dual qualified and can fly in either seat . 27701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am about to be a senior ROTC cadet . I will be a CSO Lieutenant when I graduate in May . <p> Correction , you 'll be an LT and CSO candidate until the day you pin on wings . Do n't get ahead of yourself too much . <p> For instance , is the F-15 CSO a Nav , EWO , or WSO ? Are there multiple CSOs in certain aircrafts ? For example , is there a Nav and a WSO in an AC-130 . <p> F-15s have WSOs . There are multiple 12XX positions on several aircraft . AC-130H and U models have a Nav , an EWO , and a FCO , all of whom have 12XX wings . An AC-130W has a 1x Nav and 1x CSO , again , same wings . <p> If you could , please list some air frames and say what the CSOs role is for each . <p> Also , if you have any insights as to what the best aircrafts are , what are the most competitive , or any other insights , they would be greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the person . My personal pick is the U-28 but then again that 's the only one I 've flown so YMMV . <p> What makes you want AC-130s ? Think about that , talk to instructors who fly the aircraft you think you want once you get to nav school , do as well as you can , and when it comes to making your dream sheet determine what mission you want to do and put that #1 . After that bloom where you 're planted even if you do n't get your first choice . <p> Oh yeah and I think someday I want to transition to pilot ( preferably cargo . ) I hear there is a pilot shortage that 's going to only get worse in the coming years . Are any of you familiar with the process of transitioning to pilot and how competitive it is ( or will be ? ) <p> If being a pilot someday is your goal keep that in mind but work hard to earn your CSO wing and then be the best CSO you can possibly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rack and stack and have a good reputation among the people in your squadron , doors will open themselves with a little luck and timing .

After all they deal with the officers on a daily basis , and certainly have their own ideas concerning what makes a good AF officer/pilot .

I made about 40 of each letter for all my packets . Second , it does n't matter if you get more than one letter from a politician . I had one from my state Governor and one from my state Representative . None of the units cared , they just wanted to know my connection with both of them . Whatever you do , make sure you get some kick a@#@ letters and at least five or six of them . If you 've got any more questions pm me and I 'll help you all I can . Good luck ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest BLEEDS ON <p> Words of caution , make sure the politician actually KNOWS you and can testify to your character . Otherwise the rec. means nothing . However it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue people in office . Your best bet is to ask several people for recommendations and then pick your top two or three . Although I did n't do this , some people will have YOU write the recommendation and they 'll review it and put their letterhead and Herbie Hancock on it . Bottom line , make sure they can testify to your character , it 's likely that they 'll get called if you 're considered for selection . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks much for both of your replies . BlEEDS ON , I do n't think I would get to meet one on one with any of the politicians for them to actualy know me or testify to my character . All these politicians have public relations staff and so on who take care of requests for LORs on a case by case basis never actualy giving me the chance to meet let 's say my congressman . Do you think it would be just as equal to have that congressman 's office worker who might write the letter to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else who might have a few words to share on this topic . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest flecth033 <p> It would not be equal to the congressman 's office worker to testify for your character because they are not the congressman . Some staff people are interns ( I know this because I was one ) and do n't hold any clout . If you can get one from the congressman then get one and have them personally recommend you . Like Bleeds said make sure they know you . It would be best for them to sit down and interview you in order to write the best recommendation . If the question comes up on how they know you , you want to be able to have something to say instead of your parents know them , or you called into the office to get one . They want letters from people you know or have interviewed you . You might be able to get away with one LOR from someone to who does n't know you but if you have many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest jkfaust <p> I 'm an OTS applicant and I just got back my last letter of recommendation .

I had read a post on another forum where someone else had asked about a specific AFI or AFR that addresses this and there does n't appear to be one so I was just wondering if anyone else had come across it . There IS an item in the ROTC customs and courtesies that read something like " Public display of affection while in uniform , except in the context of a military social event like the Military Ball , is not allowed . This includes kissing , holding hands , and all other forms of physical affection . " But I can not fathom this is what this person was actually attempting to enforce .

Chances are that most of the time you are hanging out with these people , they were in Flight suites . While there are rules and regs about PDA in flight suites , when you are a flight suite , it 's pretty lax . Plus , chances are you might have been at the club or squadron bar or something along those lines where it was n't " formal-ish " <p> Now , if he was in blues , chances are he was in a more " formal-ish " setting , and that 's why you get " yelled " at . I do n't think the major had any right to yell at YOU , he/she should have taken your husband aside and said something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has " different " personallities in each uniform . If he 's in blues , he 's very rigid , by the book , and no touching at all . If he 's in his BDU 's , he 's the same , only he 'll give me a hug if we are parting ways or something , but he will not hold my hand or anything . Now , if he is in his Flight suite ...

Somoene with a Nav slot that was qualified for a Pilot slot and did n't get one , in my opinion , has a lot more to be pissed about than someone who GOT a Pilot slot but did n't get ENJJPT . Nothing against **25;1086;TOOLONG ( or any other type of Navs I left off ! ) , but at least with a Pilot slot , you know you have the opportunity to fly . <p> I 'm just trying to help you see the bigger picture and keep you from spreading any bad karma around , man . Good luck at UPT when you get there , and good luck on getting ENJJPT . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone is dead set on a fighter , then there is a BIG difference between Euro-NATO and SUPT . Fighter selection is 85% v 30% . Also , when all the competitive applicants are so close , then every little bit helps - even 5 points on the PFT . <p> Everything is done on a standard distribution . So if there are 100 applicants , and the average PFT score is 90/100 with a standard deviation of 4 points , then a difference of 5 points could mean 2-3/10 points for the PFT percentage ( 10% ) . <p> Since the PFT counts 10% , two or three points in the order of merit ( out of a hundred ) could mean a score of 92/100 becomes a 94/100 or a 95/100 . If the Euro-NATO cutoff is in that realm , then his 5 PFT points matter a great deal . <p> In all honesty , with a 99 PCSM , I think you will get the Euro-NATO slot anyway .

" Police can make copies for official purposes . " <p> So I would say state agencies are OK . <p> If you read their FAQ you can also send in an LES : <p> " You may submit a copy of your Military/Government I 'd or a copy of your pay stub ( please feel free to black out any unnecessary information . We just need to see your name and who you work for ) .

My license yes , but not my CAC . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> To prevent identity theft and protect information from being used by individuals impersonating U.S. military personnel , TRICARE beneficiaries are instructed as a general rule not to lose or allow others to use their CACs or I 'd cards . <p> However , it is legal and advisable for providers to copy CACs and I 'd cards for specific authorized purposes , which may include : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cashing checks <p> Administering other military-related benefits <p> Verifying TRICARE eligibility <p> The DoD recommends that providers retain photocopies of both sides of CACs and I 'd cards for future reference . <p> *Title 18 , United States Code , Section 701 prohibits photographing or possessing uniformed services I 'd cards in an unauthorized manner . Unauthorized use exists only if the bearer uses the card in a manner that would enable him or her to obtain benefits , privileges , or access to which he or she is not entitled . <p> The US Army North Provost Marshal advises that photocopying of military I 'd is a violation of federal law. ( 1 ) The photocopying of U.S. Government identification cards is a violation of Title 18 , U.S. Code Part I , Chapter 33 , Section 701 and punishable by fine and imprisonment . <p> Military I 'd also contains the complete Social Security Number ( SSN ) of the service member . Military personnel should avoid using their military identification for other than military purposes . It is especially important that military personnel avoid presenting their military I 'd in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your SSN and credit card information during a retail transaction increases the likelihood that you will become the victim of identity theft ! Furthermore , any requirement for you to show I 'd as a condition of making a credit card purchase is a violation of policy , and may be a violation of state law . <p> The major credit card companies advise that it is a violation of the terms of their contract with merchants for any merchant to require that you present I 'd as a condition of making a credit card purchase . Mastercard , for example , wants cardholders to report merchant violations , and provides a web-site for doing so at : http : //www.mastercar ... violations.html <p> Some businesses claim that asking you for I 'd as part of a credit card transaction helps to protect you against fraudulent use of your credit card . This is not true . Consider the facts that Mastercard and Visa are multi-billion-dollar , international , companies and that they spend millions of dollars to fight credit card fraud . If presenting I 'd made you safer in a credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended , by the major credit card companies . As we have seen however , just the opposite is true . Presenting I 'd during a credit card transaction puts you at risk , and thus the credit card companies prohibit merchants from requiring that you present I 'd as a condition of making a purchase with your credit card . <p> Unfortunately , not all merchants play by the rules . Some , apparently , have n't even bothered to read them ! <p> The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse(2) quotes from the Mastercard and Visa rules manuals , which state : Mastercard - " A Merchant must not refuse to complete a Transaction solely because a Cardholder ... refuses to provide additional identification information ... " Visa - " A Merchant must not require a Cardholder , to provide any supplementary Cardholder information as a condition for honoring a Visa Card or Visa Electron Card ... " <p> Some people believe that writing " See I 'd " or a similar notation on the signature panel of their credit cards ( and thus requiring merchants to check their I 'd ) helps to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , providing the additional information contained on your I 'd during the course of a retail credit card transaction actually increases the likelihood of you being targeted for identity theft . According to Creditcards.Com(3) " when a merchant sees " See I 'd " on the back of a card instead of a signature , that card should not be processed . " Both Visa and Mastercard have a zero liability policy when it comes to fraudulent use of your card . Visa says : " Visa 's Zero Liability policy is our guarantee that you wo n't be held responsible for fraudulent charges made with your card or account information . " Likewise Matsercard 's policy states : <p> " Zero liability applies to purchases made in the store , over the telephone or made online . As a MasterCard cardholder you will not be responsible in the event of unauthorized purchases provided that the following preconditions are met : Your account is in good standing . You have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from any unauthorized use ... " <p> It is important to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unauthorized use " will certainly include complying with the terms of your contract with the credit card company ( all that fine print that comes with your new credit card ) . This means that to maintain your zero liability you should properly sign your credit cards , and that you should refuse to provided additional identification during retail credit card transactions . <p> Finally , a few things to remember that will help to protect you against fraud and identity theft : <p> - Do not use your military I 'd for other than military purposes . <p> - Never allow anyone to make a copy of your military I 'd - it 's illegal to do so . <p> - Avoid showing I 'd or providing additional identifying information during a credit card transaction - it puts you at risk . <p> - Properly sign all your credit cards . This helps you maintain zero liability in case they are stolen . <p> - If you find that your credit card has been lost or stolen , report it immediately to the issuer : 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the squadron ?

That is a huge reason why I dropped my pilot application with the Marines and am looking at the more family-friendly Air Force . <p> I think those four sum it up for now . Based on your answers I may have some follow-up questions later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot , flew KC-135s and MC-12s formerly , take my advice for what you will . <p> 1 . UAV training is shorter than pilot training , but not by too much ( I ca n't speak for Global Hawks ) . Use the search function . Length of training should not drive this decision . All of the UPT locations suck , as does Alamogordo where MQ-1 and MQ-9 IQT takes place . Call that a wash . You can wash out of both , so bring your A game wherever you go . <p> 2 . Expect going the UAV-direct route to close the door to flying manned aircraft . The majority of UAV pilots right now are guys forced into UAVs sometime at after graduating UPT . The vast majority of them want to return to flying manned aircraft . All of them would be in line in front of you . Retention and morale are grievous issues in this community , which is why the 18X career field exists . However , those few people in this community who are happy are the ones who chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . Your family situation , your call . Understand that just because you are n't on the road does n't mean you will be at home . 60-80 hour weeks are normal . <p> 3 . There are several active duty bases for 1s and 9s : Off the top of my head : Creech , Cannon , Holloman ( FTU ) , Ellsworth ( 9s only ) and Whiteman ( 1s only ) . Global Hawks are Grand Forks and Beale , IIRC . There are also Guard/Reserve units in various locations . Google works for you as well as it works for me , so I 'll let you figure it out from here . <p> 4 . This is what you should probably give the most consideration . The USAF is more family friendly than the USMC , but this is a difference in degree , not in kind . On base housing is nicer , that 's about it . You are a number on a spreadsheet somewhere and Big Blue gives exactly zero fucks about your family . The military is the military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at counterinsurgency " ) , so expect that shit to be your priority . You can expect to deploy . Reread the first five words of this post . Also , the LRE trends young for two reasons . First , as a brand new Lt in a flying squadron , you 're at the front of the line for any task the Capts and Majs in your squadron would prefer not to do . Most of them have deployed already , so guess what you 're going to do . Second , instructors are in short supply ( ref that sentence about retention and morale ) , so they ca n't be spared for the LRE since so many noobs need training . Relocating is a wash . You can moved with next to no-notice in any community . Finally , I 'll be blunt here : your wife does n't seem like she 'll be happy as a military wife . If she is n't happy , you probably wo n't be either . You know her better than anyone , so again , your call . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent advice . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 2 . Do n't expect to leave for something where your seat moves . You could get a teaching slot at Randolph or a ALO tour , but the rest of your time will be spent flying the line . I will " 2 " guineapigfury . Just because you are " home " does n't mean you are at home , even more so if your wife works . When I am on swings ( 1600-0000 ) I rarely see my spouse unless it is her or my weekend . Also mids sucks . <p> 3 . I believe every base but Creech has on base housing . I know of one person who does n't commute the 30-45 minutes from Las Vegas by living in Indian Springs , but I would n't suggest it . So just plan on adding 1-1.5 hours to your day , every day . <p> 4 . It use to be that if you were at Creech you could expect to stay there for 4+ years . But now with bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCS cycle and move every 3-4 years . I 've been at Creech for 3 years and have done two 120 day LR deployments . I would expect the deployments to extend to 6 months sometime in the future ; to get in line with the rest of the AF . If you are n't stationed at Creech expect a 1.5 month TDY to train , which just adds to your time away from family . <p> Bottom line : If your goal is to contribute to the war from CONUS , and not deploy as much as some other AFSCs , then sign up . If your goal is to not PCS and find a back door way into a real jet , the UAVs is not the way to go . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Gentlemen , good answers all , thank you . This is exactly what I was looking for . <p> Just a quick note : If I do go the RPA route , I 'm not looking to use it as a back door into real jets . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm fine with that . What I meant by my comment in #2 was , is there any real risk of being made into a mechanic ? An analyst ( though that would n't be too bad ) . That sort of thing . <p> I 'm surprised that the jet guys are deploying as little as they are , and that RPA are deploying as much as they are . Go figure , right ? <p> Over all , you gentlemen are probably right . Maybe because of my family situation the military is no longer the right choice for me . That may have become my reality when I said " I do " . If so , fine , I 'll just have to accept that . I guess I 'm just hoping to still find some way to serve our country . While I would prefer to do that in the military , I may need to start looking elsewhere . <p> Anyway , I 've been given lots of food for thought , and I 'm grateful for that . I still welcome any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just a quick note : If I do go the RPA route , I 'm not looking to use it as a back door into real jets . If I 'm going in , its as drone and I 'm fine with that . What I meant by my comment in #2 was , is there any real risk of being made into a mechanic ? An analyst ( though that would n't be too bad ) . That sort of thing . <p> I 'm surprised that the jet guys are deploying as little as they are , and that RPA are deploying as much as they are . Go figure , right ? <p> Specifically , not much chance of moving to another career field unless something happens like a medical DQ down the road . Not frequent , but it does happen . However , as one remains on the military there is a tendency to slowly move out of direct operations to management and weapons system support . For instance , you may become an 18X ( career RPA pilot ) and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after about 6-8 years , you may start sliding into staff positions at the Major Command and/or HQ AF level , or even into system support jobs at an AF Material Command Center . They are still RPA oriented , but could be in future system development jobs or acquisition-related jobs . If you do n't screw up , you may later trasition back to ops , but in a supervisory or command position . <p> As for the deployment issue , be careful about how you define the term . Most aviators interpret " deploy " as going overseas something like a 3 to 6 month tour to a forward location . However , many also go on shorter trips ( 10-15 days ) or so , come home for a few weeks and go again , repeating frequently as part of a normal job ... not a deployment , but sometimes adding to 150 or more days a year . The airlift community ( C-5 , C-17 , C-130 ) does this frequently , as do other non-rated people who support forward operations ( comm , CE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that you and your spouse need to talk about this . The military 's job is to deter and , if necessary , fight/support the fight . If your spouse ca n't understand and adapt to that , you 're both in for an uncomfortable life . You WILL be deploying , making temporary trips , moving every three years or so , perhaps taking a one-year remote ( un-accompanied ) tour , etc. because that 's the job you 're taking on . <p> Also , keep in mind that the way the AF operates now is largely driven by the wars in the middle east . Five ( even three ) years from now that wo n't necessarily be the case . Times change and the military reacts , and sometimes does n't get a vote ! ! <p> Edited July 29 , 2013 by HiFlyer <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Some RPA squadrons never deploy however you do n't get much say in what sq you end up in . <p> Keep in mind the 18X career field is so new that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past their first assignmet . There are a lot of unknowns in terms of career progression . The flying world standard of 2 ops tours then on to staff etc. may work but we do n't know . Manning is still a big issue so it is hard to see them pulling people out of op units . Also no one knows for sure how war drawbacks will change us and if we will start to feel the budget cuts like other flying units . <p> The way leadership is talking right now 90% of dudes assignments will be Creech , FTU instructor at Holloman , back to Creech . Replace Creech with w/e other base . Again , no one really knows because no one has made it that far . <p> If you are stationed at Creech you can live on Nellis housing . However that will add 30 min onto your drive . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have heard rumors that as a result of sequestration they would drop the requirement for guys with their PPL . Not sure where you would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone at AFPC that you sent your rated board application into or pilot assignments . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Q : ... When you talk to people in the RPA community , there 's a sense that once Afghanistan -- after the 2014 drawdown , there 's not gon na be the need for RPA pilots and sensor operators , so fewer Airmen are going to be taken from manned platforms and moved to RPAs . And they may even curtail the 18X career field . I 'm wondering if you could talk about whether there will be kind of a reduction in the RPA community following 2014 . <p> GEN . WELSH : The RPA career field is gon na change because RPAs are gon na change . We 're at the right flyer stage of RPAs right now , and over the next 50 years , it 's gon na look dramatically different than it does today . But the United States Air Force is gon na be in the middle of that change . We 're not walking away from remotely piloted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na go to 100 percent of our air frames being remotely piloted . And so we will slowly evolve over time into the missions best suited for RPAs . ... Eventually , this is gon na kind of explode on us nationally . And then it 's gon na get really exciting . <p> SEC . FANNING : And there 's no evidence from the combatant commanders that the demand for this is gon na decrease , even as we pull out of Afghanistan . Quite the opposite .

I put all the concern and questions on the back burner to try to get myself in order . For example , doing well in school , completing my education , setting up internships and studying for the nursing boards . At 19 or even in your 20 's you are better off taking the time and energy to invest in yourself than your boyfriend/girlfriend at that time . <p> We had been dating for 3 years when he left for nav training . Did we talk about me moving with him to follow him through months of training , many moves just to be together ? We sure did , but maybe I was just too practical at 22 . Was I going to miss him when he was at training ? Did I worry that we might grow apart if he was in TX and I in NY ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , move to the area of the country where i knew no one but my " boyfriend " . Did I want to give up health insurance a secure job , my friends and family to follow him around through training ? No We did the long distance thing ; it stunk but we managed to see each other every six weeks , racked up huge phone bills and got married 18 months later . <p> In those months , we BOTH accomplished many things professionally and grew to know each other , and more important , ourselves better . <p> This forum is a great way to learn about military life . Use the search functiona and read lots and lots of threads , if you feel you really need to . Personally , If I was 20 and in college again , I would have been too busy studying , working , writing resumes , having fun with my friends and with " Scooter " , than to be posting questions on a military aviation forum about military life . <p> You asked for advice and guidance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just 20 years old , finish your education first . Do not interrupt your education to move to be with him . Focus on making yourself the best person you can be . He should be doing the same . If he has the flying bug it will always be with him . There are alot of hurdles to be passed to get a pilot slot , so enjoy your time now with him now and work on your relationship so you wo n't have to worry about him " when he is gone all the guys " team up " to go to bars and have a bunch of good looking chicks around because they know they can get away with anything " . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AFwife62406 <p> I agree with Tankerwife , although I basically did exactly the opposite with what she 's suggesting . I met my husband while he was in his 5th year of college and I was in my 1st year of my 2nd bachelors degree . The plan was for him to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my nursing degree and then we 'd see where we were at the end of those 3 years and go from there . This was the plan almost exactly a year ago . In a matter of 1 week , I decided to quit school , cancel my student loans for the next year , quit my job , pack up all my stuff and move from Wisconsin to Florida to be with him . Have I regretted for one minute my decisions ? Nope , not at all . We got married last month and I am fairly certain we probably never would have gotten married if I had n't moved with him since we 'd only been dating for a month before he left for ASBC . However , I am 5 years older than you are , and I already had a bachelor 's degree to fall back on until I can finish my second one . <p> As far as them going out with the guys while they 're gone , in all honesty , I 'm not all that thrilled about that taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal person I have ever met in my entire life and I know for a fact that he would never do anything he thought would hurt me , no matter where he was or who he was with . It 's not the most pleasant thing to think about the man you love out ogling other women , but if you do n't trust him to not take action , you might want to rethink your relationship . Decent men are n't out trying to figure out what they can get away with . <p> Good luck . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Fuse <p> The main points I 've received from my experiences is that if you think you will be unhappy being commited to someone who you will not see for a length of time , you WILL be unhappy , and so will he . He will need %100 support from you . Easy to say , hard to do . My suggestion is to keep an open mind and research . You 've made a big step just posting on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how he feels . He is trying to do something great with his life . If he decides to do this , you have a few options . 1 . Be a part of it and focus on the great aspects of it . Make a life of your own where your stationed . 2 . Go with him and be depressed . This will drag him down as well . It will not only effect his life , but also his work . 3 . Leave him . Let him move on with his life and dream . <p> I 'm worried that when he is gone all the guys " team up " to go to bars and have a bunch of good looking chicks around because they know they can get away with anything . <p> This kind of throws up a red flag . As a few have mentioned , there is a close bond between these guys so there will definitly be some visits to the bar . If he is a good man ( and obviously he is if your with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be an issue . In the same breath I say that , I will also say I think it may be a common fear in military relationships . <p> I beleive military relationships have to be on a completely different level of trust , respect , and determination than a " regular " married couple . That 's why I 'm looking into ANG . <p> Good luck on both of your decisions . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Contrary to popular belief , some of us do have morals . I do n't  have to cruise for chicks and hump everything that moves , despite my natural instincts . Do I look ? I do n't  look , but I wo n't turn away either . Do I touch ? Hell no . Not worth my time . <p> I simply live in fear of my wife ! I have no doubt that straying would bring about the end of my marriage . She has told me that on several occasions and I have told her the same . In addition , shed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd be dead . So where does that get me ? All for a piece of a$$ that ' no one will ever know about ' ? Hell no , thank you ! <p> And let me tell you ... someone will ALWAYS know . Not only that , if people do n't  know , they will still talk ... people are people , even in the Air Force . They love gossip . My wife is stationed in Texas and I am in Washington . So far she has had 3 people ask her how the divorce was going because they 'd heard she was divorcing me . They have also asked her how some of her male doctor friends were in the sack because they ' heard ' they were sleeping together . <p> YGBSM if you think its only pilots that have the opportunity to shack up . My wife is more faithful than anyone I know . She shrugs off the idiocy of the masses because she knows I am faithful to her . <p> That 's what it comes down to . Is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , temptation is everywhere . Especially after a long day and a few drinks . That 's usually when the British Airways stewardesses show up wanting to talk to you and have a couple more . I 've always gone home alone . Its not that difficult . <p> AND , by choice , I am in a military relationship since my wife is in the USAF . So we are apart for over 10 months a year . On average , I see her every other month for about a week at a time . We still make it work . Its HARD work , but its so worth it . YOU will be in a situation where your husband will come home to you EVERY NIGHT , except when deployed . <p> YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY . <p> Good luck . Hope I do n't  sound preachy , but its all true , love it or hate it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> I 'm worried that when he is gone all the guys " team up " to go to bars and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get away with anything . <p> Do n't worry , he is young .

PW SNAPs do n't even go into the squadron bar and they find a way to jink out of most deployments . <p> Deployments are n't the problem for you 're relationship . You will have to watch out for the man chasing female pilots in the squadron .

I tried asking the whole deployment length for fighter pilots last week and did n't have any luck getting an answer . They said that what the deployment lengths are now are irrelevant to what they 'll be later on and you ca n't make your decisions based on that . <p> #1 What 's in it for you as a couple is kind of up to you as a couple to decide . A few months ago I was ALL worked up about my husband going to pilots training - thinking I would n't have any time with him , I 'd spend most of my time alone , while he 'd be off with the other trainee 's studying , or working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude about the whole thing . I finally figured out ( reading this board REALLY helped ) that I need to look at his training as something we 're BOTH going to complete . Yes , he 'll be the one flying and studying , but as his wife , it is my duty to help him out as much as I can so he can be successful . Whether that 's by taking care of all the home stuff , helping him study , cooking for him and his classmates , giving him his space to do what he needs to do - whatever - his success will partially depend on my attitude about the whole thing . <p> #2 I ca n't help you with at all . I have no clue . <p> #3 I was worried about this one too . It 's not easy moving away from all friends and family , and I 've not been part of a spouse group yet , but it 's really not that bad . You meet people where you normally would - in your neighborhood , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AF when we bought a car from them and we 've hung out quite a bit since then . Right now we 're part of a volleyball team that has nav and pilot LT 's on it . It 's all guys , but they 're really nice and do n't seem to have a problem with me being part of the team . <p> #4 Again , I have no experience with this , but from what I can tell it just depends with the deployments . Where will you live ? ..... lol . Honestly that 's impossible to predict . Probably near a military base somewhere in the world would be my guess , but since you do n't know what he 'll fly or anything , I do n't think anyone can answer that for you . On average , I think people move about every 3 years , but again , that 's not set in stone . We 're going to be moving 3-4 times in the next few years I think for his training . Military benefits can be looked up online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a year of a bachelors in nursing done also . ( I 'm not a nurse. ; ) .... yet . ) I 've found that finding a well paying job is tough . You 'll put the degree to use , but it is tough sometimes finding a job . I 'm running into the problem right now of not being in a place long enough to get a decent job . We 're going to be here about 8-9 months and then move again and live there for under a year I think and then move again . It 's hard to get employers to hire you and train you when you 're only going to be there for a half of a year or so . Not impossible , but it 's difficult . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> 1- what is in it for us as a couple , and ME myself , for him doing this job ? <p> A trophy husband . <p> Originally posted by molester : <p> 2- how often would he be away for the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a mistress .

They are n't fun , but , that 's something the your guy signed up for when signed the papers saying " I 'm going to join the USAF " . Deployments are what you make of them . If you live by the phone day in and day out , if you think " Oh , he has n't called me ... he must be at teh bar looking at other chicks .. " that 's going to be a long long long deployment . <p> 3- are you type A personality ? If you want friends , you will have them .. they are n't just gon na come to you .. well ..

I was gone at least a few days a week , sometimes a few weeks at a time , on flights . I hit the bars with the boys , had a good time . I even jumped on a grenade or two and danced with the friend of a chic that my single buddy was trying to work . But when when it came to closing time , I went home ... alone . I NEVER went out without my ring on , it was on display for all to see . My wife went out to bars with friends while I was gone . She got hit on , she accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . <p> Part of it may be that the two of us ca n't hide a guilty conscience for $hit , but its mostly just trust .

Most women I know do n't , but hey , that 's the job . I 'm not going to sit in my room when my planes broke for 3 days in Bermuda , I 'm going to have a good time ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Military aside , it seems like you have some huge trust issues . You need to either fix them , or stop thinking marriage is going to work .

Has he been selected for pilot training ? Realize that the first step is making it through pilot training . After that you can worry about some of that other stuff ! If he does n't go to Sheppard for UPT , getting the fighter track is not a given either . There are too many unknowns to speculate ... just take it one day at a time ! <p> I have been with my husband through UPT , IFF , RTU and several years of his operational life . The best advice I can give you is to keep an open mind , be flexible and have your own life . <p> Yes , no matter what airframe , they will be gone on deployments , and they will hang out with the boys at the squadron/bars . They need their " man time " . <p> Their hours can be long , and they will need time to study and prep . You will really appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how solid your relationship becomes when you 're dealing with issues from 6,000 miles away . <p> I really like his life , but have my own career and life , so that i 'm not living exclusively through his .

He told me that there was no such thing as having your own career and a GOOD military Family . <p> The best part of that convo was that Dave backed me up , and told me that he wanted me to have my career ( minus a few choice words we said about that mod ) . 27701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings up an awesome point , being a stay at home spouse is the best job ever , it is rewarding , the results are visible every day , anywhere the military moves you , you already have your career laid out ... the benefits are many . <p> My wife is a full time Mom , and neither one of us would do it any other way , I know to each their own ... I just ca n't see the other side if their are young kids in the house . <p> Oh yeah , she TOTALLY has her own life away from the squadron ... living her own life and doing her own thing , and supporting me .

@@43194800 @3194800/ <h> USAF , MEPS MEDICAL DQ / WAIVER QUESTION <h> 6 posts in this topic <p> I 'm an Air Force OTS Rated applicant with my package currently before the 15OT01 Review Board . We 're expecting results within the next 2 weeks , and due to my age , I 'm a priority for the next May BOT class . If selected , I would have to go to the May BOT class , or else I would be age disqualified . <p> During my medical screening paperwork I filled out last year , I admitted to having dislocated my left knee in 2005 when I was 19 years old . My recruiter told me this would require a waiver , so this summer I visited an orthopedic surgeon and had a full consult with X-Rays . He filed a report with my recruiter stating that there is no long-term damage from the injury , that my knee has full range of motion , and that it is 100% and would not pose any issue for military duty . My recruiter filed the paperwork and notified me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee . <p> She then scheduled me for a MEPS physical , before she had to transfer and I was assigned a new recruiter . On Thursday , I visited MEPS for my physical and I passed all the requirements , but during the medical consult with the head doctor , he Permanently DQ 'd me due to the paperwork stating I had had this knee dislocation in 2005 . He did not do an evaluation of the knee , nor did he send me out for an additional consult . <p> I called my recruiter and she was pretty surprised . She had though the orthopedic surgeon 's report and the waiver would have been sufficient , or at least that would have prompted the MEPS doctor to do an evaluation of send me our for another consult . Instead he DQ 'd me . I 'm now aware that according to DOD Instruction , any dislocation of the knee/shoulder ( 718.86 ) is disqualifying . However , what is the purpose of the Surgeon General 's waiver I received granting me permission to proceed with the MEPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look at the knee , send me out for a consult , or consider the orthopedic surgeon 's report ? <p> Further , now my recruiter is putting in another waiver request to the AF Surgeon General 's Officer seeking a final waiver on the knee that I assume would supersede the MEPS medical disqualification . Anyone have any insights on this process ? How long it would take ? Likelihood of acceptance ? <p> As mentioned , I 'm age critical and need to be ready to process in early May for BOT . I still need to have a Flight Class IA physical since I 'm a rated applicant , and that ca n't be scheduled until MEPS qualifies me . Am I out of luck here , or can these types of things be expedited ? My recruiter said she spoke with her commander and he 's pressing for this waiver to be a priority . I just do n't know whether that 's a realistic hope or not ... <p> Thanks for any input . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your terminology is a little mixed up ( and I 'm not a recruiter ) but I believe somebody at MEPS is confused . Continue to work with your recruiter , make sure you get a disposition from the CMO ( Chief Medical Officer ) , not merely the local doc . <p> At a guess , I believe you should 've brought a copy of the waiver approval with you to MEPS and attached it to your 2807 to force the doc to review it . This is n't your fault , but something you will learn ( if you have n't already ) is you often need to know other people 's jobs as well or better than they do to get what you need . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The waiver that my recruiter put in for was issued by the AF Surgeon General 's Office . She never shared a copy with me prior to her transfer , but she stated it covered my knee injury . So , heading to MEPS , the knee injury was n't really a concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam and other aspects that I could fail . That all went fine , but then the doc took a look at my medical history and simply DQ 'd me based on that . <p> So , now my recruiter has to put in for a new waiver . Do you know anything about this process ? Is this something that would likely take too much time for me to still be able to get a Flight Class 1A physical and get processed before May OTS ? <p> FYI , the initial waiver apparently was just a waiver clearing me to go to MEPS . <p> Apparently without this waiver , they would never have even been able to schedule my MEPS physical because the injury is technically disqualifying . The waiver was based on the orthopedic surgeons report stating my knee is fine and was meant to allow for MEPS to make a determination on the status of my knee . Unfortunately the MEPS doc did n't do any evaluation . He simply DQ 'd me . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You always needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force likely included the accession clearance , however that waiver is processed at MEPS in concert with multiple offices . Again , I think this is just a big disconnect at some clerical level . <p> I wish I had more information for you , but I focus on the application of medical standards within the AF , which you 've already done . These deeper administrative processes at MEPS and recruiting are a bit beyond my expertise , and a recruiter would have more answers , especially regarding the time frame . There are n't any recruiters ( so far as I know ) here on BO.net , so I might recommend you ask your question on afforums.com or PM one of the several recruiters there . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> @deaddebate - a few years ago I had a nice young kid get transferred in in to my place after being in an MVC - he was an Army NG Spec4 - he &amp; a couple buddies had just came back from Iraq and had an accident ( hit a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - was on the vent - had one of the worst liver injuries I 've ever seen in someone who lived - had bad ARDS , had to be prone positioned &amp; on APRV vent , got an emergency trache @ 3AM because he lost his airway , a couple of emergency angio 's , a couple of surgeries , etc .

I think the regs are fairly new too ( last fall ) so maybe it just has n't been discussed yet . I also put this is the spouse section because it seems like the place for family/housing questions , so if it would be more appropriate somewhere else please go ahead and move it ! <p> Anyway , I heard that the AF and Army both introduced some restrictions on what breeds of dogs you 're allowed to have if you live on base . So I looked up the latest AFI , here : <p> a . Residents may not board dogs of any breed ( including a mixed breed ) that are deemed " aggressive or potentially aggressive , " unless the dog is a certified military working dog that is being boarded by its handler/trainer or approval is obtained by the Installation Commander in writing .

But I 'll be at UPT next year if everything goes as planned , and from what I 've heard it 's usually advisable to live on base during UPT for the sake of convenience . <p> My concern is our dog is a boxer mix , and it 's fairly apparent from looking at him that he 's part pit bull . If I 'm interpreting the above paragraph right , they 're saying that any dog that 's even partially one of the listed breeds would not be allowed . Is that correct ? <p> Also , I 'm pretty sure all our registration paperwork for him says that his breed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to have him cleared to live on base ? <p> I just do n't want to be in a situation some day where we 're walking the dog on base or something and someone freaks out because they think they see an " illegal animal !

Just say he 's a boxer if anyone asks and do n't make a big deal out of it ... I think you 'll be fine . And just remember , you may not always have a choice of whether you can live off base or not . <p> Yeah , our dog is pretty chill so I ca n't really imagine someone having a problem with him . He 's good around little kids , other dogs , etc. so I 'm not too worried about his behavior causing any problems . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of people with every type of breed in that list and the dogs are great and not aggressive at all .

If the paperwork says " boxer " , then as far as the housing office knows , you have a boxer . End of story . <p> That 's pretty much what I was hoping would be the case . Luckily I think the rescue groups around here are clever enough that when they pick up dogs like this they seem to try and register them as anything but " pit bull , " in order to get the dogs out of situations like this in the future . <p> You can always go the " lab-mix " route , saw this pups twin on base yesterday ... pretty sure no one from housing saw the actual dog ! Not really sure how no one has freaked out yet . <p> Holy crap ! Yeah that dog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . If they can get away with that then I guess I should be good .

@@43194804 @3194804/ <h> PCS weigh-in <h> 36 posts in this topic <p> Searched the forum and google but ca n't find the answer to my question ... <p> We just PCS'ed to Pensacola and did a full DITY move . My wife drove my truck behind me and I drove a 26ft Penske truck with her car on a car trailer . I weighed my rig on the way down at a certified scale , etc with her car on the trailer ( 3 axles total ) . We are staying in a hotel so all of our stuff is still in the truck . Do I need to get the Penske truck weighed without the car trailer and her car on it or can I just have it weighed empty with her car on it and TMO does the difference in weight ? Seems logical but I do n't want to get hosed . <p> Hopefully someone knows the answer as I need to know ASAP . Thanks guys ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> When you started , you should have gotten the empty weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once it was loaded with all your crap and your wife 's car , there 's your full weight . I 'm not an expert so IDK what the regs say on transporting vehicles if that counts just as part of your total weight moved or what but to me , those are the weights you need to determine how much crap you hauled . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I just moved and what they had me do was weigh the Uhaul truck empty , with a full tank of gas ; then weigh the Uhaul truck packed ( a whopping 2500 lbs ) with a full tank of gas . The gentleman at the weigh station on base told me I could n't weigh with the car dolly or car attached . The gentleman at TMO also informed me that including a trailer/car is not allowed with the weighing . Also keep in mind that you will not be reimbursed for the rental of the trailer for your vehicle . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm not suggesting this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally optional ... I 'm just sayin ' ... <p> My gripe at the weight station was they made me take my dog out of the car because he was " moving around " and it threw off the measurement . I said BS , I hauled his heavy ass all the way across the country ! Anyways , GL man . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If you truly believe the full tank is optional ... someday you may have to ask yourself if that extra 100 lbs was worth it . <p> Worth what ? Lighten up francis . <p> I 'm not gon na purposefully not fill it up , but I 'm not making an extra stop at the gas station just to top it off . Same goes for when I weight it full , not gon na stop at the gas station with a truck full of my sh*t and pulling a car on a trailer .

" Anyone with half a brain can easily see that fully topped off is a theoretical max that you can never actually reach . However , what you were implying was completely dishonest . Am I going to stop for gas before weighing in empty if the needle is not on F ? Yes . Am I going to stop for gas after driving a few miles to pick up all my stuff and driving back to weigh in full ? No . Unless the needle has come off the F significantly . <p> Playing the gas game for a few extra cents per pound per mile is just as retarded as the guys who try to move bricks or cinder blocks with their DITY goods . If you 're " not going to suggest " but just tell people something illegal is " ok " you could screw someone over who did n't know better .

Not saying , but I 'm just saying . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It is nice though , if you own your own trailer , you get to count the total weight of the filled trailer for your weight . ( eg , I went and weighted my SUV all empty , then after I filled it with stuff , loaded up the trailer , then I weighed it all together . Paid for the trailer like 3xs over . <p> There are some other little restrictions on the size of said trailer ... but it sure did make it nice ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Sometimes I push buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are really ######ing stupid people who would use the excuse " but I read it on ... " to justify why they defrauded the government . To me , it is worth it to make sure I have a legit weigh-in once every three or so years ... to others it may not matter so much , but they should always be careful of what they imply and how the grade A morons of the world will see it . <p> Am I missing something here ? The OP needed an ASAP response to getting his PCS weights figured out and that 's what I offered up . The way I do it is both faster than constantly stopping at the gas station and , bonus , it ensures the government pays me *less* than what I would be due if I had filled up my tank just prior to weigh-in each time . <p> Like 3-holer said before , you 're gon na max gain like 200 lbs from trying to game the system so really there 's no point when I 'm hauling way more weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " implying .

I think for a partial DITY you would do just that , weigh full and empty .

My third axle ( trailer and car ) was something like 4,550 lbs . When unloaded , that axle weighed around 4,500 lbs . So unless finance ca n't do the math ( I would n't be surprised if they ca n't ) , I would not be asking for/getting any weight credit for the car or trailer . <p> Man , this would have been alot easier if I would have just done it the RIGHT way , huh ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I THINK with a partial DITY , you are allowed to carry up to 500 lbs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they ship it . Just what I 've heard . Might be wrong . <p> Any source for that ? After a quick scan through JFTR Ch 5 Part D , I could not find any limits as to any max weight limits for partial DITYs .

However , unless it has changed in the last three years , carrying 999 lbs of HHG will net you more money than carrying over 1,000 due to the way the incentives are set up . <p> Edit : You 'd have to look in the JFTR to see what , if any , the restrictions on multiple cars is , as I have yet to make a married move . You should also be able to get all this information from your TMO brief when you go in to set up your partial DITY . <p> Man , this would have been alot easier if I would have just done it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot easier if your support personnel had provided the appropriate level of support .

I know hating on public workers and private defense contractors big and small is the flavor du jour , but according to most of these civilians , this economic waste is more than justified ; an outright necessity for a lot of these communities . The alternative would be even more households working competing for service economy/Olive Garden wages .

I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an alternative that does n't otherwise involve private industry getting dragged kicked and screaming into a position where they 're forced to retrain the Country 's labor force , in order to gainfully employ the population in a capacity no longer deemed wasteful or politically twisted . <p> Despite the use of big words , this is some of the dumbest shit I 've ever heard . <p> In addition to it 's mission of providing security for the US of A , the military also has the mission of being one great big ' ol jobs program . <p> It 's arguable which mission the Pentagon has more focus on at any one time . If you look at how the Pentagon spends money ( inefficient , wasteful , etc ) , you 'd think they 're not getting their money 's worth , assuming you think the military 's only focus is providing security . <p> However , once you realize that the military 's mission is also to be a jobs program , then it looks like the Pentagon is actually spending money in a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , the more jobs that are created . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Despite the use of big words , this is some of the dumbest shit I 've ever heard . <p> How so ?

I think the success of our PGMs and LO assets have caused us to become too technology dependent and risk averse . Yes technology is great and we are able to execute missions while risking fewer lives , but we have n't fought a large scale conventional war against a determined foe since Vietnam . Yes , PGMs and newer technologies would have been a great help to us then , but if we had had them , the Vietnamese , most likely , would have also . At some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary with equal technology if we want to maintain the current status quo within the globe and will have to accept loss of large numbers of pilots and aircraft to win . Is it possible for us to develop weapons so expensive that our military leaders and civilian authority will be scared to employ them for fear of losing such high value equipment ? We lost about half of our F-105s in Vietnam . Imagine losing half of our F-35s/F-22s . I doubt we could afford to recapitalize and then where would we be in maintaining desired global status quo ? Personally , I think we should invest in some LO , but not solely LO . I think we need to invest in cheaper aircraft where we could buy more , perhaps many more . They would be more cost effective in operations similar to Iraq or Afghanistan and we would maintain a larger number of trained and proficient fighter pilots . One day we may have to rely on numbers and not just technology to accomplish a mission and we will have to accept losses . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have achieved success there without overwhelming numbers of young men willing to die . We may have to do the same in an air campaign some day . So , I believe it is in our national strategic interests to maintain a large fighter fleet , and fighter pilot force , to maintain a skilled defense/aircraft industry labor force , and to keep more than one company in the business of manufacturing fighter aircraft . We ca n't do it by buying only the F-35 , IMHO . A bit of a ramble .

Thanks 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You know roughly the length of 18x training is ? Also I know some guard guys have went to UPT . Is that decision up to unit or guard bereau ? <p> Thanks again <p> I believe it is 5 months , but I 'm not currently sitting at my desk for the solid answer . <p> We had 2 hired for 18x , was advised by NGB that they did n't fill all of their UPT slots ( do n't ask why , cause I do n't know ) , and were switched to UPT . I believe I heard last week that those 2 will now go 18x due to their packets not getting approved quickly enough to make it in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it looks like it is FY dependent . <p> BL is you will most likely know when applying and/or when interviewing if the position is UPT or 18x .

Most of the RPA UPT slots I know about are for locations where the OG also had RC-26 's . <p> There may be some opportunities for new hires to go to UPT if they do a stint with an ANG MC-12 unit and then return to their ANG RPA unit for permanent assignment .

Their unit is still sending folks though UPT . <p> What I 've heard : Most guard units are still sending their RPA Pilots through UPT . Supposedly you can get all the days you want bumming as an drone pilot . As far as an airline guy bypassing any pipeline training , you still skip IFS/IFT if you have a PPL .

@@43194807 @3194807/ <h> AFOQT details <h> 66 posts in this topic <h> Guest iloveflying333 <p> Well , I took the new AFOQT today for the first time and I 'm not too happy . I did n't really study for it , as this is the middle of my final exam week , but it was harder than I had thought . The only studying I did was 2 nights b4 the test . I looked over the math sections and got comfortable with the instrument comp . I also did a complete run-thru of the exam in the ARCO book and worked a little with the block counting and the tables section . I reviewed the hidden figures and rotated blocks a little , but just kinda figured I 'd take my chances since there did n't  seem much I could do to improve . I felt pretty confident on all the other sections . <p> Things went pretty similar to how I studied , which probably serves me right . I guessed a lot on the arithmetic , but i think i did OK on the general math knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very happy to see that the planes in the inst. comp were much easier to distinguish than those in the ARCO book , but I hope i did n't mess up since I was def. rushing to finish . The hidden figures were not nearly as " busy " as those in the ARCO book , and although I know i missed some , I felt I could see more on the test than I could when studying in the ARCO . Gen. science , Aviation info , and both english sections all went well and I found them to be easy . The aviation info . section is a joke if you have your PPL . A couple of the word definitions were in the ARCO book , so that was nice . I 'm most upset about the rotated blocks , block counting and the tables and graphs sections . I had to guess on a decent amount of the rotated blocks and I was only able to finish about half of the block counting section ( left the last page blank ) and 3/4 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the XY graphs . <p> As soon as I got home , I opened the ARCO and circled the math questions that had concepts in them that I thought had been covered on the test , so maybe I 'll be able study better next time . There was a lot of percentage/ratio questions and some decent algebra . Anyway , is my score going to be as messed up as I think it is from not finishing those few sections and probably butchering the arithmetic ? I 'm glad I finally took it and have an idea of what to expect , i 'm just annoyed about a few sections . The more I think about the test , the more I think I guessed wayy too much and just generally ######ed up . Anyone else feel this way after the test , but ended up doing ok ? Anyone else not finish a few sections ? At the end of the exam , I just christmas treed the answers i did n't get to by choosing random letters . Should I have just done one letter like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in answers ? I could n't decide , but in retrospect , I wish I 'd done one letter all the way down . 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest L Unit <p> a . It is properly edited . Read the reviews for guides , some of them are notorious for poor editing . <p> b . It contains examples of all the sections . My gripe with the current ARCO book is that it only contains 6 sections . I borrowed some older guides from friends in ROTC and although they were the old version of the test , they had all the sections . <p> 2 . As always , take the test when you are feeling well . It sucks if you have to wait another month because you are sick or got no sleep the night before , but since you can only take this test twice , seriously consider postponing it . <p> 3 . Eat some carbohydrates for dinner the night before and for breakfast . Your brain is fueled by glucose , and if you do n't have any readily available in your bloodstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean eat a cup of table sugar before the test , as you will probably burn out before it is over . Complex carbs , not simple ones ! Additionally , lay off the 12 cups of coffee . A SINGLE , 8 oz. cup of coffee has been shown to increase test scores . Anything more than that is detrimental . Seeing as how it 's difficult to get an 8 oz. cup these days , consider just waking up a little earlier , or taking a cold shower to wake you up . <p> 4 . I 'm not particularly good at arithmetic . I 've spent my college years doing calculus , leaving the little stuff for the calculator . I 'm horrible with my multiplication tables when it comes to the 6,7,8 columns . When I sat down at my test desk , before anything began , I wrote out a quick table on one of my scratch sheets . It turns out I only referenced it to check my work after I was finished with a problem , but I had it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may find a similar tactic works with other sections . Just make sure you do n't bring anything into the test room that is n't in your brain . <p> 5 . Section 4 there is really the example for figuring out what you are not the best at , and concentrating on studying that . I practiced the arithmetic and math knowledge sections 4-5 times over . Even though I had done the problems before , seeing them again made me recognize the TYPE of problem , and how to attack it . <p> 6 . Manage your time . You will probably be going as fast as possible anyways , and most of the sections you will finish with time to spare . However , table reading and block counting are very time-limited . If you know you are getting close to the end time , but have 5 answers left , sacrifice accuracy for speed . Do n't leave anything blank ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> All i did was study and do the sample and practice tests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the test and my weak areas . I was already familiar with the aviation knowlegde ( I 'm a CFI student , so I 've been studying that for a while ) and instrument interp . My weal areas was verb and having to do math without a calculator again . The verbal is a little more difficult to correct , but the math was n't , just got the pencil out and practiced my short hand . Note : learn frational and diecimal relationships , this help me out big on time , i just looked at a fraction and new what ball park the decimal number was , no long division needed . <p> Test day , I got 8 hrs of sleep , got up 2 hrs before the test to allow my body and mind to fully wake up . I dressed nice , e.i khaki slacks , button down , and nice shoes , to make myself feel more professional and get in that mindset .

If you wanted a third try in ROTC you had to have sharp grades and a commander to go to bat for you . In rare cases you see people who speak a second language get a third try or waive the test altogether .

They 're all about the same , but it does n't hurt to use them all . Go to a well known book store and buy them , or a used bookstore to get them cheaper ( try to get the latest version ) . None of them are perfect , and none of them give you the exact test , but they will all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , for the Verbal sections , many people recommend a GRE or GMAT verbal analogies study guide , which are apparently similar to the type of thing you 'll see on the AFOQT . The most important thing is to understand the way the test will be administered ... several ( a half dozen or so ) strictly timed sub-sections . Practice taking the tests under strict time restraints as the books suggest .

I had one conditional for grades when I reported the misdemeanor ( which put me at two = scholarship suspended for one semester ) . Depression set in , that and trying to hold down a job to help pay for school ( I took out $13,000 in student loans just to pay for that semester for what financial aide did n't cover ) ... well anyways my grades were shit this last semester . Then I find out I would either be dis enrolled or lose my scholarship next semester too ( zero tolerance alcohol policy ) . So I replied by trying to switch schools to my home state where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of this stupid private school I was at . AF ROTC could n't approve it until next semester . So I have to take out another $13,000 loan to stay in , or just be kicked out altogether . So I volunteered for dis enrollment . <p> Can I still fly ? Current GPA is 2.8 . I have 85 credits not including the F 's that brought me down last semester . Only 60 credits will transfer so those bad grades wo n't and I will have at least a 3.3 since that was about my average other semesters . Major was Aero Engineering , but I wo n't be doing that anymore . PCSM = 90. 60 flying hours . PFT = 100 . So if I finish school with a decent GPA and go to OCS is pilot slot still possible ? <p> I do n't know if this forum is strictly Air Force ... but I also looked into the Army .

Is there a direct question somewhere in the OTS/ROTC process ? <p> I know the answer to the ROTC side of that question ... <p> All cadets have to report civil involvements within 72 hours ( any run-ins with the police including traffic violations ) . If you do n't report it supposedly they will find out later when you go for a security clearance and that would not be good . This goes into consideration when they determine your stratification against all other cadets in your Wing . One of the cadre told me that it can drastically effect your Commander 's ranking . As in you can be a top cadet but enough civil involvements will put you into middle third and not top . However , I have a buddy with 6 or so ( all speeding tickets I think ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question , so they do n't specifically ask for your traffic history , but it 's on your honor to report any tickets etc . <p> No clue about the OTS process , anyone ? ? ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just went through OTS with 10 traffic violations .

I had a speeding ticket about 2 years ago . The officer actually handed me two tickets one was for speeding about 24 over , another was going to be for tailgating but since I was cooperative and polite he gave me a careless driving I believe it was . I went to court and spoke to the prosecutor where he dropped the careless driving but couldnt do anything with the speeding ticket . So I just paid the speeding ticket and left . <p> I came into the detachment and filled out my Form 35 with just the speeding ticket and totally forgot about the other one . But now I am wondering if it will even show up on my record . Should I report it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> First of all , careless driving is a worse offense than tailgating , so either your not remembering correctly or he definitely did n't " hook you up " b/c you were being cooperative . Secondly , if the DA got completely rid of the careless thing , is n't that like it never existed ? I would say just stick w/ the speeding ticket and move along . <p> 6strings : What I would do is call the Motor Vehicle Commission of your state and request a Driver History Abstract ( I think that 's what it 's called ) and see if both violations show up on there . If not , I would follow up with a call to the Police Dept/Municipal Court in the town you got the ticket in and get the complete record they have of your violations there . If the violations show up at either of these sources , I would recommend reporting them to your detachment . <p> Being a pilot applicant and going through my TS investigation , I was paranoid about these things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was going to come up that might jeopardize my chances . Yeah , the driver histories cost some money ( in NJ at least ) , but the $8 I spent was well worth my peace of mind . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> deal with the speeding ticket and do n't  worry about the other violation , but if you 're worried , KILLACAM has some good advice .

A lot of B-52 guys wear their flight caps like that for that reason alone- it 's tradition . I 'd say about 50% of us wear it , and most of those who do are the combat vets , although I have n't heard any rule , spoken or otherwise that only combat experienced aircrew can do it . <p> It is technically out of regs , but I have yet to have some staff weenie or uniform nazi give me any grief over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you are going to get schwacked quick if you think that the easily offended types are n't the military . The are rampant , and one offhand comment , such as using that term for a flight cap , overhead by these folks will quickly have the equal opportunity and legal folks on your *** faster than shit . A few years back at SOS we actually had a guy stand up in Polifika auditorium ( a.k.a the Blue Bedroom ) and in front of 700+ of his fellow CGOs ask Gen Ron Fogleman ( then CSAF ) what he was going to do to remove Playboy and other magazines that were , in his words , " offensive ... especially to women of color " from the shelves of USAF BXs . Fogleman maintained his cool and said that decision was above his pay grade , but the sheer fact that someone felt they could stand up and ask such a stupid questions shows how bad things have gone since the days of painting naked women on the nose of aircraft . <p> I do n't agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunker four floors under Europe with a lot of NATO types that have no idea what being PC is all about ( God bless ' em ) ; but much like Tailhook we have all learned the hard way ( sts ) that our profession has been infiltrated and it only takes on joke or crusty comment and the next thing you know you are the subject of the Spanish Inquisition .

@@43194818 @3194818/ <h> Resigning from the IRR <h> 2 posts in this topic <p> I separated from active duty 1.5yrs ago after 7yrs and 9mo of service . I was not RIF 'd or VSP 'd , had no remaining ADSC , and did not separate under any special program . <p> While going through the separation process every time it came up in the paperwork or in dealings with MPF it was clear that on their end they believed I had no remaining Military Service Obligation . I was close , but just short of the 8yr mark , so my understanding was that they were wrong . However , not having any desire to voluntarily continue in an IRR capacity if I did n't have to , I kept my mouth shut figuring I might be on the positive end of a military paperwork f*ckup for once . <p> I 've been happily existing on the civilian side for over a year now and today I get a letter in the mail from my local AFRC unit telling me that I should expect to have to report for IRR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow . <p> From what I can gather online , in the past an officer would continue indefinitely on IRR unless they resigned their commission , however , that was supposed to have been changed a few years ago . Apparently , at the 8yr mark I should have gotten a form that would have required that I elect to continue in the IRR , or resign . That did n't happen and because I thought I had mistakenly been given a clean break when I separated from active duty , I did n't think anything of it . <p> Apparently , if I 'm a member of the IRR , I 'm required to maintain my uniforms ... that would have been nice to know . Not to mention it seems I should also have a reserve I 'd card with base access and BX/commissary privileges . Neither is the case and at no point during the separation from active duty was I given any information on the IRR ( made sense given that I did n't expect to be transfered to IRR status ) . Information available from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to officers . <p> Can anybody who 's either experienced this process or had a spouse go through it point me in the direction of a good source of reliable information ? I 'd like to be educated before I call AFRC to figure out whether this is just a f*ckup on their end haunting me from beyond the grave and I can tell them to pound sand , or whether I need to formally resign my commission with AFRC . I do n't want to run in to the typical scenario where neither I or the person on the other end of the phone truly knows what they 're talking about , so they just default to the easiest solution from their perspective to get me out of their hair ( i.e. ' yeah , you 'll have to show up for muster in August unless you resign ' ) .

You can call DMDC prior to if you want to verify . Also I do n't know exactly when the rules for the IRR changed but I suspect it was with ROPMA . It apparently used to be that an officer was retained in the IRR until reaching a certain age ( possibly age 62 ? ) or until he submitted paperwork to resign his commission . Nowadays the officer is discharged after his second failure to be promoted to the next rank . Continuation is not considered for IRR in general . <p> At least in the Air reserve they only promote 1 guy per year in the IRR ( I guess to keep up appearances ) . So your chance of being promoted is nil . The board you will meet in the IRR ( to major ) is in the year you have 6-7 years TIG and your subsequent board will be the year after . Your mandatory separation will be 6 months after the 2nd board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revoked and you are barred from further officer service . If you would like to prevent this from happening you need to submit paperwork to ARPC which indicates you want to resign your commission . You can resign your commission as long as you do n't owe time , which it sounds like you do n't . <p> One final point for those getting out via VSP or otherwise receive separation pay and as a result owe 3 years in the IRR : AFPC may or may not put you in the IRR as they should . Also if they do put you in the IRR they will give you a break in service . This can be corrected administratively later on , but it 's a pain .

I have researched a lot on AGR vs ART and feel I am well-versed in the pros and cons of each . <p> As for the offers , the first option is an ANG AGR position that is supposedly a flying position , but remains to be seen if I will actually do any flying due to needed requals or interfly agreements .

If you think airlines might be in the cards , then being current will be a big deal , which sounds like its questionable for the AGR . <p> Other than that , I 'm a big fan of AGR over ART . If you get to 20 , you can retire with pension and then move to wherever you want and start a new career while young enough to do so successfully while having an income " cushion " since its tough to make what military officers make straight out of the chute in a civilian job . <p> Being an ART--in my opinion--gives you far less flexibility overall . Many would argue with me though . There is a lot of ART propaganda out here that shows how you can make much more money in retirement as an ART but it requires you to retire as a GS so if your next career is not GS that math goes out the window . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll play " bad " guy : serve six more years , collect $3M+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , with a percentage to your spouse if you die first ( SSB ) .

Does anyone know how exactly Marine Corps / Navy select their slots . I know the Air Force has one drop night where everyone gets T-38 or T-1 , but I 'm unsure how Naval Flight School works . <p> I found so much info about AFROTC and how exactly flight school works in the AF , but there isi n't that much information about Naval Flight School , especially about how selection works . <p> I know that with every UPT class there are at least a few T-38 drops available . So if you want one , you can really work hard to get it .

The marines have a minimum baseline score you have to get to get jets usually .

I do n't just because he needs a good down to earth kick in the nuts here and there . <p> Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one mistake if you 're remotely shit hot .

As mentioned , 89th and UPT IP jobs look at FEFs ( I 'm sure there are others ) . If the guy is shooting for a UPT IP job then there are criteria like no Q-3 within last 3-5 years or something . 89th is probably looking more for the perfect FEF . <p> It should n't effect an assignment really that much . The losing CC obviously knows the story and could use it to steer the guy to one assignment or another based on it , but I have n't seen too much of that in my time . The gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the losing CC or his buds can tell him . <p> Multiple Q-3s are a different story altogether . I someone is bringing in multiple Q-3s and ca n't seem to break the trend , it may be time to look at a different career choice . Herks tend to have a few Q-3s in every crew position every 6-12 months . There are only 3 critical items in a Herk , IIRC so there is a lot of " wiggle room " . Do n't crucify me if the 3 items is not correct , it 's been 32 months since I 've seen the inside of an airplane and I do n't have the time to find all my EP stuff to check . So , take your pick from a " clean " kill ( a guy not putting the gear down after multiple prompts from the EP in the seat ) to someone going out and just not being able to fly the plane worth a sh ! t coupled with weak GK , I 've seen a few of these . Most people recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never seen a guy or gal not make AC and most make IP . Ask Boom he knows one of the people I 'm talking about . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27697 @qwx437697 <p> As you can see by the responses on this thread , each heavy aircraft has a different mentality about Q3s and how often they go out . Apparently they are rare in Barneys , but not so rare in the tanker world . I 'm a Herk IP and I 've seen a decent number of Q3s go out , but in all honesty , only about 5-10% of the checkrides end in anything less than Q1 . Most busts occur because someone had a bad day , and the Form 8 will generally reflect that . Having a Q3 for something such as GK , safety or judgement can be a bigger hit than someone who simply got behind and forgot to configure or did n't turn the right way in holding . <p> Tell your friend not to worry and use it as a lesson for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flying skills and/or GK for the next time around . One bust usually has extremely minor effects on someone 's career unless they are going to apply for one of those above-mentioned jobs ( UPT/89th ) . <p> Do a good job at the non-flying job , and do n't get any more Q3s , and in a few years no one will care . Just realize though , that in most squadrons , the IPs and EPs keep an eye on guys that Q3 a checkride , at least until they show that it was either just a bad day or they have shown improvement . I know I did ... scheduled to fly with a copilot or nav that busted a checkride , and I always felt I needed to instruct/watch them more closely .

I want to fly more than anything and currently I was selected to fly heavies in the Air Guard . But talking and looking at various posts it looks like the washout rate of Air Force UPT is about 30% to 50% . Where the Army is only 10% . <p> Taking a small look at entry academics the AFAST is alot easier than the AFOQT ( 38 PICSM ; 56 Pilot , 54 Nav ) . It took me about 6-years to get my bachelors with work etc . ( Right now I am getting my instrument rating and have 115 hours of flying . ) I am not a good test taker , and learning takes a little longer for me . I heard the Air Force has a higher speed program . Where if you can not keep up they boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their program . Either way you are going to get some good training . I am just trying to get some feedback from some experienced pilots . <p> I am not trying to take the easy route I just want a realistic chance at getting my wings ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Do you want to fly for a service that is all about supporting one goal : Airpower - or do you want to fly for a service that has several ' irons in the fire ' - ie tanks , grunts , artillery , etc , etc . <p> If you want to fly , the AF is the only way to do it . You said it yourself , the AFAST is easier than the AFOQT . That should be a hint right there . The USAF is a technically minded group of professional officers and enlisted folks whose soul purpose is to fly and fight or support those who do . That ai n't  the case in the Army . The army needs bullet stoppers as bad as they need Apache pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck with your decisions and good on ya for asking the questions from those with experience .

He went over 10 years ago mind you and then on to black hawks later . I really could n't tell you that much . : confused : <p> Wash out rate : It 's really a crap shoot to me since I had 10 lost from 30 in my class . 1 SIE , 2 medical and 7 flying deficiencies ...

Take the advice of alot of guys , there is help all the way through the program - but you have got to push and show intestinal fortitude , they 're not going to coddle you by any means . <p> I firmly believe we have a more strict/intense program than the Army program - only basing it on a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough even going thru fixed wing qual course - a much more watered down version from what I witnessed .

Go find out - get a lesson or two in helos vs fixed wing that 's my only best advice since most of us do n't know our own shortfalls until we are confronted with them .

Being an Army aviator , I tend to agree with the consensus . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , but most of us realize that life is better in the AF . Better pay , better standard of living , better support . As I said , nothing against the Army , but we 're owned by the ground pounder 's who do n't always understand the needs of aviation . Also , if you 're thinking about life after the military , I would think fixed wing time is more marketable than rotary wing time . Like I said , just my 2 cents . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest HueyPilot <p> I 've been through both Army IERW ( Initial Entry Rotary Wing flight school ) and AF UPT . The courses are organized differently ( obviously ... one primarily training helo pilots and the other FW pilots ) , but the training philosophy is very similar ( vs the Navy style ) . You follow a strict timeline in both programs and are expected to master certain events by a given point in the course . <p> The Army course is a bit shorter , but I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helos are harder to learn to fly than airplanes ... and while you do n't have to memorize verbatim the " boldface " in the Army course , you have to be able to spout off around two dozen emergency procedures from memory since you likely wo n't have time to reference the checklist . <p> The Army course also throws in a few " Armyisms " , requiring you to do a 4-day field exercise , several road marches , and a few other " fun " Army events ( like land navigation , obstacle courses , etc ) . Air Force UPT is strictly flying-oriented . <p> As for wash-out rates , it 's about the same . While attending IERW , I did n't witness as many SIEs as I did in the AF ( do n't know why that is ) , but the numbers of students actually washed-out for flying-related problems was about the same ... both my IERW class and my UPT class lost one student . <p> The AFOQT and the AFAST ca n't really be compared ... yes the AFOQT is harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you enter the US Army as a commissioned officer you 'd have to take their officer qualifying test as well as the AFAST . The AFAST is strictly a flying aptitude test . <p> My advice : If you just want to fly for the military , and do n't care what kind of flying it is , go USAF . They are oriented around the flying mission ... you do n't have to play grunt at all ( unless you get an ALO job ) , and the USAF 's facilities are much better and aircraft are better equipped . <p> Army flying is very unique ... units are organized into Regiments , Battalions and Companys . You are directly supporting ground troops . You live in the field with them , eat in the field , sleep in the field . You park your aircraft in some open meadow and pitch your tents ( sts ) in the treeline and set up hasty fighting positions . You rarely fly over 1000 ' AGL , and you 'd likely belong to a distinct fraternity of pilots called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly a couple hundred hours a year , or less . You 'll spend as much time flying as you will doing basic grunt training ( ie weapons qual , MOPP training , sitting out in the woods with a Kevlar helmet and face paint on , etc ) . And you 'll have to work on and live near Army posts , which are pretty ghetto compared to your normal AF Base . <p> Anyways , that 's my .02 cents . I flew as a Army Guard UH-1 pilot for nearly 4 years , and I 'm currently flying Herks for the AD USAF . And my father was an active Army AH-1 pilot . Any other questions , just ask . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest drelyn8 <p> I am an ex army aviator now attending UPT for C-130's. ( + regional airline pilot ) I loved the Army and do n't think I 'll ever have as much fun flying as I did in the Army . Both flight schools are harsh , but I will say that the USAF prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be a PIC from day one unlike the Army which trains you to be a copilot . Plus the USAF has a track for becoming a PIC as the army relies soley on politics and the need for more PIC 's . <p> If you have an opportunity to go to a heavy unit . Do not pass it up . Seriously do not pass it up . Flying is the job . <p> In all schools I have been in OCS , Army flight school , USAF flight school ( numeroous enlisted and officer schools ) there have always been others that I was surprised they made it there . <p> Just the fact that you are finding out this info before making a decision tells me that you are selling yourself short . The warrant program is excellent but not without jobs not pertaining to flight . <p> One last comment . Army flight training was much more difficult with regards to actually handling the acft . Helos are much more difficult to learn to fly . Anyone can fly an airplane . Therefore the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually fly the aircraft . The USAF spends alot of time on the reg 's , IFR , etc . Items that are essential when you become more comfortable in the aircraft . <p> Good luck ! ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest HueyPilot <p> Plus the USAF has a track for becoming a PIC as the army relies soley on politics and the need for more PIC 's . <p> I 'll back that one up ! One of the reasons I left the ARNG ( aside from flying less than 100 hours a year ) was the PIC debacle . I had about 300 hours TT ( there is n't really a minimum time requirement ... just when your unit feels you 're " ready " ) , and our supervisory instructor pilot ( SIP ) had recommended me for PIC . Our commander felt we did n't need anymore PICs , and myself and a couple others basically had to wait until someone left the unit or died . <p> So I got my conditional release from the ARNG to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to upgrade to PIC ( well , not really an " upgrade " , they just make you one and you undergo a few supervisory rides to ensure you wo n't kill yourself and someone else ) . That 's how it is in the Army . And the Army Guard is worse ... who you know , versus WHAT you know is key there . <p> One guy who finished IERW after me came back qualified in the OH-58 ( I asked to go to that track but was told no ) , then got himself into the Medevac unit and got qualified on the UH-1 . Since he knew the headquarters guys , he also got to fly the OH-58C+ RAID helo from time to time . Then , only a few months back from the UH-1 course , he went to Rucker to attend the UH-60 AQC ( aircraft qual course ) , and flew UH-60As with the battalion . THEN , he talked one of his buddies at NGB ( he worked for LAARNG headquarters and knew most of the NGB staff in DC that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-out C-12 slot . <p> Unfortunately the CW5 who commanded the C-12 detachment was less than thrilled , since he liked to interview and hand-pick his new C-12 pilots . So this intrepid moocher was told he would never touch the Louisiana Guard C-12 , and left for New Jersey to fly theirs . That 's the last I heard of that guy ... but the ARNG is very political ... a big reason why I left . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest fartman38 <p> For the Army pilots : Not really " regret " but would you wish to fly for the AF instead of the Army Helos ? <p> And for the AF pilots : Would you give up your AF career to fly helos in the Army ? <p> If anyone wants to give personal anecdotes , I 'd be happy to listen to them . I just want comparisons between the Army and AF other than the usual such as ' Army is tougher ' or ' AF has a better quality of life ' <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm an AF pilot and would totally give up my career to be an Army helo pilot . Or a shrimp boat captain . I think the shrimp boat captain would be tougher , but you 'd have all the shrimps you want . But Army helo pilots do n't often worry about drowning or thier boat capsizing , so they have that going for them - which is nice . However , Army helo pilots frequently deploy to locations where shrimp are inferior , only fried , and only served on Fridays , but with steak and lobster . Neutral advantage . As far as quality of life , helo pilots frequently enjoy the best material pleasures life has to offer , including hookers . Shrimp boat captains enjoy the quiet serenity of fishing the calm blue waters of the open ocean with a few close friends . Also , a good haul this time of year will net you ( pun intended ) upwards of $250 . <p> Advantage : Shrimp Boat Captain . <p> 4 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> After working assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots are a different variety of whores . That may be disrespectful to the working ladies but there are not too many pilots who would not go fly something else for somebody else given the chance . There is a large group of pilots who always think somebody else has it better or is making more money . My thoughts are if you are happy and all systems are in the green , do n't pulling off the throttles or seeing what " this switch " will do . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> First time poster . I have done both : I flew UH-60 's for the Army for seven years and have flown Vipers for eight . So I ca n't speak to flying helos for the USAF , but I have certainly seen both branches . I can sum it up easy for you : if you want to fly for the Army , become a Warrant . If you want to fly for the USAF , go Guard ( or to a slightly lesser degree , Reserves . ) Those are the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to continue to go places and fight wars . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> If you want to fly for the USAF , go Guard ( or to a slightly lesser degree , Reserves . ) <p> Here 's a bit more pragmatic advice ... if you want to fly for the USAF take whatever opportunity you can get . <p> Do n't listen to the guys that got lucky and convinced some Guard unit to hire them when they act like getting a pilot slot in the Guard is easy . It is not , unless you know someone ... then it is the easiest thing in the world to do . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27697 @qwx437697 <p> I 've done both . I was in the Louisiana Army National Guard for nearly 8 years , of which I flew for them for about half that time . I was a Warrant Officer and flew both slick and medevac Hueys . Around the end of 1999 I left the ARNG for the active duty USAF and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely pilot perspective ... flying helicopters is a blast and I loved it . It 's mostly VFR flying , in the weeds and a lot of low-level ( nap of the Earth ... in the trees ) . Nothing I do in the USAF will be quite like flying around with the doors open in a Huey . Also the Army operates a lot like the Navy does with respect to flying regs ... unless things have changed dramtically in the past 10 years , their flying regs consisted of AR 95-1 ( most of which is a reprint of FAR 91 ) , the -10 ( -1 for USAF types ) and the FAR/AIM . Everything else was printed as a Field Manual . <p> That being said , there 's another side to that coin . I do a lot of things in the USAF I could never do in a helicopter . Flying to South America , Europe and a host of other locations ... being able to sample those places and then head home in the same time period . If you ever see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there for a while because you 're deployed . No out and backs or off-station trainers to locations outside the local flying area 99% of the time when you fly helos . Plus ( and this is a big one ) , USAF pilots tend to fly more than Army pilots ... unless of course you 're deployed , then you fly a lot . But back in garrison , Army pilots do n't fly as much as AF pilots . In the ARNG , I flew less than 100 hours a year , and that was actually trying to fly a lot . <p> If it were n't for the threat of being deployed for 12-18 months , I 'd consider going back to the ARNG as a warrant and flying for them again . But I doubt I 'd be willing to go active duty Army . If you 're going to do the Army thing , at the very least fly as a warrant officer . Commissioned officers do n't fly much , they are essentially commanders and staff . They maintain enough experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing on a daily basis , and no more . Chances are as a LT you 'd arrive as a platoon leader . Enjoy that time because that 's probably the most you 'll get to fly in your career .

As a senior captain you 'll probably command a company , and that 'll probably be the last " real " flying job you 'll have in the Army . Once you leave the company , you 'll probably spend the next several years as a battalion staff guy . If you 're lucky as a senior major or junior LTC you might be the battalion XO and then the battalion CO , but you still wo n't get to fly too much . Do n't expect to become an instructor pilot or even a maintenance pilot as a commissioned guy .

You 'll probably branch off into one of the major career directions , such as instructor pilot , maintenance test pilot or safety . It 's a lot like being a LT or junior Captain in the Air Force , but you get to do it for the rest of your career . <p> Other pros/cons I 've noticed ... if you intend on having a flying career after the military , it 's generally easier to find a job as a fixed wing guy , and FW pilots tend to get paid more . As one of my former Army mentors used to say , the commercial helicopter pilot field is akin to the professional white-collar slave trade . Long hours , tiring days , and pay that rarely breaks the $100K mark , although that was 10 years ago so things may have changed somewhat . But also figure that most helo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part 121 ... now you 're talking about totally different games when it comes to crew rest rules , etc . On the other hand , nothing 's quite like flying a helicopter . I have n't flown a fighter so I ca n't say much about that ... but the closest I got was the old T-37 and as much fun as that was , when it comes down to the basic fun of flying , I 'd take the helicopter , unless I was actually trying to get somewhere . <p> That 's probably too much rambling but I figured maybe some of the lurkers and noobs out there that have n't yet committed to one path or the other might get something out of it . I focused on the Army for a reason ... this board tends to focus on AF flying so I wrote more about the subject most people on here have limited knowledge about . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Over the last 40-50 years or so , there have been literally hundreds of Army pilots that transferred their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ANG status .

There are opportunities to attend OCS at some point down the road if you 've satisfied that flying bug and feel you want a different career path .

How does this process work ? <p> What 's the level of popularity/competition for the helos in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UAV ) <p> Out of ROTC your Commissioned as an RLO , straight and simple . Warrants are either selected from Prior Enlisted in any of the Services or from Street to Seat Aviators out of the WOFT program . Currently the trend is about 80-85% Prior/20-15% Street to Seat . You can revert from a Commission officer to a Warrant in Aviation and Ive seen guys who have done it but its not exactly a normal process . Most of the people I know that have successfully did it came from branches outside Aviation and often times from Guard to Active or vice verse . Also as far as time they stay , you got ta keep that in mind most of the guys your bringing in to aviation as " new guys " already have however many years towards their retirement . <p> Going to the other services ... I 'll let somebody with experience doing such speak on it as to the actual process . However it is important to recognize that one services flight school may or may not meet the requirements for another . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most talented Army Helicopter Pilots ...... The Coast Guard . <p> Competition ... Popularity ? Who F'ing cares you will get what you get when and if you complete all the stuff leading up too and including IERW . I fly guns , I picked guns , I picked 3rd and I had the option to select from anything but Chinooks . Currently we have a 300% manning in Chinooks you just are n't  seeing more than 1 or 2 tops dropped at a selection and often times not at all . I know other guys that graduated just as high and got " stuck " in something they did n't  originally want because the selection went something like 1x Apache , 1x Kiowa , 18x Hawks . Usually there will be one guy hard up for taking the fat girl home and he 's welcome to them . Hawks/Kiowa/Apache ... depends who you ask why they do whatever . Some guys used to Crew on a particular bird and want to fly that . Others look at possible basing assignments . If you wan na go to Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some guys are smart enough to pick the mission , others are retards with delusions of how great a stick they will be and want to take a Hawk like its some sort of magic ticket to the 160th . And finally there are guys who just get what they get because they spent their weekends hungover and got whatever was left at the end of selection with the rest of the bottom of the class . Maybe its what they wanted , maybe they are like the one tool bag in my group that complained he had to fly scouts when he graduated last in the class and was lucky to be flying anything . Oh and we do n't  fly UAVs . That 's an entirely different MOS in the Army they do n't  pick from Aviation after all that money and time and training to waste us on that hell . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27697 @qwx437697 <p> Straight out of ROTC , can you choose to commission as a WO instead of a CO ?

( Apache , Blackhawk , Chinook , Kiowa , UAV ) <p> As already answered , if you complete ROTC you go in as a 2LT . Only way to become a warrant officer is to complete WOCS and apply for that separately . Having a college degree would help if you sent your packet in . <p> There are opportunities to fly fixed wing within the Army , but they are limited . Mostly flying C-12s , RC-12s , UC-35s and an odd assortment of other FW types . If you want to fly FW , then seek another service . <p> Transferring to the Air Force depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioned officers in the Army must apply for an interservice transfer ( IST ) . That is a matter of timing . Many times the Army wo n't release you . Other times they may . No guarantees on that one , just " right place , right time " . Warrants can apply for Air Force Officer Training School ( OTS ) once their initial commitment is up . If you apply prior to that you 'd have to get a conditional release ( to let you out of your commitment ) and again , that 's not likely . I got a conditional release and left 2 years early , but I was also Army National Guard and not active duty ... different set of players and conditions . Even then , the adage " right place , right time " still applies ... people who saw me apply and leave were not granted conditional releases later on . So best way to do that is to wait for your six years to end and then apply for OTS . <p> If you get accepted through OTS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you qualify for Fixed-Wing Qualification ( FWQ ) , then you might get lucky and attend that course . If you do n't then you go through the full-up UPT syllabus , as I did . I do n't know the particulars and it 's been a long time ago , but I remember being told you have to have 1,000 military hours to qualify for FWQ , at least on the active-duty side . The ANG and AFRC have different rules and I 've seen guys with fewer than 1,000 hours attend FWQ . <p> Regardless of all of the above , I 'd urge you to consider what you really want to do . If you want to fly FW , then do n't bother with the Army and try for the USAF or Navy . If you think flying helicopters is what you 'd like to do then by all means consider the Army ... but realize the Army is the only branch that trains 100% of its new pilots on RW aircraft first . I never so much as touched an airplane the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MC all train their pilots in the T-6/T-34 prior to branching them off to helos . <p> What you get when you graduate depends on what 's available and your class ranking . I was Guard so my fate was pretty much a given ( UH-1s ) . But for my AD friends , about half got what they wanted . Generally , if you graduate in the top half of the class , you 'll get the airframe of your choice . The only people I saw that got both airframe and post ( base ) of their choice were the top few . The bottom half generally gets their second or third choice . Several people wanted lift ( UH-60 or CH-47 ) to a nice post but instead got OH-58Ds to Ft Polk ... they were n't happy . It 's typically not easy to get the CH-47 ... not many airframes and a lot of students want to fly the Chinook for whatever reason . The next two that are in demand are usually UH-60s and AH-64s . If you want an OH-58D that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I went through Rucker . All the dudes who were pissed about their assignments got 58Ds . There were a few that really wanted to fly in the Cav and got their dream choice of a 58D to a Cav post , but most tried to avoid it . Back then , they sometimes had a FW slot direct from IERW ( Initial Entry Rotary Wing ... the Army 's version of UPT ) , but I do n't know if they are still doing that . Given the strain on active units with helos , I doubt it . Someone in the Army now might be able to tell you a more up-to-date answer . <p> Oh and we do n't  fly UAVs . That 's an entirely different MOS in the Army they do n't  pick from Aviation after all that money and time and training to waste us on that hell . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> They have been selecting new Warrants for a direct Fixed Wing transition on the condition that they complete an advanced aircraft qualification before hand . Typically they send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Somebody high up decided they wanted to start vetting young guys into the Fixed Wing community in order to develop a cadre of experienced Senior Warrants within that community over the next 10 years . That selection is very conditional though . They offered a slot to a guy in my unit that just got done with the AQC for the 64 , but that was because he had been a CRJ pilot in the civilian world before he went street to seat . They let my class take a look at the requirements they were wanting for selection to that program and it was pretty stringent . A lot of guys who were interested in the program but we 're ruled out for Unsat flight evals , failed academics tests , etc . Basically if your shit did n't  stink and there was a slot open you could actually get a fixed wing slot but its not something I 'd go betting on . They 're only handing out something like 4-5 of them over the course of a fiscal year . <p> Huey , <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing about the Army or helicopters but from a 6-9 second google search the mission seems alright to untrained eyes ... <p> I wanted Scouts based on the mission before I got into flight school and flew the 67 . The mission is amazing , but fact of the matter is the Apache is picking up a large chunk of their mission due to the conditions we operate in . Plus the Army has n't  put dick for money into that community over the last 15 years being that Comanche was supposed to replace it ( our 12 Billion dollar pile of shame ) and then the ARH-70 after that . Most of the buddies from flight school that went 58 were just all about the whole doors off in the weeds shooting with an M4 out the door mystique .

They are almost always wearing ACUs because as usual , the uniform boards cared more about the shoes in the air conditioned offices than the people who the ABU was really intended for . While it 's got a crappy service life of only 4-6 months in that environment , at least it breathes somewhat under IBA and all the other crap we have to wear over it .

If we get hot breaks they take about 10-15 minutes to heat to their max temp . It 's wierd standing there and righto n the minute they just flare up and start smoking . Do n't know why they continue to heat just know that they do . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling airflow is the culprit , in addition to the rampant convective heating and heat transfer Xtendr50 mentioned . Even the little airflow from taxiing around with warm brakes helps cool them down significantly . <p> But , typically , what happens after a max braking scenario ? You stop and do n't go anywhere . When nothing is blowing the heat off those bad boys when they are just sitting there static , they heat UP like mugs . I 've been on several Herks where we had to EGE for hot brakes ( curses to you weakass E-model brakes ! ) , and once had both mains on one side blow -- not fun . Hot brakes ai n't nothing to play around with . When you hear/feel the " chatter " , you best be getting airborne soonest and delaying the gear up call , foshizzle . When the " chatter " gets to be downright mushy &amp; sticky , EGE ought to be on your brain . That and the LM/boom yelling " It smells like something is burning , yo !

The heat absorbed by a component ( e.g. , brake pad ) will be TRANSFERRED to other components , overheating them ... but there is not a increase in total heat .

All you can do is convert it or transfer it . The issue here has to be the conductive and/or the convective heating of the wheel . When you stop , all of the kinetic energy of the moving aircraft goes into the brake disc as heat .

The energy must always be there , so the cause of the delay must be in the transfer from the brake pads to the wheel assembly ( kinda like rotorhead and Chuck17 said )

Did I make a good living ? Yes , I was not married and owned a very small house and had nothing better to do than to spend almost all my time on trips or AFTPs , working in training , scheduling , tactics , motorcycle safety etc , etc . I may have been an exception , but I showed many a co-pilot what time commitment was required and I know several that are guard bumming to their hearts content as we speak , again keep in mind OEF/OIF has allowed many of them to remain on title 10 active duty for 2 years , we have several co-pilots that have 1000 hours in the C-130 and 600 hours of combat time . I finally decided to get full-time employment after my 6th OEF/OIF deployment , I had gotten married and have a small child , I got hired by the US Forest Service as a firefighting lead-plane pilot ( awesome job ) and recently left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. guard bumming is a tough one , but I will try and answer . Myself and 2 others came out of the schoolhouse in 1997 , two of us bummed and one went to the regionals , the two of us that bummed were able to get hired at FedEx around the same time . With that being said my sim partner at FedEx was an Embry-riddle grad and flew for a regional , he is only 28 ! He also accumulated 4500 hours in a RJ , it is very good time , but from my experience I noticed that military pilots did not have to have as many hours as straight civilian . <p> Bottom line , if you are brand new to your unit , and do n't mind rotating to the desert for two years straight , you will get plenty of flying time , be ready to upgrade to Aircraft Commander at the end of this time , then go get a job at the regionals and hope to upgrade quickly , however sometimes it 's a crap shoot , I know several that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from UPT that are still in the right seat or got pushed back into it from the reverse flow through when American furloughed .

My buddy sitting reserve has n't worked in 25 days , I think he is home every night for now . <p> I think I have proved that you can fly less with an airline , make more , and get hired with less hours .

Ironically , it was written by a T-38 FAIP bud of mine who would later go on to be an Albino driver . Less than 10 years ago this occured , but it 's a throwback to the fighter pilot days of lore . <p> **29;1266;TOOLONG <p> Taxpayers beware ; this story involves the combustion of tens of thousands of pounds of JP-8 and the consumption of many of your tax dollars in an effort to retrieve one long-dead aviator . <p> Mr. Bones , or Mr. F. Bones , or Frank T. Bones , is the mascot of the 95th Fighter Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base , Florida ( the home of the mighty F-15 Eagle ) . He has a long and glorious history , most of which I do n't know , which started back in WWII when the " Boneheads " ( as the 95th FS pilots are called ) flew P-38s and generally kicked everyone 's butt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in your high school biology classroom , dressed in a flight suit complete with name tag and O-6 rank ( that 's right--though dead , Mr. Bones has attained the rank of Colonel . Hope for us all . ) He usually resides comfortably in his coffin in the Bonehead 's squadron bar at Tyndall . Usually . <p> I am proud to say that the 50th FAIPs now have a place in the history of the venerable Mr. Bones . It all started when my squadron commander , Lt Col XXX " Grover " XXX , and my good friend and fellow FAIP XXX " Bob " XXX went cross-country to Mountain Home AFB ( that 's in Boise , I 'd ) so Grover could attend the retirement ceremony of a friend . Yes , when you 're the squadron commander , you can grab a " Seeing-eye Captain " like Bob , take a jet , and travel across the entire country if the mood strikes you . <p> Anyway , Grover , like Mr. Bones , has a long and distinguished history himself , much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , while drinking in the F-15 squadron 's bar at Mountain Home ( his old unit ) , he spied Mr. Bones propped nonchalantly in the corner . It seems the F-15 boys from Boise had been on a trip to Tyndall in the spring and had stolen Mr. Bones right from his coffin ! Grover 's first assignment as a pilot was to the 95th , so being a Bonehead at heart , he decided to stuff Mr. Bones into his T-38 's travel pod and wrest him back to lovely Columbus , Mississippi ( the Mountain Home Eagle drivers , being both drunk and somewhat dim-witted , were none-the-wiser until it was too late ... ) . <p> On the way back to Columbus , Grover and Bob stopped for the night at Elsworth AFB in South Dakota , just down the road from Sturgis , where a huge Harley rally was underway ( apparently it 's the biggest Harley rally in the land--who knew ? ) Since Grover is a Harley driver and Bob had the foresight of toting his video camera along on the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours through the streets and bars of Sturgis . The resulting 30 debaucherous minutes of video , replete with drunk and sometimes naked biker women , come into play later .... <p> In the meantime , Saw , another good friend and fellow FAIP , had left Columbus to pursue his dreams of becoming a real man and was about half-way through the F-15 syllabus at Tyndall , training with the fine instructors of none other than the 95th FS . Well , word traveled quickly that Grover had acquired Mr. Bones , and since Saw was once a member of the 50th , it fell upon him to get him back to the Boneheads . Saw contacted me to find out what Grover wanted for ransom , and Grover put it into Bob 's and my hands . So what did we ask for ? RIDES IN THE MIGHTY EAGLE JET , what else ? The 30 debaucherous minutes of video were edited down to 20 , set to loud music , and sent along with a ransom note ( authentically constructed out of magazine clippings , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family models " be flown to the land of " pork and catfish , " and was signed the " FAIP Mafia , " a throwback to days of yore . <p> To my great surprise , Saw called me a few days later with the news that the ransom had been accepted and that four Eagles were on their way up for retrieval . After I got over my disbelief , Bob and I spent two weeks drafting paperwork and assembling agendas for their visit . Grover left everything to us , insisting that we only " make it memorable . " To us that meant one thing--lots of booze ( yes , there is irony to be found there ) . <p> Last Thursday , as the four-ship of mighty Eagles was taxiing up to Base Operations at Columbus , Bob and Slaydog and I stood waiting on th ramp with a cooler full of beer . From there we took them to the squadron for a tour , and Ringo ( an Eagle pilot ) gave an " Eagle Reach " presentation in our auditorium for interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around seven , still in our flight suits , and basically took over the whole restaurant . Bob and I had taken Polaroids of Mr. Bones in several unflattering situations , so before everyone got too drunk , we presented the 95th squadron commander ( callsign " Gorilla " ) with a shot of Weed , the pictures , and several vulgar though surprisingly lyrical poems . About one hour and four bottles of whiskey later , the Mississippi woods reverberated with fighter pilot songs , none of which can be repeated here , as my now fairly inebriated co-workers sang at the top of their slurring voices . It was then that I knew that I had done good , though it was a fleeting feeling cause I passed out soon thereafter . <p> And yes , the next morning at eight we managed to brief a three-ship ACM ride ( that 's Air Combat Maneuvering ) , and Bob , Slaydog , and I crawled into the back of the Eagle jets and raged for about 45 minutes . 45 minutes of 7+ G 's , full afterburner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . <p> When we landed , we all limped out of our jets and were shaking hands when Grover pulled out onto the flightline in his Harley , Mr. Bones riding on the back . We handed him over , a more than fair trade , and watched a little sadly as he was stuffed into an F-15 travel pod and taken back to his coffin at Tyndall. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If you ever find yourself in their bar , they keep all the " ransom details " from all the abductions ... you should be able to find the video , polaroids , and lovely poetry ... along with lots of other good stuff from Mr. Bones ' previous trips .

I was pulled because I was in a friend car with daytime running lights , so the headlights were already on and I did n't manually turn on the lights and I figured the taillights would be on as well . Unfortunately , I ended up recieving a DUI-minor because the cop could smell the beer on me .

When you first enter ROTC you are supposed to give them all of your tickets and fines that you have ever received . So there is the first place you may have to admit it . <p> Second , for your security clearance , they will invistagate your record . People will tell you do n't  put it down but there is a story of a person that went to my det who hide something from his record before his commissioning investigation ( his lawyer advised him to do so and told him that there was no way the air force or anyone could find out ) and the air force found out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure he did n't commission ) . <p> Third , you say it will be off of your record but there will always be a record of it . <p> Either way , I say admit it and confess . If you are entering AFROTC , confess it right away . I do n't  believe it will hurt you ( know plenty of people that admitted to smoking pot when they entered and are now flying and doing other things ) . Heck , I would report in to the commander and explain to him everything . It shows responsability and maturity and that you are n't afraid of admiting mistakes or taking punishment . JUST DO NT LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN . There will be no excuse if it happens while you are in AFROTC and you will be judged against a different standard . <p> If you are in ROTC , admit it .

You ca n't look at the money too hard , because you wo n't like what you see . He said one night , flying the redeye from LAX to Cincinnati , his mind started to wander and he began calculating the yearly total cost .

Transition training ( if you choose it or your insurance co. requires it ) can be expensive , but that 's a one-shot deal . <p> - As a non-builder , you 'll need an A&amp;P to sign-off the condition inspection every year . Not all A&amp;P 's are willing to do it due to liability concerns - you may need to hunt one down who is familiar with RVs and is willing to do the inspection , and fly to his/her location annually . <p> If you have n't already found it , vansairforce.net is a great resource for all things RV . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> anyone familiar with owning in the light-sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically reduced . obviously the planes are smaller , but they can be just as fast , if not faster , than your average Cessna. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have a Cherokee 140 and I run about $12K per year flying 150 hours and BEFORE engine reserve . <p> 100LL : 150 hours *8 gal/hr * 5.30$/hr = $6,360 <p> Insurance : $600 /yr <p> Hangar : $160/mo * 12 mo/yr = $1,920 <p> Annual : $2K/yr <p> Maintenance : $1K/yr <p> Total : $11,880 <p> Be advised that this is an average year , it can be more expensive ... especially during the first few years that you have the airplane . You have to get all of the quircks fixed early , and you probably wo n't be ready to do oil changes , brake pads , etc by yourself yet . An RV-4 will have considerably less MX cost since it is experimental , but you will have to pay an A&amp;P for the annual since you wo n't hold the repairman 's cert for the aircraft . Engine overhaul is a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't throw it in my costs because it 's already paid for . I set aside $20K the day after my last overhaul just in case . Obviously , hangar , insurance , and fuel costs vary widely based on location and experience . Two years ago I was n't flying as much and was running about $8K/yr . Also , I fly 25 hr/yr or so TDY , so that is essentially free gas . <p> Just my two cents : do n't do it until you can really afford to fly as much as you want , have your overhaul money set aside as soon as you buy it , and try to hangar it whenever possible for peace of mind . Last , but not least , enjoy the type of flying that owning your own airplane can provide . It 's a great feeling . The RV is a great airplane and I would have one if I did n't have a family of three . <p> Edit : One other thought : make sure you get the avionics you want with your purchase or budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they cost a not-so-small fortune .

The prevailing VFR weather in New Mexico also makes it possible . <p> There is an old guy down in Portales who does " Owner assisted " annuals , but unless you have decent mechanical knowledge , I would n't trust his work . Having the right tools and knowing the right people brings costs down significantly . GA as a whole is a very small community .

It was ADVERTISED as the solution to this very thread ; hoardes of Joe working stiff finally able to afford some very restricting kind of flying , which was better than envying rich people outside the airport fence right ?

We all know there 's a generational gap in terms of affluence , old people have money , young people are increasingly broke as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is OLD by societal standards . As such , their health is failing and they ca n't continue to hold FAA medicals . The intent of LSA was NEVER to open the market to young broke people . Wan na know why ?

The demographic that COULD afford to throw stupid money after silly money to keep that Bonanza flying 45 hours a year in the air conditioned hangar now get to continue flying under LSA rules . They let their medical expire , full knowing they could n't pass a renewal , and so they take their buckets of money and throw it into a shiny new LSA . <p> LSAs ca n't fly at night , can carry only one passenger , ca n't fly IFR , yet they cost six figures ! ! !

GMAFB . I digress . <p> If I could get an LSA ( day VFR , non-IFR equipped , under 120KIAS ) for the acquisiton cost of a rat trap 150 , then we 're talking . The avionics alone in that LSA cost more than the -150 , forget the manufacturing cost of the thing . It 's a non-starter and just like California equity refugees were swelling up the housing costs in Southeastern cities at the middle of the last decade , so are old rich people with failing health , artificially sustaining a ridonculous price for a glorified kite that you ca n't even tow past dusk . Sure , you could equip an LSA for night VFR and even IFR , but in order to fly outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who can get a medical will go back to their Bo and fly 4 people in comfort at 140kts ( burning silly fuel flow but I digress ) . LSAs are non-starters for the guy looking to " afford " GA . <p> When this last batch of old folks ( boomers in particular ) dies off , there 'll be a fire sale of aircraft , but no buyer 's to pick up the inventory . The operating costs are going up and up and up . Even now 30+ yo spam cans are sitting idle waiting for suckers to pick them up and nobody will touch them ; everybody knows the operating and mx costs of these relics are prohibitive when amortized for the kind of flight hours the median GA pilot does in a year . You 're better off boating to be frank . GA will about cease to exist in 30 years they way this thing is going . The FAA and some of the airline/military crowd could n't be happier about it . <p> Edited October 10 , 2011 by hindsight2020 <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something I 've never really understood - why do airplanes and their parts cost so much ? A brand new 172 costs $274,900 . That 's the base price for the cheaper model . For a design that has n't really changed in 50 years and is partially built in Chihuahua , Mexico . The models go up exponentially from there , a Cessna 350 , which looks like a fun 2-seat , low-wing plane to fly ( despite not being able to go upside down ) is $558,200 . <p> And then you need to rebuild the engine every 2000 hours for $20,000 ? The base 172 engine produces 160hp at 2xxx rpm , which is a dramatic 15hp increase over what it produced in 1958 . Does n't sound like the reliability or power has increased much at all . <p> What gives ? Is it solely down to economies of scale ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Ya , a huge part going into my this decision is that I 'm a single dude going from Hurby to Cannon . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite judge the place yet , but I 'm thinking it 's gon na be hard to put a price on throwing my middle finger out of the window of my own plane as I leave that place every weekend . <p> Still , I want to be smart about it and not put myself into huge amounts of debt just trying to stay sane , so that 's why I made this thread .

If separate , what type of work is done during the UTA ... local flying for currency reasons , some type of desk job , or just trying to knock out all required AF CBT training ?

I think he 's talking about Min rnwy length requirement that is in the regs for each particular a/c , the one that says you need X amount of runway to take-off ( regardless of weight ) , as opposed to a minimum take-off distance . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For the C-130s , the real answer is n't as simple as 3000 ' /6000 ' . For contingencies ( aka combat ) , the min runway length for landing will be different than for takeoff , and both numbers are highly dependent on a/c weight , outside temp , and pressure altitude . If you want a really general rule , 3000 ' will allow a Herk to land and take off at most weights and temp/PA combos . Both numbers can get under 2000 ' in the right circumstances .

I 've seen several instances ( including a guy in my current squadron ) where it worked well and a non-flier spouse followed a flyer with very little delay to the same base . I 've also seen many instances where the couple was separated by at least a state . <p> IMHO , the worst thing you could do would be to marry another pilot , as this is the hardest thing for AFPC to work . You ca n't be in the same squadron ( or so I hear ) , so your options are to either find an MDS that has multiple squadrons at the same base ( seen this ) or go to seperate MDSs that are stationed in the same place ( seen this attempted ) .

When you get married both you and your wife go to the MPF and tell them that you both got married and you want to update your Join-Spouse intent . There are three codes , A , B , &amp; C. <p> A - You want a Join-Spouse assignment with your spouse both CONUS and OS ( even short tours if possible ) . <p> B - You want a Join-Spouse assignment with your spouse only for CONUS . <p> C - You do n't want a Join-Spouse assignment with your spouse at all . <p> As for the dual pilot thing , yes you can be both pilots and stationed in the same squadron . I have two 130 pilots stationed in my squadron here at Little Rock . Join-Spouse is easy if both of you are of the same AFSC , it 's hard to do if say you 're an F-15 pilot and she 's a C-130 Nav . <p> Also Join-Spouse assignments are not guarnteed , the AF will station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll go to the same base . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest goirishgo <p> hi , i just got engaged this past weekend . i am starting UPT at laughlin on dec 1st. my fiancee is a senior in AFROTC , commissioning in may . we are trying to figure out how we can be stationed together eventually . a little background , her top choices on the dream sheet are AFIT , comm , and intel . <p> when filing for join-spouse , do both people need to file , even if the other is not finished with training ? for example , if i am putting in for my assignment out of UPT or follow-on , and she is still at AFIT but not due to finish at the same time as i finish my training , does she need to fill out her dream sheet early ? <p> i guess to simplify my question , i know that when filing for join-spouse , both people need to put in for it . however , what happens when one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? <p> obviously there 's a number of scenarios seeing as how i do n't know what kind of planes i 'll be flying and she has n't found out what her AFSC will be ... but anyone who has experience with the join-spouse program that can help she 'd some light would be appreciated . just trying to gather as much info as early as possible . thanks ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest rotorhead <p> Both should make their desires known ( and exactly mirror each other ) .

If your unit is at a reserve base or a civilian airport , do n't hold your breath for Join-Spouse . If there 's no real AD billet there ( not talking ART or AGR , as she is n't eligible for those as an AD line officer ) , she ca n't get stationed there .

She had three more years of rotations , only to be done at particular bases , when it was assignment night ( already went a year and a half apart ) . When he put his request to be a FAIP or C21 to Andrews , APFC was nice enough to accomodate his request , however AFPC allotted the C21 to a different UPT base . That base would n't trade/swap for it because someone there wanted it too . He ended up getting neither and now will be spending another 3-4 years apart from his wife .

Get married , update your join-spouse code at the MPF and start having your Commander start talking to the functional . However realize as an Active Duty Officer you 're going to move 3-4 years after your first assignment and the AF is n't going to try and place you around your husband all the time . They 'll do their best ( and they really try to work the join-spouse thing for couples so everyone 's happy ) but sometimes it 's hard . Also he can transfer Guard/Reserve units ( not something he 'd probably like to do since they spent $$$$ making him a pilot but it 's an option ) . <p> On the flip side if you do get married and you are n't around your spouse and come up here you wo n't be the only one .

My wife is not AF , but she is an RN , so I 'll throw my two cents in . <p> 1 ) Is there anyway I could contact a family who is dual military ? I would like a general idea of what life would be life . <p> I know a few people who were married AF couples . Most of them were flyers , but I actually know one couple that was pilot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to PM me with your personal e-mail address , I can contact them and see if they would be interested in providing you some answers . <p> 2 ) Assignments : I 'm pretty positive that nothing is set in stone with the Military , but how likely is it that I could have a joint-assignment ( I think that is what it 's called ) with my husband ? <p> A lot of similar questions and answers throughout this thread , but the general consensus is that the AF will try to make it happen but they will not guarantee anything ( and the term is " Join Spouse " ) . <p> I would recommend against you joining the AF for several reasons . <p> - A nursing degree will give you the opportunity to work in a very broad variety of jobs . While you do have a good chance of Join Spouse considerations in the medical field , I do n't think that commissioning is necessary to work as a nurse for the AF . There are plenty of nursing GS ( civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one available at the base that your husband goes to , then you always have the option of applying to the civilian hospital in town . My wife worked as GS nurse in Lakenheath , and now works for a civilian hospital . <p> - As a civilian , you do your job on base and that 's it . If you are an officer , you are now eligible for all the perks that come with that role to include deployments and AEFs . Unless you are on an AEF cycle aligned with your husband , he could leave for four months and return two days after you 've stepped out the door for your four month deployment ( I work with a maintenance NCO who had that exact thing happen to him ) . If you do get assigned to the same AEF and have kids , you 'll have to find somebody to watch them for four months ( kids are not a trump card for deployments ) . <p> - Even if you are able to work all of your assignments to the same base as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get your report dates aligned . When you arrive at a base , you incur a Time on Station commitment that you can not alter without special circumstances ( which join spouse is not ) . It 's not a big deal , but as you know or will soon discover , PCSing is much easier if done together . <p> I would research more information on civilian nursing opportunities within the AF before you get committed to commissioning . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest thebratpack <p> My spouse has ten years in .... I am an RN . My advise is stay civilian with the degree . There are many benifits to working the civialian side . Variety , opportunity to change specialties , etc . Also , if you secure a job before moving to your next assignment , you can inquire about relocation allowances . Most facilities will provide you with some $$$ for relocation . PM me if you have more questions re : this area . <p> Another thing to consider is that although you may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well come into your future . With two spouses AD deploying and reassigning makes stability a bit harder to maintain . But it can be done . Just easier when one is AD and the other is civilian . <p> If your concern is student loans . Most states and or facilities are starting to offer forgivness progams . If all else fails , try the VA hospital ( if there is one in your area ) .... pay usually beats civialian and AD pay , student loan payback ( up to 40,000 the at the facility in our area ) , many oppurtunities for further education .... again PM me if you want more specifics . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest lemondrop <p> My boyfriend is currently at UPT .

UPT has always been full of surprises , you never know how things are going to turn out . He could change his mind half way through T-6s and want to go fighters . Hell , I have seen a couple both get fighters and then have one wash out of IFF and go to C-17s . Had another guy at Yokota turn down his follow on to C-17s to go E-3s because that is what his wife got out of T-1s . <p> Only time I have heard of fighter married to airlift was F-16-C-17 assigned Shaw and Charleston , lived in Sumter , divorced a year later .

Rex , the Wonder Engineer , is on his 7th local in two weeks , and his nineteenth hour of receiver AR this month . Leading this perverted race is a wore-out E model , with the pride of the Raggedy-Ass Militia as crew . Rex stirs slowly from a sound sleep as Joe , the infamous numb-nuts boomer , former hero of SAC , pokes him with greasy , tobacco stained finger . Rex 's eyes bolt open as he hears the IP , Capt Bank , yelling at him from the right seat . " Engineer ! We do n't have a ready light here , is there a problem ?

Doses will be lowered from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams for regular products , and 12.5 milligrams to 6.25 milligrams for extended-release formulations . <p> The FDA is recommending that manufacturers apply these lower doses to men as well , though it is not making them a requirement . <p> The new doses apply to all insomnia treatments containing the drug zolpidem , which is sold under brands including Ambien , Edluar , Zolpimist and in generic forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. The changes do n't affect other popular sleeping medicines like Lunesta and Sonata , which use different drugs . <p> FDA officials pointed out that all sleeping drugs carry warnings about drowsiness . <p> " All sleep drugs have the potential to cause this , so health professionals should prescribe " and patients should take " the lowest dose that is capable of preventing insomnia , " said Dr. Ellis Unger , a director in FDA 's Office of Drug Evaluation , on a teleconference with reporters . <p> Ambien has been blamed for several recent high-profile driving accidents in the past year , including Tom Brokaw in September and Kerry Kennedy in July . <p> The FDA has received more than 700 reports of driving-related problems connected to zolpidem over the years . <p> " But in most cases it was very difficult to determine if the driving impairment was actually related to zolpidem , " Unger said .

According to FDA staff , the difference can not be accounted for by usual factors like size and weight . <p> For now , patients should continue taking their currently prescribed dose until they can talk to their doctor about the best way to proceed . <p> " We really do n't want people to change the dose they 're on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Unger said . <p> Ambien is marketed by Sanofi , Intermezzo by Purdue Pharma LP and Zolpimist by NovaDel Pharma Inc. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Great , takes 15 mg to do anything for me ... now I have to take 3 pills every time I want to sleep .

Keep in mind , I did three hurrivacs , had one freak hail storm that downed over three quarters of the fleet , endured a fuel shortage after katrina and just had general bad weather all the way around . It also took me over a month just to complete the aerobatics phase becuase weather would never get above solo mins . If I remember correctly each stud does something like four or five aerobatics solo 's and if they do n't get up in five days they require a warm up ride before they are allowed to solo . The five day rule also goes across the board for all syllabus flights and the IP 's took advantage of the giving studs 86 rides . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more self paced program to . If you were n't ready , you did n't fly . The sim phase is also seperate from the flying phase . I never flew and had sims at the same time .

My date of commission is on 24 Apr 2014 , after which my RPA training will begin that summer . <p> 1 . While digging around in the internet , I have found out that I am exempt from block 1 of training ( IFS ) in Pueblo , CO , and that I will go straight to IQC at Randolph instead . My ROTC Detachment NCO 's were not aware of this policy ( new as of Dec 2012 ) , so be sure that yours know if you are a RPA selectee , so that they can work on getting a waiver from IFS early on for you . <p> 2 .

Have you guys , or anybody you know , trained in my situation in IQC ? If so , did the civilian Instrument/Commercial pilot still have much to learn from the course ? <p> The person I talked to via a number on the IFS arrival guide , said normally a guy in my situation would not be exempt from IQC , and that often the trainees who struggled were often civilian instrument/commercial rated pilots . He mentioned struggles with the military side of aviation and struggling with boldface or whatnot . So he recommended that I still attend IQC for my benefit . <p> From the way he said it , it seems that in the past they have let some individuals passover IFS &amp; IQC and go straight into Block 3 ( RPA fundamentals ) , and that he was referring to their struggles there ? I 'm not sure . <p> This is a funny situation for me , as it is weird to think that I will have to do another instrument checkride for the FAA &amp; USAF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are probably wondering why I am wasting MY money on instrument training , if the AF is going to provide it . Well , I started it as my plan B if I did n't pick up a pilot slot ; which I technically did n't get due to nearsighted eyes ( good enough for RPA ) , but flying is what I want to do when I get out of the USAF. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 2 . Correct . Although you wo n't actually get an instrument rating and all of your flights are in a simulator . <p> 3 . We had a guy in my RIQ class who had his civilian instrument rating . He still had a lot to learn and the course was still challenging . For the most part you are completing the UPT syllabus in the sim with half the acrobatics and no formation . <p> 4 . Previously the only way you would be exempt from IFS was if you were a already a rated guy with your PPL . I had to go through the RPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Guys who make it all the way to the T-38 and wash out of UPT go through RIQ even when they have completed the instrument phase of the T-6 . <p> 5 . RFC is a joke , study a little , play lots of golf . I doubt anyone could struggle with it . If there was some magical way to show up at FTU without having completed some prior AF flying training you would have a tough time and your instructors would probably hate you . You really need the prior training to experience and adapt to the way the AF is going to train a pilot . To get the best training I would say go to IFS . That being said if you do n't need to go you are opening up an opportunity to wash out ( people with all levels of experience do ) . But if you would wash out of IFS you probably do n't belong anyway . <p> Maybe guys who graduate college with their instrument rating should go straight to IFF ? Sounds like a good idea right ?

You usually ca n't get the tanker to speed up between refuelings , so you are stuck at that speed .

I look forward to all the missions -- cargo or tanking . But if the KC-135 is n't that efficient of a people or cargo hauler , why does n't the AF buy a few squadrons of convertible or combi freighters to pick up the palletized airland cargo ? I 'm all for multirole airplanes , but it seems you could fit two or three times the cargo on a DC-10 like Fedex uses and have the same training regimen that the KC-10 pilots have . That way you 'd save the wear and tear on the true tankers . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The KC-135 was built for one main reason , to get the bombers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the art . That 's why Gen. LeMay bought so many . <p> Sure , the KC-10 is great for cargo , and it can up and haul a fighter unit lock , stock and barrel , but if I understand correctly ( and please correct me if I 'm wrong ) does not have the quick response starting capability of the -135 and never sat SAC alert for that reason . <p> Hopefully , the future tanker will be as tough and as numerous as the -135 and as versatile as the KC-10 , with it 's huge cargo area , receiver air refueling capability and built in drogue system separate from the boom .

Problem is they have no understanding of threats to our operations and are myopic in prioritizing fires or EW to enable those combat air assets . <p> The other issue people are missing out on is the airspace coordination piece . If you have to get up close and personal with targets ala Hawg with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area as all the gun target lines and support fire positions a ground force in a near peer/peer fight is going to not only have but need to be using especially if your threat defeat tactic is to get low . Not a lot of that to worry about in Syria/Iraq/Astan with the hybrid SF/Ranger driven fights we are waging . If they have indirect it 's pretty limited . A Brigade or Battalion movement to contact is going to have multiple PAAs and transitioning them to perform CAS may actually have a negative effect on the total battle area because we shut down fires or suppression or smoke .

@@43194886 @3194886/ <h> CSO vs . NFO <h> 25 posts in this topic <p> I have researched both of these occupations and it seems as though they are very similar do you know of any major differences ? I realize that both are in different branches of the military . And from what I have read transitioning from NFO to pilot is not possible whereas CSO to pilot is , however it is no easy task . I 've recently realized how narrow-minded my flying goals were ( ANG slots only ) and decided to open up to a more broad spectrum , AD Navy/Air Force , Reserves/Guard , and most recently the CSO/NFO career path . Sure , piloting an aircraft would be an awesome position to be in , however , I do not want to give up my dreams of flying because I was being intolerant to other paths .

However , do/did any of you find this unappealing or is it affecting any of you ? <p> 5 ) Within the same regards as question #3 , you can move from CSO into a pilot slot ... can this transition also take place into any other fields ? <p> I appreciate you all taking the time to read this post and hopefully give me some feedback on the case .

I just know that if cross-training into UPT does not work out I would MUCH rather be in a position that I know I will enjoy , such as CSO . I hear/read how hard it is to get a slot for UPT , I 'm just hoping I am competitive enough to get a CSO slot ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just to clarify , this is false ; ABM is 6 years same as Nav .

I am just saying there is usually more CSO selects than pilot selects and pilot selects usually have higher averages across the board . If you pick pilot only and there is 150 pilot slots and 150 CSO slots , you just cut your selection chances in half . If you just want to be a pilot , put pilot only but if you want to be an Air Force officer it only seems logical to put all the options you are able to . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Going a bit off topic , but I 'm considering applying for both NFO and CSO .

@@43194887 @3194887/ <h> 7 posts in this topic <p> Swiped from Otto 's LinkedIn . I remember reading this as a Lt maintenance officer . Timeless ... sport bitching and repeating history : <p> Anonymity , Accountability , Cowardice , and Courage . <p> March 4 , 2017- <p> In February 1992 , I was a mid-level O-3 ( Air Force Captain ) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Merrill McPeak was halfway through his tenure and he was unleashing changes and reforms that to this day are among the most controversial actions ever done to a single military service . From changing the " wing " structure , to shoving Total Quality Management down our throats , to a savage " reduction in force " and yes , the unveiling of a uniform reminiscent of an airline pilots , McPeak was seemingly unchallenged by history , his fellow generals , or even common sense . There were anonymous papers faxed around with criticism but no one dared put their name out there in opposition . <p> Multiple events were my catalyst but one day in my BOQ room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well it would never be published by the Armed Forces Journal a magazine I had read since ROTC . The assistant editor called and said it was being seriously considered and they needed a bio and photo and then hours later , West Point graduate , owner and publisher , the irascible Ben Schemmer called and said he was going to run it . In our call , he said there was great debate in his editorial meeting and some said I was just bitching but he said I was putting my career on the line and they were going to run it . <p> Ben told me I was going to lose my career , he said there is no tradition of disagreement in the US Air Force . I had heard that twice before , one at Squadron Officer 's School from AF Historian Earl Tilford who said the Air Force crushes dissent in all forms . He said as an Intel briefer during the Vietnam War , he was briefing about Operation Lam Son719 and he used the words the " Allies were retreating " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Butch " said he was right , retreat implies order and this was a rout ! He was tossed out of the office and became an Air Force historian . The other time was from Colonel John Guilmartin who was sacked as editor of the Air University Review who told me the Air Force leadership will never allow dissent , you tow the line or get crushed . <p> Hearing Ben tell me at that moment my career would be over , I gulped and said it 's worth it . Someone has to voice concern over McPeak 's idiotic policies . <p> The article was published and a few weeks later , a friend called and asked how I was ? I said umm , OK , and he said my article was the subject of a discussion at Air Combat Commander 's conference room ( he was a general 's aide ) and the view is I will receive a phone call telling me to resign my commission if I have any problems with USAF policies . I ran to Radio Shack and bought a microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd tape it and go on 60 Minutes . No call came . <p> A couple of months later at my next training location , I got a call from a Major General I had worked for and respected and he told me he and most of his fellow GO 's agreed with me but none would lay it out there publicly , as I had . Several years later , I was passed over for Major and kicked out of the USAF . I personally do not believe the article was directly related but that I did not do the careerism the USAF officer corps expects and my records were not competitive . Either way , I had prepared for that day but it still came as a severe blow . <p> Which brings me to today , it 's impossible to not turn on certain news shows or read the leading newspapers or websites without seeing news that is highly classified to include signals intercepts of American citizens . I 'm sure these leakers believe they are helping the nation , in their infantile minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so concerned , invoke whistle blower laws and go see their Members of Congress ! Is n't it telling that not a single individual has done this ? Or go to the National Press Club and hold a press conference . Instead , they are playing games with our national security . <p> There are often articles written about the need to write critical assessments of the military and none look further than our current National Security Advisor H.R McMaster and his book Dereliction of Duty . It did not hurt but most likely saved his career . I was able to get in the Air Force Reserve and retired a few years ago as a Colonel . <p> Stop the Leaking . Stop breaking laws divulging our national secrets . Stop putting the lives of our armed forces service-members and our citizens at risk . Or if it 's so important , do n't be an anonymous coward and stand for your principles . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Managed to take a swipe at Trump over 20 years ago , wonder what his politics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still goes on , last time I heard about it a few years ago , it was called the tiered officer concept , of which you were NEVER told what tier you were . - There were 3 of them , top/middle/bottom , and there were qualifications but that 's about all I knew . - Funny what drunk O-6 's will divulge. - 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The article gave good insight to the culture of the AF in the early 90s , but was almost all sport bitching with no real solutions given other than platitudes like- " Leaders , not managers are the key to success " and " Let 's use ' RL ' --Real Leadership ! " - Yawn ... tell us what that actually means . <p> I love the plug for Marines and their strong heritage vs our so-called confused heritage too ..

Ops tempo changes constantly and all the info they have is usually AT LEAST 18 months-3 years old . Not to mention a lot of the " quality of life " comes down to leadership at your base-unit level , and there is no way anyone at UPT can predict any of that . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The only differing perspective I have is that my wife and I have grown closer with all of these deployments and and being gone so much .

I 'm in ACC and we are ALWAYS on the road ... deployments , exercises , random TDYs for things like SOS , safety school ... you name it . Coming at it from a different angle , keep in mind that a lot of well-paying professional jobs in the civilian world require long hours at the office and out-of-town travel . The military often requires the same demands of its people , too . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Go with the mission and aircraft you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else .

I 'd hate to think what would have happened if I had just let it alone . <p> AFPC only scores once or twice a week . Your testing center is required to mail it within 1 duty day of testing and should send via certified/trackable post .

Average 7 days gone per month . And one 60 day deployment about every year and a half . Flying hours average 40 while at home and up to 135/mo while in the desert . When we do go on the road , we get to spend 24+ hours on the ground at each location . The fighter guys need extra rest on their drags and that gives us more time for drinking while TDY . The cargo haulers typically spend 17-18 hours on the ground and that leaves little time for sight-seeing and drinking . <p> Occasionally the KC-10 does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours with little effort . It 's nice to be able to cross the pond without getting refueled . All KC-10s are associate tanker wings , this means we have one active and one reserve squadron per squadron of airplanes . This gives us more bodies than required per airframe and makes it really tough to overwork us ( i.e. the family life is very good ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Can you also talk a little bit about the nature of the mission of the KC-10 ?

There seems to be a lot of information about the C-17s out there , so I am more interested in KC-10 information . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xtndr50boom <p> I wrote this in a pm to someone asking me the same things . It 's got some good nuggets if I may say so myself , here 's a copy of it . Good luck : <p> 1 . Depends . As a first year co , expect him to be gone about 150-200 days the first year . He 's got alot to learn , not just about the airplane but about how to operate his airplane in " the system " . He can be gone a couple days on a JA/ATT exercise with the army/marines , to a week or two for fighter drags . It all depends on the mission at hand . Once he 's gained some experience he 'll be thrown in an office job . Make sure he stays away from the executive officer job . Pure beauracratic ( sic ? ) hell . Best to ask for scheduling , life support officer , or better yet try to swing a job in training flight or stan/eval . Lots of knowledgeable brains to pick and it counts as an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Al Dhafra AB , UAE . Great spot to be in , for the desert . <p> 3 . Travis . I spent 5 years at Quagmire and it still boggles my mind how asinine the mindset over there is . The squadron 's are for the most part excellent . But the base support , atmosphere , local area are crap . Not that it matters , but IMHO the aircraft are better maintained here as well . McGuire always seems to be one step behind travis for some reason . The 9th I think is the best squadron here . But if he goes to the 6th he will have a better shot at becoming a fast-burner . They seem to be very career oriented for O 's in the 6th . At McGuire the 2nd is the best . The 32d is also quality but always seemed a little behind . Staying at the base depends on his career path . ops/ops/OSA-UPT IP , or ops/OSA-UPT/ops . Alot of the guys I flew with at McGuire are now here . They spent their 4 years there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 . Moderately close community . You know most of the people at the base you 're at , will meet the folks from the other coast . Best part is , no one is all in your business . It 's really what you make of it if that makes sense . We work moderately hard and party moderately hard . This part all depends on the friends he makes at the base . I still party with alot of the mcguire folks that come here . They 're a great bunch , but not full of themselves like some other communities . <p> 5 . Being able to fly a 5 hour sortie , land , and not feel like absolute crap . It 's VERY comfortable . You do n't have to use interphone to talk to the others in the cockpit , you only use it to talk to the boom in the back and vice versa . It 's got a large variety of missions , A/R both as a tanker and a receiver ( VERY challenging but also VERY rewarding ) , cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agencies like TACC and other supporting folks , and passengers . These include DVs . I 've flown with DepSecDef Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld , NATO Air Marshalls , the C-DRUNC ( Head honcho of the US army folks in S. Korea ) . That will get you ALOT of visibility from all parts of the DoD . Medevacs are stressful sometimes , but very rewarding as you can imagine . In a nutshell , we get the benefits of doing all that without the cons , ie , low levels in 120 degree southern arkansas , endless stages going to and from the desert , and the endless bag-drag you get in the T-tail world . What do I dislike ? Being the " reliability tanker " in the AOR . Since we 've got a receptacle and carry ungodly amounts of gas ( 340K ) we 'll sometimes just orbit over Iraq or Afghanistan for 12 hours at a time . Boring , but when the shit hits the fan who do they call ? That and the timid nature of some of the pilots . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for any mil aircraft in a combat theater . This was more a McGuire thing . They were very skiddish about doing tactics ; they literally drug their feet for years over this while Travis has been fully tactics qual 'd for years . The one thing your boyfriend also wo n't like is taxiing . You 're sitting 20 feet above the ground , your nose gear is 30 feet behind you , the mains 70 feet behind the NLG and you can just barely see the wingtips if you contort yourself enough . Those are the pains of the aircraft . But a bad day for us is when the coffee jug does n't work . <p> Overall , it 's a fantastic aircraft , with a huge assortment of missions and experiences to be had . I would recommend it in a heartbeat . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Tankerclown <p> DEFINITELY GO TO TRAVIS .....

Found plenty of threads about replacing our aging fleet , etc , but could n't find anything about what a typical day in the life of a tanker pilot is like . <p> First off , that 's funny . Especially seeing who edited your post . <p> - What would your typical day(stateside) entail ? <p> If you are a co-pilot you probably wo n't be stateside for very long because we are super busy flying right now . After you finish initial training , you 'll go on a fighter drag and a cargo run . After that , expect to deploy for 60 days . <p> - How are the missions and what would be your typical mission stateside/deployed ? <p> Stateside mission is pretty much limited to locals . You may do an occassional CONUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions--you 'll take off heavy as a mofo and hold over desert landscaped territory offloading gas to those needing it . Expect to fly 7-12 hr sorties here . Make sure you bring something to read or listen to . <p> - What are the deployments like ? <p> 60 day deployments in Al Dhafra , UAE . As far a deployments go , its definitly not bad . Expect to go every 3-5 months as a co . <p> - How is the community ? Is it pretty close and are the people pretty laid back ? Is there still a lot of partying going on like you would see on the fighter side ? <p> Great community . There are only 4 active duty KC-10 squadron 's in the AF , so you 'll get to know a lot of guys/gals in the -10 community . Partying like the fighter side ? Are you joking ? We do n't have roll-calls , but when you go on the road you can expect to drink plenty of adult beverages , if you like to do such a thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depends on where you go and if you 're flying that day , or if you have a additonal duty . You 'll fly probably 1-3 times a week depending on crew pos . <p> - How are the missions and what would be your typical mission stateside/deployed ? <p> You can do a Coronet ( dragging fighters to or from overseas ) , a Business Effort ( going down to Edwards for a week refueling F-22 's ) , Red Flag , we occasionally get Aeromedical Evac missions here at KSKA , and up here you sit Operation Noble Eagle alert 1/2 times a year for a week . We do also get other TDY 's that pop up from time to time . You 'll also do a lot of " other " training for our strategic mission . You can also evacuate people from typhoons and other natural disasters but AMC would rather have the airlifters partake in that . <p> - What are the deployments like ? <p> Depends on where you go again . If you go to KSKA you 'll go to Manas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . All other -135 bases go to the Deid . Deployments are usually 60 days cause you 'll time out fast hour wise . I 've seen some people get extended a few weeks after but it 's rare . Expect to deploy at least 2-3 times a year . You 'll usually get about 200-250 hours each time you deploy . <p> - How is the community ? Is it pretty close and are the people pretty laid back ? Is there still a lot of partying going on like you would see on the fighter side ? <p> Community as a whole is laid back . There are some still old Pilots/Booms ( especially at Altus ) that feel they are still SAC warriors . And you 'll get that feel going through our " other " strategic training ( think Dr. Strangelove ) . But overall the community is great . Very laid back . The -135 community leadership is starting to get a lot of MWS crossflows from the airlift side so I think the community will start changing . For instance my next Sq/CC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior C-17/C-21 guy . Most of our ADO 's are C-5/C-17/C-130 crossflows . Most of them are cool and shake their heads and question why traditional tanker guys do some of the things they do . <p> Overall it 's a great aircraft ( Boeing really overengineered it , semi-glass cockpit/great avionics ) , great people that fly on it ( especially Booms ! ) , and a great community .

Two types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . It is my desire to command at all levels , as an IDE select I was like to attend at the earliest opportunity followed by a tour on the Joint Staff . Following that assignment I would like to return to fly in a leadership position . My choices of preference are X , Y , &amp; Z. <p> or <p> 2 . It is my desire to serve my country and fly as much as possible . I would like to remain at this base for a long as possible . My choice of follow on bases is X , Y , Z. <p> Either one of these is acceptable in my opinion , honest feedback and expectations are the key . <p> Once you fill out the entire ADP ( there are several tabs ) , send it to your SQ/CC , THEN TELL HIM YOU DID ! The system does not notify the boss that you sent it . <p> When the DT meets they will consider your statements along with the endorsement from the boss as they make a future vector on where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed a chance to express your vote and it may be seen as " this person does not care , so let 's send him to a UAS " . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The first page is he hardest , selecting AFSC/Locs . You can select an AFSC and then multiple locs in rank order where you would like to go . At the top make sure you select the widget for which assignment preference you want ( 1st choice , 2nd et . ) After that it 's career vectoring ( like CH said above ) and finally your personal thoughts on what you want to do with a block for your commander below that . I believe the old T-ODP sent an email to your CC but I do n't think ADP does so give them a heads up . <p> Cooter <p> P.S And yes I 'm now an OG Exec ... I know me now but I 'm working for a former -111/-15E WSO that is bringing lots of perspective to a a place that lost it for a while . <p> 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he hardest , selecting AFSC/Locs .

Doing it before you arrive at your first assignment is overkill . Just do it when you get there and update once a year .

Just FWIW . <p> Otherwise all good advise . <p> Edited September 15 , 2011 by Kikuchiyo <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I work assignments for USAFE and work closely with the ACC &amp; AMC DT advisers .

Just FWIW . <p> Otherwise all good advise . <p> Since knowing your audience is so important when communicating , can you help answer that question WRT the ADP comments section ? Who has eyes on , other than the sq/cc ? Just seems like listing quals could be viewed as arrogant if read by a 20 yr senior leader . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Fair enough . The info I had was more from the guys that use it for DT panels than from the assignments guys . Both do use your ADP , but to slightly different ends . <p> For the assignment officers , having that info can serve as a mini-bio highlighting any special quals , skills , or courses that make you different . I 've seen them use the ADP that way at an assignment match , but did n't know they had specifically asked for it . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asked for it , then they must be using it . I 'll bring it up to Lude when I see him later this month and ask for his thoughts . <p> But both DT advisers that I know , and the O-6s that sit on the DTs , have specifically briefed not to list a bio on your ADP . The USAFE/A1 stated just the other day , the DT does n't really care what YOU say , they care what your rater and Senior Rater write about you . But he did caveat that by saying that what you write on an ADP can certainly affect specific assignment actions . <p> So , like Whitman said , it 's about knowing your audience . If you 're updating an ADP for a DT that you 're meeting , then write to that . Then once you 've got your vector , update your ADP again for the assignment team based on your vector and true preferences . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The reason Quals are important is some jobs require certain quals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the FTU . You must be an IP to go to Test . Certain assignments may request specific quals such as FAC(A) or Sandy . The only locations this information is located is in my gradebook , the LOX , and PEX . So Quals are important on the ADP ... but not as much as your leadership looking out for you . Caveat-CAF standard . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll tag this here although it could probably double in the UAS thread . The first UPT-D bubbas to UAS are up for reassignment . The process for listing a/c preference is an ADP . There are 9 different a/c available in this first drop . The process being somewhat UPT assignment-esque vs. a standard next assignment from an already established MWS makes the ADP sort of an oval peg in a round hole ( sts ) . For example , if following the ADP format and honoring the MAJCOM/AFSC/Location tier to listing prefrences , the five ADP slots can be taken up with only three a/c listed leaving six a/c unlisted due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little piecemeal on exactly how to make this whole thing work . To top it off , it 's been made known that while one may be released from UAS to AFPC , there still exists the possibility that there may be a " mismatch " at AFPC resulting in not receiving one of the available assignments . Due to the first set of available a/c being airframes only without any mention of location , our current guidance is to fill out the ADP with our first five preferences with no regard to correcty marrying MAJCOM and Location and use the comments section to rank order the remaining four airframes . So we do have guidance , however , this possibility for a release but then subsequent mismatch makes me want to make sure we have all of our ducks in the right rows so as to maximize our potential for receiving an assignment . <p> Based on this info , my own inexperience with ADPs , and the " oval " use of the ADP in this process , I do have a couple of questions for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADP process from the AFPC side who can elaborate on how an ADP used and submitted in this way might effect the process of assignment selection for UPT-D UAS pilots . <p> Essentially , will ignoring the MAJCOM/AFSC/Location tier format flag somewhere and cause a delay or worse the " mismatch " or will the people receiving the ADP understand what is meant and work through the ADPs in a logical fashion . If there is a mismatch or discrepency will the AFPC folks notifiy you or will it flag and force some sort of rejection due to inproper formatting , etc ? Lastly , is there a better way to submit our ADPs so that our preferences and intentions will be better understood and most obvious to AFPC ? <p> Thanks for any info and assistance in regard to this . As you can imagine it 's an oppurtunity none of us want to miss and I 'm just looking for ways to improve upon the guidance we 've received rather than attempt to jettison it completely . Additionally , this is sort of an ASAP inquiry as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ego <p> Edit : Mods , have n't been around in a while and did n't even know there was a full up UAS section now . If this discussion is better served in that section I will remove and repost. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'd have to imagine it will work like someone who gets an OSA or FAIP assignment out of UPT . Find out from your CC what airframes/locations are available , let him/her know what you want , and hopefully they go to bat for you . <p> I imagine it looks a lot like a FAIP model . Our SQ/CC 's a good dude and has done his best to keep us in the loop . It seems , however , that the flow of information ( probably to the Group ) is somewhat sporadic and sparse in some areas . I imagine a lot of it is based on this being the first iteration so no one has an exact bead on how it 's going to work . Just looking to see how this process might look from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best present our cases so as to maximize this opportunity .

You should n't have to pay anything back that you 've gotten for FT , like travel . Any uniforms you 've gotten from AFROTC should just be returned to your detachment and they should n't charge you for anything unless something was lost or became serviceable . If you 've gotten any AFROTC stipend money you might need to pay that back . I 'd double check with the cadre on that . <p> 2 . I think that if you intend to attend OTS , you 'll have to do all of it regardless of completing FT because you have n't actually commissioned yet . <p> 3 . Depending on how your cadre are in general , they may or may not be upset with you for trying to disenroll because you did n't get a pilot slot . I think your attitude of leaving other AFSCs for those who really want them is a good one to have , hopefully they 'll think the same way . <p> Keep in mind that AFROTC usually has reboards for rated slots for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so maybe improving your commander 's ranking or getting extra flight hours will put you over the threshold .

I wish someone told me about it 10yrs ago . <p> 3 . Make profit <p> 4 . If that does n't work , improve your commander 's rating . Your stats are good , which had been stated .

You want someone else to have a job that could help them get a pilot slot because you 're thinking about leaving ? <p> No , I mean I do n't want to take whatever AFSC I 'd get if I did n't get a slot , because I would be entering the AFSC without the desire to be in it , possibly taking it away from someone who does .

What is base housing like ? Do you get to " pick " which housing you 're in ? ( meaning : I 've heard that there are a total of three bases with housing available ) . Dave has seen Lakenheath housing ( and liked it ) . His friend was stationed at Mildenhall . Thoughts/opinions ? <p> Do NOT get base housing ! First off , much of base housing is not actually on base - when we were there , there was housing that was as far as 10 miles from base . The houses in England are small , and the base houses are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the outlets are 110V . There was a fairly new set of houses in ( I think ) Thetford that were actually pretty nice , but once you 're on the housing list , you have to take what they give you based on availability and your rank . If you turn down an on-base house , the clock starts ticking on how long you have to rent a house . <p> If you do want to live on base , Lakenheath and Mildenhall share many facilities , so there should n't be any difference for housing priority in being stationed at one place over the other . <p> Most importantly , living off base let 's you experience more of England - being within walking distance from the god pubs is always a must ! <p> 3 . All and all : What is something you wished someone told you about moving to the UK ? If you could change anything , what would it be ? What did you absolutely love/hate about being over there ? <p> A couple pieces of advice : <p> - Ship your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you think you can do without your car stateside and have your household goods packed , do it . It can take up to a couple months for that stuff to get over . You will be given three separate pickups - one for household goods , one for " hold baggage " ( several hundred pounds that goes via air and arrives quicker ) and the stuff you put in storage . As far as cars to bring over , do n't listen to people who say that larger cars wo n't fit - not true . We brought over an SUV and there are plenty of folks who bring over F150s , Expeditions , etc . They 're not a problem on the roads , but sometimes it is a tight squeeze in the parking lots . If you have a second car , that will be on your dime to ship it . <p> - Measure your furniture . With the houses being smaller , you may look at houses that have rooms where your stuff might not fit . When you 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also small ) to see if you can fit the larger stuff through . I 've heard stories of folks who had to cut king-size box springs in half in order to get them up spiral staircases to a second floor bedroom . <p> - Storage : If you can do without it for three years , leave it behind . <p> -- Put your large furniture in storage . We put our guest bedset , formal dining room set , and entertainment center into storage and it was a good thing we did . As I mentioned , the houses are very small , and it 's tough to find places that will fit large furniture . We have minimal room in our bedroom with the bedset and dressers . <p> -- Put your extra clothes in storage . The British houses do n't have closets , though you 'll get a few shrunks from the furniture office ( two for each military member and one per dependant ) . Each shrunk is only a few feet wide , so there 's not a whole lot of room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . <p> -- Put your small 110V appliances ( stuff that costs less than about $30 ) and appliances with motors ( vacuums , washer/dryer , microwave ) in storage . Anything that is not dual voltage needs to run off one of the bulky transformer that furniture office will give you . Even if it is dual voltage or running off a transformer , the difference in volts/amps will eventually burn out the motors . <p> As far as the good and bad , we loved most everything about being over there , but particularly the travel . Take advantage of the cheap airlines ( Ryan Air , Easy Jet ) and see as much of Europe as you can . For living , Newmarket , Cambridge , and Bury St Edmunds were popular locations with nice towns and a good nightlife ( Cambridge more so of the three ) . They 're all roughly south of the bases , but the first two are closer to London and the airports . <p> That 's what I can remember off the top of my nugget , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to think back a decade and give you some answers . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We plan on living off base-- for year two and three .

It was still in effect when we PCS 'd and we tried something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do a sort of " pre-quarantine " so we would n't have to lock up the pets for 6 months when we got there . Problem was , the vet we used did one step out of order and the Brits did n't accept our paperwork . Whatever the current system is , make sure your documentation is perfect . As far as the vehicles go , a smaller LHD car is doable , but keep in mind that commutes will be along narrow country roads and it will be very diffucult to see around that JCB ( tractor .... they 're all over the place in East Anglia ) to pass from your seating position . If I had it to do over , I would 've sold my US spec vehicles beforehand and stuck with RHD . If you have kids , consider looking in Ely . Nice village , not too far from base or Cambridge and you can get more space for the money . It will still be much smaller than what you are used to though .... just be prepared to adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live in Cambridge . Big picture , nothing compares to living overseas .

No reason whatsoever to need a year to " adjust " to ENGLAND . Amazingly , the people speak ENGLISH . Just like you and me they eat with forks , count on their fingers , and like puppies . Depending on what kind of commute you want and how close you want to have the conviences you are used to , I 'd look at Cambridge , Bury St. Edmunds , and Newmarket first - those are larger towns that will have things you are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of charming villages closer to base , but they wo n't have anything more than a pub and a post office . <p> You can drive an American spec car easily enough , but you do have pay for the adjustments you have to make them street legal . Roads are different over there though - in general rural roads are more narrow and will have tall hedges that block curves . Gas is more expensive too , so getting a British spec VW or Rover that gets 45 mpg might end up saving you thousands of dollars vs. bringing over your SUV . I bought a 4-door when I got there for around $3K off the lemon lot , then sold it when I PCS 'd a year later for $2700 . The lemon lot will be FULL of cars for you to chose from , in addition to the local dealerships . <p> The one thing I wish I knew when I went there ?

We lived off base in the village of Aclonbury Weston in a 385 year old house called Grange Farm . It was awesome . Do not live on base unless you have to . <p> The village was great . We had a great local pub and the best butcher shop I 've ever seen ... once I figured out when the hours of operations were ( actually , it seemed so random I never really figured it out but I did stop in whenever I saw they were open ) . The thing about living " on the economy " is you have to get used to the fact that the Brits are 40 years behind and working half days to catch up when it comes to some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say we had an outstanding experience and we made some lifelong British friends , including our community midwife ( we had a child born in a British hospital and it was a fantastic experience ) and her husband who happened to be an RAF F-1 pilot . <p> I sold my cars before I went over there because everyone told me the roads were too narrow and I would n't be able to get parts . We got short notice orders ( Desert Shield hurry up and get here before we actually deploy ) and I panicked and sold our 2 year old Accord and my 1 year old full size Bronco . Big mistake . they would 've both been fine and I ended up buying another Accord and a Mazda 626 that went through three engines in two years . The parking lot at the squadron was full of SUVs when I showed up the first day . I wish I had never sold my cars . <p> We left our 225lb St Bernard home in the States with my brother . I could n't see locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good call . <p> The time may be right to buy a house because of the exchange rate but I 'm not sure about the current market over there . There were guys who PCSd out that made over $250k on their houses because they showed up when the dollar was strong and the housing market was weak . Most of the people I knew who owned houses when we shut the base down were in the oppostie scenario ( bought with a weak dollar at the top of the market ) and they simply had to walk away from their houses , leaving the keys and a note to the bank on the kitchen counter after the movers had their HHG packed and in the van . I never heard of anyone having that follow them credit wise back to the states but that was a long time ago and times may well have changed . So , it depends . There is some risk of losing whatever equity you invest up front , just like here . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strongly echo the posts that say ship your stuff early , live off base , and buy a British car . <p> The DEFRA website linked above is a great resource for shipping pets . I shipped two large dogs ( 100 lb+ ea ) . I did n't have any trouble , but it was n't cheap . PM me if you want specifics . Get started on that NOW though . You do n't have to put them in a kennel here for 6 months , but it is still a 6 month process . <p> I brought a Ford Escape over here before . It was like driving an Expedition in the States . Certainly doable , but parking lots and back roads are a pain in the ass . My suggestion is have the AF ship your car and have your husband buy a used car from the lemon lot . You can then decide later which you prefer . <p> Do n't live on base . The less you have to do with the housing office the better . They are not there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bureaucracy that exists to save the taxpayers money at your expense . Yes , I 'm a little bitter . Living off base means I have little to do with them . Also , getting base housing does n't mean you 'll live on base . You could find yourself living in a house off base provided for free . Additionally , there is old crappy housing that the base ca n't get rid of . There 's a new push to get people to live there , so be prepared . They offer the crappy house to you , and if you refuse they turn off TLA and refuse to pay OHA . Which means rent is entirely on your own dime with no housing allotment . That effects the E-1 to E-6 crowd , but an O-2 or O-3 might get burned as well . Hopefully that housing surplus will be cleared out by the time you get here . <p> Check out www.rightmove.co.uk for a great house hunting resource . I second the recommendations for Bury St Edmunds and Cambridge . The further you get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live half an hour from base and have a decent yard with a large house by American standards . My wife and I had committed to living out in the country though with our large dogs . <p> We 've got a 2 year old girl who we send to British day care once or twice a week . When she turns 3 we can get a voucher to send her to a local school . We can also wait until she 's normal school age and send her to the Kindergarten on base . Lakenheath has a normal American school system . <p> What I 've found causes the most frustration for people is expecting it to be just like the US . While it is a first world Western country , they move at a slower pace than in the US with reduced hours . Do n't expect to have companies falling over themselves to get your internet installed tomorrow or being able to go to Walmart to shop at midnight . <p> It 's an awesome opportunity and it sounds like you 're taking advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed questions . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have n't read all the replies here yet and my military info is a bit out of date , but I was stationed at Mildenhall 95-98 , got out and stayed in the UK for the next 12 years so can offer a couple of points . <p> First piece of advice - put that American iron monster back on the market and pick up a used car when you get to the UK . Sure , it 's fine on most of the roads , put try parking that beast in the middle of Bury or Cambridge and you 'll wish you 'd left in on your side of the oggin . ALL parking spaces in the UK are the width of a compact car +6 inches . If you even take a 2-door coupe , you 'll struggle to get the door open far enough to get out . Practice going through the window . Used cars are n't cheap , but they can be found in great condition and , like everything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things between inbound and outbound mil folks . <p> Appliances - refridgerator . Leave yours behind . Unless you want to put it outside and be the redneck family in the village ( Trans Am on blocks optional - see point above about American cars ) . It wo n't fit in 98% of British kitchens . Get used to a fridge/freezer about 2/3 the size of an American one . Same for washer and dryer . The UK units fit under the countertop in the kitchen and you can get a good used one for about -100 . Dryers are n't quite so common due to space , but again , pick up a used one when you get there . Check all of your electronics - most are dual voltage these days and , if they are , will work just fine with a plug adapter . For most of the other stuff you can keep a transformer or two in the kitchen and bedrooms for things you ca n't live without but , again , most of the usual domestic stuff you can get used from outbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is PAL capable . Many of them are multi-system these days , but if yours is n't , box it up or sell it ( it 'll be obsolete by the time you rotate back stateside , anyway ) . <p> Living on base - do n't be so bloody daft ! What 's the point of going to a first-world overseas location if you 're going to live in Little America ? The other thing is that time will disappear around you over there so hit the ground running . Your first year will be up before you know it and you 'll wonder what you were ever thinking about living onbase . <p> Live off base - no question . Especially go for some of the smaller villages where you may trade convenience for character and community , but it is a trade well worth making . They may not have the walking-access to shops ( but they will ALL have a pub and , really , what more do you want ? ) . I lived in Dalham for 2+ years and was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was pulling pints behind the bar at The Affleck Arms and knew most everyone in the village . And they all treated me like gold . The housing stock is hugely varied from wicked cool and interesting ( friends rented the old Mildenhall train station ) to horrible little boxes on a postage stamp . On this issue , get some really , really good advice from someone in the area about buying versus renting . When I was there in the late 90s , finding rentals was a problem due short supply . Buying may well be a good idea now with the housing market tanked , but the prices will still make your eyes water once you convert to dollars . Think carefully and talk to a lot of people about it even before you leave . Do n't waste time with a year on base to get used to it . Seriously ? <p> School - not an issue until high school . Send your little one to the local school . It 'll be a great way to meet local people and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be surprised if your tiny Yank develops a cute little English accent while you 're there . <p> Dogs and renting ? The Brits themselves love pointing out the irony that it is the " Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children " but it is the " ROYAL Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals " . But that also means some snooty locals may stick their nose into how you handle your dogs , so be prepared for a little unwanted supervision on occassion just on the off chance you run into said snooty local . <p> General stuff : <p> Space in the house . There is n't any . Get used to it . To practice , buy a camping trailer and live in that for a few months . After that , a British house will seem cavernous . As an example , the NCO housing at Mildenhall , before we did some major renovations in the late 90s , had galley kitchens that were so narrow that you could n't open the oven and the fridge at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smaller than your current living room . Only useful for planting a few flowers in , really . British homes generally are really tightly packed . They would put a whole village , including pub , shop , and church , in the space of a normal American single family plot . But , the plus side of that is that there is still a lot of green space , especially in Suffolk around the bases , so you lose in your living space but you gain in your surroundings , if you know what I mean . <p> Britain does a lot of things differently than we do . That does n't make it right or wrong , just different . Some of their bureauracracy will leave you stunned but you will have no choice but to succumb to it . The locals all do , they just know about it beforehand . They over-engineer the hell out of everything they touch but it usually works ( except the electrics on a British car . 100 years of practice and they still ca n't get that right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head or you will go mad off base . Cost of living in the UK is bloody high and getting higher . Shop on base as much as you can for the stuff you need , but do go out to the market towns and spend a few quid out there . Just accept that a dollar does n't get you what a quid ( slang for the pound ) used to . <p> Pubs . Not just for alcoholics . Pubs do not have a direct translation in the US . Especially in villages and urban neighborhoods , they have a social standing and community role that no place in the US equals . They are where drinks are drunk , rounds are bought , friendships are made , stories told , life happens . Do not underestimate the importance of the pub to your experience of the UK . Find a local you like and become regulars . It will enrich your time there immeasurably . <p> Eating out , especially at pubs , is pretty reasonable . The beer is wonderful . All of it . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still all wonderful . Make a habit of hitting village pubs as often as you can . Many will welcome dogs . <p> Well , that 's about all the pontificating I can think of right now . Feel free to PM me if I can be of any more help . As I say , my USAF knowledge is going to be a bit out of date , but I just left the UK last year and can fill you in on life in general a bit . In any case , enjoy the place . I envy you going over for your first time . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> One thing I 'll add that nobody else has : after about a month in , go buy an Ordnance Survey map of your village and go for a walk to a rural pub . Britain has a wonderful system of walking trails and they 've mapped their country to a ridiculous level of detail . There 's something fantastic about taking a walk with the dogs to a small local that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Live off base . No reason whatsoever to need a year to " adjust " to ENGLAND . Amazingly , the people speak ENGLISH . <p> Is that the language they speak over there ? Could 've fooled me . Of course they 'll tell you they invented the language .... whatever . Just remember to put some randoum " u " s in when spelling and you 'll be ok . Two nations separated by a common language . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> About the dining experiance of England , for God sakes do n't eat at a Wimpy Burger you will be disappointed . If you like Tex Mex in the states learn to make it yourself and hopefully the large Commisary on Lakenheath has what you want . Now if traveling and you stop in a small village aroud lunch time Pub Grub is the way to go . I remember when we had a shop barbecue at somebodies house off base it seemed like pray call for the Brits to come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grill . A good rule of thumb is that Catsup is about as spicy as a Englishman cooks with . Cucumber sandwiches and prawn flavored crisps are not bad . Mildenhall village had a good Chinese takeout when I was there plus alot of Indian cusine with all their curry dishes . Plus in the larger citys like Cambridge they have a Pizza hut and McDonalds Etc . Anybody , does Mildenhall still the Maurder pizza place it was good ? Plus the bowling alley on Mildenhall made a decent burger . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Air Force telling people base housing must be filled first because of " Budget restraints " . I 'd do everything you can to get around this . <p> Only get to spend time there when broken on tail swaps . Would give a major part of my anatomy to be stationed at the box D. <p> Unfortunately , I heard this is for true for all ranks until they get up to 98% occupancy , which might take a while . Living out in town is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope they do n't take that away . If you can get off base , I highly recommend Bury St Edmunds . You can walk everywhere , Abby gardens , pub on every corner , great restaurants , plenty of shopping , movie theatre and friendly people . Good luck Kayla ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Great advice all around . If I may add , make a concerted effort to meet as many Brits as you can . They are really a great people , friendly with a good ( albeit sometimes wierd ) sense of humor . I enjoyed not only being stationed there , but the couple of trips I 've been able to make back . <p> If it were more affordable , and I could have my guns for sporting purposes , I 'd seriously consider moving back ! <p> Enjoy your assignment , and do n't waste a second of it as it will go by quickly ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Another update to the mandatory on base housing is that it would only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out on the economy . <p> I went to the Mildenhall/Lakenheath Spouse ( club ) page on FaceBook , and from what I read on there , it 's for E7 's and below . I went to the Lakenheath website , and it had a section for " Housing rumors " and the wing Commander addressed the rumor of making people stay on base ... from the gist that I got , it was for Enlisted peeps only . Neither articles actually gave a rank , though . I only heard/read the rank on the Spouse page . <p> Anyone know for sure ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Theoretically it applies to everyone , but most officers qualify for bigger housing , so you wo n't be forced in there . The memo said SOME O-3 's and below MAY be affected . I do n't know what the exact cutoff criteria are though . <p> The best way to find out would be to have your husband call the Housing office via DSN and ask if he 'll be affected by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his grade and number of dependants . You could call yourself commercial , but then you 'd have to pay or the international call . <p> PM me if you need the phone number . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I sat through a staff meeting on Friday about the new housing policy . The E1-E6 memo ( to maximize occupancy of Lord 's Walk , a just-off-base dilapidated housing area ) is a directive underneath a broader initiative to guarantee 98% government housing occupancy . <p> So to be clear , everyone is affected by the new initiative . When you arrive , you will be offered government housing . New inbounds will be prioritized to move immediately if there 's an available house . The officer waiting list is maxed-out to move people off-base to on-base , but if you get here and there 's an open house , you 'll bump people out of the way ( since the wing has to use its own money to move people from the economy to government quarters ) . <p> If you move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not be able to move off base and receive OHA . So make sure you know what you want before you get here or figure it out quickly during your 15 days of TLA . <p> FWIW , we lived on the economy in Bury for the first 9 months and then moved on base to new Lakenheath housing ( Liberty Village ) prior to heading downrange . It turned out to be the best move in our situation due to some pregnancy complications that developed while I was deployed . If you have any family members on EFMP , you may be seen on base at Lakenheath or at Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge . <p> I have no idea how the ops tempo is on the Mildenhall side of things , but get some honest feedback from your sponsor and some friends that are already over here . You ( and your children if you have any ) will be the ones spending the vast majority of the time in your house and relying on the services of the surrounding community . <p> PM if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ! <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Couple of questions about England . For TV 's I 've read some about NTSC vs PAL . My tv is somewhat older and it says PAL-N and PAL-M but I think UK uses PAL-I and it would n't be compatible . Is this true ? Is it easy to just buy TVs over there and not go through the hassle of trying to get converters or whatever you need . Also , for single guys is Cambridge worth the drive or do a lot of people stay around Bury and Newmarket ? Thanks .

Out of the 21 of us that finished Tweets , 2 of our 4 Marines wanted jets , 1 of our 2 Navy guys wanted jets , and most of the Air Force assignables wanted T-38 's . Of course this changed for various reasons . A couple discovered the C-130 mission and others became frustrated with the maneuvers , the formation phase , etc . We knew we were only getting 4 T-38 's for our 13 assignables , so guys were exploring a lot of options knowing that their first choice might be out of reach . <p> The staff at the 8th , although not fighter MWS heavy , is very T-38 FAIP heavy . We had 4 T-38 FAIPS and a former Viper driver join us to balance two Cobra guys and our C-5 guest help , so nobody was there trying to talk anyone OUT of a fighter , if that 's your concern . Also , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys to the T-38 track based on ability and aptitude . <p> We had a night just prior to track select where MWS guys from all walks came and spoke to us about the lifestyles , and that helped a lot of guys finalize their decision . Bottom line from that night was no matter who you are or where you go , you 're probably going to be wearing a tan flight suit sooner than later . <p> I am guilty of trying to talk a couple of guys into joining me on the T-1 side , not because I think fighters are bad , but because they were good dudes , and they were good to have around .

The closest anyone gets is having a FAIP who has a fighter follow-on . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for primary . It sucks that people are turning down fighters because they are wooed by the heavy crowd . Think about it , how much planning do you do , then brief , and debriefing , just to go to C3 for a 1.2 ? You can generally count on a solid 8-10 hours for a 1.2 , start to finish . Maybe less for CT . Then go do your additional duties for a few hours , ancillary training , and do n't forget to come in on Sunday to get ready for Monday 's morning flight . I 'd personally do twice that for a 1.2 , but it sounds crappy at first , especially if you are forced to be in the Tweet flightroom for 12 hours with nothing to do . The idea of endless travel with minimal planning and low stress can sound pretty appealing , and so the rebel force managed to take over most of my Tweet class . <p> Oh well .

Anyway , my impression during tweets was that the type of flying you enjoyed most had the largest influenced on what you were going to put down as your first choice for track select . If you really loved formation and Gs then there was little chance a heavy driver was going to convince you to put T-1s first . On the other hand we had a dude in my tweet class that graduated top stick , but his nose was so big he never got a seal with the mask , and he hated Gs ! ! Needless to say he was happy to put Tones as his first choice . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Agreed somewhat on the FAIP comment , although we had some pretty stand-up guys for FAIPS , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the Air Force " looking kids and they were pretty senior as well , but my main point was that the climate at least in MY flight was to get solid dudes who did well and put forth the effort what they wanted , and most of our solid dudes wanted T-38 's . There was no steering of the flight , only individual coaching . I spoke the RC/KC side , the F-16 guy spoke the fighter side , our USMC guy spoke what he could about wht he 'd seen , our reservist spoke the bomber side , and so on . We had a pretty good mix . <p> I do n't doubt that heavy cheerleading does n't happen due to the lack of fighter guys in Tweetland , but I never really saw it . <p> Toro , thanks for the clarification on the tan bags .

I do n't want to get in only to have her support me ( I have her full support , but I know that does n't necessarily mean she 'd be happy with it ) until she realizes it 's a strain and such after a few years . Would she be able to stay home and not have to work ? I know the salary is n't the greatest , but it would be about what our standard of living is now if only I worked and she stayed home with the kid ( if we lived on base ) . <p> I need all the input I can get on this .

There is a ton of info on there about being a military wife , what it is like to go through UPT with your husband , etc . <p> Everything you have asked depends . My husband was a EWO on the RC-135 before UPT/ANG . Some years he was deployed 200 days . Some years he was deployed 45 days . It can change every single year . With RC 's you do n't move very often . ( Offutt is the only RC-135 base ) . <p> Your finances will dictate whether or not your wife can stay home , not your salary . Do you have student loans , two new cars and credit cards out the wazoo ? Then probably not .

My squadron is making an effort to keep non-deployed TDY to a minimum . At home you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a JAAT . <p> My wife and I had about $15K in debt from student loans and other things ( she lived off of credit cards in college ) , plus two car payments . By the way , do n't do two car payments unless you have to , it sucks . I got my new car because I needed something to replace my old car ( xmsn was going out ) and have room for a stroller . Then we accidentally had our second child and her car was inadequate , so we got a mini-van a year and a half after I got my car . <p> Anyways , as parents of two kids , the child care costs basically made her working moot . So she quit to be a full time mom . I was a 1Lt at the time , and it put a damper on our pocket books . We barely made it by till I made Captain . <p> We were making inroads to paying of debt ( I was prior C-21s , so not too much TDY to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Rock will finish it off . <p> As far as home life , fighters probably is better these days .

I 'm sure there are differences among pilots of different weapons systems , but what are they exactly ? Do fighter pilots work 12+ hour days all their careers while those that fly heavies work only on weekdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Here is what life is like for a typical F-16 pilot.I had the same question so how this helps . <p> Typical Day flying : <p> Show up about 1 hour prior to Mass Brief ( unless I need to do more mission planning ) . Mass Brief is 2.5 hours prior to takeoff . We brief for about an hour . Step , Start , Taxi , Arm Up takes about an hour . Most local sorties are between 1.0 and 1.5 hours . After landing is about 30 min . Tape assessment is about 45 min . Then debried can last 1-3 hours . If it 's an upgrade ride then it will be longer . A CT debried can be real short . Then you have to see if you 're flying the next day . If so then you need to start mission planning for the next day . So the flying part takes about 6-9 hours + the mission planning time ( 0.5 - 2.0 hours ) . These are average times and usually you can cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time management . In addition to the flying duties you try to squeeze in some non-flying duties ( email , etc ... ) so that you stay on top of stuff . <p> Typical Day not flying : <p> Depends on your job . I started out as a scheduler and it was n't too bad but some people hate to be schedulers . Other shops include Training , Weapons , Stan/Eval , Mobility , Life Support , Safety . And if you 're a LT then you 'll have SNACKO responsibilities ( snack bar , party planning , cleanup , beer purchasing , squadron cleanup , etc ... ) . If I 'm not flying then I 'll usually spend about 8-10 hours at work . I shoot for 8 hours but sometimes you get real-time tasking and you have to complete small jobs before you can leave so you find yourself leaving at about the 10 hour mark . The only time I stay longer than 10 hours is if I also have to fly that day OR if I 'm double or triple turning ( 2 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to be long days . Non-Flying duties usually involve lots of email , paper pushing , reading and adhering to Regs , studying for an upgrade or for self improvement , attending academics , etc ... I could get real specific into the jobs of each Shop but I 'm not sure if that 's what you want . <p> If someone tells you that they hate flying fighters because they barely fly and spend 12+ hours at work 6 days a week then my response to that is they need to get better time management . I definately do not neglect my life outside flying so I make it a priority to NOT do work at home and to NOT do work on a weekend . There are very rare exceptions to this ( such as upgrade rides that I need to prepare ) but I am definately satisfied with the fighter lifestyle . The one caveot , I think it is fairly high-paced so I seldom have time to just vegitate in front of the TV or do other things that waste time but are relaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 4+ times a week , go camping or rock climbing on the weekends , watch a movie every once in a while , leave work at 3 and go down to the beach for the afternoon , read magazines or books for fun , plus other random hobbies . There are some people who do n't have a life outside of flying but I 'm definately not one of them . It 's all about prioritizing . <p> 25 .

Larger crews = More officers per squadron = less qweepish $hit to do individually when not flying . People that have ligit jobs in the squadron ( i.e. scheduling , training , stan eval ) often put in standard 10 hour days . If you are a slug in the squadron then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership will recognize this and ship you out for a non vol ALO/UAV tour and their earilest convienence . Mission planning takes up one whole 10-12 hour day . Then flying take 12-16 day pending mission length and debrief times . B-2 world ? well you can probably imagine , less officers = more qweepy $hit to do besides flying = 10-12 hour days . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> I guess I come up short in the " who has it the toughest " dick measuring contest this guy started . <p> A-10 guys never work more than 6 hours a day unless they 're flying and then it 's only 4 hours a day . No brief or debrief . Show up , see if there 's an open spot on the schedule , go fly around , go to the bar . <p> If A-10s did fly in combat they do n't get their asses shot off like the Herc or bomber guys .

EvilEagle is right on with his analogy of why things are so tough . A huge part of the stupidity of USAFE was the flying hour program .

Then we realize our ASD is too high so we take off the tanks and fly 450 KCAS to and from the area and log a 0.8 . And when we realize we are n't going to fly enough sorties , we surge ( each crew flying 2-3 times with a hot pit refueling in between ) . While I was there , surging was not an exception ... it was the norm ( at least once a month ) . I sat in on a weekly staff meeting with the WG/CC , OG/CC and SQ/CCs and the WG/CC said that the USAFE/CC ( Fogelsong ) had , in not so many words , called him a pu$$y because we he did n't want to up the sortie count for the next year . Despite the fact that we are already pulling 16 hour days , he wants to save face , so he agrees to up the sortie count . Following the trickle down theory , the vice OG/CC tells us at the next aircrew meeting that training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one guy takeoff , pulled closed and land .

After the war it served Tactical Air Command , then inactivated . <p> Fourth Air Force is a Numbered Air Force in Air Force Reserve Command ( AFRC ) . It is an intermediate echelon responsible primarily for all Air Mobility Command ( AMC ) gained AFRC air refueling units in the United States and AMC gained AFRC strategic airlift units in the western United States . <p> Formed in the United States during World War II to provide air defense and combat training for the personnel of newly formed units . After World War II , Fourth Air Force was assigned to the reestablished Air Defense Command , later to Continental Air Command , and back to Air Defense Command . From September 1960 to January 1966 the organization was inactive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 Fourth Air Force reactivated as a part of the Air Force Reserves ( AFRES ) . <p> The Fifth Air Force ( 5AF ) , with headquarters currently located at Yokota Air Base , Japan , is one of very few numbered air forces of the United States Air Force never to have been based in the United States itself . It is also one of the oldest and continuously active US air forces . <p> The 5AF had its origins as part of the Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) , which was formed in The Philippines in September 1941 under Major General Lewis H. Brereton . Immediately after the outbreak of the Pacific War in December , Brereton sought permission from theater commander Gen Douglas MacArthur to conduct air raids against Japanese forces in Formosa , but was refused . As a consequence , FEAF was largely destroyed on the ground by Japanese air attacks . Following the Japanese invasion of the Philippines , the remnants of FEAF relocated southwards to bases in the Dutch East Indies . After those islands also fell to Japanese forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> United States Army Air Forces units in Australia , including FEAF , were eventually reinforced and re-organised following their inital defeats in the Philippines and the East Indies . In August 1942 , under the command of Major General George Kenney , the new Fifth Air Force was organized as a component of the FEAF , with headquarters in Brisbane , Australia . The 5AF , along with the Thirteenth Air Force ( the other main combat command of the FEAF ) devastated Japan 's air , land , and sea forces in the South West Pacific Area for the remainder of World War II . Using General Kenney 's innovative and devastating low-level parafrag , strafing , and skip-bombing tactics , the Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces played a major role in pushing the Japanese back to their home islands by 1945 . Shortly after World War II ended in August , the 5AF relocated to Japan as part of the Allied occupation forces . <p> In 1950 , from headquarters still in Japan , the 5AF became the main United Nations combat air command during the Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that formally ended that conflict in 1953 . <p> The Seventh Air Force ( 7 AF ) is a Numbered Air Force ( NAF ) under the Pacific Air Forces major command ( MAJCOM ) of the United States Air Force . 7 AF is also the air component of United States Forces Korea . 7 AF 's headquarters is located at Osan Air Base , South Korea . The commander , Seventh Air Force , is dual-hatted as commander of the combined Air Component Command ( ACC ) , part of the US-Republic of Korea ( ROK ) Combined Forces Command ( CFC ) . <p> As part of the U.S. Air Force 's plan to establish Warfighting Headquarters ( WFHQs ) , 7 AF will evolve into a Warfighting Headquarters for United States Forces Korea . <p> Eighth Air Force is a numbered air force ( NAF ) of the major command ( MAJCOM ) of Air Combat Command of the United States Air Force and it is headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana . <p> In World War II , it was a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in western Europe from airfields in eastern England from 1942 . The Eighth Air Force was commanded during World War II by Major General Carl A. Spaatz , Major General Ira C. Eaker , and Lt. General James H.

It later became the United States Air Forces in Europe . <p> The present Eighth Air Force began its existence as VIII Bomber Command and received its current designation when the original Eighth Air Force redesignated to United States Strategic Air Forces ( USSTAF ) . It engaged in combat in the European Theater of Operations during World War II and moved to the Pacific Theater in the final months of the war . Eighth Air Force served Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) after the war , both in the United States and overseas until SAC was deactivated , then served Air Combat Command since June 1 , 1992 . <p> The Eighth Air Force 's now commonly-accepted nickname , " The Mighty Eighth " , derives from the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. 8th Army Air Force " ( Doubleday and Company , 1970 ) . Freeman died in the fall of 2005 . <p> Ninth Air Force is a Numbered Air Force in Air Combat Command ( ACC ) . It is headquartered at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter , South Carolina . It is an intermediate echelon responsible primarily for fighter units in the eastern United States . The Ninth Air Force also serves as the Air Force component of the United States Central Command . <p> The Ninth Air Force began life in the United States as a numbered close air support command . This establishment became the major tactical air force in the European Theater of Operations during World War II . <p> Most of the Ninth Air Force was created from USAAF units which had been part of the U.S. Army Forces in the Middle East ( USAFIME ) fighting in the Egypt-Libya Campaign in late 1942 . As the Ninth Air Force they were initially under the overall command of AFHQ in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations . In 1943 they moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1943 .

Since World War II , it has provided air defense in the Far East , primarily the Philippines , until the 1991 eruption of Mt . Pinatubo forced the closure of Clark AB . Numerous Thirteenth Air Force organizations participated in Southeast Asia combat operations in the 1960s and 1970s . <p> Fourteenth Air Force , also 14th Air Force ( 14 AF ) , is a Numbered Air Force ( NAF ) of Air Force Space Command ( AFSPC ) . It is a functional echelon dedicated to space systems operations , responsibile for missile warning , space surveillance , and range operations for the Department of Defense , NASA , and commercial space launches .

Since its transfer to Air Mobility Command in 1992 , Fifteenth Air Force has assumed responsibility for airlift and air refueling missions . <p> Sixteenth Air Force is the Warfighting Headquarters for United States Air Forces in Europe ( USAFE ) . It is headquartered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating agency , Sixteenth Air Force has served both Strategic Air Command and United States Air Forces in Europe . The Sixteenth Air Force has been the operational air force for USAF combat operations in the Balkans since its move to Aviano AB , Italy , in 1992 . <p> In 2005 , Sixteenth Air Force moved to Ramstein AB , Germany to become USAFE 's new Warfighting Headquarters . Currently the 401st Air Expeditionary Wing , responsible for ongoing U.S. Air Force contingency support in the Balkans , is the only wing assigned to Sixteenth Air Force in its new role . All other wings that were assigned are now assigned to HQ Air Command Europe . <p> Eighteenth Air Force is a Numbered Air Force in Air Mobility Command ( AMC ) . It serves as the warfighting component of AMC .

Later , the Eighteenth AF received other combat units in addition to troop carrier wings . On January 1 , 1958 Eighteenth Air Force was deactivated and Twelfth Air Force absorbed all of its resources . On October 1 , 2003 Eighteenth Air Force was reactivated at Scott Air Force Base . <p> Formed after World War II , the Nineteenth Air Force served Tactical Air Command between its creation in 1955 and 1973 .

In its most recent form , it was Air Mobility Command 's intermediate echelon for units in the eastern United States , Atlantic , European , and Middle East theaters . On October 1st , 2003 , Twenty-First Air Force was redesignated Twenty-First Expeditionary Mobility Task Force ( EMTF ) , a new organization below a Numbered Air Force . <p> Created as a wing of the USAAF during World War II , it gradually evolved into its modern designation of Twenty-First Air Force . Initially , it ferried aircraft , but by 1942 , its mission had changed , as it is today , to airlifting personnel and cargo . <p> Twenty-Second Air Force is a Numbered Air Force in Air Force Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible primarily for all Air Mobility Command ( AMC ) gained AFRC theater airlift units in the United States and AMC gained AFRC strategic airlift units in the eastern United States . <p> Twenty-Second Air Force can trace its lineage to World War II . Prior to and during the first part of America 's participation in World War II , the organization ferried aircraft . After World War II the organization operated as a subordinate echelon of the Military Air Transport Service ( MATS ) . When MATS was redesignated Military Airlift Command ( MAC ) , the organization was designated Twenty-Second Air Force . After the U.S. Air Force reorganization of 1992 , Twenty-Second Air Force continued as a subordinate echelon of Air Mobility Command . In 1993 , Twenty-Second Air Force was transferred to the Air Force Reserves ( AFRES ) to replace Fourteenth Air Force , which transferred to Air Force Space Command . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Okay , so I know the definition of a Numbered Air Force , but can somebody explain to me why we have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it . But if they 're simply a staff asset to run things , why do n't we absorb them into the MAJCOMs ? And why in the hell do we have MAJCOMs that only have one NAF ? Is n't that kind of like having an Ops Group that only has one squadron ? What the hell is the point ? <p> Got talking about this in light of all the budget cuts .

Look at AETC for an example : You have the 2 AF in charge of basic training and a bunch of tech schools and then you have the 19 AF which only focuses on flight training . I think the jump from a MAJCOM to the wing is too big and it 's a way to specialize and allocate assets . <p> On the other hand looking at AFSO which was under MAC as the 23 AF ( 1983 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now the 23 AF is back ( 2008 ) under AFSOC . <p> Just look at it as more non-flying staff jobs , so you can make Lt Col one day . 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I honestly ca n't tell , was that a vote for shutting down all NAF 's or justification for their existence ? The forms said my sarcasm detector was intermittent today , so I 'm just checking . After all , AOCs are a weapons system . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It seemed to make sense ( at least on the space side ) having a general in charge of space operations and also being dual hatted as the commander of the JSpOC .

Take USAFE , for example . While Gen Brady ( USAFE/CC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly delegate oversight to one of the other 10-ish GOs in USAFE . While the AOC works for the NAF/CC , we have little to do directly with the rest of the A-Staff and we are a self-sufficient entity . <p> Something like this came up recently where methods of combining duplicate forces was plotted out to see where we could cut funds . Bringing the AOC under the MAJCOM/CC was one of those propositions . It creates a whole new ( even more ) confusing system of **32;1430;TOOLONG , etc. , but the bottom line is it 's doable . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I did a PACAF exercise at Hickam a few months ago and I was amazed at the inefficiency of having AOCs subordinate to a NAF that seems like it only exists just to house the AOC . Especially when the MAJCOM commander was at all of the meetings , along with the NAF and AOC commander , anyway . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> In the AFGSC case , the two NAFs owned by the MAJCOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To have the care and feeding of bomber wings left directly to a missileer ( or vice versa ) without a commanding GO in the mission area involved would do a disservice to the mission . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> In the AFGSC case , the two NAFs owned by the MAJCOM accomplish very different parts of the ' deterrence ' mission . <p> True , but I would tend to agree with the dissolving of the single NAFs under a MAJCOM . The NAF staff could easily be absorbed into the MAJCOM staff to accomplish the same missions . It would mostly allow for the cutting of a bunch of higher level NCOs and officers ( O-5 and above ) who accomplish similar missions . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> True , but I would tend to agree with the dissolving of the single NAFs under a MAJCOM .

It would mostly allow for the cutting of a bunch of higher level NCOs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Same question occurred back in the early 90s regarding Air Divisions . Back then , you had a command echelon known as the AD between the Wing and the NAF . AD ran the functions on the base , and the Wing came underneath it , oftentimes when there were two Wings at the same base . For example , Luke AFB was the 832nd AD . The two flying Wings , 58th TTW ( F-4/F-16 ) and the 405th TTW ( F-15 ) fell underneath the AD . IIRC , the " one base , one wing " concept was the demise of the ADs <p> Other ADs were the 831st AD was George AFB , 833rd at Holloman , and 836th at DM.

According to the USAF Fact Sheets ( lol ) , The Eagle allegedly has a higher thrust-to-weight ratio 1.12/1.30 compared to the Block 30 Viper 's .0898/1.012 ( depending on powerplant ) and lower wingloading ( only 83% ) than the Viper ( Block 30 , at least ) . I assume these figures are for an equivalent configuration , and I 'm assuming they 're not skewed . <p> So if someone with some aeronautical knowledge could tell me if higher t/w and lower wingloading necessarily translate to a shorter turn time and/or turn radius for two aircraft at the same initial IAS ?

The two exceptions were in some of the CT missions : A-10 guys had a little less proficency at ACM , and F-15C guys had a little less proficiency at CAS . <p> As far as the standard multirole IFF missions .... based on what I saw with IPs dropping " nerf bombs " at IFF , there were two factors that offset each other : <p> - IPs that came from bomb-dropper MWSs had an immediate ability to " see the wire " and it was easier to make corrections to parameters .

Is it easy for someone with good grades , a PPL , community service , etc. to get a pilot slot through OTS ( depending on the needs of the AF ) , or is it a total crap shoot , and ROTC is much safer ? Like I said , I 'd much rather do OTS because I 'd have the option of going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guard option . But , I wo n't risk a pilot slot over it . What are your opinions . <p> EDIT : Sorry if this has been discussed before .

The odds are much less compared to ROTC . Getting a slot through ROTC generally is not that difficult provided you put the effort in , get good grades and do n't get arrested . If I had to do it again , I would n't change a thing . I know there are many people who are happy having gone to the guard , OTS , etc . I 'm just telling you what has worked for a large portion of the pilot force . OTS and guard guys are definitely a far lower number .

Guard UPT boards usually want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so of graduating . <p> To the OP : Despite what some may say , the Guard route is not necessarily the golden ticket to the chocolate factory . There are still some hoops to jump through ( with greater consequences ) . Example : I was recently picked up at a fighter unit with the Guard - went to AMS ... day one , was eliminated by not having proper form on the last of my sit ups ( 4 short of the min ) ... max points for waist , almost maxed the push-ups , etc . Done - no if , and , or buts , that was it ... end of the road ... no more pilot slot . Four sit-ups killed my opportunity . Obviously , if I would have performed better on the PFA , I would n't be sharing this . <p> ROTC is a great option - do n't throw it away without extremely good reasons if your end goal is to fly in the AF. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Go to a large football school in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in something you enjoy and would n't mind doing if the AF thing does n't work out .

Turns out K is a regular instructor and T is a formal training ( FTU ) instructor . It also answered my second question - certain models within the same airframe do have different AFSCs . <p> There are actually more , but those are the primary ones you 'll find in a flying squadron . <p> You can hold more than one prefixes , and some prefixes trump other ones . In my last squadron we had a pilot who was a WIC graduate ( W11M3B ) but he was also an Evaluator ( Q11M3B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to three ) will always be W11M3B because it out trumps and holds more precedence than a Q11M3B . The Evaluator AFSC was made his secondary , so by pulling his SURF you would see both of his AFSC 's on there . Having more than one AFSC does help for instance because some Sq/CC 's and DO 's are only line guys , not Instructors or Evaluators. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've yet to see any impact at all on anyone 's job prospects , career progression , promotions , assignments out of a secondary AFSC . <p> If you are going for a job that requires a specific AFSC that you used to have at some point in your career , they will be able to see it on your duty history even if it 's not up at the top of your SURF/DVB/etc. 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've yet to see any impact at all on anyone 's job prospects , career progression , promotions , assignments out of a secondary AFSC . <p> If you are going for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at some point in your career , they will be able to see it on your duty history even if it 's not up at the top of your SURF/DVB/etc . <p> Hacker 's right , it does n't do anything for your career , etc .

I seem to remember 11F ... something or other . Maybe it was because I was a FAIP . <p> I 'm positive - just double checked my records . I was a FAIP also - my AFSC went from 92T0 ( T-38 student ) to T11K3D ( T-38 IP ) , then back to 92T0 as an IFF stud . <p> 92T0 is a student pilot . Pilots in IFF are now rated . <p> Correct , but you 're not yet a fighter pilot ( 11F ) and you 're no longer a T-38 pilot ( 11K ) , so you are back to being a student pilot . I merged this thread with a previous thread on AFSCs - reference the link from C-17driver to AFMAN 36-2105 . Page 14 and 15 list out the 11-prefixes and 39 lists 92T0 as a pilot trainee .

I give you +5 points for persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll do the best I can to reply in this format with as much info as possible . I know you all do n't need or want a heavy sales pitch , so i 'll try to avoid that . <p> The most popular loan program we help people with on at present is the VA 30 year fixed loan . <p> While every loan situation is different , the dominant interest rate people are getting on a VA 30 year fixed is 3.75% at present . Rates have been in this range for the last couple of months . One never knows for sure how long they 'll last , but that 's what we 've been able to do recently . On a 200K refinance loan that would create an APR in the range of 3.80% . <p> To speak to our competitiveness , every place that originates VA loans has different fee structures to get the same rate . One thing you 'll find with us is there are n't any fees payable to the bank on any VA loan . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding fee if that is applicable . If anyone would like me to get a specific quote for you , you can PM me if you 'd like . <p> I did want to answer the specific questions too . <p> Daynightindicator - the VA IRRL definitely sounds like a good option for you to explore . You can often structure a VA IRRL so the bank absorbs all the closing costs for you so you do n't have to significantly raise your loan balance . As far as your second question about a 2nd VA loan existing at the same time , I would answer that as a " maybe " . The VA gives a pool of eligibility that each existing loan takes up a portion , or all , of . It really depends on loan amounts for both loans you are looking at having at the same time . The calculation for this is somewhat complicated , but I 'd be happy to help get you an answer to your specific situation if you would like to do a follow up post with the loan amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wraith - I 'm not sure exactly what you are referencing with USAA . But we do have options where the bank can absorb all the closing costs for you so it 's truly a no cost loan . ( not just rolled into the loan ) We are n't able to go beyond just paying all the closing costs and give cash on top of that . <p> nsplayr - Sorry about that very late checkup on our part ! <p> Let me know if there is anything else I can answer for any of you !

And I agree with your statement about putting 20% down being better in the long run . <p> If a borrower does have 20% down the only way a VA loan would be superior is if they were exempt from the VA 's funding fee . That only occurs if the VA has granted a service related disability to that veteran . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the VA option becomes a very competetive alternative to the FHA loan . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If a borrower does have 20% down the only way a VA loan would be superior is if they were exempt from the VA 's funding fee .

Only VA loan I would do is the 5% down option . 10k down ( on 200K home ) but saves $1500 on the funding fee ( 4500 vs 3000 ) .

It was build to get vets into home ownership without them having much cash on hand . It beats the pants off of FHA loans and probably anything requiring PMI . If you can put up 20% down , then you 're pretty much of the market for VA loans and really should just be looking at the myriad of private institutions . <p> There 's a few other limitations to VA loans that I 've run into : 1 ) you must occupy the property , so you ca n't use a VA to fund a second home / income property ( though you can refinance your current home to a VA then use that available equity to fund a second home ) 2 ) The home must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) The VA loan can only be funded up to about 103% of the home 's value ... so you ca n't buy an undervalued home ( read : one in need of many improvements ) and roll what ammounts to a construction loan into it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We have had some good referrals from your network over the last year or so , and I appreciate that a lot . <p> I did want to give everyone an update with some of the inquiries we are receiving this last week . There is a lot of interest in the VA streamline refinance , for obvious reasons , as rates are currently in the 3.75% to 3.80% APR at present . <p> One big question we are getting is whether an appraisal is needed . I thought I 'd explain that to everyone here . <p> The short answer is " maybe " , which I know does n't help much ! <p> The long answer is that the VA does n't require it , but sometimes the existing lender will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , Bank of America is one existing lender that is strict in this area . <p> However , Wells Fargo , Citimortgage , US Bank are all pretty flexible on not requiring an appraisal ( sometimes USAA loans are actually serviced by US Bank which does make them eligible for not needing an appraisal ) . Fortunately , a lot of people fall in that second category . However , I know what people really care about is where they personally fall ! <p> But even if an appraisal is required , they are really just making sure the house is n't considered " upside down " . <p> So to sort of summarize the lengthy explanation . If you think you are " upside down " then we can really only help you on the VA IRRL if you are fortunate enough to have an existing lender that is flexible ( like the ones I listed above ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For instance , Bank of America is one existing lender that is strict in this area .

I 'm guessing you went to them directly , as about a year ago or more they changed their requirements for banks that do business with them making the only way outside lenders like us to get it done is with an appraisal . <p> That does bring up a good point though , that if you have a loan with BofA , and an appraisal is likely to mess things up , that giving them a call definitely ca n't hurt if you are in the market for a VA IRRL. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm working with Dave Devine at NBOKC on a VA loan . 3.75% and a $5500 rebate is a sweet deal .

To fit my schedule , the closing was even done at my house and after business hours by a local notary ! <p> I refinanced from an original loan rate of 6.0% to a 3.75% rate ( 3.8% APR ) , saving approximately $350/month . Closing costs were $2700 , including an appraisal since my original loan was from Chase . <p> I will be purchasing a new home in about a month and am eager to work with Amy again for a second VA loan since everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your VA loan/refi needs - it was an EASY process that will save me a good deal of money .

It sounds like they 've bit hitting the blue kool aid a little too hard . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selection , then maybe she should n't put arbitrary requirements on you . If you still feel like fighting that battle , dip your toe into the world of Air Force queep for a minute and reference AFI36-2013 , which is what governs the OTS selection process . LONG ... Nowhere in that document or on the AF Form 56 does it say you 're required to apply for any specialty you 're not interested in . I 'd politely bring that up and , if she still wants to be a douche about it , move on to a new recruiter . You could always try to push up her chain , but even if you get your way it 's just going to make her resentful and less willing to work with you . Technically , she 's within her rights to not submit your application because she does n't think you 'd make a good officer due to that , it 's just a really shitty reason to pull that card and she should choke herself . Its your life , not hers . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is you can retake the tests . Even if you do n't , scores are only one component of your application and there 's a long list of people that have gone on to pilot training with scores people would generally consider less than ideal . I 'd still encourage you to apply if you can find a recruiter that will submit on your terms and let the board decide , but otherwise I think you 've got the right idea in biding your time a little bit . Declining a selection for a job that you 've listed is going to DQ you from future boards unless you get a waiver which most recruiters probably are n't going to push for ( As opposed to turning down something you did n't list that they offered you anyway . That 's totally kosher . ) It 'll give you time to study , retest , fly towards your PPL and get super smart on the whole process so you can submit a baller application . The PPL is n't mandatory , but I think it will help quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't necessarily pay huge dividends in UPT or anything , but having a license exempts your from IFS . That means the Air Force does n't have to pay up for you to go to Pueblo and it saves money and time , thus making you a more attractive candidate . Plus , the boost you 'll get on your PCSM is a nice bonus . <p> Finally , just a plug from personal experience , if you do end up pushing with this recruiter and her absurdness , there are worse things that can happen to you than getting picked up as a CSO or something . I had a crappy GPA but a strong overall application and ended up wtih a CSO/Nav slot at 28 years old . I 've done some awesome shit in the Air Force , had a blast , got the chance to apply for UPT once I was in and got picked up with an age waiver at 31 . That may not be the route for you and that 's more than okay , but keep that in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . Where there 's a will there 's away , you know , and if you get smart enough on stuff you can make some crazy stuff happen . <p> Anyway , thanks for the info. - I'm- trying to find a decent flight school that wo n't break the bank- and that actually has flight instructors who can find the time to fly .

@@43194917 @3194917/ <h> MEPS Criminal History <h> Question <p> Just had a quick question about the DD2807-2 you have to fill out for MEPS . There is a question that asks if you have or have any history of being arrested or other encounters with law enforcement . I 'm guessing they left that part ambiguous as to try to elicit as much information as you remember . I know for the medical and criminal history I was trying to remember ANY time I 've even spoken with a doctor or police officer . I put down as much as I can remember , but I 'm wondering what they 're actually going to be looking at . I am not so much concerned about my history as much as I am me forgetting about something that is a non-issue that I just put in the back of my mind . <p> So here 's the scenario ( not my scenario , but much more serious than mine , and a buddy said I could use it ) : I was inside my mom 's house as a juvenile- when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town , got suspicious , and called the police . The police came , ordered me out of the house , and placed me in handcuffs until they could verify my story . Long story short , they verified my info and story with my mom , and told me that she instructed me to go home ( to my dad 's house ) - and that I was in big trouble . They laughed and said that it was better to be in trouble with her than the law , and that I would look back on this in months/years and laugh . <p> Anyways , is that the type of story that should be disclosed to MEPS ? Or is that something where you keep your mouth shut because it wo n't matter if they find it later anyways ( since- it was n't a criminal activity ) ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> 8 answers to this question <p> I do n't have anything that is even more than $180 , and definitely no drug/alcohol violations ...

@@43194920 @3194920/ <h> 2017 Active Duty UFT Board <h> 79 posts in this topic <p> Starting a thread for 2017 Active Duty board . There is an annoucement out on myPers and packages are due in November . One change from last year is that if you are medically eligible , you must select and rank all of the rated positions ( Pilot , Nav , RPA , ABM ) . So basically if all you want is pilot and you are offered something else and decline , then you will no longer be eligible to apply to- future boards . There is also a website on the AF Portal with some raw data on the selectees from the previous 3 years . Interesting to note that of the 14 who were selected last year , all 14 had PPLs . Food for thought. - <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just from talking to the dudes who got picked up in FY16 , I think PPLs and scores were the two biggest deciding factors last year by a long shot . I have n't seen the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it backs this up . <p> I was fortunate enough to grab a slot last year , even though I had plenty working against me . I was on an age ETP at about 32 years old and , honestly , outside of picking up DG out of the BUFF FTU , I felt like my bullets were pretty run of the mill for a rated guy . I was #1/3 out of the squadron and #2 out of 35 or so from the wing ( I never saw the final strat , just heard the approximate numbers from the exec ) . <p> Where I shined , I think was that I had a PPL and my test scores . My AFOQT and PCSM scores both took a nose dive after I commissioned so I studied my ass of and retook both . Despite feeling like a douche taking the AFOQT as , you know , someone who already qualified as an officer , I walked out with a 97/98/94/96/82 and a 96 PCSM when all was said and done . I know for a fact there were guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strats to me , so I 'm pretty convinced the scores made a difference . <p> In short , definitely check your AFOQT and PCSM scores if you 're thinking of applying ( and retake if you can/need to ) and go get a PPL if you do n't have one . I honestly think those are the two biggest keys to success all things considered . Good luck bros , and if anyone needs help with the age ETP thing or needs anything else just hit me up . <p> - <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll echo the above sentiments . I too got picked up on that board , and it seems like my strong points mirrored his . I 'm also a rated guy and DG 'd my training program , have my PPL , did n't get the best wing strat as far as application packages are concerned , but I had a 99 PCSM and a 97 Pilot AFOQT . So it seems to me that 's the common theme , as well as as the fact that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backgrounds. - If you do n't have good AFOQT scores , go get a study guide and retake it . Then retake the TBAS if you need to , build some flight hours , and your PCSM should shoot up pretty high . I also have an ETP , but for a medical issue .

I wish they would forgo my original TBAS since it was taken 7 years ago . <p> Try e-mailing AFPC.PCSM@us.af.mil explaining your situation . I just now kind of wrapped my head around what your situation is ( sorry , I was just kind of browsing the thread earlier ) . <p> Long story short , I took my TBAS about 7 years ago as well . I did abysmally . I took it again after 180 days was up and scored a 92 . When they rescored everything , it dropped back down to a 78 . I 'd already taken the TBAS twice , so I e-mailed these guys when I decided to apply to the UFT board last year asking what I needed to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and said I was authorized a retest because of the version change , even though the FAQs page on the TBAS site seemed to imply I did n't . I took it again and scored a 96 . Shit was awesome . <p> Your situation might be different since you 've taken the new version already , however I 'd shoot them an e-mail and see if you have any recourse based on your situation . If anything , they may allow you an outright retest since the guidance is n't crystal clear with the new version now -- or you might be able to get a waiver pushed through if need be . Remember , you can still update your scores even after the cutoff for application submission up to a certain point , so if it takes a while it still might be worth it . The worst answer you can hear is you 're f 'd and stuck with your score , and in that case I 'd encourage you to still push forward with your application . You never know what 's going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFPC is super adamant that people do n't get discouraged by the ridiculous average score/selection rate last year . You might still be competitive with other things in your application and not even know it . <p> Also , just for reference , I retook the AFOQT as well . My pilot score went from a 90 to a 76 when they realigned the scores . So when I took the TBAS again , it came back in the low 80s . When my new AFOQT scores came back with a 97 pilot score or something like that , it shot my PCSM up over 10 points . The weight they 're putting on the AFOQT seems to be much heavier than it used to be . <p> Again , good luck man . <p> Edited August 1 , 2016 by gohornsgo <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> What I 've told my guys who want to apply is this - think about not getting selected right now .

" - Thankfully , the FCII waiver is very achievable . <p> For FCII and Trained , Kidney Disease stages 1-3 are waive-able and all exams can be accomplished locally , Stage 4 requires a TDY to WPAFB ( ACS ) and waiver is unlikely. - Stage 5 is not waive-able. - You will need a recent Nephrology consult . <p> Contact your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AF-approved Hypertension and Pain medications available to you , and make sure you are taking the right meds. - You need to demonstrate control on these medications for the waiver to pass. - The list is known as the " Official Air Force Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications , " last updated on 30 May 2015 . <p> Separate of all this is the ( non-flying ) Accession/Retention standard for the Air Force. - I believe you are very lucky that you are currently serving , and you must not have a break in service in your conversion to the AF. - AFI 48-123 para 4.2.1. would not apply to you because you are already Commissioned. - Therefore , DODI 6130.03 ( Accession ) does not apply , just the normal retention standard of the Medical Standards Directory , which states : <p> J11 - Cystic kidney ( polycystic kidney ) , when renal function is impaired , or when ongoing specialty f/u more than annually is required . <p> Because you are well controlled and at the earliest stages , I think you might get away with not needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably need to push a waiver for you and it will similarly probably be approved. - Get your gaining unit to write a nice memorandum of support , including some statement of needing Pilots to meet mission requirements and that you are excellently qualified among their applicants. - Those letters do help . <p> If unfortunately your condition and prognosis is poor , you MUST get any LOD benefits through the Navy. - The Air Force Reserve would deny your LOD because the Navy owned you at the time of diagnosis and development. - Are you AD Navy or Reserve Navy ? <p> Finally , I looked for similar cases in the AF flying waiver system and your chances are very good . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If unfortunately your condition and prognosis is poor , you MUST get any LOD benefits through the Navy. - The Air Force Reserve would deny your LOD because the Navy owned you at the time of diagnosis and development. - Are you AD Navy or Reserve Navy ? <p> - <p> Finally , I looked for similar cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good . <p> Great information , thank you !

You would be ill-advised to present an air of " you guys suck " or the common " it 's not fair " puling . You must politely highlight impropriety in execution of written guidance . <p> Was the syllabus executed in proper sequence ? <p> Was the syllabus executed with proper flight durations of each ride ? <p> Did you have too few IPs ? ( could teach only one way , did not know various techniques for success , etc . ) <p> Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no constructive , useful critique ) and then get slammed ? <p> Were any of your IPs brand new ( inexperienced ) ? <p> Think seriously about your skills . Should you be flying a different aircraft or mission ? Would I want my best friend flying as part of your crew or on your wing ? Would I want my wife flying in the aircraft you were piloting ? What is the likelihood that you will kill yourself or someone else ? <p> Know the FEB reg ( 402 ) ... your defense attorney likely will not be very familiar . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> From what I can tell from your other posts , you washed out of a fighter RTU . From my experience , unless you have clean cut syllabus deviations in your gradebook THAT WERE A FACTOR TO YOUR PERFORMANCE you are going to have an extremely difficult time getting back in the program . I 've been on an FEB board and I 've personally written an AETC fighter syllabus , so I know that they are written with lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parade , but I just do n't want you to get your hopes up . <p> An AETC fighter syllabus has very little latitude in terms of " syllabus implementation " that you could argue . They are pretty black and white , exactly for this reason . I 'd say it 's very unlikely that they did n't follow the syllabus flow , since GTIMS would have caught it beforehand ( assuming F-15C , F-22 , or F-16 ) . That 's ( unfortunately for you ) the only leg you 'd really have to stand on that might work . Your opinion as to how you think it SHOULD have been implemented wo n't count unless they clearly violated the letter of the law . And that would have had to directly had a negative impact your performance . For example , if they screwed up something with your radar academics , but you washed out for defensive BFM , it would be a pretty tough sell that the two were legitimately related . You never got defensive BFM academics , but washed out in defensive BFM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't win that one . Techniques vs procedure ? not going to win that one either . Did you execute IAW 3-1/the brief ? that 's all that matters , along with the course training standards ... which by the way mostly point back to 3-1 and defer to the brief . Breaks in training ? Might have a case , but only if they did n't give you ADD rides when they were REQUIRED to ( as opposed to " OG/CC may approve ... " ) and you had some trouble in that phase . <p> Remember , the board is going to consist of IPs from your base , genarally dudes from another squadron that you did not fly with . they 'll understand the syllabus from an IP perspective . You wo n't be able to sneak much by them . <p> On Bud Day ... he has zealously represented some dudes on FEBs in the past . Having said that , the standard story is that he tried to burn down the barn to get his boys reinstated . As a result , he has pissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to try and paint all the IPs as idiots/miserable failures/dishonest liars/etc . Reference previous paragraph . The board consists of IPs . How would that go over with them ? <p> Start with the area defense council . If he 's retarded AND you really believe in your heart that you have a factual case ( not just an emotional one ) , then hire someone . But I 've seen many dudes waste serious coin on FEB attorneys ... they 'll take your money regardless of whether you have a case . Realistically , almost zero FEBs result in reinstatement . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest TwoDogs <p> FEBs at RTU bases happen more often there than say a regular unit . Talk with the SJA at your RTU he probably has the process down pat , and he will assign you a JAG . From what I 've heard FEB 's are love fests , where they love the guy , they just do n't want him flying fighters . So talk it over with legal council and see what your options are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in your next transition . If you fight it and the end result is the same , it may not be so good in terms of good will . So honestly look at your case and be your worse critic , and see if there is any truth to your current situation having to do directly with your skill set .

Rumor mill now is that the AF is just going to kick everyone with a pending FEB decision out . <p> First off , it is not ususual for a FEB final determination by the 4-star to take 4-6 months . Remind your bro that FEB findings are only recommendations , and the Convening Authority for the FEB and the MAJCOM 4-star are free to concur or nonconcur with that recommendation and determine just about any of the possible outcomes for the respondent . In other words , just because the FEB recommeneded your bro be retrained to a different airframe , that does n't obligate leadership to do that . <p> Second , FEBs have nothing to do with retention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has to go to a Board Of Inquiry ( a.k.a. a " discharge board " ) , which is an entirely separate process from an FEB . Even if an officer were to lose his wings at an FEB , the 4-star would have to initiate an entirely separate process to start and execute a BOI . BOIs are a whole additional legal process that takes place in a courtroom with another panel of senior officers , etc. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I just spent four months of my life serving as a recorder on a FEB and know way more than I care to admit . <p> After the board adjourns , much time is spent waiting for the court reporter to produce the transcript .

When one washes out of our FTU because they just ca n't hack single-seat fighters , leadership often- offers them a waiver to the FEB . The terms of the waiver are generally acceptance of an ACC crew aircraft , basically anything but single seat fighters . Not sure how the B-15 fits into the mix . The WG/CC is the waiver authority . <p> Sometimes the waiver is not offered . - A dude washed out of my FTU class and was not offered a waiver because he washed out for reasons that the leadership deemed " safety of flight " problems . - They went after his wings . - His own words - it was the shittiest experience of his life . - He won and got a B-1. - That 's my only data point for a waiver not being offered . - If problems are due to SA and safety of flight , the waiver may not be offered . 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> ( all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTU washouts come through the schoolhouse ... ) <p> - <p> Hope all works out for the best .

This is the first time I 've heard anything about this - anybody know if there 's something to this or if this is just something the rumor mill coughed up ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Well , there 's not anything official other than the OQE and the 1122s , but the IPs definately can have input as you described it . There 's usually a few things that happen in this process . <p> 1 ) While you ca n't really let anybody below the FAIP/Fighter cutoff line get a fighter or FAIP , it CAN go the other way .... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for various reasons ( there might be several people who do n't deserve to be above the line , but the way a bell curve works , obviously not everyone is going to be that low is--this is just one reason ) but the IPs do n't feel that person is ever going to be safe in a single-seat aircraft or is not the kind of person they want to work with for the next 3 years as a FAIP . If this is the case , they often can " influence " ( read : change ) assignments around . I believe this would usually happen before the SNR ( or whoever does assigments at the UPT bases ) runs though the list to make assignments , but changes have happened as late as few hours before assignment night . I do n't think they would ever make anything type specific ( saying a particular student Joe can fly a Eagle , but do n't put him in a Viper ! ) though . <p> 2 ) They often can " massage " ( as my SNR put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the class do n't want to FAIP , so they are left with a dilemna . You do n't want to make the guys the did the best take a assignment they do n't want , but you also do n't want the guys at the bottom training new pilots for the next 3 years , so they have to find someone in the middle . They then ask the IPs who they think would make the best FAIPs and sometimes even talk to some of the potential FAIPs , and then they make their decision from there . <p> Having said this though , I want to add that I 'm still very new to the IP world and assignment process .. if I 've given any incorrect info , any current/former AETC IPs feel free to jump in and correct me ... <p> As far as being notified before assignment night , it depends on the SNR and the student , and where the FAIP slot is . Some guys want it to be a suprise , no matter what it is . Obviously if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , they would n't tell you unless the two were n't together ( I had -38 in my top 3 and the -37 was n't number 4 .... they told me ahead of time ) . It kind of depends on what you want . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Unofficially , the IPs have a huge say in the ranking . Officially , it is the Flt/CC who writes the recommendation , but it is after hours of consulting with all the instructors in the flight . <p> For guys finding out where they are before assignment night , it seems like the trend for about as long as I 've known has been to leave it a surprise . When I went through , our class was told exactly what was in the drop and were we ranked before the drop . At the drop , we were teleconferenced to the other two bases ( Sheppard was n't included ) and you stood up in order or ranking to pick your jet from what was available . Shortly after , they changed to keeping everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance what everybody is getting , but it 's up to him whether he wants to tell the students - or even the IPs . While I was an IP at Columbus , no Flt/CC ever revealed this to his IPs . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Metalhead <p> Yup , right on . I 'll throw in some more for your reading enjoyment . : rolleyes : It 's a lonnng-assss post but some good info for you studs . <p> It 's pretty much the norm at XL that the Flight Commander let 's the IP 's in on what the drop is . The studs are told a day or two what the OVERALL drop is ( meaning for Laughlin+Vance+Columbus ) usually , and NOT specifically what 's allocated to Laughlin . That way the studs can fill out what they really want , and not try to game their drop as much . <p> For instance : " Well the FC told me I 'm #7 and there are 5 C-17 's and I think there are 5 or 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really what I want too , but I 'm probably not gon na get one . So I 'm gon na put C-5 's down as my #1 ' cause there 's only 1 of those . That should give me a better chance , since I do n't want a KC-135 . " <p> You hear that some times , and the reality of it is the FC MAY be able to trade a C-17 for that C-5 with another base if , for example , there was another kid at that base who wanted a C-5 over a C-17 . Happens . So usually the Stud 's are n't told what is specifically slated to the base . Just the overall . <p> Now to answer the 1st question . Is there anything official that let 's the IP 's influence what airplane you might get ? Yup . 1st let 's look at what governs the IP 's , etc : <p> AETCI36-2205 Formal Aircrew Training Administration and Management <p> 5.14.3 Track Assignment Procedures : <p> 5.14.3.1 ... The student 's assigned IP will make a training recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight commander will concur of nonconcur with remarks . ... The recommendation will be based on each student 's demonstrated skills and potential to complete advanced training . <p> Continuing on , The SQ/CC will ... <p> 5.14.3.2.3 ... provide the best match of the student 's skills , potential , desires , and available training quotas . Students will receive their first choice of an advanced training track if it is available and if the individual student 's IP and flight commander recommend the student for that track . <p> AF Form 3849 is the preference worksheet . <p> What you should realize when reading this is -- it allows IP / flight commander(FC) subjectivity to enter into the picture . If you score high enough to get a T-38 but your IP and/or FC do n't think you have the potential to handle it . They can deny it . Delve deeper : <p> 5.15.2 MWS Assignment Procedures : <p> 5,15,2,1 ... students will complete AF Form 3849 , indicating their choice of MWS aircraft . The assigned IP will make a first assignment instructor pilot ( FAIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student 's demonstrated flying and interpersonal skills , maturity , and potential to return as an FAIP . The flight commander will concur or nonconcur ... <p> ... <p> 5.15.2.4 WG/CC 's will be informed of other bases ' aircraft assignments . If an appropriate MWS assignment is not available in the assignment block , WG/CCs are authorized to work assignment swaps ( within an assignment block ) with other WG/CC 's to better meet Air Force needs and student desires . <p> ... <p> 5.15.2.6 The WG/CC will be actively involved in actions affecting JSUPT students in the assignment selection process and will make the final decision on the best match of student 's skill , potential , and desire with available aircraft . <p> Now look at some of the phrases in there : <p> interpersonal skills <p> maturity <p> potential <p> appropriate MWS assignment <p> Air Force needs <p> student 's skill <p> WHAT IT 'S SAYING , is if the IP 's do n't think you can handle a C-17 , they can give you a whacker , ( no offense to you whackers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you one . Now realize it does say " WG/CC " These decisions are n't made lightly . The man delegates authority down , gets recommendations up , etc . Do n't know how often this happens in the 38 's , but T-1 's see it -- probably one person in every 3 or 4 classes . So not very often . I 've seen it both ways , once a guy was shithot but tanked his check rides . So his MASS score was way low ( I ca n't remember or figure out what ' MASS ' stands for , even after reading the reg , but it 's the rank merit score and it 's defined on p104 of : LONG ... ) and hence what he should have received was , how do you say , an airframe that is not typically picked by the top individuals . We ( the IP 's , the FC and the SQ/CC ) made the decision that , due to the needs of the Air Force , this person should be in a ' more demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get put in a plane that would never go low level , even though his scores and desires would have had it that way . He was no shit f'n scary down low . It was a good decision . <p> Now I know the IP 's do n't discuss any of this with you guys and you do n't get issued this reg. , but these are the rules of the game ( and hence why I posted them ) . In the end it comes down to what everybody has always said : <p> Try hard , have a good attitude , be here to learn , and it 'll all work out in the end . <p> Do n't think that because ( you think ) a particular IP does n't like you , that your chances of ' success ' are low . You can bet your *** that the IP 's all talk and have a BIG picture of how people are doing and what they deserve . The only person who is going to screw you is you . <p> So go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt ! <p> 08 .

It would seem to be to same way for JSUPT or UPT . My question is how big of a wash out rate is there for ENJJPT ? I know for JSUPT there are remedial training programs to keep folks from getting cut , is the same true for ENJJPT ? Also , how much more intense is ENJJPT from the other UPTs ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> There are actually two formation checkrides at SPS : a " basic " and " advanced . " <p> The basic check is mostly close in formation ... wingwork , close / extended trail , rejoins , etc . <p> The advanced check contains a 90 / 45 / 180 tactical turn , tactical rejoins , FM , and some more extended trail . Basic stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fair game . There are 15-ish ( ca n't remember the exact number off the top of my skull ) " advanced " form rides prior to the check , and FM is done on all but 2 of those rides . <p> I do n't know how this differs from SUPT , but I 'm curious ( sts ) . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest T38driver <p> The Formation phase has one check ride , at the end that includes all the items you listed . ( Close in and Tactical Formation in addition to Extended Trail ) . At CBM , the student is required to complete tact turns , wing work , the g-x , and Extended trail to complete the check ride . <p> As for the blocks . Two blocks ( 4 rides each ) , before initial form solo ( Pitch and puke , no tactical ) . Then 4 more rides , concentrating on tactical . Initial Tac Form solo . Then they go to a 12 ride block before the check . Later , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advanced form after assignment night . <p> That 's a general overview , let me know if you have any specific questions . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest terribletravis <p> I am new to all the posts but I could not find any good information on the ENJJPT program . When applying for a Pilot slot , we were given the option to try for ENJJPT but when I looked it up , I could not find much information . I have now received a slot for ENJJPT and want to find out more information about the program . <p> This is what I know : <p> ENJJPT is specifically held at Shepard AFB , TX <p> About 50-60% of the class is Europeans <p> There is no track selection after Phase 2 ; everyone goes Fighter/Bomber track <p> If any of these statements are wrong , please tell me . <p> Here are some questions I have : <p> I know that currently all they are using is T-37 's but I read a post ( rumor ? ) that the T-6 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the actual difference between the two programs ( aside from track select ) ?

Wo n't be all T-6 until 2009 , should start students in T-6s late 2008 <p> What is the actual difference between the two programs ( aside from track select ) ?

( i.e. promotions , job assignments , ect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel compelled to add that it seems like you just kinda applied for ENJJPT as an afterthought and did n't really know what you were getting into . In which case , you may REALLY end up regretting that later . Hope I 'm wrong ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Gumps <p> Primarily the international flavor you get at ENJJPT , which is a little stonger than at UPT . ENJJPT also has some syllabus differences , and is currently working on another syllabus change , which will drastically change the current system . You 've probably heard , but they are moving toward taking the T-6 and making it a 8-9 month program , to include tactical formation , something done only in the T-38 in the past . Also , there was talk of removing the bottom dude or two ( after the T-6 portion of training ) and putting them in a T-1/T-44 at a UPT base/Navy base . That would try to eliminate the aforementioned guys that decided half way through that a fighter is not for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone Tones anyhow , into a T-38 . <p> I have spoken to dudes at UPT , and it seems much more of a melting pot of instructors as well . At ENJJPT you have US and internationals , but they all were fighter pilots for the most part , with the exception of your Buff and Bone dudes , and the random Italian C-130 pilots . <p> As for the flying , it is mostly the same , I 've heard there are some things at ENJJPT that are done that are n't at UPT and vice-versa ( FM , continuous extended trail , etc ) <p> The bottom line is that you 've gotten yourself into a program that is designed to build fighter pilots , so I hope you know what you asked for and received . Let me know if you have any specific questions regarding ENJJPT , and good luck . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Found this on the Facebook ENJJPT group ... posted by someone who got ENJJPT FY 07 who had asked someone from his Det who went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey dude , of course I remember . Congrats on getting ENJJPT . It will be awesome . A lot of people ask what you can do to get ready for pilot training , what to study , etc . The truth is , there 's not really much you can do to get ready for it . Any amount of studying you do beforehand will only put you a couple of days ahead of everybody else when you get there , and then you 'll all be even again . You will be somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of things you are supposed to learn once you start the flying portion . You 'll hear " like drinking from a firehose " all the time . <p> As far as other things to expect , the timeline sort of works as follows : you 'll start with aerospace physiology first , which is the easy part of the program . You 'll go out early in the morning , practice PLF 's , sit through classes about GLOC 's and spatial disorientation , etc . I think that lasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you 'll start the systems academics phase for the T-37 ( I do n't think they 've upgraded to the T-6 yet , but I might be mistaken ) . The contractors they have are awesome teachers and could build a tweet from spare parts if you gave them a couple of hours . You 'll cover engines , hydraulics , electrics , etc. , the whole gambit . Then , at some point , I think it totals up to be about a month after you 've formally started the program , you start reporting to your flight room instead of the academics room every morning . You 'll meet your instructor pilots ( IP 's ) and you 'll start getting put on the schedule to fly . <p> Expect to fly about 4 times a week or so , as long as the weather is decent . If your class gets behind they might start double-turning you ( fly twice in one day ) to try to get you caught up . There are five flying phases in the Tweet . Contact , Instrument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you start getting put on the schedule to fly , life is a blur for the next two months . You 'll step to the jet on your dollar ride and you 'll have absolutely zero SA on what 's going on . You 'll barely be able to get the jet started in the correct order like you 've already practiced a hundred times in the LINK simulator . Everything seems to happen at ludicrous speed . In the contact phase , you 're just learning the basics of flying the jet from point A to point B , how to fly a military overhead pattern , how to put the jet into a fully developed spin and then recover , how to land , single-engine ops , emergency procedures , just the basics . After you have about 5 or 6 contact rides , you 'll start flying the instrument phase simultaneously . This is to give you more practice in the VFR pattern with an IP next to you before you solo . Then you 'll fly a mix of contact rides and instrument rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the VFR pattern with no IP next to you . <p> Solo is awesome . You 're scared as ###### when you step to the jet , but once you get airborne it 's sweet as hell . Your SA is 10 times better because there is no pressure from the right seat . Your first solo ride is in the VFR pattern ( the IP actually flies the first half of the sortie with you , then you land , shut down the right engine , he climbs out and you fire it back up again and take off . He then walks over to the RSU shed to watch you in the pattern and help you out on the radio if necessary ) . After that , you 'll be full-up cleared to the MOA , to Hacker ( the auxiliary field where you practice pattern stuff ) . You live for the solo rides and you actually start looking forward to those sorties instead of sucking with the IP seeing everything you get wrong . <p> The instrument phase is the most grueling . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the instrument phase simultaneously , but you alsol have academics every day , and you 're also flying LINK missions every day ( T-37 SIM with no screen so you can practice instrument procedures ) . There is a LOT of stuff to learn about instrument procedures . <p> You 'll have your first checkride at the end of the contact phase . It 's pretty nerve-wracking , but it 's not too big of a deal . It 's actually kind of nice when you get the contact check out of the way , because then you can just focus completely on the instrument phase . <p> Towards the end of the instrument phase , you 'll start flying " out-and-backs . " You fly IFR to some other airport , grab some lunch , and then fly back . You 're responsible for filing the flight plans , doing fuel computations , planning divert options , etc . Then , at the end of the instrument phase , you 'll have another checkride . <p> Here is where the program starts to get money . At about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also finish up with academics and LINK missions as well . Congratulations , you just made it into the Tweet Flying Club . You 'll find that you actually have time to do things like go out to dinner during the week or watch a movie at home or whatever . The fog finally starts to lift a little and you think you might actually make it through this program . <p> After contact and instruments , you 'll start low level navigation . You 'll build maps and fly low level routes to arrive over a target at a specified time . This phase is awesome because you 're cruising at 500 feet and you can actually look outside again as opposed to the instrument phase . Low level nav is a short phase , only like 8 or 9 rides or so . Then you 'll start flying advanced contact . Advanced contact is more of the same stuff in basic contact , but now you add in aerobatic maneuvers . About half of the advanced contact portion is solo . You already know how to do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase respectively . <p> You 'll also start flying the formation phase along with advanced contact . Formation is probably the most fun phase of the whole program . You 'll hamfist the first formation ride , but you 'll get the hang of it . You 'll do fingertip whifferdills , extended trail exercises , echelon turns , etc . Then you 'll have your advanced contact and formation checkrides ( sometimes only separated by a couple of days or so ) and you 're done with the Tweet . <p> Then there 's the T-38 . It 's an awesome machine compared to the Tweet , full up with afterburner and everything . You 'll move to your new flight room on the T-38 side of the house , and you 'll start at the bottom again . <p> The T-38 phase is easier than the Tweet phase . The program runs : Contact , Instrument , Basic Formation , Advanced Formation , and Low-level Navigation again . Here 's the difference though : You already know how to study . You already know the instrument procedures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formation is the same , but now you add the tactical formations and stuff . Like the T-37 phase , the first couple of months or so are somewhat difficult , but not as bad . Same deal with the LINK missions and academic classes for about the first half of T-38s . And then you 're done . <p> A quick side note on non-flying related stuff . If you drink alcohol , you 'll drink like a mother######er at Sheppard . You 'll NEED to . Everyone always studies all day on Sunday , so Friday night you 'll have a ton of stress built up from the week , and you and your bros will go out and get absolutely wrecked . I never drank in college like I did on the weekends at Sheppard . Woke up several times underneath my truck staring at the driveshaft with Carl 's Jr . littered all over the place . If you do n't drink , no worries , you 'll still hang out and just take it easy on Friday and Saturday . So get ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The international dudes are pretty cool too , they make things interesting . <p> So that 's about it in a nutshell . Of all the uncertainties , I can guarantee it will be the best year of your life . Pretty awesome when you finally pin on the wings . So here are some parting recommendations : <p> 1 ) Go to Kinko 's when you get thereand get the big packet of gouge . They 'll know what you mean when you ask them . I think there are a couple in town there , so call first to find out which one has it . It 's got lots of useful information and stuff that previous classes have compiled . It 's good reference data , but remember , it is gouge so it might not be 100% accurate . <p> 2 ) Start practicing ground ops as soon as you can when you get there . Get someone from a couple of classes ahead of you to walk you through it a couple of times . They should be glad to . The better you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more brain bytes you can dedicate towards the stuff that actually matters . <p> 3 ) Chairfly . I know it sounds gay , and it 's difficult to do for long periods of time , but it will pay off huge . Talk out loud to yourself when you are chairflying if you need to to keep your mind focused . Go over every detail of your flight the next day , repeatedly . Trust me , it helps big time . Also , schedule yourself for practice SIMS if you have the spare time . <p> 4 ) I do n't know if you 're IFR qualified or not , but the more exposure you have with instruments , the better off you could be during the really grueling phase . It might be worth checking out on Microsoft Flight Simulator or something . <p> 5 ) Help your bros . Not everyone will do as well as you will . Offer to take them to the SIM and help them practice whatever they need help on . Share info you get about test questions , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys can work as a team . <p> That 's about it dude . It will be pretty awesome . When does your class start ? Do you know anyone that will be in your class ? <p> Anyway , hit me back if you have any questions or whatever about the program . I got a little long-winded , but it should give you a little bit of an idea of what to expect . <p> Also , when I left , I think they might have been building a new simulator building or something . So the syllabus may have changed a little bit since I was there . Anyway best of luck and I hope you do well . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Searched and found this page so I figured I 'd just piggyback it on this one . <p> Our flight leader came back from a meeting with the news that the T-44 and helo tracks were now a possibility out of Sheppard for dudes who the Cadre feel wo n't do well in 38 's rather than just washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy is headed to or will be soon to the T-44 track . <p> Edit : Just for the record I actually think this is a good deal and not some " crazy oh no ! " deal as the thread name kind of implies . Just found a thread about Sheppard and added this at the end . <p> Edited November 14 , 2007 by egochecks <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ENSTUD <p> The guy you are referring to was in my class and finished Tweets and even went to the fuge . The day before he was supposed to start 38s , the squadron commander stopped him in the hallway and told him he is n't starting after all and he has the choice to go to helos or T-44s . He chose T-44s . About 8 months ago we heard this was a possibility for any ENJJPT student so it 's not that big of a suprise they actually did it ... but I 'm sure it was for the dude that it happened to . <p> During commader 's call yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options said , " this does not mean ENJJPT is becoming a full blown SUPT track select , but I 'm not saying it wont be in the future " . <p> Also , one the ENJJPT 2008 changes is going to be the option for NATO countries to send their students to Sheppard for just 38s . Spain and Denmark are expected to start sending students once this option is available . <p> Just to clarify , the dude that is going to T-44s DID finish Tweets . He struggled throughout with 3 out of 5 checkrides busted and 2 FPCs , but did end up finishing . He was one hardest workers in our flight ... knew all the GK/prcedures better than anyone , but just could n't put it togeher in the air . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> so if a stud just does n't want to do the fighter thing , they 're still " stuck " and do n't have a choice to go 44s , but if the leadership thinks they ca n't handle 38s then they will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely do well in 38s , but did n't want to do that gig . Seems people like that at EN are still stuck , despite this new 44/helo thing . Correct ? <p> That 's the way I understand it and that 's pretty much how the CC made it sound in the commander 's call . I 'm sure there are guys who would like the option , but I would definitely consider that a rarity . We knew going to Sheppard locked us into 38s . I think I remember signing some kind of form saying I understood that ENJJPT meant only fighter/bomber option . My point is , you 're right , but you 'd be hard pressed to find someone who considers themselves " stuck . " <p> As far as the wing cc making these changes , I do n't think this was all his doing . The previous CC made comments about the new options coming down the chain months ago . The new CC seems to be a great guy . Definitely had a good time at the roof stomp when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going another track is n't getting treatment unavailable to others . He 's just the first one to catch the new program . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Ward104 <p> When applying for a Pilot slot , we were given the option to try for ENJJPT but when I looked it up , I could not find much information . I have now received a slot for ENJJPT and want to find out more information about the program . <p> I am curious , when applying for a pilot slot are all applicants given the option to try for ENJJPT ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I see , thanks . So I take it the chances of getting into ENJJPT is even less than UPT . If you sign up for ENJJPT and do n't make it , can you still get into UPT ? <p> If you sign up and do n't get selected , yes you can go to UPT . If you sign up and do n't make it through the program , no you ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your mind to accept the ENJJPT slot and are just looking for more information , I would suggest focusing on people 's posts who have been through Sheppard . ENJJPT IP and FURY220 are good sources of information . There will always be dudes arguing and whining over UPT vs ENJJPT , Academy vs ROTC , fighter vs heavy , Yankees vs Red Sox ... ignore it because neither side will convince the other side who 's right . <p> Edited December 20 , 2007 by FallingOsh <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Right now ENJJPT only has Norwegian , Dutch , German , and Italian students . There is a Greek instructor hanging around on the 38 side and a Canadian on the 37 side . I think that there is also a Portuguese somewhere but I 'm not sure on that . With the new ENJJPT 2008 syllabus more countries are probably going to start sending studs again but we 'll see . As far as foreign guys graduating at the top of their class there is usually a German who gets DG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't say that one country is consistently better than another , but the foreigners do seem to have some advantages over the American students at times . Most of the foreigners here seem to have gone through more stringent screening to get here and they have flown a more in-depth type of IFS where they get acro experience etc . However , think of it just like you would with Americans . Some dudes go to pilot training who flew for a regional airline and have 2,000 hours . No guarantee there that the guy is going to be #1 or that he is even going to be in the top . Pilot training seems to have a way of throwing curve balls to people and you ca n't predict in the beginning before day one who will be #1 on the last day . Another thing to remember is that ENJJPT is a NATO program and not a U.S. program , therefore some people say that there is some politics that goes along with that not only for leadership positions etc but also with students i.e. ranking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own but there are people out there who believe that it does go on so that might be why some people are saying that the foreigners are normally in the top of their classes . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Do n't forget the Spanish SNR , who flies T-38s for the 90th . Turkey no longer sends students here , either ... although they have one IP ( Turkish SNR ) . ( Hell , if you 're the only one at ENJJPT from your nation , you 're not really the " Senior National Representative . " More like " Only National Representative . " ) <p> Also , your last couple sentences ( highlighted in bold ) are complete and utter horsesh ! t , and it sounds like you have been talking with some giant SNAPs . When it comes to the final ranking decisions , there is n't really a lot of " decision-making " about it . What actually happens is the TIMS results are glonkulated by TIMS and are run through a GIANT macro in Excel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , there is a *SMALL* amount of input that comes from the IPs in the flight , but this has a very tiny impact compared to all the flying data that 's thrown-into the mix via TIMS . <p> Sorry to disappoint , but when it comes to the final rankings , there is no cigar-smoke-filled secret back room . Deciding the drop , though ... well , that can be a different story ... <p> What you DID say correctly has to do with the " pre-ENJJPT " flight screening differences between the different nations . The Dutch and the German studs have pretty extensive screening programs , and those guys get quite a lot of flight experience before they make the move to Wichita Falls . Generally , it shows ... which begs the question : why are n't we doing more of it for US potential SUPT/ENJJPT students ? 
@@43194924 @3194924/ <h> Leaving the Air Force for the Airlines <h> 1,126 posts in this topic <p> I read this article the other day . It 's one man 's entertaining opinion about the state of the industry . He gives a little background why military pilots may have a bit of a stigma in the airlines among some . I 've only encountered a handful of people who feel this way , but they are out there . Depending on the airline you go with , you could be trading your Air Force problems for a whole new set . <p> U.S. commercial aviation 's love affair with the military is , however , about more than just avoiding the costs of training pilots . While it 's true that one can hardly distinguish the background of a pilot after a few years with an airline , as new hires , military pilots are often the least militant of labor groups . Until the end of the first contract negotiation they experience , their peers will often view them as Kool-Aide drinkers easily swayed by managerial agitprop . <p> 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hiring free-for-all at the majors , but in the next 3-5 years- assuming the economy does n't tank or external forces do n't interfere ( DoJ , etc ) , there will be regular hiring at most of the majors . Any well-qualified military pilot will have a decent shot at a job . Just do n't expect a job because you have an ATP and a pulse . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have a feeling that some will be hired , not all ... As a result some ex-mil will give the " regionals " a shot and be very disappointed/demoralized . After a couple of years of commuting at that level , some will leave for non-flying jobs . The romance of the airlines has gone down the tubes . It will become a matter of simple economics for most people , and flying at the regional level will not support that . For those looking into making the leap , gearpig said it well , you will be exchanging your AF problems for Airline problems ... and likely you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article and understand what outsourcing has done . The history is there , and it will help explain what is going on at the " mainline " level . There is a lot of change going on in the industry . Some ok , but a lot of bad too . Buyer beware . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> American just announced hiring 1500 pilots over the next 5 years . Application window opens tomorrow . <p> Affirm . SWA , US Airways , United , and Delta also have their application windows open . ( I think SWA may close today . ) Jet Blue should open their window in November . This might not the " boom " Butters seems to be hoping for , but there is certainly a positive trend in the industry . <p> Good luck to those 2001-2003 YG folks getting ready to make the decision . It 's not an easy one . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Are airline pilots required to join the Union ? Wonder if the former-mil folks are less supportive of organized labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some companies , like UPS , have management pilots that are on salary and are not union . A non-corporate or non-management pilot who is operating under the union negotiated contract and receiving union wages but is not paying union dues is extremely rare , but they are out there . While former military members are often less militant when it comes to things like job-actions and strikes , being a non-union pilot for a unionized airline is generally a bad idea . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Are airline pilots required to join the Union ? Wonder if the former-mil folks are less supportive of organized labor and that could be an area of contention . <p> As a military guy entering the airline business some 14 years ago , I recall having no strong feelings one way or the other regarding unions . After being here for a while , life would seriously suck without a union . Not required but helps when you are dealing with airline management that would have you working 24/7 for peanuts for as many days a month as they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company but companies and/or management are certainly self serving and destructive to the safety and quality of life of their workers . Trying to reach an agreeable compromise is always contentious . <p> 3 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> UAL plans to hire 60 a month for the foreseeable future . Couple buds of mine just finished training there and the rumor is they may go to 100 a month ... so that 's around 700 in 2014 for UAL . AA will likely hire 500-600 next year . DAL announced 300 new hires but there 's significant rumors that they may go to 500-600 in 14 to account for FAR changes . SW is hiring 300 , and JetBlue and Spirit will likely add 200+ each next year . Hawaiian , Alaskan and Virgin will probably hire 200 or so among the three of them . That 's about 2500 for sure hires and possibly 3000 , all in 2014 . It will likely accelerate in years following . I 'd expect 2015 and beyond to hire 3000+ per year at the majors . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . <p> Of course , considering how our nation is being run , the economy could crash and burn , but in that case we 're all screwed . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> " Yeah , lots getting out and going to the airlines . But a lot are going on to do other things . The other guys are smarter . " <p> To each their own . Life is n't always about making a buck . Honestly I 'd rather make a little less and fly than make $200k a year but sit in a cubicle . I 've worked as a non-flying professional and I was n't that satisfied . These days , there really are n't any truly safe bets anymore in this economy . I 'm an ART now but even this job is n't what it used to be . <p> FWIW , most people know there is n't going to be a hiring free-for-all at the major airline level . That being said , from now through the next ten years should be a good opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . Not all will get the call and some will be told " no thanks " , but by and large , if you are a good dude and have IP/EP experience , you stand a better than average chance of sitting in the right seat of that Airbus/Boeing . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> " This is what many of you do not understand .

Once you register , give it a week before you can post .... but , very valuable information for those looking at that career option . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yeah , I have checked out airline pilot forums before .

I mean , it takes work to skim the dozens of posts on this site on a topic I like in order to weed out all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was poking around airline pilot forums and clicked on the Delta hiring thread . It was only a few months old and already had 178 pages of crap ( probably with a few good tidbits of info buried in there somewhere ) .

Used to have some good info w/ bros helping bros , but it seems to have turned less useful lately . I think it would be a good thing to get that kind of spirit re-kindled , either here or at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me get my current gig . There 's a lot of good info there if you 're willing to wade through the garbage . Ditto on TacAir 's Delta thread comments above . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll rephrase : apply now but do n't get disappointed when you are n't hired in the next few month ... or next year even . At some point , hiring about 2,500-3,500 pilots a year , the majors will exhaust their readily available supply of highly experienced mil EP types and I 'd expect to see basic ACs or inexperienced IPs making up more of the " typical " new hire classes . <p> That being said , my original numbers ( 3,000-3,500 TT ) is what 's " typical " now . I 'm sure there are people getting hired with less , it 's not the " norm " from what I can tell . Fighter guys will likely have fewer hours which is why your bros are being hired under that . <p> Edited October 12 , 2013 by Hueypilot <p> 0 27701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering your hours on an application : You will very likely be asked during the interview to describe how you interpreted your military time to civilian . This would be a bad time to try and explain how you incorporated other/sim/unapproved multiplication factors/etc for the obvious purpose of " fluffing " your resume . United was notorious for seeing right through this padding during the last hiring boom , and I personally know someone who got asked to leave the interview over an unintentional discrepancy of @300 hrs . He had plenty of flight time and experience , they just viewed it as an integrity issue . <p> I also advise avoiding the **25;1525;TOOLONG translation fallacy . I know a few low time AC 's and " career CPs " that got hired by padding their hours with " Primary means the same as PIC " . However , those companies were low-end regionals and contract freight . Any major airline worth being hired at is well familiar with the differences . <p> When I was asked this very question , I responded " I used the FAR definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of an aircraft is directly responsible for , and is the final authority as to , the operation of that aircraft ) . So , the hours I recorded as PIC are when I was the person most responsible for the flight - meaning I had the " A Code " , was not receiving instruction , and no sim or ' other ' time " . They all nodded their heads and moved onto the next question . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 2 . From the 3 application websites that I 've seen , nobody cares about " Evaluator " time or student time .... however , you will include that in your TT . <p> Disagree . Evaluator is " super PIC " time--i.e. , you 're expected ( required ) to assume command if the pilot(s) you 're evaluating do something unsafe or are otherwise deemed incapable of continuing . Another way of saying that is that the EP is ultimately responsible for the safe conduct of the flight--sounds like " PIC " to me . Include it in your " Instructor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you break down IP vs PIC time differently , but your total " Instructor " should be IP + EP , then deal with Instructor vs PIC per the instructions ) . My opinion , obvioiusly , and it 's how I did it . I seem to recall one site ( airlineapps ? ) specifying exactly that . In some communities I was in ( various C-135s ) , the EP typically had the A code , anyway ( by design ) . <p> 6 . Most want to know instrument , night , and XC ( i.e. more than 50 miles away from your starting base ) <p> Common wisdom on this ( and , again , at least one site 's instructions ) says that any mil flight that leaves the pattern is a XC ( i.e. , distance test does n't apply ) . Also , the 50 mile test only applies to XC experience needed for a Private Pilot license--the more general FAA definition is " land at a different airport . " <p> it 's all in how well you interview ( i.e. go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview call is the hard part , though , and largely out of your hands--assuming you 've done everything you can to present yourself in a positive light ( resume prep , error-free apps , etc . ) . BIG " 2 " on Emerald Coast--best money I spent throughout my entire job search . <p> You will very likely be asked during the interview to describe how you interpreted your military time to civilian . This would be a bad time to try and explain how you incorporated other/sim/unapproved multiplication factors/etc for the obvious purpose of " fluffing " your resume . <p> Interviewed thrice , hired ( offered the job ) thrice--and not asked once about how I converted mil to civ on the apps . That said , I fully agree that you do n't want to be tap-dancing at an interview over how many hours you claimed .... <p> One thing that folks also need to consider is *recency* of flying . If you are more than X months/years removed from the cockpit , you might not be the best candidate . All applications do ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time " comment meant to read that there is no " Evaluator Hours " tab to be logged . Yes , as eluded to , you will place those hours as IP hours . <p> Agree with Jughead about your hours calculation .... <p> Edited October 13 , 2013 by C-21.Pilot <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Y'all keep talking about not claiming your other time . According to FAR 61 you are authorized to claim your other time as PIC if you carried the A code . I 'm the one getting violated if the copilots dork up the ocean crossing while I 'm in the bunk . I 'm also the first to be woken up if something goes wrong . I think that 's pretty easy to explain . Am I missing something ? And no , I have n't claimed other time when I was a copilot . <p> One point to add . I did n't claim any other time with Southwest ( they specifically state to exclude it ) . With the multiplier I have 4000 TT . I was invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHS I know of 3 others with approximately 3500-4000 TT with interviews at DAL , SWA , and UAL . There are guys that have been hired in the last week at UAL with slightly more experience and I have a buddy here hired this month at Atlas . He interviewed while at IP school . It may not be the proverbial flood gates , but dudes are getting hired at a decent rate . Get your poop in a pile , you will get called !

I talked to me Commander , and said I would like to change my major to history . <p> They submitted a package requesting an FY11 Commissioning slot and change of major . It was denied .

He is also asking that I do not enlist . However , a big problem is that , I will be a completed cadet for more then a year , which is pretty bad . <p> Now , I know I screwed up , and should have picked a different major from the start . But I got into nursing school and realized it was n't for me . <p> But like I said , I just want to calm my nerves a little . Being an Air Force Officer would mean everything in the world to me .

How will this hurt my future Guard/Reserve career ? Or , for that matter , an Active Duty career should I later decide to join the pilot recall program ? <p> One of the things officer promotion boards look at is break in service . To keep this from being a big deal , when coming up for a board , submit a letter of explanation to the board with the PRF and other paperwork . It 's just something else that stands out when the board is shuffling through all the candidates , but any explanation ( short of being in jail for that break ) will usually be good enough .

Believe it or not , when you join a Guard/Reserve unit , the paperwork takes FOREVER to process . We had a guy just come to us from the Navy flying P-3 's up in Washington . It took one freaking year for his paperwork to go through , and for him to get sworn in . If you 're all about taking time off with the wife and family , then get the paperwork rolling , and then take your time off . Guard units typically understand about taking time off , and not coming to UTA 's because you 're waiting for paperwork and getting caught up with lost time with the family . Keep the break in service to the shortest amount of time as possible . <p> As for the above example of a pilot completely changing services , that might be the reason for the long delay . But then again what do I know ? Just my .02 , take it for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I started my paperwork with my ANG unit about 3 months before I left active duty , and was off active duty for another 3 months before it was all done and I was officially " in the unit . " Fortunately , because I started early , they back dated all of my paperwork so I did not have a break in service and all of the ass pain that can go along with it . My advice , put in the legwork now and take your vacation once you 're in a unit .

I thought it would just be one more hurdle I would have to get out of while waiting for my transition to get through Guard Bureau . I had 3.5 months where I was completely out . That break in service after 10.5 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in service , the Guard reqired 11 years of AD for me to come back in at my previous rank . I had to get two good Guard years before I could get promoted back to 0-4 . Dude , that was a fair amount of cash over that time , not to mention the two years longer that it would take to make 0-5 . What I did n't know really ended up hurting me . I will say that being a ten year captain in the Guard was a license to steal , so it was n't all that bad . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest WNFRED <p> I 'm separating from Active Duty but have n't specifically picked a Guard or Reserve Unit .

How will this hurt my future Guard/Reserve career ? Or , for that matter , an Active Duty career should I later decide to join the pilot recall program ? <p> Here is my personal experience . Being in the IRR is great paperwork wise . It really should only take a couple of weeks to a month to put you back in the roster . The biggest PROBLEM is once you have a break in service greater than 90 days your aeronautical orders expire . This is a gigantic pain in the ass to get back . It took me well over six months and that was with my unit really working with me . If you are not going back to flying then do n't worry about it , but if you are then make SURE those 90 days do n't elapse .

@@43194929 @3194929/ <h> Foreign National Spouse ? <h> 11 posts in this topic <p> Has anyone ever been in a position whereas their spouse started out as a foreign national ( such as without a green card or US naturalization ) ? What do I need to do first if we are to get hitched ? <p> I 'm a newly commissioned LT about to EAD in two months . I punched this question off to my Det NCOIC but he needed to research a bit and ask some questions off to others as well . I basically have no idea where to start and would like to look for some additional experiences . <p> The marriage paperwork I understand is straight forward , but everything else , such as the security clearance ( I have a current TS ) and the fact that she is not a US citizen , is unknown territory for me . <p> My fiance is from China ( which may complicate things further ) . I have reported my foreign contacts to the assigned security officer at my det a few times before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any physical changes until after 5 years of my initial TS issue ( kind of weird to wait that long ) . I have reported foreign contacts before during my TS clearance since 80% of my family/relatives are foreign contacts . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> There are 4 things : security clearance , immigration , military , and SSA . <p> -Security clearance : just report your marriage to your security manager and chain of command . They should know what needs to be done , if anything . When I got married I had recently re-done my security clearance in which I listed everything for my then-fiancee and reported her as such , so I did n't do anything after we were married . Since then I 've had an additional periodic re-investigation and there were no problems . <p> -Immigration : You should know that if she is not currently in the US on some type of visa , and then you get married and try to get a marriage visa , that it takes about a year from application to acquire the visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you during this time . I did the fiancee visa which is the quickest way to get your fiancee over here ( but also most expensive ) and then get married in the US and adjust status to permanent resident . During the adjustment of status she is to remain in the US . See visajourney.com and uscis.gov . <p> -Military : Once you are married , go to the I 'd card office . Bring her passport and marriage certificate . She should have a visa in her passport which will be OK for the 2nd form of picture I 'd . She does not necessarily need a social security number at this time . Go by the tricare office if you want to sign up for Tricare Prime , otherwise you 're on Tricare Standard by default . You can also sign up for Tricare Dental at this time if you want to . They will take $12 out of your monthly pay on your LES for dental premiums . Update your life insurance beneficiaries ( SGLI ) and your record of emergency data ( VRED ) . <p> -Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may give you an SSN as part of that process , but if they do n't go to the social security office and sign up for a SSN for her . This took me 3 visits and a month and a half since they 're basically unfamiliar with the fiancee visa and there were some issues with the name check . The issue was her visa was in her maiden name , then we were married so her name changed and everything from that point was in her new name except that her passport still showed her old name . <p> I 'm pretty sure that 's about it . The immigration process was the height of bureaucratic foolishness , but they did n't give me any problems . The time from application for the visa to the actual visa issuance was 5-6 months . She came over , we were married within a few days and then we applied for adjustment of status so she could get her green card . I taught her how to drive and she got her license within a few months . It cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority being USCIS application fees . Other associated costs are embassy fees , doctor 's fees , immunization costs , document fees , etc . She 's from Japan . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For China , what I 've seen ( online research and one personal account in-country ) is that the marriage visa seems to be a faster process than the fiance visa . Perhaps it varies between countries ? <p> I 'll be getting ahold of the NCOIC and I 'll update this thread with any new info . <p> I fully understand the documentation of foreign contacts . I basically printed out the SF-86 as a hard copy and have updated with a pen new names and contact info as well as travel dates . Never thought about recording every single call made though . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yeah I just looked at visajourney.com 's stats for China on CR-1 and K-1 visas and it looks to be about the same amount of time . I 'd also go with the CR-1 visa in this case since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the K-1 because it was faster for Japan at the time . <p> So I guess since you 're doing the CR-1 you 'll want to get married ASAP so that she can join you once you 're halfway thru UPT or maybe done with UPT ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I would absolutely pass exact info to the security dude at your DET for every stage of this , i.e. from known contact to engaged to married .

With the commute , plan on being gone 10-11 hours a day . Your flight hours do n't count for anything . Overall it 's a very boring job with almost no satisfaction . The pay is good though . I would consider other things before this , the community is pretty much a black hole that I tried like hell to get out of . 27695 @qwx437695 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I enjoyed my time at Creech , minus the commute . It is true , it is not flying nor do those hours count outside the Air Force . I typically worked six days on , three days off . Shifts were 8.5 hours long plus whatever time you spent on additional duty type stuff . There was some satisfaction when we got to help dudes on the ground or shoot . A lot of what we did was intel-related activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ABM or other non-pilot career fields . When I left , RPA dudes were still getting flight pay and deployment was almost on a volunteer basis .

I read that Holloman , Whiteman , Cannon , Beale , and possibly Edwards and Ellsworth also have RPAs now . Any truth to this ? <p> All those bases have RPAs . There are also Guard and Reserve units in various places . I 'm at Ellsworth , we work a 5-1-2. 5 days of flying , 1 day for admin and a 2 day weekend . Sometimes you end up flying on the admin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectively you get a three day weekend . We have three shifts of 9 hours apiece . I frequently work 10-12 hours a day . At least in my corner of the world , you can expect 1 120-ish day deployment during your asssignment here . 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I think everything is pretty accurate except these two . Typically one 126.9 day deployment per assignment cycle unless you volunteer for another . I 've never seen leave be that much of a problem , either , even when manning was lower than it is now . Our squadron worked with everyone who made reasonable requests , which sometimes leads to flying those 2 R days a month , so one of your bros gets some time off work . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Is it the same for Agr and Art positions ?

They just stood up a reserve operations group ( 726th ) at Creech in order to support this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much have carte blanche to go on orders for a few days-months at a time whenever they want to . This is a great option for people who have their own side business or just want a part time job where they can set their own schedule . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've done 2 different units . Each scheduled differently . One place avg was 2.5hrs in the seat , the other , I was doing 4-8 depending on the night . Great for getting hours , but gets old . IMO 3-4 hrs is a good amount of time . Enough time to get settled , be in the flow , and not get bored beyond belief . 8 hrs in the seat ... Let 's just say , when you get the schedule the day prior and see what you have to look forward to , there 's a sinking feeling lol . But it is what you make it . I 've had 8hrs fly by , and some felt like 20 . <p> As for the " week " schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekends are pretty nice . Of course , everything is unit dependent . I 've heard of many other scheduling outlines . <p> And again for " bumming " , all depends on the unit , and the whims of the Feds . <p> Just figured I 'd post a little update : ) <p> EDIT : regarding flight hours , are you referring to RPA hours counting for FAA hours ? Hopefully they 'll work something out to have some conversion . True , it 's not " flying " , but you 're doing the same stuff . CRM , task management , managing aircraft systems , talking with ATC , dealing with WX ( in a much more difficult manner ) , etc ... I 'm not gon na sit here and try to make believe that there 's something magical about physically sitting in an aircraft ( aside from the fact that you 're flying ) . It is extremely relatable experience despite being on the ground . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm looking information regarding additional drilling days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@43194935 @3194935/ <h> Trace Tricuspid Insufficiency ? <h> 10 posts in this topic <h> Guest wojo <p> I recently went on PDT with AFROTC and was disqualified for my Jet Orientation ride because of a " heart murmur " that was heard by the flight doc using a stethoscope . I had never heard anything from any of my other doctors about it both before and after his finding and the ones after looked very hard to find it . They heard nothing , but to be sure they sent to me get an echocardiogram done . I had already taken 2 electrocardiograms too be sure nothing was wrong and they both came back normal , even though they do not diagnos heart murmurs . The echocardiogram results were just given to me and it said the following : <p> Description Of Procedure : Technical quality of study is good . <p> 1 ) The left ventricle appears normal in size without hypertrophy and with overall normal systolic function . Estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60% . Segmental wall motion analysis reveals no abnormality . <p> 2 ) There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right heart chambers and aortic root appear normal in size . <p> Comments : This is a normal echocardiogram . Nothing is seen that should preclude this person from any activity . <p> I asked about what " Trace Tricuspid Insufficiency " meant and the doctor said that it just means that the tricuspid valve does'nt close entirely in your heart and he said it should be nothing to worry about considering 95% of the population has the same diagnosis . I looked at in online at LONG ... and it said that it is found in 4 out of 100,000 people ! ? ! I also remember that the nurse that administered the test said that it was very small what she saw , so i 'm not sure what to do . But , to be sure since I want to fly for the USAF , do you see this interfering with my future as a USAF pilot ? Thanks alot for your time ! <p> IV . Waiver Considerations . The ACS considers trace AI without the murmur of AI , and in the presence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mild AI , in the presence of a normal trileaflet valve , is considered for FC I/IA and FC II waivers . <p> Moderate AI is considered for FC IIA waiver only if the member is asymptomatic , left ventricular function and chamber dimensions are normal , and there is no evidence of aortic root dilation or significant dysrhythmia . FC III is similarly restricted to low performance aircraft . <p> Severe AI , or AI associated with LV enlargement or dysfunction is disqualifying with no waiver recommended . <p> Procedures performed during the ACS evaluation include a lipid panel , ECG , chest x-ray , echocardiogram , pulmonary function testing , 24-hour Holter , treadmill , and , for evaluees over the age of 35 , thallium imaging and coronary artery fluoroscopy . Centrifuge evaluation is no longer required based on an ACS review showing no evidence of +Gz induced arrhythmias or decreased G tolerance . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 4-5 years ago I had a suspected acute case of pericarditis . It quickly went away , and I have not any issues since . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the follow-up . The full report said : <p> 1 . LV size , wall thickness and systolic function are normal , with an EF of 60% <p> 2 . There is trace mitral regurgitation ( insufficiency ) . <p> 3 . There is minimal mitral valve prolapse . <p> 4 There is trace tricusipid regurgitation present ( insufficiency ) . <p> I was processing for a guard pilot slot at the time , but was DQ'ed for acute pericarditis within 6 months , and for mitral/aortic valve insufficiency . <p> Now I am being processed again for an identical slot , in a very different location , and these old results have come back to haunt me . From what I understand , we need a waiver first to get the MEPS physical to happen , and then will need another waiver for the FC1 . The recruiter processing my packet has been very helpful , but I do n't have a clear idea of what the waiver probabilities are here . Reading the regs , it sounds like the results from my echocardiogram are fairly normal but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one could chime in with better knowledge , I would be grateful . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> The acute pericarditis does require a waiver , and would pass easily if that were your only condition . 1 is in the normal range . 2 combined with 3 is a slight concern and likely needs a waiver . 4 is not a major concern , no waiver needed . <p> Though you likely barely skirt the clearance standards for the mitral regurgitation and prolapse per DODI 6130.03 and AFI 48-123/MSD , the docs/techs will err on caution and push for one as a CYA measure , especially because you 've got the h/o pericarditis as a kicker . <p> This waiver will require a Cardiology consults with a new ECG , Chest X-Ray , Echocardiogram , Holter Monitor , and probably a Stress Test . Know that you MUST provide the video/recording of the Echo to ACS for review . TELL THIS TO THE CARDIOLOGY OFFICE AND DEMAND YOU KEEP A COPY . DO NOT SEND THE ORIGINALS WITHOUT A BACKUP . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult independently , and you are approaching your application window , it would likely be worthwhile to press forward and do it on your own , however that may not be possible depending on the cost and availability of a Cardiologist to you . Otherwise , MEPS may coordinate with Cardio consult for you , however the referral process will be lengthy , or they might not cover it at all and it 'll all be on you , out of pocket . <p> I reviewed six similar waivers for IFC I 's going back to 2012 , and in comparison with your condition and extent , I 'd wager your chances are much better than 50/50 , maybe 90/10 because your case is so mild . However , if you have any other conditions that also need a waiver , those chances will rapidly drop . <p> Lastly , the biggest hurdle will definitely be scheduling and accomplishing the exams due to the mountain of red tape involved in this kind of stuff . Be proactive and firm about getting it done . Always be nice to the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions and get an explanation . Do n't leave a specialists ' office until you know what they are going to do , and an estimate for how long it will take . <p> By the time all exams are done and submitted , they ca n't be more than one year old , so timing is often key . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Excellent info . I have no other conditions that would require a waiver -- to my knowledge .

I do n't do the service dress thing , but it is mostly because we have too many stupid " I did my job " ribbons so with 2 sets of the big wings I 'd have the top set almost on top of my shoulder .

I wear the double wings on all my uniforms ( prior Flight Engineer ) . The double wings catch a lot of attention ( not what I was after ) , especially from the enlisted side knowing I was once in their shoes . I worked too hard obtaining my enlisted wings just to toss them aside . Some evidently think the double wings are gay , but it 's about pride , professionalism , and experience , not winning a popularity contest , so wear them as you please . The double wings also seem to set a positive tone when interacting with the enlisted crewmembers , establishing credibility . Depending on your unit 's name patch design and the company they use , the double wings may not look good . Our unit uses Mardon , and the wings came out much smaller than I predicted , making them very hard to distinguish from all the possible Air Force wings , which is why I 'm considering going to solely the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clip from AFI 36-2903 , which allows you to wear your enlisted wings as an officer : <p> 5.9.5 .

When <p> serving as an officer in the same career field as when enlisted , count both time in the enlisted and <p> officer career fields to determine the earned badge level . Time in Sister Service career fields is not <p> used to determine earned badge level for Air Force occupational badges .

I am a pilot and have dealt with plenty of flight Docs , most of them very good . All Navy and Marine pilots go through what we call NAMI WAMI . It is basically the king of medical evaluations in Pensacola Florida . When you get there the first thing you do in the morning is fill out a questionnaire about your medical condition . All kinds of questions about allergies , headaches etc . Some forms even have a question asking if you are breathing just to see if you are actually reading the questions . You see , pilots are known for checking no , whether it is true or not , on almost all questions so they throw in that trick question . My advice is to not admit anything minor that is not affecting you now - allergies included ? One question asks if you have ever had allergy problems . Those who said yes spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fungus , etc known to man even . Almost everybody has had some level of allergy problems in life . Do not give them a reason to DQ you unless you feel it is significant . Who cares if you had allergies as a kid ? You may develop them in the future but then again you may not . Plenty of people fly with allergies . I am not saying to mislead on bigger issues . We had a guy who had eye surgery earlier in life and tried to get by without admitting it . Another had asthma and lied about it . Not smart . Basically , be as honest as you can but use common sense . Get past your physical and then down the line deal with the minor problem if you have to .

What exactly do you think you 're allergic to ? Pollen , ragweed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away by simply moving to another part of the country ( like you going somewhere for UPT ) . Of course on the other hand , they could get worse too . Allergies can also go away ( or begin ) with age . For example , I grew up in the Northeast and never had a single allergy that I knew of . I spent 5-6 years in FL during and after college without allergies . I got an OTS flight slot when I was 25 and ended up starting UPT when I was 26 . Literally a few days after getting to my UPT base , I had an allergy hit me big time . Eyes itching and watering , a constant runny nose ( like water ) , etc ... It as terrible . I got to my UPT base in March and in southern GA ( Moody ) , there are lots and lots of pine trees . In the spring , they spew out so much pollen that you can wash your car and literally 30 minutes later , you 've got a layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollen on the ground to pile up into small drifts , like snow . Anyway , this lasted for a few months . Luckily , I was casual for 5 months and did n't start flying until September . From there , I went to Columbus , MS and by next spring , the allergies had come back , but not as bad . After pilot training , I moved back north and they went away . So , in my case , it may have been a regional thing , but again , I spent a lot of time in FL , which also had a lot of pine trees and never had a problem , so it may have just been age . <p> Like others have said , I would just not mention the allergies , especially if they 're mild . Most of the time when you 're wearing a mask , the oxygen is so dry that it 's going to dry you out anyway . I do n't think you 're going to have a problem with breathing .

@@43194944 @3194944/ <h> What 's a military pattern ? <h> 21 posts in this topic <p> I hear a lot of talk about military traffic patterns with fixes and all kinds of stuff . What does a military traffic pattern actually consist of ? Is a VFR pattern more like an approach or is it just a general procedure ? <p> Tactical Release Points - very similiar to Radar Release Points , but these points are usually interfaced with special arrival and departure procedures associated with a tactical environment or training . <p> Inside Pattern - very similiar to a standard civilian pattern . You can enter from initial takeoff or touch-n-go ( " request closed " ) , or can enter from a 3-5 mile Initial which is typicall around 2000-3000 ' AGL above field elevation . <p> Outside ( VFR ) /Radar Pattern - typically called the " penalty box " , is flown when practicing multiple instrument approaches , or when multiple overhead patterns are warranted from Initial . Also , is used at UPT for traffic separation . <p> Perch - unlike civilian patterns , we " perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a VFR traffic pattern . This is where descent in initiated and is usually 1500 ' AGL . <p> Base - typically 700-900 ' AGL at the furthest point away from the landing runway . Here you are manuevering the aircraft to be 1 mile away at 300 ' AGL ( 3 degree glideslope ) . Although the " gear down " called is n't required until crossing the threshold , this is where it usually happens , as well as other required safety checks . <p> Downwind - same as a civilian downwind , although with two VFR patterns , there 's a Inside and Outside downwind . <p> 06 .

It 's kind of hard to explain in words , since it was the most ****ed up pattern I had ever experienced , but on the other hand it made sense , since there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be precise , or people could end up hurt . <p> It 's a VFR pattern . You 'll have a release point where you 'll essentially cancel IFR and enter the pattern . That will basically put you on a 45 to the runway centerline . Inside of that will be a VFR entry point , which basically lines you up the same way , but a little closer to the runway . The centerline will be called " Initial " if you stay at patten altitude , fly " overhead " the runway and break . Typically 500 ' below you , dudes will be doing visual straight in approaches . <p> There will be an inside downwind for those breaking/pulling closed patterns and an outside downwind to fly to to " go around the box/container . " <p> At any given time , you might need to " break out " to deconflict yourself . You 'll go out to VFR entry and try it again . Hopefully there wo n't be someone coming in from the MOA 's through the release points , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> I have n't even scratched the surface ... <p> There is a whole myriad of rules , procedures , weather mins , radio calls , etc at the base and at the aux field , where you 'll do half your pattern work . Half of the difficulty people have with solo flights , IMHO , is getting the pattern procedure down . It 's a daunting task at first , but with enough practice in ( and out ) of the jet/turboprop , it will become second nature . <p> Every flight room has a pattern duct-taped to the floor in multicolored tape . An IP will sit there as the controller and you 'll fly ( walk ) around the pattern . Heaven help you if you do n't know the procedures or radio calls verbatim . You WILL look like a dumbass in front of your peers . <p> We went so far as to take my son 's sidewalk chalk , draw the pattern on my driveway and walk around it with someone rotating as the controller . Missed calls or screwups cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me funny since we had 9 dudes walking around my driveway with outstreched arms talking to ourselves : confused : ... 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Metalhead <p> I would say Speed and Volume . ( By the way these are also 2 of the 4 essentials to a heavy metal song ! ) The fastest way to get a plane on the ground from up high and fast is to fly up initial fast and break , 1 turn to final , and land . The military pattern is also the only place you 'll see 12 planes in the pattern doing touch-n-goes with 1 minute spacing . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 1 ) enhancing traffic separation by having different a/c types flying different patterns <p> You will very rarely have different aircraft in the VFR pattern at the same time . Generally a pattern and the groundtrack references are built for the predominant MDS at that base , and they 've got priority . If a C-17 showed up at my base will there were F-15s beating up the pattern , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to him flying different airspeeds , you need to have increased runway separation when he lands , as well as wake turbulence separation . <p> loading up the turns at idle power seems like a good way to quickly bleed energy <p> It is , but again that 's not the reason we do it . When you go into your initial break ( depending on how fast you 're going ) , you can bleed from cruising speed ( 300 knots ) to gear limiting speed ( 250 knots ) at mid-range power in less than 90 degrees of turn . <p> better margin of safety/survivability with the jets traversing potentially hostile terrain while in the approach phase <p> This is true as well , but it 's not the reason we do it on a day to day basis . In combat you would do what 's called tactical initial - two aircraft with one mile lateral spacing at 10,000 feet that do a 40 degree nose low sliceback in idle to the base point , where they throw down their gear , continue another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that approved at your average CONUS base . <p> The reason for the VFR pattern is because it allows for a greater volume of aircraft like Metalhead said and more training with less gas . We could practice all our landings from the radar pattern , but staying in a more confined visual pattern saves us time and gas . <p> 20 .

Currently debating the whole " bum vs. civ job option " , but my real desire is to bum . Just a little worried about the feasibility of supporting a wife and kid on bum pay ... <p> Everything I wrote 2 years ago still applies . Bumming on 1Lt pay with a family will be difficult- we have one guy doing that , but he was enlisted for a bunch of years . <p> Each double day you do ( ie flying ) will be about $200 take-home . Trips are only single pay days , but you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of weekend duties ( Sunday ops desk for a double , drills , weekend Guard lifts ) that make balancing with a civilian job easier , and a ton of flying throughout the week that the unit will help you out with if you need more man days . <p> You can do the math yourself- you get 12 UTA ( all-purpose ) man days per quarter , plus 12 AFTP ( ie flying/training ) days per quarter , plus 30 ( unit dependent ) squadron funded days each year . Any time you do on Title 10/32 is bonus , and does n't count towards your allotment . So theoretically , if you use all of your days , you 'll get 96 ( UTA/AFTP ) + 30 ( Sq funded ) + x ( active duty days ) . It 's up to you to make it work . <p> Here 's what I 've done so far this year ( 4 year Captain ) : 16 UTA periods ( 4 makeup ) , 7 AFTPs , 4 Active duty days , 8 Squadron days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $6000 , which is exactly what one month of pay would net me on active duty as a Captain . I 'm expecting to do somewhere in the neighborhood of $15-25k this year , as a true part-timer who flies about twice a month plus drills and the occasional Sunday desk duty . <p> But I have a full time civilian job . If you have more time available , you can fly a lot more . I think $60k as a 1Lt is a big stretch ( you 'll be flying/on duty nearly as much as an active duty guy ) . Expecting $30-40k take home is more realistic if you 're working your butt off . <p> None of these calculations include deployments , because they 're so infrequent . I 've been in the Guard for 3 years , and have n't deployed yet . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I kind of felt like that $30-40k range was what I could expect/hope for if working/flying my butt off , and a deployment may be imminent for me as well . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a solid 1.5 hour drive from my unit , so I 'm torn about how to handle that as a new guy coming back . I do n't want to burn a good job with benefits , but I also do n't want to be the guy min-running the unit from the beginning , not getting better at flying , and not getting face time around the squadron . <p> If I was single it would be a no-brainer , but , with the family , guaranteed money is hard to give up . 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Let 's assume you find a reserve unit who will let you bum as much as you want ... will it be just like a guard unit it terms of pay ? <p> Pay is the same . There are those who will say Guard is better , others will say the Reserve is better ( Ford vs Chevy ) . I 've seen good and bad units in both the Guard and Reserve . There are pros and cons to both but those are mostly insignificant . Find a unit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Heard good things about Savannah . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> What is the low and high side flying hours wise at a Herc unit ? Obviously dependent on the unit , but overall curious . <p> Depends on how much you want to fly , and if you deploy . Deployed , Herk guys typically do a bit over 300hrs in 120 days . Home station , on the low side you 'll do 100-200hrs a year , up to 400-500 if you 're busy and volunteering for missions . Just up to you .

I tried sending you a PM , but it said you 're " Unable to receive messages " . What 's it like flying in Cheyenne ? How many guys are " full time guard bums " ? Or do most pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I know this may sound naive , but my only experience with C-130 is with Marine Corps KC-130 squadrons in which for the most part the only local area training sortie are aerial refueling sorties . Seeing as guard C-130 's generally do n't have that mission if you are n't going on trips are there local flights to be had ? The reason I ask is that I 'm considering squadron that has the potential to become a C-130 squadron in the future and I 'm trying to understand whether I could make that transition and still being employed in my civilian job . If the only option is 4-5 day trips I may struggle . Thanks 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yes , there 's local flying . Usually 1-4 locals/day . Maybe nothing on Monday or Friday , and maybe less if your tails are deployed or on trips . <p> Either way , you 'll need to fly a good bit to get all your currencies done . We have more beans than some ( all ? ) other heavies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if you 're new ( and therefore have more requirements ) and non-airline .

I 'm from a tanker unit , and I know a lot of pilots there guard bum , and the tankers are always going on trips . Whether it be 1 day , 3 days , 1 week , all the way to 3 months .

@@43194946 @3194946/ <p> In his Apr. 21 memorandum , General Schwartz set forth guidelines and addressed standard eligibility requirements for officers working in the cyberspace domain . Eligibility criteria for enlisted personnel are slated for release in a future message . <p> Maj. Gen. Michael Basla , Air Force Space Command vice commander , who will wear the new badge , highlighted its significance . <p> " The Air Force mission -- to fly , fight and win in air , space and cyberspace -- acknowledges the significance and interrelationship of our three operational domains in effective warfighting . The establishment of the Air Force cyberspace badge underscores the crucial operational nature of the cyberspace mission , " General Basla said . <p> Lt. Gen. William T. Lord , the Air Force 's chief of warfighting integration and chief information officer said the new badge reflects the importance of cyber operations . <p> " The Air Force 's cyberspace operators must focus on operational rigor and mission assurance in order to effectively establish , control and leverage cyberspace capabilities , " he said . " The new cyberspace operator badge identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to operate in this new critical domain . The badge symbolizes this new operational mindset and the Air Force 's commitment to operationalize the cyberspace domain . " <p> The new badge is authorized in three levels : basic , senior and master . Badge level eligibility criteria are consistent with those listed in Air Force Instruction 36-2903 , Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel . The guidance for the cyberspace badge will be included in the next revision of the AFI . <p> Certain officers are " grandfathered " and eligible to wear the new badge . Officers converting from the 33S to the 17D Air Force Specialty Code on April 30 are authorized the basic cyberspace badge . Officers may continue to wear the communications and information badge at the authorized level until Oct. 1 , 2011 . <p> Upon completing the Distance Learning Cyberspace Operations Transition Course -- the " X- course , " Undergraduate Network Warfare Training or meeting criteria for upgrade , officers who earned the senior or master level communications and information badge are authorized to wear that same level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have completed the X-course and have at least one year of cyberspace experience since Jan. 1 , 2006 , also are eligible to wear the cyberspace badge . The 17D career field manager is coordinating with Air Force Space Command 's Space and Cyberspace Professional Management Office to identify eligible officers . <p> Beyond the grandfathering period , standard eligibility criteria will apply and officers will be identified in orders published by the commander of Air Force Space Command , who is responsible for cyberspace force development . <p> The AFSPC commander , in conjunction with the Air Staff functional authorities responsible for cyberspace-related specialties , will regularly approve authorization orders listing additional officers who have earned the badge . <p> The design element of the badge holds significant meaning . The lightning bolt wings signify the cyberspace domain while the globe signifies the projection of cyber power world-wide . The globe , combined with lightning bolt wings , signifies the Air Force 's common communications heritage . The bolted wings , centered on the globe , are a design element from the Air Force seal signifying the striking power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space dimension of the cyberspace domain . <p> The new badge is equal in precedence to the aeronautical and space badges . Those awarded multiples of the cyberspace , aeronautical and space badges must wear the cyberspace badge above the others while serving in a cyberspace billet . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Honestly who gives a shit about what badges we wear in the AF ? Do your pilot wings make you man ? Are you offended when you see a missile dude wearing a flight suit and having a checkride ? <p> I guess I do n't define myself by my airplane or my pilot wings . Are my pilot wings less shiny because the comm geeks now have wings ? <p> I do n't care if everyone in the AF wears a flightsuit , at least then we would n't be wearing goofy digital ABUs . <p> I 'll agree with you on the ABU portion , but not be being offended when non-flying AFSC badges look like some sort of wings ... YGTBFSM ! No , a set wings does n't make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a huge part of our heritage as a flying community . You know , heritage , that thing that some of our senior leaders and especially the uniform boards trample all over in their efforts to create our " unique identity . " <p> IMNSHO , it does sully the meaning of our wings and the pain we all go through to get them . Wings are the singular symbol pilots/navs/aircrew across all services worldwide wear . That symbol says that we 're in the business of operating complicated pieces of iron whether that be sitting up front tugging on the yoke , flying the boom , or operating a multitude of systems in the back . I think it speaks volumes as to what a set of USAF pilot wings mean when I 've met foreign grads of USAF pilot training who chose to wear them instead of those of their own nation . Now we 're going to take that symbol and also say it represents flying trons through air and fiber optic cables while sitting at a desk . Absolutely not , it means we crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badge Designer for chipping away a little more from what it means to bust your ass to get a legitimate set of wings . <p> I 'll caveat my little rant by saying that those guys do bring a sh ! t ton of capability to the fight that makes our jobs easier . They 're an essential part of the toolkit wherever we go , just do n't like the badge . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As gay as this is , it is not something that is being pushed for at the " operator " level . Trust me , I ca n't stand the fact that space operators wear leather jackets , scarves , and the same flightsuits as aircrew . There are a lot of other folks that share my opinion . However , it is not something we asked for , it is something a General ( and pilot ) pushed to show how forward of a thinker he was . <p> Seriously , it 's like we are the community college kids who are the state school 's biggest fans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers . It 's freaking gay . <p> I think it is perfectly reasonable to disagree with these fake wings , and everything else , but you need to blame the decision makers , and not label the folks that do what they 're told . Back when we had blue flightsuits , we were nerds , but at least we were n't nerds trying to be fliers . <p> Cyber and Space have some cool shit going on , and there 's a lot to be proud of in doing this job . The last thing we need is to try to copy the flying world and look like a bunch of wannabe pukes that worship pilots . Nobody wants that . <p> In conclusion , cyber and space are very much part of today 's fight , but we should have our own identity and let the aircrew keep their heritage and traditions in tact . <p> I along with a couple thousand comm guys became a 17D Cyber Operator on 1 May ... Fought the wings as best I could ; but it is what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you keep calling us comm guys . I joined up to be a comm guy , not a cyber guy . Personally , I like airplanes and being closer to that mission , which I 've been lucky to be so far in my short career . I actually know very little about the " base " network world . I 've done more tactical , deployed &amp; comm-maintenance type stuff ... There 's actually quite a bit to this comm field . <p> That said , it is a whole new world in that cyber domain , much of which I do n't even have the clearance to know about . What little I do know is that they do some serious business that could very well win future battles without a shot fired or American life lost - and I 'm 100% good with that . Is every comm guy a real " operator " now ? Nope - but like someone above me said , somebody made the call for the new AFSC and wings ... I signed on the line so I 'll roll with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the end I 'll keep doing what I do to keep the mission moving , regardless of what device I wear . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We do n't care . We could care less about wings . We only care about what we bring to the fight and if you want to know what that is then get on the SIPR . <p> They bring us the most mismanaged , cumbersome , and uninnovative network in the entire world ? <p> I do n't give a shit about wings ... I do n't give a shit about any info that might be on SIPR . I just know the following : <p> 1 . Air Force e-mail sucks . It is slow . A 75MB size limit is absolutely ######ing absurd . Solution : GMAIL ( or contract google to design one for us ) . If you want a better , DOD-ified solution , see AKOs new e-mail . <p> 2 . Air Force portal sucks . It is slow and contains NO ######ING INFORMATION . Wait ? It does contain information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How could it possibly take anyone more than FIVE MINUTES to find a telephone directory . What about a base map ? PFPS ? I can go on . It ######ing sucks . Solution : Connect a google search appliance to that bitch . <p> 3 . DOD to DOD traffic is slow . ###### , intranet traffic that remains on my base is ######ing slow . They just rewired the entire building for CAT-6 and gave us machines with gigabit ethernet cards . Network traffic that stays in the confines of my base SHOULD NOT BE SLOW ! Not when its 1000-Base-T . Solution : I do n't know what the ###### is wrong with it ... <p> 4 . Air Force computer support sucks . Try this shit on for size . AETC buys computers and they get sent to my base . Then , the COMM dudes open the computers and install the AF common desktop on them . Then the COMM dudes tell our ADPEs to pick those computers up and install them in the squadron . Here 's the problem with that : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systems . A 11K3 ( Instructor Pilot ) who HAPPENS to know about computers should NOT be the one installing that computer ! They have n't received ANY formal training about how to install or support that computer . Furthermore , they are n't even given any admin rights to help support it if they wanted to . <p> JCollins , I know you probably work hard and the bureaucracy sucks , but there is no excuse for the air force to be running a network like this . NONE ! We may not be a corporate entity , but there is no reason our network can not behave like one ( fast , well-organized , and secure ) . The Air Force 's focus should be on correcting deficiencies in our network , not offensive " cyber " capabilities or opening up social networking sites . Once our network is where it should be ( as good as Google 's , Apple 's , or Microsoft 's ) , then we can start working on our offensive " cyber " capabilities . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here it goes . My wife is a Comm Officer who hates the base network probably more than we do . She also , along with a lot of other 33S types I am friends with hate the network , hate the software , get infuriated with the 45-75MB e-mail limit , CAC certificates , Office . pst files that stop working or get deleted , and feel that the AF can do a much better job , and above all , they all hate the Comm Focal Point . It is frustrating to try and do all of your mission planning only to be locked out of the network and then get the run around from the Comm Focal Point . Now , imagine being a Comm bubba and not getting any help from the Comm Focal Point . It happens . <p> The problem with the AF is they approve all of this software to run on the machines/network but they do n't test to see that all of this software is compatible with one another . There has been a ton of money lost on contracts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight . " <p> In regards to the Cyber Wings , well , I am not a fan . And like Zach Braff wrote , this was n't a popular topic for the 33S as well . While there are 33S that wish they were operators like any other non-rated types , the majority of the 33S I know are fighting to stay 33S and avoid getting sucked into the 17D fold . I guess in the end it does n't matter anyway . People way over their pay-grades made the decision , and 99% of my non-rated bros are pulling the handle the first chance they get anyway . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> WTF ?

There are rumors this could change in the future , however , it 's unlikely . <p> if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seasoning can you expect from a C-17/C-5 unit ? <p> You can expect a " prog tour " of a few months right back from Altus , and presently about 6 months of Active Duty OIF/OEF orders per year . You can also expect to be trained and seasoned for Aircraft commander . One VERY big difference in the Reserve is that time to upgrade can take a lot longer than AD , because there is no shortage of experience in the unit . Our unit has a 2000 hour policy , which can be overlooked , and is just a guideline , but is a ballpark number . You can expect to get about 500 hours per year if you work consistently . <p> If you 're part-time , can you get more trips ? <p> Yes , you can get " cut to fit " Active Duty orders to fly one of the ten day OIF/OEF trips anytime you like . You can also fly the occasional drop down mission . ( we get about one or two a month ) . <p> Can you afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely . With six months of Active Duty orders per year , all your traditional reservist training money for currency ( locals simulators and ground training ) , orders for upgrade TDY 's , and cut to fit orders , you can make enough money to live comfortably . That being said , there is no guarantee OIF/OEF orders will be offered in the future , and units make no promises to take care of you . <p> You will make a lot more money active duty , but you will also earn every bit of it . <p> Ultimate Tourist , <p> Do you have any airline guys that fly for your unit part time ? I 'm curious how a full time airline job would work with being on active duty flying status for 6 months/year , even if you 're just a traditional reservist . I 'm looking to eventually fly for Continental out of Cleveland ( if/when they start hiring again ) , and applying to the 445th AW which flies C-5s out of WPAFB. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AirGuardian <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about for the Guard units ? <p> As a member of the only Guard C-17 unit without AD on board this answer is for our unit specifically . <p> We have a bunch of folks on orders flying alot doing sandbox quickturn runs in both the areas " Ultimate Tourist " mention in his post . Granted , we tend to stick to 5 day runs vs the 10 days mentioned at " UT 's " unit . We maintain very solid runs for people to plan their lives around which keeps them happy , able , and willing . <p> We have S. America runs on a normal basis as well as the pop up trips to areas all over the U.S. mostly Guardlift which is nice . We hold the reigns on those pretty much and not Big Blue during the missions themselves . <p> Every so often we land a Pacific run which is a good change from our European Vacation extravaganza we 've been doing for nearly 4 years now . <p> Overall , as a Reservist or Guard unit it really comes down to Current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Guard " Bumming " or Reserve " Troughing " ( Part-Time Flying living alone ) can be done rather well if you remain available to schedulers like myself . We cater to those who fly for money and other attributes each mission garners . <p> Traditional Pilots with jobs at other airlines fly alot with us and are able to maintain currency in both jets rather well and are able to enjoy missions which fit their work schedule - that 's my job to ensure they have what they need/want to keep them coming back ... It 's great having the experience level of both Traditional Heavy Airline guys and our Full-Time forever Pilots bringing ideas and foresight to the jet itself . I myself am a full-time Tech at my unit and enjoy flying with the Airline guys just to get a different perspective of what the civilian sector enjoys or does n't as well as their experience . <p> Note : We also have close ties with the Altus C-17 Instructors/Evaluators who fly with us every once in awhile . Gives us time off for our high-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught/emphasized at the school house while the Altus folks seem to enjoy escaping the runs around the flagpole on a weekly basis as well as the tax-free benefits . Great interfly agreement that both sides gain from . <p> Overall , I firmly believe we have the best of both worlds and I would n't trade it for anything right now . <p> Edited February 19 , 2009 by AirGuardian <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest srvmcm <p> I 'm not sure I understand how these Active Duty orders work for heavy guard/reserve jobs .

Do you have to be at the squadron daily when you 're not flying ? I guess I 'm just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the reserve location how would AD orders work ? <p> Units mandate specific needs mind you , <p> But , in our case - those who are on AD orders and not already full-time Guard Employees like myself , do not have to come in daily by any means . If the unit requires them for something , i.e. - full timer shift coverage , aircraft tours or other sideline tasks , then Yes we do call them to do some in-house work . For the most part they are expected to fly the missions we 've gained AD orders for and anything else we might need them to fly last minute . Most of the time we can forcast at least a month out or two on the books for them to plan their lives around . But , if a Big Blue mission drops in unannounced , or a mission shifts to the left or right , we expect them to step up and fly . <p> Several of our folks are over an hour away so they have secured an apartment/hotel locally under these orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long mission that arrives back at homestation at 10PM or later/ or early hours in the morning ( sometimes , they stay to get some local training in as well and do n't rush off . ) Its just the safest way to conduct business . Many drive home 2 , 3 , 6 hours away to be back with the family for a few days before the next mission . Granted , all flyers are expected to maintain currency requirements ; therefore , they will come in and get on the schedule to fly locals / Sims , accomplish Ancillary Training , Drill Weekends ( if they need specialized items ) , Physicals , get vaccinations , etc . It 's really a good deal overall on how take care of our own . They get alot , but they give alot too ! <p> In the beginning I mentioned that I am a Full-Time Employee with the Guard . A bunch of Technicians get AD orders for several months at a time , but are expected to be in the office doing our normal jobs . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tactics , Training , Current Ops , Scheduling , etc. we maintain the job knowledge continuity for the rest of the unit members . It 's a good trade for AD Retirement points and maximization of pay if you understand the system ... <p> Overall , that is what we have been able to maintain at our unit and many others do the same . However , I dare say not many if any other unit has been able to talor their AD orders for their people this well . Biased perhaps a bit , but I 'd like to know if there is any other unit that has been able to employ their folks without the real deal deployments and for almost 4 solid years ... Not a jab , I am really curious . It 's always good to know others who are doing the same or better so you can learn techniques on how its being done . Politics carries alot of weight ya know . Futurewise , who knows ! Mr. Senator is coming down tomorrow so maybe he can give us a clue down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AirGuardian <p> Where do guard/reserve C-17 's and C-15 's usually go on the east coast ? I know you head to the sandbox frequently , but do you get to stop in Europe and see some great places ? Play golf ? Ski ? <p> Because of the missions we 've secured , our unit passes through Andrews AFB for the most part while another one may pass through McGuire / Charleston / Dover for cargo pickup initially , then its off to Germany for either one ( different bases for each ) . Staying the night in Germany with plenty of crew rest compared to others . Sandbox then back to Germany most of the time , plenty of crew rest again , then back through the same locations mentioned above - then homeward bound . Variations do happen depending on our users request of course . Not enough time to ski during the winter - but one crew managed this event somehow , but golf is doable during the summer . We 've been doing this so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some great resturants and whatnot ... Every rare occasion , someone gets anxious and grabs a rental for another tour of the country or another one somewhere , but we 've pretty much made it as far as Normandy , Paris and Amsterdam . But that 's of course if we 're delayed for more than a full day . Yup , many are burned out over this - but we know most or everyone has it worse so complaints are virtually nil . We try to schedule a great/different trip elsewhere for those who fly hard so I can regenerate them . Change is a good thing so they can bring back new stories of fun/bewilderment . Note : I would n't expect this elsewhere so be careful and find out what the unit is really flying . Heard of some great deals , but none seem to last that long . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AirGuardian <p> I dare say the March guys are the closest to running our type of game as well . We initially had dedicated ourselves to 4 missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and off ... <p> After our first year , March was coming on line and they stepped up and took the Bravo bird stuff in Germany . After awhile we gave up another mission and March stepped up again - they were quickest to figure out the deal . I consistently see March tails in Germany so I 'm guessing they 're still playing much of the same game we do , but to a lesser extent for that particular mission set . I 'm sure they play in the Pacific waaay more than we ever have Weeest Coast and all which is nice . I myself have visited them several times and they graciously allowed us to borrow a tail to China . I lived in San Bernardino , CA for awhile and enjoyed their airshows well over 20 years ago as a former 141 guy we 've had plenty of interaction back in the day . After moving to San Jose and graduating a Spartan I unfortunately was too far to sight see anymore . March is a great place to be centrally located with either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Skiiing and Surf within a couple hours or so depending on direction . March is the only other Reserve Component who owns their own iron like us if I 'm not mistaken . <p> But like the man said - Any March guys out there to clarify or just keeping a good secret ! <p> Hydrate , traffic , but minor smog comparatively speaking ... it ai n't a bad place at all ! To each their own of course . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest dudemize <p> One of the good things about the C-5 are no deployments . Our job is to move stuff from the states over to the AOR . No point in deploying us if we just turn around and fly back to the states to pick stuff up . Plus , the mx infrastructure and ramp space requirements are too large . <p> Most of our missions are scheduled for 4-5 days . About half head straight overseas from Dover and the other half transit a stateside base to pick stuff up before heading over . We usually fly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Most missions usually break somewhere for a day or 2 ( or 7 ) , but I 've been pretty luck as my last few trips have gone off as scheduled . For our missions they usually cut us 14 day orders ( to account for breakage or itinerary changes ) and if we get back before then we can just work out the days in the office . We currently have 1 crew ( 3 pilots ) on full time MPA ( active duty ) to fill any trips not picked up by anyone else . Our unit is stingy with the full time orders but other units have a lot more folks on orders . <p> The lifestyle is good but the airplane itself is a real PITA . The maintenance issues wear on you after a while . Also , we see the same 5 or 6 places over and over again . If you want exciting flying and a lot of variety , the C-5 is not for you . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest dudemize <p> Thanks for the info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about reserve bumming out of Dover and owning a house ? Raising a family ? <p> Bumming is no problem . If you you sign up for one mission , that is 14 mandays right there ( you 'll likely only be gone 4-7 days ) . Full time orders are a possibility , but helps if you 're an IP . It helps the schedulers with manning the locals . <p> Dover is one of those places that is great to live , but not so great to visit . We 've been here 8 years now and like it . The cost of living is low and no sales tax ! <p> Having said that , we are thinking of moving , but only to move closer to family . It wo n't be an easy decision if we decide to leave . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest dudemize <p> Just a thought , but are n't you flying the C-5M and soon to be getting the new engines ? Should n't that help A LOT with mx issues ? <p> We just received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most noticeable difference is how quiet it is . The folks living near the base are going to LOVE the M model . By the way , there is no such thing as a C-5M without the new engines . The C-5M , by definition , is fully AMP 'd ( Avionics Modernization ) and RERP 'd ( Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program ) . <p> While the M modifications will definitely help in the mx department , it is still a C-5 with miles and miles of hydraulic lines to leak , electrical wires to short out , and lots of fuel tanks to leak . The engines will make a huge difference , as they should be pretty much maintenance free . No more engine runs ! <p> Anyway , last I heard it is going to take about 4 years for us to fully convert over to the M with the final tally being 18 ( at Dover ) . As of right now , all the C-5Bs will be converted to M 's . My guess is that they will probably convert a few select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That should leave the final C-5 count around 60 ( 112 plus or minus now ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest dudemize <p> How long does it take to upgrade to AC and eventually IP in the reserve C-5 units ? <p> If you fly a lot , you should upgrade in 3-4 yrs . Then another 2 or so to IP if you do a good job as AC . These numbers vary a lot . <p> Is it difficult to find time to go back to school for Master 's , Certifications , etc ? <p> Should be plenty of time for that . As a TR you can work as much or as little as you want . <p> Are ART/AGR positions available for young dudes ? <p> We 've hired several young guys/gals as baby ARTs in the last couple years . Baby meaning they are not IPs which is normally a requirement for ARTs . ART jobs were easy to get back when the airlines were doing well , much harder these days . <p> What type of civilian jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to avoid airlines like the plague ) <p> Airline jobs are nice due to their flexibility . I think we only have 2 or 3 pilots that work your typical 9-5 jobs . We have one that works for Customs and Border Patrol . The rest are bums or airline guys . Myself , I work for NetJets although I 'm on mil leave at the moment . It works great with my reserve stuff . <p> Just out of curiousity , how is the squadron up at Dover ? Push it up type people ? Tight-knit group ? <p> The people in my squadron are awesome . I enjoy flying with pretty much everyone . The problem with Dover , being an associate wing , is we are too closely affiliated with the active duty . We do n't own the airplanes so we get pretty much the same crappy trips as the active duty . We get first dibs on the trips , but all the trips are the same so it does n't help . We do get the occasional good deal AFRC trip .

I filed my VA disability claim early in Dec 2014 so my claim was decided and finalized in four months ( unheard of , but getting better ) . I only mention this to say that anyone separating should immediately request records from their medical clinic on base , because it takes three months for them to copy them down for you . <p> I had an immediate job after separation with an investment company and life seemed to be good .

I applied to over 30-50 jobs a week on various sites , but never used any of the headhunter firms mentioned above . I also applied to USAA as well , but found they typically only hire from within and will move you up from the bottom . This is not uncommon at every military and Veteran 's recruiting fair that I have attended . Most companies are looking for you to start at a beginner 's level and a beginners salary .

A few rules I 've learned in the process . <p> 1 . Never underestimate the power of a referral from a friend . I received two interviews this way that turned into opportunities I eventually turned down for the GS job . <p> 2 . If you simply submit a resume and do n't follow up afterward , do n't expect to get the job . <p> 3 . Do n't get discouraged if at all possible . <p> 4 . Start early finding a job .

Although I have to move out of my home state , I am very happy to be given a government position that will allow me to retire in less than ten years if I deem necessary . Also , once you are in , you have a better possibility of transferring to a state of your choosing later on . <p> 6 . Get all of the civilian certifications you can while on Active Duty ( Six Sigma , PMP , MBA , etc ... ) . It 's a very competitive world out there , and certifications can get your foot in the door . <p> ***Bonus - I wrote a letter of recommendation for a close friend to teach English as a second language ( ESL ) in Japan .

Once I get ready to leave and want to get some gifts from the bazaars I 'll use the Eagle card to get my cash . <p> Cons of cash- easily stolen or lost .

You could probably manage to dodge getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see any reason why you 'd want to . <p> Cons of cash- easily stolen or lost .

That may vary from location to location , but in at least " some " locations , you can use it just about everywhere , with the only exception being any local national " bazaars , " etc. , that may be on base . Even the LN-run restaurants and shops at Balad took the card . YMMV depending on where you go . <p> I went into my deployment ( Nov - Jun last year ) approaching the card w/ the same caution you are--and within a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than cash w/ none of the lost/stolen issues . The security aspect is great--there 's NO connection between your card &amp; your bank account , so even if you lose the card , no one can use that as a way into your bank account . As for getting any residual balance off it , I had something like a $40 balance left when my time was up--while I was waiting on the rotator at the ' Deid the night of my departure , I walked across the street to the shoppette and offloaded the money to my bank account ( simple--just the reverse of the way you normally load it ) . If you get " stuck " leaving the AOR w/ some money on the card , there are ways to get that back , too , though I gather it takes a bit longer ( week or two ? ) . I ca n't think of any reason to have so much money on the card that I 'd care about a week or two , so even that 's not an issue for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the USDP ( and if not , I want to know where you 're getting better than 10% ! ) , or if you otherwise need to move a lot of money around ( e.g. , my TSP contributions got completely porked w/ the CZTE , I had to make a $7.5K " cash " contribution to fix it ) , the deployed Finance office has the ability to give you a temporary limit suspension--instead of the normal daily limit ( $300 ? ) , you can upload whatever you need ( say , $10K for the USDP ) , then give the card to the Finance troop who will deduct it &amp; apply it to wherever you need it . MUCH better than writing a check , IMO . <p> Last point is that using a credit card over there seems to be a bad idea all around . There were multiple cases at Balad while I was there where folks would buy whatever at the BX on their credit card , then all sorts of fraudulent charges would show up . They stopped short of shutting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly because a lot of the small supplies moved around via GPC purchases ) , but it was " highly discouraged " ( and , if you have the Eagle card , unnecessary ) . If you ca n't bring yourself to get the Eagle card , go with cash and leave the credit cards locked up . <p> Bottom line , I really think they " got this one right . " Good luck--have a safe deployment ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Anyone know if you can renew it stateside ?

I 've never used the Eagle Cash card and do n't think almost any of our guys use them either . I 've never been required to even have a card at BAF and have paid cash in the past with no issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I guess I 've never really bought more than like $40 worth of stuff out there so having a couple of Jackson 's in my wallet before arriving in theater was the easiest possible system . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've always used Eagle Cash with no problems . Huggy , get the Eagle Cash card when you get down range if you do n't want to hassle with carrying cash around . It 's a basic debit card ( PIN required ) linked to a checking account . If you prefer cash , go with that . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Anyone know if you can renew it stateside ?

New rule as of Aug 10 is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get a new card each time you deploy , or convince the young finance troop to give you an extended expiration date if you are a frequent deployer . I was able to set my expiration date at 37 months , to cover the 4-5 deployments I will most likely do between now and my next PCS , but that was with a lot of sweet talking ...

@@43194960 @3194960/ <h> General ROTC questions <h> 19 posts in this topic <h> Guest Samwise <p> Hello , This is my first post , but I have been reading up on this forum for a few weeks . I am a Junior in High School and have almost completed my PPL . I hope to go to a state school and pursue my ratings , but I have wanted to serve my country too . I 've been looking at all of my options for a pilot slot in the military and have narrowed it down to to the USAF , Navy , and Coast Guard . I want to keep my options open and not miss out on opportunities that will come at me in the next few years . I always thought the AF was for me , but I am unsure if ROTC will be , and the academy is probably out because I 'm not an all A student . I was in Civil Air Patrol for half of a year and never even wore a uniform ( made the new people dressup in white collared shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almighty CAP cadets called us penguins ... wow ) and quit for a number of reasons . There was so much b.s. going on ... including taking ' orders ' from a 11 year old fat a** who was incompetant , and very immature . In the beginning it is fine we learned about aviation related stuff , but then it got really and it was 4 hour meetings where we stopped learning about aviation and started learning how to stand at attention for multiple inspections . I can take this s*** , but not from a bunch of wannabe military kids who think that I 'm there b**** . <p> I 'm sorry for this rant , but is ROTC like CAP ? I mean its college and I do n't want that crap now and I really do n't want to be wasting my time for a maybe pilot slot if the commander likes me and go through 4 years of training . <p> If you went through ROTC would you do it again or go OTS ( knowing it would be harder to get a slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you only go through college once ... so any advice for a novice ? <p> Thank you , <p> Samwise <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Flight <p> ROTC is the way to go if you do n't alredy have a degree . It 's not like CAP , but you will deal with some things that seem stupid . It 's just part of the game you have to play if you want to get a commission . It 's good that you have flight hours , but that 's a small part of the puzzle . You need to focus on having good grades and be active in sports . Get involved with your school some . You have to first get into college before you can get into ROTC . Maybe pick a couple of schools you 'd like to go to , and contact the det now to see what you can do to better your chances of getting a scholarship out of H.S. <p> Now , one thing I see already that you need to squash is the attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are always going to be below somebody and have to just shut up and take the kick in the sack without bitching about it . In ROTC YOU WILL have to stand at attention for inspections while some wannabe military kid looks you over . 90% of the stuff you do in ROTC has NOTHING to do with aviation . Everything in ROTC is a MAYBE until you can prove to your CC that you deserve a chance . Attitude is everything in ROTC ! How well can you deal with the crap without selling yourself out is key . If you ca n't do these things , than the military is not going to be for you . It 's hard for you to see it now with your narrow minded H.S view , but when you enter the military it 's no longer about what YOU want . It 's all about what the AF wants to do with you ... You have to prove to the AF that you deserve the opportunity to serve it . The sooner you realize this , the better off you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end up flying a desk like me , but it 's not the end of the world . If you ca n't accept that fact , then forget about it ... You wo n't make it ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Flight is right on ! I can reiterate the fact that there will be a bunch of BS to put up with in ROTC , but it 's all about how bad you want to be an Officer first ( nevermind wanting to be a pilot ) . Having been a Sgt in the USMC and been through part of USMC OCS , I can tell you any commissioning source will have it 's share of BS to put up with . Having said that , it was extremely tough for me to come to AFROTC and have kids with 0 military experience telling me what I should and should not do . But I checked my ego at the door and sucked it up ( sts ) . Be prepared to put up with the BS no matter what and worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot ... as Flight said , it 's all about what the AF wants/needs .

Sorry after re-reading my first post I think I came off with a bit of a ego problem which is far from the truth . I am involved in H.S. sports ( soccer ) and am active enough in other intramurals where I am in good shape , so that 's not really an issue for me . I am sorry if I came off bitter too , but I guess I am just mad that I did n't realize that there was no light at the end of the tunnel for me in CAP sooner , I mean I lost a few Friday nights . Let me re-adjust my questions a bit : <p> Was ROTC really strict while you were in college ? Like if your an athlete in H.S. and you are caught drinking you are coded and can be kicked off the team , is it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you committed to joining like the Navy 's BDCP program ? Is it compettitive to earn one ? <p> How does ROTC work , is it at nights or is it considered a class ? <p> What is the main area of study in ROTC ? Military History ? Officer Responsibilities ? Aviation ? <p> Is it like a 4 year extended boot camp ? <p> I heard the differenc between AFROTC and NROTC is that in the AF everyone wants to be a pilot or nav and it is more compettitive , is this kinda true ? <p> How do you sign up , do you just visit the detachment and tell them your interested ? <p> Do you have to pay for your uniform ? <p> I 'm sorry if this is very annoying , but the irony is the two branches of service I do n't want to enter ( Army and the Marines ) are the only ones who try and recruit from my school and I 'm quite clueless to what ROTC really is . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking can be filled from www.afrotc.com website . <p> Yes , you will attend an ROTC academic class once a week for your first two years and then twice a week for your last two . There is also physical training in the mornings and a 2-4 hour " class " one night a week that is more physically involved than the academic class , although there are still academics in the 2-4 hour class . <p> I was n't in CAP , but ROTC is : rainbow : and most cadets realize that . Well , I should n't say most , I 'd say about half . The thing you 've just got to remember while you in it is that it 's a 4 year long game and you 're supposed to learn to put up with the bullshit and the cadets who are just douches . I do what I can to get my face time with the cadre and I certainly do my jobs around the det with a smile , but I do NOT enjoy it ; but it has to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is NOT NOT NOT like ROTC ; yes , there will be some things on AD , but it 's much better than ROTC . <p> But believe me , if you want to fly a bird , you 'll put up with a lot of crap . <p> Outside of ROTC most of us are just like any other college student . There are , however , some cadets who only hang out with other rotc people ; do n't be one of those guy , live your college experience to the fullest . With that being said , it is like sports teams in high school . If you get caught drinking , smoking , whoring or whatever , you can easily get kicked out and if you 're on scholarship be forced to repay what you 've been given . You can still party , get drunk , chase girls and whatever else floats your boat , but if you 're underage or even of age , you 've got ta keep it under control because if you Fvck up , you 're gone . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone number or email of the unit admissions officer and give them a ring , they 'll guide you through the rest . <p> No , you do n't have to pay for your uniform , but you do have to put in a deposit in case you burn it in a drunken bonfire or something . <p> Scholarships are competitive based on the make up of your class within your detachment so it all depends on your classmates . <p> The area of study during the classes varies from what year you are . Your first year you 'll just learn basic AF lingo , customs and courtesies and other crap like that . Second year is about history , third and fourth are more about what you 'll be doing on AD and refining the skills you 'll need to be successful . <p> Do n't be afraid to ask more questions , but do n't be afraid to use the search function . <p> Good luck , I 'd definitely advise anyone who wants to fly to go AFROTC <p> P.S.- Good on you for flaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your CAP accomplishments this conversations would have been much different : ) 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm currently in my 5th year ( yes , 5th year ) of AFROTC due to my technical degree . I 'll try to answer all of your questions in the order you asked .... these are my opinions of course ... <p> Due to the current down-sizing of the Air Force , it is extremely damaging to be caught drinking while underage , or for any alcohal related incident . Only a very small percentage of cadets stay in ROTC after an incident like this . The cadre ( officers in charge of the program ) must really want to fight to keep you in the program in order for you to survive . That being said , if you have something like this on your record before you enter the program , I have found that ROTC is willing to give you the benefit of the doubt , even when applying for scholarships ..... just do n't screw up again . <p> I came in with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were allowing you to try the program for one year without consequence ... meaning that if you dropped ROTC , you only had to pay back the AF for the money they spent on your tuition and fees . After the first year of being on scholarship , the AF is allowed to involuntarily enlist you into the AF if you drop ROTC . I have only seen 2 cadets enlisted into the AF on these terms . The others have had to pay back the money . The further you get in ROTC , the more risk of being enlisted you have ... both of the cadets were Seniors who decided to drop . <p> These scholarships are competitive . The best way to earn one is to pursue a technical degree which the AF is always looking for . About 50% of AFROTC scholarships are given to technical degrees like engineering and physics . 25% are given to cadets that pursue degrees that are considered to be a critical need for the AF , like meteorology or electrical engineering . The other 25% is non-technical degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your grades up , keep being involved in sports and start thinking of people to write reccommendations for you . <p> Every university is different in their scheduling of ROTC courses , but generally , mine have n't run past 1800 . You have academic courses and then leadership lab . Plus you are required to attend PT sessions and a few other things which might take place on Saturdays ... like military balls or dining outs . Your academic courses cover a lot ... from Air Force history to National Security issues and Leadership . <p> ROTC is generally relaxed except when you are preparing for Field Training . Depending on which detachment you go to , this might be a year or only one semester of your training . Field Training is either a 4 week or a 6 week training camp between your sophomore and junior year . <p> Not everyone wants to be a pilot , but yes initially , most cadets think it 's what they want to do . Then they realize it 's much harder than they first thought and revert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an outsider ... that everyone wants to fly . <p> You can visit the det of which ever university you are thinking of attending ... they are generally very accomodating to potential cadets . They will be able to tell you what you need to do . Speak to the Unit Admissions Officer ( UAO ) <p> No , you do n't have to pay for your uniforms until you commission as a 2nd Lt. Treat them well though because you are responsible for any damage .... and they are gov property . <p> You can PM me if you want more info .... or just ask on the thread and I 'll check up on it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest monkeypoo <p> Sam , AFROTC is game , like anything else . A game you got ta know the rules to play . You 're going to find some , and in some cases , a lot of the similar crap in AFROTC that you found in CAP . Understand that , but know where you want to be and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trix sometimes for many reasons and some detachments are better than others . I just graduated from a small detachment and am glad to be done because it was full of a lot of cut-throat a-holes ( and a few great dudes too ) , but I learned a ton in the process . Yes , pilot and rated slots are competative , but I 've never seen anyone who deserved it , not get one . As long as you put ROTC into perspective you 'll be fine . Just know that ROTC is a means to an end . Before I joined AFROTC , I was fortunate that my father was a CSAR ( Combat Search &amp; Rescue ) flyer , so I had a good idea about what life in a flying sqdn was like as well as what the high motivation of flying dudes was like . So I went into AFROTC knowing THAT was the Air Force I wanted to be part of . In my time in ROTC , I saw a few great cadets get jaundiced by the of ROTC and quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor leadership of the cadre at my detachment . But the more ROTC dropped the ball sometimes the more it made me focus on getting what I wanted - which was the pilot slot . The trick is just to remember that it is all a game . Play it well , work hard and you WILL get what you want . And btw , I was accepted to the AF Academy and decided not to go . After doing the ROTC thing and looking back now , I 'm still glad I did n't go the USAFA route and would have still gone to the same detachment even after knowing what I know now . Over all , AFROTC is a great program that often has many flaws , but will teach you a lot about yourself . To succeed in competing for a rated slot , keep your grades high ( academic major does n't matter ) , perform well at all basic military skills , stay out of trouble and keep your eyes on the ball and that 's it . Hope you find that advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm now on my way to UPT and it feels great . Air power ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ShineR <p> I 've answered the questions many have already answered , but maybe there 's a few nuggets in there ... <p> Oh and even if you 're not an " A " student , try the USAF Academy anyways , check it out and see what its all about . Looking back at my experience of going through the whole ROTC program , I wish I would have taken my invitation to the Academy . If you have questions about that , PM me . <p> Was ROTC really strict while you were in college ? Like if your an athlete in H.S. and you are caught drinking you are coded and can be kicked off the team , is it like this in ROTC ? <p> Get used to this answer : it depends . It depends on your cadre , it depends on what you did , and it depends on YOU eg if you have good grades , good attitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on little things due to manning issues and anything can pretty much end your ROTC career if your cadre does not fight for you . I know of cases where a cadet was n't the sharpest ( no where close actually ) got an underage drinking ticket and was gone . Same thing happened for another cadet who was sharp and only got a slap on the wrists . Just be sure you do n't  screw around , and if you do , do n't  get caught . <p> If you get a scholarship are you committed to joining like the Navy 's BDCP program ? Is it compettitive to earn one ? <p> Yes and Yes , for the most part anyways . If you get a scholarship and contract , you are contracting for 4 years . You will have to do this after your sophomore year anyways if you are not on scholarship . If you lose your scholarship , you will have to pay it back and/or enlist . <p> As for competitive , some scholarships are more competitive than others , just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical degree ... tech degrees = 5 years of hating life and learning something that you will never use . <p> How does ROTC work , is it at nights or is it considered a class ? <p> Its a class . You have one class were you learn about BS and a Leadership Laboratory where you stand around doing BS . <p> What is the main area of study in ROTC ? Military History ? Officer Responsibilities ? Aviation ? <p> First two years some leadership , but mainly military history and how to wear your uniform and stuff . After that its leadership and paper pushing skills . <p> Is it like a 4 year extended boot camp ? <p> No . Unless you are a Texas A&amp;M or VA tech type , because they have what is called a " Cadet Corps , " but even then , its not really boot camp , just more BS . Only " boot camp " thing you will do is field training and that 's only a month long during the summer between sophomore and junior year . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AF everyone wants to be a pilot or nav and it is more compettitive , is this kinda true ? <p> It depends . Different classes want more flying slots , some do n't  want them at all . As long as you 're good and do n't  suck , you should get a slot for something . <p> How do you sign up , do you just visit the detachment and tell them your interested ? <p> I did exactly that . Look for a website at the local school or give them a call for more info . <p> Do you have to pay for your uniform ? <p> Not while you 're in ROTC , but after you graduate and commission , you can buy them at a discounted rate if you want . You will have to buy uniforms after commissioning no matter what though . <p> I 'm sorry if this is very annoying , but the irony is the two branches of service I do n't want to enter ( Army and the Marines ) are the only ones who try and recruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROTC really is . <p> Army and Marines have decent programs if you are into helos , though standard of living is different . And FWIW , I would rather be a Marine pilot than a Naval Aviator any day of the week . <p> Hope this helps <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest fartman38 <p> I apologize if this topic was already mentioned previously , as I could n't find one like this . <p> I just want to get it straightened out what I 'm going to go through once in ROTC . For AFROTC , do you apply for a pilot slot in your junior year , or after Field Training ? If you do n't get selected , do you have a secondary choice such as a Nav if you qualify ? Pilot Alternative List ? How and when does this process all begin ? When do you normally get results ? <p> Let 's say there are about 30 cadets in a AF Det , usually how many apply for a pilot slot , and usually how many receive one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BTG program ? Does it qualify for anyone ? <p> And say you received a slot for UPT , do more candidates drop out during UPT ? How ? And how does the selection list work , such as Bombers , Helos , Fighters , Cargo , etc . <p> How does this whole huge ' process ' work ? <p> And similar process descriptions for the Navy and Marines are also appreciated . <p> I apologize again if this post was already mentioned . <p> Thanks in advance <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest bdmski <p> Basically your junior year you inform them which of the rated positions you would like to apply for . Pilot , Navigator aka Combat Systems Officer , Air Battle Manager , and the new Remotely Piloted Aircraft Pilot . You can apply to all of them or none of them if you 'd like . You 'll have to rank them in order of your preference . Your junior year around March/April time frame you 'll find out if you got any of them or got an alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your det , rather how many in your graduating class . Those are the people you are competing against not only in your det but nationwide . In my det we had 10 people in my graduating class . 5 applied for pilot . 3 got it and one got an alternate . I applied for all the rated positions and got nav alternate and hear back about RPA pilot next month after the board meets . <p> As for UPT , people can drop out before they even get there for getting medically disqualified , or perhaps they show up at IFS in colorado and realize that flying is not for them . I 'm sure dropping out at UPT is not impossible either . After the second phase of UPT you are put in either a fighter/bomber track , tanker/cargo track , or helo track . Depending on your ranking within your track and the needs of the air force determines what air frame you get if and after you complete UPT. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> A quick question-- What happens if you run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship ) during your third or fourth year of ROTC ? Is that " Game Over " , or is there more to it than that ? <p> If you are only talking about ROTC scholarships , expand your horizons and look at all that are out there . There are thousands of scholarships available for college students , so I would assume you can get at least one . They have books at Barnes and Noble that detail a good number of them and outline what you need to do in order to be competitive for one . And like Rainman said , get a job . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> During our end of the year awards ceremony they must 've gave out atleast 20 different scholarships and most of the recipients were POC . They ranged anywhere from $500-&amp;10,000 and the criteria was usually pretty straightforward.Trust me there are plenty of ways to get money from scholarships .

If this is true what 's the point of signing Sanctuary letters anymore if they kill the one chance of getting Sanctuary . This is all through the grapevine so I do n't know how true it is but I 'm willing to bet Big Blue is all worried about a handful of Guardsman and Reservists getting an AD retirement and is starting to put pressure on units to keep people from getting Sanctuary . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It 's amazing how upper managment in the unit buys the Big Blue party line , " If you get sanctuary , the active duty can sent you ANYWHERE !

Plus as a Guardsman if you get sanctuary you become an AGR . All the flyers I knew who got sanctuary ended up staying in their units . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Sanctuary applies to the AD as well . Basically what it says if you reach the 18-20 year point in your career , the military ca n't suddenly RIF you to screw you out of your retirement to save money . ( At some point they most have been doing this to create this law ) unless for some reason you wanted to get out at the 18 year point . For the Guard and Reserve they put into place a set of policys on how to adopt this to ANG/AFRC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 years of AD points ( not reserve or guard points ) Any time I do some sort of mission that 's MPA/title 10 ( sort of like the AD renting or contracting out a ANG/AFRC to fly a mission ) I have to sign a waiver saying I will not claim sanctuary . If however I get involuntary called up or mobilized I can declare sanctuary and serve out my remaining time on AD and recieve a AD retirement once I serve my time as opposed to getting my retirement at age 60 for ANG/AFRC . Sanctuary can be a confusing policy and Big Blue is n't exactly handing out color brochures or creating a course on ALDS to teach you the ins and outs of sanctuary ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I just went over 17 years of AD points and am learing a lot about sanctuary . I was told that in the event your squadron/Wing is " involuntarily mobilized " you 'll be offered the opportunity to sign a nice , fresh sanctuary waiver , or simply not be mobilized/deployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else from within , or seek a hired gun to replace you . <p> When I was at Little Rock back in 2005 , two of the instructors were GA guardsman who 'd been activated for either OEF/OIF and went into sanctuary and declared sanctuary .

I know the AFI on the sanctuary program ( AFI 33-332 WRONG AFI IT 's AFI 36-2131 for Sanctuary in the Air Reserve Components ) states that AFRC members who enter and declare sanctuary will be absorbed into the AFRC AGR program until they complete 20 years of active duty . I assume that since the majority of AFRC AGR positions seem to be either in GA , DC ( Pentagon ) or Colorado , it does mean a PCS for those entering sanctuary , although not to some armpit , third world hell hole . <p> What really sucks about sanctuary is that the program was designed to protect reservists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when over or close ( AFRC tracks all members over 16 1/2 years AD Points ) to sanctuary as it requires a waiver , that until recently had to be signed by the NAF/CC ( now at the Wing ) . It made it a pain to see an opportunity and apply ( esp if it was short notice ) only to know it would take some time to get a waiver , and therefore you really are n't competitve for the position in the first place . <p> Reason for the edit : I referenced the wrong AFI .

Just trying to find out if this is common practice at UPT and what everyone 's feeling on this are . <p> First of all , it 's not a " Fighter Crunch " , <p> The tradition of crushing the flight cap actually came from the bomber community in WWII . During missions , the Pilots would wear their flight caps underneath their headsets . <p> After they came home , they would step out of their aircraft and with their headsets removed , their caps would have a " crush " in them . <p> So ... it is n't a " Fighter Crunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since WWII . For some reason , fighter guys are doing the " Bomber Crush " . I have no idea why fighter guys do it and I doubt they even know ... I guess deep down inside , they 've always wanted to be a bomber pilot . ; ) <p> What 's even more funny than seeing a Fighter guy with a Bomber Crush is seeing a Non-Rated Officer with one . Now that is just ridiculous ! <p> In the bomber community , the tradition of the " Bomber Crush " is still in practice today . <p> Anyway , last year I spoke with a B-17 bomber pilot who verified the tradition . He was a great guy who had lots of stories . If you ever get the chance to speak to these pilots , it will truly humble you . <p> Below is another explanation of this time honored bomber tradition . It goes into a little more detail . <p> Hope this clears things up a bit <p> Peace , <p> THRILLER <p> LONG ... <p> " Normally , the cap had stiffeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire around the inside top perimeter to maintain the cap 's round shape . These kept the cap in its proper , regulation military shape and angle . However , since bomber pilots wore headsets over their caps during flights , they would remove the wire stiffener to make headset wear more comfortable , causing the sides of the caps to become crushed . Eventually , the caps retained their floppy " crushed " look , giving the pilot who wore it the look of a seasoned veteran . The crush cap identified its wearer as an experiened pro , and was as much a part of his identity as his leather flight jacket .

Weird huh . Anyway they would not grant a waiver which he fought for 6 months to no avail . So he gave up for a bit then tried to start the ETP process , what a mess . He was lucky cause he knows a senator and a guy who is president Bush 's #1 campaign financier and a number one dickhead also ( just my .02 cents ) but my buddiy was told by AFPC that he better have at least that much " powder in his keg " to try and get an ETP and even with that much , it would be a long shot unless George Busch himself signed a letter of rec . <p> Long story short , he got very lucky . Apparently two weeks ago the AF called his recruiter ( before starting the ETP process ) and said okay were gon na let your guy in because he has already been selected and approved so were tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another batch of eye tests not including the cyloplegic refraction , then well let him waiver the test .

You really have everything to gain and nothing to lose by persuring an ETP . I would be interested to know what the postop results for applicants mentioned by Rage were and how they compare to your 's . If they had marginal results after PRK that may have been the deciding factor . If your eyes are significantly better and if the rest of your package is strong you may still have a good chance . <p> Your profile says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are on AD .

My PAS is the one I owe my ETP to . <p> I do n't know your particulars or if your surgery was very successful but if it was I would build a package that shows the AF that they will incur minimum risk and be getting an exceptional individual and a strong candidate for pilot training . <p> Some things I think would make strong medical evidence for your case ( Rage and F-16MD if I am off on any of this or forgot something please jump in and set me straight ) : <p> -Good vision of 20/whatever <p> -Eyes that are stable , that your vision is consistant and your eyes are not changing <p> -Include all of your pre and post op paper work from your eye doctor and the doctor that performed your PRK . <p> -A letter from these doctors saying your surgery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of activity . <p> -An evaluation and recommendation by an Air Force doctor . <p> After you have established that your eyes are sound medically you will want to show the Air Force you are exceptional and a strong candidate for UPT . Some good evidence : <p> -Recommendation from your CC <p> -Letter from your senator or congressman <p> -Awards <p> -Stellar OPR 's <p> -Good GPA <p> -Good AFOQT <p> -Strong PCSM <p> -Flying hours ( if you do n't have them already I do n't know if dropping several thousand would really help or not ) <p> -Anything else that shows you are a good officer <p> I hope that this helps you .

As such , ETP recurs as an alternate way that disqualified folks look to get a pilot slot . Here is a Bullet Background Paper I prepared on this topic years ago . <p> - USAF physical standards ( AFI 48-123 ) are used to select candidates for various categories of service ranging from enlistment to pilot training . They are designed to select for functional capability and operational safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems in mind <p> -- AFI is based on Department of Defense Instruction , DODI 6130.4 Criteria and Procedure Requirements for Physical Standards for Appointment , Enlistment or Induction <p> - Candidates , who fail to meet minimum qualification medical standards , may be reconsidered for accession and/or entrance into aviation and other special operational duty training programs , via medical waivers and the CSAF exception to policy ( ETP ) <p> - A medical waiver is a scientifically validated extension of a published medical standard based on pre-established criteria and requisites . When appropriately and consistently applied and monitored by the duly-appointed waiver authority , medical waivers are associated with minimal risk to AF operations , including personal health , mission completion , or flying safety <p> - The ETP is a process employed by the CSAF and other designated AF authorities under unique and special circumstances to reconsider a candidate who : <p> -- Has failed to meet minimum criteria for a medical waiver as determined by the appropriate medical waiver/certification authorities <p> - The ETP decision is the product of a deliberate operational risk management ( ORM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the overall interests of the AF are best served by accepting the limitations of a specific medically disqualified candidate .

I realize you have to do something to earn your AF paycheck but would n't that make it harder to get a waiver ? I can see the AF saying " well , he 's already a Maintenance officer , we 'll just keep denying him " . <p> I ask this question because I was recently DQ ( 4 days ago ) for what eventually turned out to be Keratoconus . The doc , at first , said " you have a precursor to TPSK which has a 30% chance of developing into keratoconus " . Then it became " you have early stage TPSK " and landed on " you have keratoconus " . Sounds like they are building a case to support their DQ , IMO . I want to get a 2nd opinion because , from what I have read , at this stage I should have deteriorating visual accuity , etc .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception , perfect color vision , perfect visual accuity .

Officers ... good luck with your ETP ... it 's a difficult road and again finding a friend of a friend who happens to be a flight surgeon who will try to be an " advocate " for your case will only make the process longer and make the flight surgeon look like a fool ... it is strickly a LINE decision ... if the chain of people in your corner ( non-medical ) can convince the Sec of the AF that you walk on water or are the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AF Surgeon General 's office for their opinion ( based on the work-up done by the AF consultants ... Brooks ) and make his call ... he has the authority to say " Thanks medical folks ... but I 'm willing to take a chance on this one " ... that 's the process in a nut shell ... if your stars and bars buddies can help influence the process who could blame you for trying ... there is nothing more the medical side can do for you ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Fuse <p> Looking for advice and information I have n't yet found using search ... <p> Basicly I got ear tubes for what I think now was an issue with my wisdom teeth . I have read elsewhere ( including here ) that they were allowed and did n't need a waiver . Well they needed a waiver . Then I was DQ 'd for them . Technically I was DQd for ' perforation of the eardrum ' which I did n't have until the doc perforated it to place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with knows nothing about ETP waivers , nor does my recruiter . My ENT doc is willing to write letters or make phone calls to support me , but I 'm not even sure where to go from here . I have no issues about prepping an ETP request , but I have no idea where to send it to . <p> Can I pull my ear tubes out and reapply ? Can I send the ETP to AETC or wherever on my own ? <p> Any help would be greatly appreciated . <p> Edited June 24 , 2009 by Fuse <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> First things first . Check out AFI48-123 and the waiver guide ( Google should get you there ) to learn all there is to know about tubes and ear drums . It wo n't take you long to know more , from an administrative perspective , than most of the medical techs , some of the docs , and virtually anyone in your chain of command . <p> If you find out that a waiver is not an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of thumb is that if a condition is waiverable for folks who are already pilots/navs you have a decent case for an ETP . There is limitied guidance available for ETPs but everything I 've seen is geared towards being too old for UPT . You 'll follow the same basics . The ETP goes up your chain of command and eventually gets routed to the Vice Chief of Staff . I 'm basing all this off my personal experience in 2004 so things may be slightly different now . <p> My ETP package included : <p> A Staff Summary Sheet ( any exec can help you with this part ) <p> A memo explaining the situation and requesting an ETP <p> Letters of support <p> Medical documentation <p> Etc . <p> I ca n't remember for sure but a copy of my UPT application may also have been required . <p> I was on active duty in AFMC when I worked through all of this and I think that was a big help . Doing it through AETC is probably an order of magnitude more difficult . What is your status ?

All dudes selected right out of UPT go to T-38 PIT and are a T-38 IP for about 2 years at Whiteman before attending the B-2 RTU . The majority of the rest of folks picked up for B-2 's are FAIPs and MWS guys . Nearly all MWS folks now days are prior bomber or fighter pilots . <p> Any interested UPT studs should let their flight commanders know early that they are interested because there is some type of application package involved . You have to go through the T-38 track to be selected . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm at Whiteman now . Just met a 2Lt who 's checking in here to fly the B-2 .

Just filling in my $.02 from the other side of UPT ( not me , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crappy assignment though . Hardly any flight time ( T-38 or B-2 ) , and once your qual 'd on the B-2 , where are you going to go ? Knob Noster is a nice little town and all , but I would n't want to be stuck here for my entire career ! ! From what I 've seen , once you get into a B-2 specific job , this is where you stay . <p> Any comments ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AKROTC <p> IT ALLLL depends on the lifestlye that you 're interested in after UPT . To some of us , however rare , having a long-term , stable assignment in the heartland of America with relatively low deployment rates that only go to tropical islands , all the while flying the most advanced and incredible aircraft in history ( IMHO ) ... is allll good . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yes the B-2 is given out to UPT about twice a year and they become a T-38A IP here at Whiteman for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which generally is about 6-9 months . That could all change once they start training the STL guard guys so maybe less people will be selected for a few years . We have 2 squadrons of about 20 pilots each and an OSS . If you fly your ass off in the T-38 then you can get over 80 hrs/year but much more as an IP but not as many as an AETC IP . The B-2 you fly twice/month but sometimes more and you can get maybe around 125-150 hrs/year depending on long durations . The lifestyle is n't all that bad and Kansas City is close by . As a young guy you 'll move around to all the squadron jobs and upgrade normally but understand you 'll have many MWS guys coming in after you but upgrading to AC and IP much faster . Obviously they 'll hold the Flt/CC jobs sooner too . You would probably be in the BS until becoming an IP then either moving to the OSS or applying to WPS if that 's your wish . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 325th WPS is here at Whiteman so I just said WPS . I 'm not sure how other airframes work but like I mentioned the upgrades are fairly normal up through SEFE . We have small shops so you do move through pretty much all of them . I understand the hours thing , I was just trying to add it all together . People only hear about the 2 B-2 sorties each month but do n't fully understand the durations and other training such as simulators that we get . The T-38 is available if people want to fly and cross countries are open to wherever . <p> My recommendation for new guys out of UPT is that this may not be what they 're looking for . Do n't get me wrong , the B-2 is unique and quite remarkable but for new guys no one is sure yet what do to with them after 3-4 years if they do n't want to attend WPS . They could be here for 3 years or 10 , who knows . Maybe that 's what they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ALO's/year . Whiteman is becoming younger which hopefully will change some but we still have a majority coming from other MWS. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You mentioned about getting the MOGAR guys through their training , but I wondered how many are actually set to TX to the B-2 ? <p> When I was with them last summer , I could n't find a single one who thought they 'd actually go across - most were set on retiring , and the younger guys were talking about trying to get hired at Jacksonville or Klamouth Falls . <p> Of course , this was all said in the bar over the course of several evenings and the odd shot of weed , but it 's be interesting to know how many are actually going to retire or move , and how many will actually go accross to the B-2 . <p> Cheers <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yeah I have no clue how many are making the TX .

I will say that ALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that required a T-38 at UPT . It 's very close-nit up there , but they are not obnoxious about letting new people into their circle , it was actually a really cool community and I had a blast , even though everyone there knew I wanted C-17s . <p> I really ca n't say for sure , but if I were you , I 'd try to talk to some people up there . Call , e-mail , whatever . The club usually has quite a few people there on Friday nights , see if you can make it up there and have a few beers . Hang out , talk to people , and say , " Yeah , I really want this for next assignment , so I figured I 'd come up and check it out . " vs . " Hey , are you somebody who can get me a spot here ? " . Not that you would , just throwing that out there . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So according to a recent email I received , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B-2 .

Nothing to write home about but not 80 hours a year . <p> Manning was like the rest of the CAF - always 6.9 dudes below authorized strength . I do n't think that has changed . <p> I have no SA on current hiring practices . If you would like a good number or contact let me know and I 'll see what I can dig up . <p> Like every assignment there are good and bad aspects of the job . The B-2 community is small with only the one main base at Whiteman . Means you do n't move around much - that can be good and bad . It also means there can be bullshit politics . I 've always said the more good bros we hire and the younger and more normalized we get -- the better . Seriously , we hire are own guys - its our own fault if we hire jackasses . <p> Make up of the community is by my WAG about 50% bomber , 25% fighter , 10% FAIP and 15% other ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with success . If you were raised right in your previous community , a good bro , can fly and employ the weapon system while not being an ass it does n't matter if you previously flew AWACS , Eagles , BUFFs , KC-10s , C-21s , F-16s , etc . And anyone that really does care what you previously flew beyond busting balls at the bar is a self-identified ass . <p> And yes , straight from UPT dudes can excel . I understand in the last couple years the younger dudes , even some straight from UPT bubbas waiting on a B-2 training date flying as pseudo FAIPs have been able to deploy downrange gaining experience in the MC-12 . Good on em . <p> Be advised if you are thinking the B-2 is something you are interested in - once you have nuclear stink on your record it will stick with you . That probably closes more doors than it opens . <p> I got to do a lot of cool stuff while at Whiteman . My timing in the jet sucked as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is plenty of good other work to keep life interesting . The program began in the black world after all . <p> I ca n't speak to the current morale of the Wing . I enjoyed my time there but certainly bitched about plenty ( i.e. standard ) . <p> I 've never heard of an AFSOC dude making the transition - but that does n't mean it has never happened - especially as I have been out of the loop for a couple years . <p> There are a couple others on this board who can add some more recent dope on what is happening in the community and/or raise the BS flag on what I 've written . Except that Bluto kid - do n't listen to a word he says ! 
@@43194976 @3194976/ <h> Enlisted to Pilot <h> 15 posts in this topic <h> Guest Booty <p> Hi everyone . I 'm in a dire need of some help . I have wanted to be a pilot since i was old enough to walk . It has been my dream . I could n't afford college after high school so i did what i though was best ... i enlisted in the Air Force as a F-16 Avionics Specialist . Now 3 years in , i am finally getting my chance at going officer but i feel like im approaching this all wrong . It seems like everyone i talk to has only 2 pieces of advice for me ... 1 . Go to the Academy ( well i 'm 22 and damn me for not going out of high school but i did n't  know any better and i did n't  go , i 'm sure there 's another way ) and 2 . I have no chance at getting a pilot spot going ROTC unless i have 99s in everything . Bottom line is i want to go ROTC and i want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told is available for me and that is AECP , ASCP , and SOAR . I am making packages for ASCP and SOAR and hoping to have them in by June . I am taking the AFOQT in either April or May . I am studying the ARCO books but here on the base library there all the books from 2003 ! Basically the education office on base told me they will not help me out until i take the AFOQT so i 'm curious as to what else i 'm going to need to apply for those programs . Has anyone else gone enlisted to pilot with any information for me , i feel really really lost here and i really want to get going with it this year . I 'm taking the AFOQT around the same time i 'm testing for SSgt and i 'm opting out studying for Staff just to take this test . I keep hearing about this TBAS ? I 'm stationed at Luke AFB in Phoenix so if your a pilot on base at the 61st AMU ... no more code 3s on Friday .. k thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Hey dude , relax . I did exactly the same thing you 're doing about 5-6 years ago , and now I 'm a pilot . I did n't go to the academy and I did n't have 99s in everything . In fact , ROTC is the easiest route to getting you a pilot slot . True , the academy grads get top choice on getting the slots , but if you work hard enough , it 's pretty easy to get one out of ROTC . You pretty much just have to be qualified and not an idiot . <p> Here 's what I did : <p> I took the AFOQT , did mediocre 50 's to 60 's , had a decent gpa from going to school part time while enlisted ( Avionics on B-52 's at Barksdale ) , I applied for ASCP ( I have a good friend who 's doing the exact same thing right now ) and was accepted . I chose my school , worked my ass off there and got good grades ( the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BTW , and I say that because that 'll also affect your commander 's ranking ) retook the AFOQT after studying pretty hard the first summer I was there for it , and did much better since I knew what to expect and all . In hind sight , the AFOQT is only a small part of getting your slot anyway . Tried hard in ROTC at my school , and then started all over working for what I wanted when I got to UPT . <p> It 's a long hard process , but it 's totally worth it . <p> Here 's my advice : Do n't listen to whoever has been telling you that crap . They 're probably from the academy , and have no idea how the ROTC program even works . Call an ROTC detachment and talk to one of the officers there and they can ( or at least should ) tell you exactly how the pilot selection process works for ROTC cadets , if you want to know . Also , ROTC 's pretty gay , so is any other AETC training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get there . <p> If you have any more questions , send me a private message , or whatever they call it here . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Dude , I 'm going through the EXACT same thing , except you 're two years ahead of me . <p> I 've gone through my fair share of people putting their limiting beliefs on me , telling me things like " you 'll never get a top secret clearance " or a Sgt from tech school saying " It 's almost impossible for an enlisted person to become a pilot " . <p> The Academy just is n't my preferred method of higher education , simply because I have more of an interest in enjoying my college years in a civilian environment with the discipline I 've been taught in the past year pursuing a degree that I enjoy , rather than going through tech school again for four years . <p> The way I figure , the Air Force cares more about your APTITUDE than what avenue of education you take . <p> As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can write/highlight in them . <p> I 'm halfway through my CDC 's and I 'm going to start studying the ARCO military flight aptitude test book as well as the officer candidate book , so that 'll give me two year 's time to study that as well as get my private pilot 's license . <p> Check out wantscheck.com if you already have n't , it 's a great resource and they have all kinds of book and movie reccomendations . <p> It 's good to see people talking about this on here , because there is n't that many threads on getting an enlisted scholarship <p> Edited February 14 , 2010 by Vice <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> My .02 here .

Perspective-not bashing you , just advising , NCO to Airman , with record numbers of people trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think it would be a better idea to finish studying and testing for Staff before you attempt to take the AFOQT ? It will not only look better on your military resume , but put some extra cash in your bank account that you can stash away while you go through the process of trying to become a pilot . Take it for what it 's worth from a Guard dude . This and $0.35 will only get you a cup of coffee from the snack bar . Good luck . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Booty <p> Thanks again for the advice everyone . Marco i do hear what your saying but the way i look at things is if i want to pursue my dream i need to act now and not later . Sure i have a career now , and sure making staff would be awesome but i believe making 2nd lt would be much more valueble to me . I technically am furthuring my career , i 'd be going from making $37k a year to much .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is keeping me motivated and that is " Winners do n't wait for chances , they take risks . " and i 'm taking a very big risk not studying for staff and putting my faith on these packages but its something that i have to do . If i do make it this year and that 's a big IF ... yes i will be sad because i will miss O-1E pay by less than 1 year but knowing that i am pursuing my dream will make up for that . <p> The gameplan for now after talking with a few prior enlisted pilots who have given me some really good advice is study for the AFOQT , every which way i can but study for the AFOQT . Finish putting together my packages , get them in on time and pray . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> For the record , you guys are right ... Definentally study for Staff and take care of what you got now , because if you do n't make it for one reason or another , you wo n't have burned any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both . I did , and I made both , so if my dumb redneck ass from Arkansas can do it , so can you guys . <p> Vice , your CDCs are very important , but once you 're done with them , they may help you make SrA BTZ , and then nobody will ever care ever again what your scores were . Unless you fail them . <p> Thanks , that 's definitely changed my outlook on them , but it may be too late ; I scored a 78% on my final test , and I do n't think I can really recover from that unless I score in the 90 's and average the two scores ( I only have two sets of CDC 's ) . <p> And the study material for Staff &amp; the AFOQT is way more interesting than my CDC 's . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks , that 's definitely changed my outlook on them , but it may be too late ; I scored a 78% on my final test , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I score in the 90 's and average the two scores ( I only have two sets of CDC 's ) . <p> And the study material for Staff &amp; the AFOQT is way more interesting than my CDC 's . <p> Your final test as in your End of Course exam ( EOC ) or your final test as in you filled in the bubble sheet after answering the multiple choice questions in the CDC booklet ? If it 's just the one in the book , then that does n't really count for anything other than a gauge of how well you studied the material/looked up the answers , so your supervisor knows if you are ready to go to the education office and take the EOC or not . If it was your EOC , and you have two actual sets of CDCs with two EOCs , then definately study harder for this next set , and then start studying whatever you want . <p> There 's a reason that most shops wo n't allow you to pursue additional education until your CDCs are complete . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career goal , but they do help you to know more about and to do your job now . If you do n't excel at your current job , your leadership will be less willing to help you pursue your commissioning . As far as I remember you need reccommendation letters and such , and if your only a mediocre performer-or have the appearance of one , your commander will be less likely to endorse something like that . If you shine on your next EOC , the commander will remember your name for that when you gives you your day off , and if you continue to go above and beyond , people will continue to know who you are , making those letters easier to get . <p> Oh , and remember , CDC 's are actually part of studying for Staff too ... Just one NCOs viewpoint ...

Good luck ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Last July I was an active duty F-16 crew chief , this past February I was picked up for a pilot slot . I applied for the SOAR and ASCP programs in FY2008 and was selected for SOAR . I have very good scores ; however , I have not yet attended AFROTC Field Training and this significantly hurts my overall score for this past board . I was surprised at the selection rate for the SOAR and ASCP programs , I think SOAR was nearly 100% . The fact is that there are usually a couple more slots than people who apply , and so if you meet the requirements you should have no problems getting picked . I did however serve as the best crew chief that I could , and at no point did I let my schoolwork or aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the signatures that I needed for my SOAR and ASCP packages . <p> Pilot selection through AFROTC is not too bad in my opinion as well . I mean , 10% of my order of merit score ( what they use for pilot selection ) was a zero due to out of cycle Field Training and I got picked up for pilot . I have heard of people with pretty rough stats getting picked up as well . The most important factor in getting the slot once you are in ROTC is being active , positive , and aggressive in your studies and ROTC . This , coupled with the fact that most if not all ROTC CC 's and cadre will greatly value your prior enlisted experience and the path that you have taken , will make it very easy for you to succeed . The main thing that can get in your way is yourself . Just be willing to work at it and it will come . <p> With all of that said , remember that I said I did not let my ambitions hurt my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with a chip on my shoulder as well . I have seen others act in such ways and it has not worked out well for them . The truth is that I worked with incredible individuals with skill , personalities and work ethic to be admired . I have a lot of good memories working out on the flight line and being TDY . I 'm sure you would agree . So , if this is what you want , I suggest that you pursue it as aggressively as possible without sacrificing your current position . If you have any specific questions please also feel free to ask . I know the paperwork for those packages can seem daunting . Take care and good luck . 
@@43194977 @3194977/ <p> I. Overview . Uveitis is a general term used by ophthalmologists to describe any inflammation of the uveal tract , or one of its derivatives , such as the iris or ciliary body . In some cases such inflammations may extend into the retina or vitreous cavity . The list of systemic diseases that are associated with uveitis is robust Prevalence of unexplained uveitis/iritis increases with increased age . Henderly et.al. reported in 1987 that 12.1% of their patients had no identifiable cause of uveitis . However , other authors have found that up to 75% of all cases will have no identified etiology . The association with systemic disease and trauma is high . A list of diseases traditionally associated with uveitis may be found on page 400 of Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology , 1994 . Sarcoidosis , ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter 's syndrome account for 5% of all cases of uveitis . However , up to 20% of ankylosing spondylitis cases will have uveitis , which may often be the presenting condition .

The Oxford Textbook of Medicine warns that " atypical and indolent cases of uveitis especially in those with military , naval or traveling backgrounds , " is frequently due to syphilis .

The most common type of uveitis is iritis , usually following trauma or a corneal abrasion , but fortunately uncomplicated recovery after traumatic iritis is the norm . <p> IV . Waiver Considerations . The Aeromedical Consultation Service database contains 69 aircrew with the diagnosis of uveitis . Three people were permanently disqualified on initial evaluation . Two received temporary disqualification and were waivered after their condition resolved . Four others initially received waivers , however , their condition later became chronic or recurrent and they were ultimately disqualified . Approximately 90% of patients obtained waivers . Patients should be grounded during the active phase of the disease and while treatment and evaluation are occurring .

The move does n't make much sense beyond that . The B-1 is no longer a strategic/nuclear asset . GSC was originally intended ( as I understand ) to somewhat literally get our nuclear fecal matter collocated under one roof . If the B-1 is under GSC , why is n't the F-15E ?

@@43194979 @3194979/ <h> IMA versus Traditional commuter <h> 3 posts in this topic <p> Looking for advice/comments on a couple different Reserve routes . I have a traditional Nav job lined up . However I still do n't have my " real " job locked down . One option is about a 3 hour drive to the unit , so very doable . All of the other options are a cross country commute ( no direct flights either ) . Obviously the nearby job makes sense for the Reserve job , but it may be that one of the cross country jobs is too good to pass up . The other option I may have is several IMA opportunities within a couple hours of where I 'd work ( possibly in the same local area for some of the jobs I 'm looking at ) . <p> Besides the obvious difference in flying versus non-flying , what are some other factors to look at ? It seems the traditional job allows the opportunity to collect more retirement points , but if I have to travel and take time out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect as many days anyway . I have n't done many calculations , so I 'm not sure how much difference those points would make . For reference , I have 12.5 years of active duty . <p> For non-airline pilot commuters , ie folks who work normal jobs and commute long distance to your Reserve/Guard job , do you find the travel wearing ? Are you able to keep current ? Would you switch to IMA job if you had the opportunity ? <p> From what I 've seen after 8 years in my Reserve SQ , the non-airline commuters start with the best of intentions . They come in for 4-5 days , usually with the UTA somewhere in that block , do some flying for currency , bang out some ground currency items ... then we do n't see them until the next month . This usually lasts about a year . It 's been my experience that a fair number of these folks are merely " current " in the jet ; they 're not very " proficient " . <p> Then , the downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not worth the hassle this weekend " , or " last-minute tasking at work " , or . They start going noncurrent for little stuff . As time goes on , the noncurrent list gets bigger as they show up less frequently ; pretty soon they need to fly 4-5 times just to get current on everything ( and this assumes no wx/MX/customer CANXs , which almost never happens when someone has an epic " need to reset currency on everything " plan ) . If it keeps up , you see these folks ending up in CC-directed requal ... or they finally reach their personal breaking point and retire/go IRR/separate . <p> The last two commuters to retire from my shop were both non-aviation guys - one from northern CT , the other from TX . Both wanted to keep flying and earning points , but both said the asspain of the commute , justifying time off from work/away from family , and constantly going noncurrent , just wore them down . <p> Do n't get me wrong , we do have a few non-airline/aviation commuters who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to tell you it 's HARD to do . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks . That sounds pretty similar to the info I got from my pending Reserve unit . Luckily I 'm a known commodity to them as I flew with them while AD and so they 're still willing to give me the chance .

Regardless , life 's going to suck while you 're on base . There is no such thing as staying off base ( since there 's nowhere to stay ) . If you know you 're going to be here 30 days or more , call in EARLY to the Hotel Frontera ( DSN : 314-722-8098 , Commercial : 011-34-95-584-8098 ) and reserve a room . The reservations clerk is in from 0830 to 1630 Local time ( it 's Z+2 here ) Mon - Fri best I can figure . Call then , it seems only he has any clue what 's going on . If you 're here less than 30 days and if you 're less than a Colonel , you 'll be staying in the contingency dorms . And boy do they suck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room if it 's really busy , the bathrooms are communal down the hall , and if you 're very lucky you 'll have a phone in your room . There 's a lounge on each floor with a TV and VCR . Bring some reading material . <p> This base is supported by Rota , so there 's an NEX as opposed to a BX . The hours are 1000 to 1800 Local . They have some of the same stuff you 'd find in a regular ( but tiny ) BX or shopette . There 's a tiny gift shop with not a whole lot in it , and a couple of ATM 's next door ( one for real money and one for potatoes ) . They 're hardly ever working so do n't count on them . Go to the Hotel Frontera ( across the street past the club ) and ask the front desk to change your money for Pisetas . Sometimes they run out so good luck to you . If the base is busy , then the club will be busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... drink up . If you have the burning desire to break free of the chain gang for a while , you have some good options . 1 ) Make friends with someone who has a car , find a designated driver ( BAC limit is .05 in Spain ) and drive carefully . 2 ) Rent a car of your own . Go to the Hotel Frontera and you 'll find a bunch of flyers for rental cars . Get a big Volkwagen van and a designated driver and drive carefully . 3 ) Go on one of the many trips offered by MWR . They have everything from Bullfights in Sevilla to dinners at different castles to misc. shopping trips to different little towns around southern spain . With a car of your own , you can of course do that yourself . So here 's where to go . You 've got to go to Sevilla . It 's a large and very old city . There are some really beautiful sights . And then there 's the Spanish women . Wow ( all apologies to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 've heard the men were good too if that means anything to you ... my attentions were elsewhere . There are tons of little shops , and some really tremendous restaurants . Look for La Isla . It 's 5 star all the way around -- everything is delicious . Better yet get a guide from the Hotel Frontera called " The Tourist " or something like that and find your own rockin ' joint . If you need someone who speaks english find the Irish Pub by the Cathedral and have a Guiness ( just as long as you 're not driving ) . Catch a bullfight if you can . Or at least take the tour of the bull ring . It 's like $2.50 for a 25 minute tour in Spanish and English . The bull ring is on the river by everywhere you need to go . Be careful , a large group of people recently ( Jun 01 ) got held up at gunpoint and robbed . Stay in well lit , well populated areas and you should be allright . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of cash in your front pocket , throw it one way and run another . <p> If you just want a quick dinner off base , go to La Rameria ( known as Pepe 's to us ) . It 'll cost 2000 Piseta 's or so ( $10 ) and it 'll be laden with pork and fried etc . But it 's very good . Make sure you tell Pepe to cook your food more if it needs it ... undercooked pork = bad . Or go to El Arahal ( out the gate to the left and make the first left - bear in mind that you need to make a left turn like you would in New Jersey ie turn right then hang a hard left ) . If you 're really out for an adventure , go to Ronda . You 'll find thousands of shops and restraunts and on the edge of town will be a sheer rock cliff dropping off probably a thousand feet . It 's very senic , and very old , and not cheap so bring money ( credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go the safe , sane way , go through El Corinil ( sp ? ) . If you want damn near an hour of hair pin turns , car-wide roads , insane opposite direction traffic , and thousand foot drops ( without guard rails ) , go towards Moron and hang a right at the chicken ( it 'll all make sense when you see it ) , and stay to the left at the fork in the road . Oh , and hang on for dear life and for god 's sake do n't do it at night . <p> Other points of interest , Rota is about 3 hours away , Gibralter is about 3.5 hours , Caliz is 2.5 ? , Portugal is 2.5 , Granada is n't too far , and neither is Malaga . They all have thier own sights and attractions . Go see do because the base itself sucks .

Free movies at the base theater , usually Wed , Fri and Sat . For grocery shopping , go into Moron , exit at the 9 o'clock position from the second circle . Champion is a large store on the left . For a great meal , go out the gate , take the first left ( towards Arahal ) . Go 4 or 5 miles to Arahal , turn left at the gas station and the restaurant will be immediately on the right . It 's called El Rincon de Antonio , and has excellent Shrimp and Calamari , and anything else seafood . Also find a restaurant called La Pela in Utrera if you can ! <p> One " must try " restaurant about 15 minutes from base--Pappillons . Basque chef whips up exquisite treats . Try the sauted mushroom appetizer before moving on to the terragon filet mingon . Finish meal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostest ( she speaks great english ) recommend some truly wonderful spanish wines ( most of ' em cheap ) . A+ food and cozy atmosphere . Go w/group of 6-8 max and be sure to call ahead for reservation . Any of the stage managers will have the phone number or check with the front desk at the Hotel Fronterra . Also , for a quick bite before stepping to the jet go to the Spanish Cantina next door to the ops building . Great cafe con leche . Excellent hot chicken or pork sandwiches with cheese pack well for the flight too . Pick up a couple bottles of their exclusive label house wine ( something like $6 for two of them ) . Good stuff . <p> The Hotel Occidental Sevilla was a Palace ! ( Phone : 900 200 529 ) . If off base , the stay in Sevilla was great . However , if you plan to walk down town ( towards the Cathedral ) than take a buddy . There were plenty of 13-18 yr olds on mopeds getting rowdy , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule ( ie. eating , shopping , avoiding extreme heat ) in Sevilla is a little awkward and I recommend living during the hours of 1400-0600L , plus this schedule will keep you on track if heading back to the states ( UTC+4 , or 5 ) . As for Moron AB , all I can say is FOLLOW UP multiple times . The Euro Net flight plan system will fail you here , so get your clearance early . Moreover , the base has a lot of turnover in its personnel , so expect some delays and unanswered questions . It seems like a constant state of learning for everyone , so be prepared for glitches that could put you behind . <p> MAY 2008 Update - Just got back from Moron AB and the contingency dorms have been renovated . It might be a building by building basis , but the rooms we had were mostly singles ( standard hotel bed ) , while some had bunks ( you still had the room to yourself , but there were n't many people at the base ) . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mini-fridge . While the NEX still has the same limited hours you can still buy beer in the hotel lobby up the street . Also , Spain is now on the Euro system ( which kinda sucks with the current exchange rate ! ) but dollars still work on base . <p> Palma Mallorca , Spain - Hotel Gran Melia Victoria ( 32 ) 971732542 / ( 32 ) 971450824 was a great hotel located across from the marina and halfway on the hotel , bar , and shopping strip . Disco next to the hotel . Nice pool and under perdiem rates including breakfast . Usual Spanish late night dining and partying all around . British and German tourist spot . <p> Rota Spain - El Duque hotel - Brand new and right on the water in downtown Rota . Playa de la Luz PH(956) 810500 FAX(956) 810606 email : hpl@cdz.servicom.es is also a sweet resort , right on the beach - with a beach-bar just a block away on the water , but not really within walking distance to downtown rota . For both of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about 500-600pts = two free beers ! ) La Consuela , Eds and El Pesebre are good places to eat . There 's a tobacco shop around the corner from the Irish pub in the downtown square that sells rather fresh Cubans ( most of the shops get a little stale ) . The Montecristo number 4s are good . Restaurante Los Argentinos has outstanding food , fantastic service , and very reasonable prices . It 's just a 5 minute drive from the main gate . The address is Avenida Principe de Espana , 74 . For dinner try the sangria , solomillo de ternera , and Montecillo wine . For dessert go with the tiramisu and cafe con leche . Parillia Baileys is the BEST steak in town hands down . <p> Hotel Duque de Najera 34 956 846 020 was sucky . A few updates for Rota as of 1 Feb 05 . The Duque is loud and not very aircrew friendly . Good for overnights and short stays . Front desk personel are very unhelpful and somewhat rude . The rest of the staff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage manager I would suggest the Espadana apart-hotel or the Playa de la luz . If you are working the night shift you will not get any sleep in the Duque ! The Espandana has kitchenonettes , separate bedrooms and a jacuzzi . Much quieter ! If you are coming here to enter the ( C-5 ) stage , plan on staying on base ( billiting , Navy lodge ) for the most part except during busy times . Billeting is firm on putting crews on base . <p> Seville , Spain - Alphonso XIII ( 9540917000 ) was fantastic ! They will give govt rates if you ask . Falls within hotel allowance . 45minutes from Moron and 1.5 hrs from Rota . Part of Westin Hotel Group . For great steaks go to the Parilla Argentina Atahualpa . The address is Salado 9 in Sevilla . They have great food and great service . The solomillo al pimiente is fantastic . <p> Zaragosa , Spain - La Goya is a 4 star hotel that is very nice . Under per diem rate as of 1998 . Right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown nightlife . Multiple bars , pubs , clubs , restaurants all around the hotel . Only 4 blocks from the historic Pillar ( pee-lar ) Church . Taxi from Zaragosa AB is about $30 . Reccomend " La Fuentes " restaurant , incredible Spanish food at great price $10-14 . Then hit all the bars on your way back to the hotel making sure to hit the " La Cucca Racha " flaming cockroach . Hotel Boston is not as close to the Tubes , but the best hotel in town with a great breakfast . Staff can guide you to some great restaraunts and make reservations for you . <p> Stayed at the Hotel Boston in downtown Zaragosa . Nice room with King-sized bed and A/C ! Apparently they have Free in-room ADSL Internet service now ( sure wish my LM told us that while we were there instead of on the plane flying home ! ) . Great FREE breakfast ( coldcuts , cheese , fresh fruit , breads , scrambled eggs , sausage , chorizo , freshly squeezed juices , coffee , etc. ) ! 10-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Unfortunately , Google does n't have a good map online but the folks at the Hotel Boston 's front desk are GREAT and will give you a map with your destination circled . FOOD - Great Greek food , D+ner Kebaps , and an Irish Pub ( serving Guinness ) just NW of the Avenue de Independencia ( main road just SW of Cathedral with the big round-abount ) . Small " LIDL " grocery store across street from hotel - snacks , drinks , etc. to keep your room stocked . Remember that the main restaurants do n't open for the dinner hour until 2000-2100L. $$$ - Perdiem is currently ( July 2005 ) about $80 . You could easily spend this if you go out clubbin ' every night . Otherwise , food and sightseeing is inexpensive here and you could walk away with some jingle in your pocket . ATMs abound in the old part of the city ( just SW of cathedral ) .

@@43194986 @3194986/ <h> 5 posts in this topic <p> First of all I have researched this topic extensively and am aware that allergic rhinitis after age 12 is a DQ , however , I have somewhat of an extenuating circumstance . <p> I am applying for guard units and work as a full time firefighter as a civilian . Common practice in the fire service is to get a prescription for Flonase as working the large wild land fires we have in California for weeks on end is a recipe for congestion . I explained this to my doctor in 2011 and in order to get the prescription he gave me the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis which I do not technically have ( should have just stuck with OTC decongestants ) . I have refilled the prescription multiple times , but only when the medication expires to insure I have it on hand in case of a large campaign fire . If I explain this during my flight physical will it increase my chances of getting a waiver ? Or did I potentially screw my self by getting this prescription ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban search and rescue specialist position in the fire department , we were required to wear an EKG halter monitor . During the 24 hour period with the monitor on I threw a few PVC 's , so again , the doctor put in my medical record that I have PVC 's . They were determined to be benign and not cause for concern but is this something I should worry about during the flight physical ? <p> Lastly , has anyone heard of doctors removing a diagnosis ( such as the allergic rhinitis ) from a medical record based on a possible incorrect diagnosis ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> E11 A verified history of allergic , nonallergic , or vasomotor rhinitis , after age 12 , unless symptoms are mild and can be controlled by a single approved medication . <p> E12 Allergic rhinitis , unless mild in degree , controlled by use of approved medications , and considered unlikely to limit the examinee 's flying activities . <p> Get seen again and try to get diagnosed with MILD seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to be controlled with a single , approved med . Doctors will frequently change a patient 's diagnosis . As long as there is some justification or explanation in the record , this is fine and totally understandable . Stress to the Doc that you only use medications infrequently and as needed in conjunction with periods of heavy environmental irritants ( smoke , pollen , debris from a fire ) . <p> Avoid inhaled steroids like Singulair or Flonase if possible , as that is a flag to a doc to suspect Asthma/RAD/EIB or chronic **39;1610;TOOLONG . Though these meds are usually fine for " as needed " use with Flying Status , the underlying condition sometimes requires an MEB ( possible medical separation from service or permanent deployment limitations ) . Even if at present you do n't have a more serious pulmonary condition , chronic prescriptions of inhaled steroids can mask the symptoms that might develop later . Additionally , these meds are more commonly used to treat Moderate and Severe Rhinitis ( in addition to the other diagnoses ) rather than simple mild SAR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution ONLY without any concerns , but if there is a medication in the spray , like Afrin , then it gets a bit tougher . Allegra or Claritin are your best bet . If you need something to control any symptoms . Maybe try an OTC trial and see how you feel . Crolom/Cromolyn is OK , but not ideal , again as it is often used for Asthma , but it is better than a steroid if Allegra/Claritin are n't good enough . In all , I think your situation is n't DQ'ing and you wo n't even need to be considered for waiver . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thank you for the reply . I only use the flonase a few times a year , so I will take your advice and talk to my doctor about changing the diagnosis . Recently , I have been using the saline rinses during fires , as you mentioned , and have not needed any other medication , prescription or otherwise . Again , thank you for the information and hopefully as you mentioned JCJ or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Assuming you have no other symptoms of cardiac disease , and you had a few isolated single PVC 's on a 24 hour Holter , I think you 'll be fine . It turns out that almost no one has a 24 hour Holter without some ectopy ( only 13% of aviators had a completely ectopy-free Holter in one study quoted in the USAF waiver guide ) . <p> The relevant portion of the USAF Waiver guide is pp 323 - 326 , I 've made a pdf of just those pages &amp; attached to this post to make it easier to look at the primary source information . It uses the term " ectopy " , that 's a general term for abnormal electrical activity of the heart that includes premature heart beats - Premature Atrial Contractions ( PAC 's ) start in the upper chamber of the heart , Premature Junctional Contractions ( PJC 's ) start in the junctional tissue between the upper and lower chamber of the heart and Premature Ventricular Contractions ( PVC 's ) start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these are heartbeats where - for a single beat - the heart beats in some way other than it 's usual organized pattern . This is because there 's an abnormality in the electrical signal for that beat that causes the heart muscle to squeeze out of sequence , causing the abnormal heart beat . <p> PAC 's and PJC 's have similar origin and effects , so sometimes they are just lumped together as PAC 's or Premature Supraventricular Contractions ( PSVC 's ) . PVC 's ( especially frequent or multiform ) are more worrisome in critically i 'll patients and patients with severe underlying heart disease , because they can lead to more dangerous continuous heart rhythms or even cardiac arrest . Occasional PVC 's in someone who is otherwise healthy and has no other heart issues is almost always benign and usually unnoticed unless you undergo an in-depth physical . Occasionally you can feel them as a " skipped beat " but even then if you are otherwise in good health and have no heart problems , it 's very likely not a problem at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight physical is on the EKG . For isolated PVC 's , what the waiver guide says is if you have more than one PVC on a 12 lead EKG or a rhythm strip you then undergo a 24 hr Holter . If 10% or less of the total beats on the Holter are PAC 's or PVC 's , and there are less than 10 paired ectopic beats on the Holter , then you 're still good to go . If you have more ectopy than this on the Holter , you 'll get referred for more workup ( Echo , treadmill ) and a decision made based on that . <p> You are in the unusual position of already having done a Holter study . I 've never seen a physical exam before that required a Holter , but I could see where a physical for an extremely strenuous job such as you mentioned might require one . As always , when asked about it just tell the truth &amp; be prepared , if you can , to have documentation of the holter and interpretation . <p> Bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no heart disease and they did an appropriate interpretation of your Holter with a finding of isolated , few or infrequent PVC 's ( which is what I 'm interpreting what you wrote ) I think you 'll be fine . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I also had a thought on your use of flonase question - and this is just additive to the info that deaddebate has already given you . <p> I would agree that based on the info you 've given , a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is incorrect . Allergy is a specific condition where the body has an exaggerated , IgE mediated inflammatory reaction to something that is otherwise harmless . For example , most people can eat food containing peanut products with no problem - because peanuts are a normal , harmless food product for most people . But a person with peanut allergy may have a life threatening inflammatory reaction ( that is mediated by a specific body immune system protein called IgE ) because they 've been exposed to peanut product - something that 's harmless to everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance , and it 's likely that most normal people who are exposed to it will develop inflammation of their nasal passages . So the correct diagnosis is acute chemical rhinitis or acute irritant rhinitis , not allergic rhinitis . You are not allergic to wildfire smoke because it is an irritant to everyone , not just you . It is also acute , not chronic because ( I am assuming ) you 've never had an episode that 's lasted six weeks or longer . Even if you have this every fire season , it 's still acute irritant rhinitis as long as any single episode does n't last six weeks or longer . Nasal flonase is a recommended and approved treatment for acute irritant rhinitis . <p> For the reasons you 've alluded to and deaddebate has explained , having the exact correct diagnosis can be really important when you 're undergoing a physical exam for a qualification or job , such as a flight physical . This is medical nitpicking , but it can be really important because of situations like yours where having a ' just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem later on . And yes as deaddebate mentioned a doctor can change the diagnosis - we do it all the time for inpatients . He/she just needs to document the change and the reason in your medical records . It wo n't erase your prior records , but it 's not unusual for us to find that a previous diagnosis was incorrect - usually because some part of the problem had n't made it 's appearance yet . We just document everything in the medical record so it 's clear what we did &amp; why , and move on .

I read the " flying around in circles " and " stay out of the iron triangle " arguments from old posts , but it seems like it would n't be too bad being in ACC if you ca n't get into fighters/bombers . Do AWACS folks go to Red Flag and weapons school ? Any talk of upgrading the jet ? I 'm from Oklahoma and would n't mind being able to stick around the area for some of my career , so any input would be well appreciated ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 1 .

Things are somewhat different now that the composite wing structure is all but dead . In the old days there were horror stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . AWACS go to EVERY Red Flag . <p> 3 .

Currently we are not deployed anywhere , but that may change . No we do not go to cool places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places we stop on the way are usually awesome though . During times of deployment the 90-120 days is pretty accurate . I actually averaged less than that the past 5.5 years that I 've been in " the fatkid " . As for assignments while in AWACS , white jets are pretty easy to come by , the ocassional UAV does rear its ugly head , a JSTARS assignment is pretty easy to get , and that 's about it unless you know people in the right places . A couple of guys have gone to U-2s and B-2s actually . <p> ABMers run the wing here and with so many officers , the pilot types usually get shorted but that does n't mean there 's no career progression . Most pilots here simply do n't want to play the reindeer games the ABMs do . Flight deckers are second class in AWACS , the mission is in the back of the jet , not the front like in AMC . If you want to live in Oklahoma , you can camp out here very easily . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinions , some will agree , some will not . My .02 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> navobd ... totally agree ! Except for not going to cool places . If you want to go to cool places come to Kadena ... Korea ( great shopping ) , Thailand , Australia , mainland Japan , Vegas , Alaska . Seems like everyone at Tinker *****es about being there but never wants to leave . <p> We 've had a nav here get the Airborne Laser and a pilot get T-6 's . <p> We have " fat kids " parties over here with the RJ 's , Tankers and Helo guys , ( basically no fighter geeks ) . Not a bad time . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AWACker <p> Okay , here 's the deal . I 'm a little drained from a nice little 10 hour " local " training sortie we got back from , so my answers might be a little more ... jaded than they could be at other times . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ... it 's flying as a taxi service for 30 dudes in the back ( with at least 4 or 5 ) whom all think they are the fight . We 're mission support for mission support . And this is exactly why being flight deck on a heavy in ACC is not a good deal . At least on an ISR heavy ... <p> This moves us into aircraft upgrades . The money in ACC flows down first to the fighters . That 's fine . They 're the ones closest to the bad people most of the time , so they get the cool toys . They need it to stay alive . Bombers get money too . Whatever scraps are left over eventually filter down , way down , until they get to AWACS . The flight deck of the AWACS is ... uh ... vintage . We 're not RVSM capable , and probably wo n't be for another 4-5 years ( yeah ... right ) ... when it 'll get too difficult to get waivers in the new airspaces . But enough about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly a heavy ... and ISR jets will always , no matter who owns them , be at the bottom of the funding pile . And even the new E-10 program is having funding problems , so do n't expect that to happen for some time as well . <p> AWACS do go to Red Flag . But as far as operating from the flight deck , it 's just another TDY . That means the main difference ( big picture ) is that instead of taking off from Tinker , and flying out to a coast , orbiting , and then driving back to Tinker , you take off at Nellis , orbit , and land at Nellis . I 've still never made it to Red Flag , but from watching other people plan them , there 's really no change in how we fly , just where we 're doing it . ABMers and the like do go for the full Red Flag " experience " , and attend all the mass briefing stuff that the flight deck really has no reason to bother getting involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weapons School , but there is no such a thing for the AWACS pilots , nor should there be . Like I said , we drive the bus . <p> And if you really do like Oklahoma so much , there are other ways to get there . Altus ... Vance ... you can look into guard/reserve F-16 's or C-130 's at Tulsa and OKC ... but I just ca n't , with good conscience , tell someone that AWACS is a good deal at all . <p> Deployment rates are another thing . Sure , the last year or so , AWACS has n't gone anywhere ... so our rates are really low . That wo n't last forever , and soon enough , we 'll be on the road again like the rest of the AF . Only instead of just doing deployments over in the sandbox , we 'll do that , plus all the other commitments AWACS has been stiff-arming for the last years . I do n't plan to spend too much time in the next few years in Oklahoma . <p> And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't love the way things are run around AWACS . Flying policy decisions come down from people that do n't fly the plane , and that does bother me . The day before every flight ( mission planning ) , you brief the DO or an ADO about what you 're gon na do , and you get the fun questions about " why are you taking that fuel load ? " from a guy who does n't know the correct way to calculate the gas you need . Yeah , that 's right ... in ... well ... from what I can remember , all the AWACS squadrons at Tinker have MCC ( basically , old ABMers ) Squadron Commanders and DO 's . The OG commander is a controller as well . Sure , they 're qualified to do their controller stuff , but they are line flying squadrons ... but the pilots are n't the ones who make the decisions at all . Even when you finally get into the air , the way " they " want the A/C to make his decisions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and ask for permission to do the littlest things . And if you 're not fast enough on the draw to make your plane , then call back on your own to get permission from mommy ... they got radios in back too , and you can bet the MCC on your plane has already called back and screwed up whatever plan you 've worked out for what you 're gon na do . I 've got more *****es and gripes than I can type in one sitting , or two , or probably a full week , so I 'll just cut my losses . <p> And a final thought . I know a dude that " chose " to go to AWACS . Liked the location , the lifestyle , and all that jazz . Now that he 's here , he seems to have finally developed a decent , healty dislike for what we 're doing , just like the rest of us. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AWACker <p> The NATO AWACS site cracks me up .

We fly with those dudes from time to time , and I imagine it 's just like other reserve units with other airframes . Seamless .

But ... I have n't talked to many people that have been there ( on assignment ... hell , I 've been there TDY , it 's Tinker East . Or we 're Robins West , who knows ? ) . That means they probably have similar gripes and complaints . Although ... <p> ... I have talked to an enlisted guy that was there for some time . His main gripe was that he was an Active Duty guy , working in a combined AD/Guard wing . Said that , although it 's praised in many a publication , the arrangement leads to some major difficulties in the admin side of the house , at least . I 'd imagine for the pilots , flight deck , and other " aircrew " , it 's about the same as AWACS . <p> And as far as Robins being the Tinker of the east ... here 's my proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if I am , forgive me ) :

In fact , once I was able to demonstrate full ROM and strength , it was not brought up again during my FCI exam . Instead they found other health issues in my past to grip about and waivers are in-process . <p> The next step is getting through Brooks , not sure when I will have to accomplish it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest downinthegroove <p> I had shoulder impingement surgury and a rotator cuff cleaned up a couple of years ago .

I had to go through about 2 months of physical theoropy for it . It 's in good shape now , and is as strong as it was before I ever injured it . My first choice for a military service was actually the Marines . However , they would n't grant me a waiver for my shoulder , so now I 'm in Air Force ROTC . I 've already gotten a waiver for the injury and there 's no problem with me being in the AF . However , I 'm afraid it may prohibit me from passing the pilot physical . Does anybody know what the AF 's policy is on that kind of injury ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest yogi <p> I was picked up for an F-16 ANG slot about 18 months ago , took the FC1 , and was under the impression I passed . Life was super . However , about three months after meeting the doc , the wing commander called me up to tell me I had been medically DQ 'd because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocated my shoulder several times in the past . After consulting with a couple flight surgeons and reading the AF medical regs , I immediately scheduled surgery in hopes of obtaining a medical waiver . <p> I had my shoulder scoped and did all the necessary rehab , but the unit 's doc refused to even consider issuing a waiver . Probably for good reason , because about 6 months after the surgery it dislocated again . Since then , it 's popped out three other times ( mountain biking , snowboarding , &amp; basketball ) . Each time it has dislocated , I 've managed to put it back in place without having to see a doctor , so I could avoid having it reported on my medical records . <p> My shoulder has full range of motion , good strength and feels perfectly fine . However , obviously it is not completely fixed and I 've been advised to get a capsular shift ( supposedly the end all shoulder surgery ) . <p> I 've already been invited to two upcoming UPT fighter slot interviews this spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the shoulder situation . The way I see it , here are my options ( if selected ) : <p> 1 . Since none of my post-surgical dislocations have been reported in any official medical document , I figure I should be able to either pass a FC1 or obtain a waiver based on the fact that ( in their eyes ) my surgery was a success . Only problem , there 's a pretty high possibility it will pop out again if not fixed . Not a big deal , but I 'd rather not have severe arthritis in my shoulder at the age of 30 . <p> 2 . I could get the capsular shift surgery now , rehab , and basically skip an entire year of ANG apps in hopes of getting picked up with a waiver next year . Only problem , I would think it would look bad on my medical records to show two surgeries for the same problem ( possibly making it more difficult to obtain a waiver ) . Am I just being paranoid , or is that legitimate concern ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder in its current state . Then , get the capsular shift during the time ( approx 1 year ) I would wait to be shipped off to AMS . This would be my most ideal option but seems like the most unlikely to be approved by the AF. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest rhildreth <p> I am in UPT now , however it has been quite a process , medically . Aside from another serious medical waiver , I had to obtain one for the same issue you are having . <p> My recommendation ... have the OPEN capsular shift surgery . I had the surgery in June of 2004 , and after 6 months ( and a ridiculous amount of PT ) my range of motion and strength were 100% . Not to mention , my shoulder has stayed in the socket since ! Even if you do n't ever become a pilot , you will be able to do so much more after the surgery . As far as getting the waiver , it was very painless .

This is because I have had repeated dislocations in the past but had arthroscopic surgery ( Nov , 2005 ) to prevent any future dislocations . <p> I 've been told that I 'll more than likely need a waiver , so I should get the orthopod to be as detailed as possible when writing his evaluation . Is there anything specifically I should get the doc to check and write about ? I 'm not completely sure how detailed he can get without taking a MRI or busting out a bunch of PT equipment , but I want to make sure the evaluation is detailed enough to help the waiver process go smoothly . <p> Any advice ? <p> PS My visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer , please share it with me as soon as possible . <p> THANKS ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27702 @qwx437702 <p> As long as you are asymptomatic , have full strength , range of motion and stability in your shoulder you should be fine .

These are typically handled with some rest , physical therapy first . If persists , then maybe some shoulder injections with corticosteroids . And finally , if not improving then perhaps surgery . Every case is dermined on an individual case by case basis though . Perhaps the imaging studies show you have a significant narrowing of the space between the acromion and the upper arm bone . This would require a surgical procedure to shave off some of the bone . <p> I have had pilots and other patients who have had this procedure . It is generally well tolerated and recovery is usually quick . I have had no issues with pilots getting back to flying after the procedure . <p> At somepoint , I suspect if you try to push through this ( STS ) and make it worse trying to do pushups at unit pt or somthing , then you could get into a situation like the T1 guy I had that finally could n't lift his arm up for the switchology in the jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have surgery or not cause I have n't examined you or the images of your shoulder .

Consider it like getting a head mold for a helmet . <p> The #1 thing you have for haze is to follow your drop instructions . The use of the medicated contact to cover your fresh surgery and steroid drops is what has gotten rid of most of the bad problems associated with PRK . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest 055-NOS <p> Background ( you can probably skim through most of this - just wanted to provide as much info as possible ) : <p> I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best surgeons in Southern California . Unfortunately the young inexperienced follow-up doctors were my down fall - they told me I was pretty much good to do anything I wanted after 2 weeks including surfing ( apparently this and skiing are the worst activities for a PRK recovery ) as long as I was out for no more than an hour at a time , sports were fine , etc . They saw the haze all along but dismissed it as dryness or normal recovery effects . So I was getting monthly check ups for a good 4-5 months where they said I was " just fine , making a normal recovery " all while the haze was getting worse . ( The surgeon has since split from this office to start his own practice ) <p> I saw a different Ophthalmologist about 5 months out from the surgery who was shocked at how bad the haze was . It was severe effecting an area slightly above both pupils , large enough to scatter light ( starbursts ) when my pupils were dilated . The Opthalmologist told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote a note about the haze . I went back and saw the follow-up docs and they came to realize that it was corneal haze after all and put me on ocular steroids ( pred forte ) . After about of month of the Pred Forte the follow-up doc said that the effected area had gotten a lot smaller . I eventually saw the surgeon who had performed the surgery and he said the hazing was now only over a small area and said that though it was still significant , it was in an area ( still above the pupils , but smaller and farther away ) that it should n't effect my vision . <p> I 'm about 6.5 months out from the surgery , just received an AFROTC pilot slot , and will be visiting Brooks sometime in the near future ( though I 'm guessing no less than about 6 months from now since I still need that 1 year of clearance on the PRK waiver ) . <p> Questions : <p> 1 . When I go to Brooks are the flight docs going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DQ me on the spot ? Or will they take note of it and then test me to determine whether or not it will effect my vision before determining whether or not to approve me . In short does my status ride completely on the tests , or is it in the hands of the examiner ? <p> 2 . Should I be messing around with ocular steroids , or other healing drugs and procedures this long after the surgery and this close to Brooks ? ( I 'm about 6.5 months out from the surgery and hopefully no less than 5-6 months away from Brooks ) Or can the fact that I am taking ocular sterioids ( or whatever else ) this close to Brooks DQ me ? <p> Thanks , <p> nos <p> PS . I 'm going to see some specialists over the next two weeks and will probably be able to produce pictures and topography charts if any of the flight docs on this forums would be interested in taking a look . <p> Edited March 12 , 2008 by 055-NOS <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be off of steroids 3 months prior to going to Brooks City Base . But , they do pay close attention to people that have been on steroids a lot longer than the normal . It usually means they have a lot of haze and it is something they pay close attention to . I know they will disqualify people with significant haze . Hopefully it will clear up soon for him .

I skimmed over that bit I guess . In that light , splitting the difference would obviously be the way to go . I know there are some instructors living in Navarre , so that could be an option . Gulf Breeze to Eglin is still quite a haul . Just realize that traffic in Pensacola flows painfully slow during the day . I used to be able to make it 20 miles in OKC in 25'ish mins .

You need to show up on day one ready to go . <p> - I 'd suggest you go to the IFS websight at www.dossifs.com and read it carefully . There are several types of pre-arrival requirements ( administrative things and study req'ts ) that require you to submit things before you go . Knowing what you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more smoothly . <p> - It would also help to get some addtional flying time before you go if you can . I 'd recommend finding a place that uses the Diamond DA20 as their training aircraft , as that 's what you 'll fly at IFS . There are lots of procedural things about the IFS profile ( exact ways to fly to training areas , ways to talk to people , etc ) so if you do n't have to worry inflight as much about basic flying ( heading , altitude , airspeed , patterns and landings , etc ) you 'll be able to focus more on the procedures . You do n't need a PPL , but flying up to the solo point ( about 15 hours most places ) might help a lot . <p> - Washouts in the IFS program are not uncommon , especially on the CSO side where many people have n't had much prior flight training . Occasionally its from lack of proficiency , but more often its from a poor attitude and failure to take the program seriously early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the DA20 ops limits and bold-face emergency procedures verbatim and without hesitation Both sets of info are on the IFS website , and are an example of attitude . By the way , the information is n't terribly hard to learn , but it is a good " attitude indicator " to the staff about how you 've prepared . Like most military flight training programs , there is n't much " catch up time " if you get behind , so do n't get behind ! ! <p> - Oh , yeah . They take the fitness and weight program seriously , too , so be in limits whan you get there . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Can anyone help me out with the usual time given between leaving OTS and the Pcola RNLTD ?

I know some people did the move beforehand , and some after . They were really great with us in terms of taking leave , or simply having time to get all moved in and settled . I do n't think there is quite as much time as there used to be , but you should have plenty of time after if you do n't want to mess with it before .

@@43194993 @3194993/ <h> Air National Guard/ Active Duty Pilot Select Decision <h> 23 posts in this topic <p> I was recently notified that I have been selected for both an active duty pilot slot as well as a slot at my local ANG unit in my home town . I 'm having problems deciding which slot to accept . The local ANG squadron flies C130s which seems like a very cool platform to fly , and it would be amazing to be local my entire career around family because it is where I grew up . I also plan to fly for the airlines one day and most of the pilots in the unit fly for the airlines so I would have a lot of connections to the majors . However it is tempting to go active duty for the outstanding benefits and the chance at fighters which has been a dream of mine . However after looking at recent T38/fighter drops on the forums and talking with current Instructor Pilots at UPT now , it does n't look like the odds are in my favor to gamble for fighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this tough decision . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You may not track a 38 if you go AD . You definitely wo n't track a 38 if you go guard . ( Unless you are the small percentage of heavy guard guys who have orders to 38s because the guard bureau ran out of T-1 slots. ) 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> However after looking at recent T38/fighter drops on the forums and talking with current Instructor Pilots at UPT now , it does n't look like the odds are in my favor to gamble for fighters . <p> Completely disregard drops on this forum and anything people say , including UPT instructors or a random fighter pilot you know ... completely serious . You are so far from track select , let alone getting a post-UPT assignment , there 's no telling what will happen . If you go AD , you could be in a class where everyone gets a Viper on assignment night ( apparently just happened ) , or you could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not the guy . Point is , NOBODY has an clue what it 'll be like for you in 1.5-2 years . Every class is different , assignments go in waves , etc . If you go Guard there 's a lot of great things , but you can pretty much count on never flying a fighter - if you 're OK with that then take the guard job and never look back . If you 'll always be wondering , " what if ? " then in my opinion it 's worth taking the chance , and even if in the end you do n't end up in a fighter , there 's still a lot great flying to be had in something else , doing great missions , and hell , you could still end up flying Hercs anyways and get a job at your hometown unit in 8-10 years . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was in the same boat of being on the fence . do n't  know the 130 unit but honestly to me , it came down to what puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the guard side was not a fighter . now AD may be ( is ) different so YMMV 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I am in the same boat with the AFROTC pilot slot but the guard unit that has been talking with me is a Viper unit so I appreciate all the advice as well . Ever since the unit talked about the possibility of me coming on board I 've been trying to amass as much information about the guard as I can because AFROTC tells us absolutely nothing about the guard . So any wisdom y'all can share with me would be greatly appreciated . <p> To the original post ... I am trying not to stress out or get my hopes up or feel like I have to make a decision right away because as far as I know there has n't been any direction from AFROTC HQ allowing cadets to get out of their FY16 contracts to go guard/reserve , unless these guard units that we have been in contact with know more than our Det commanders ( which I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program allowing FY15 graduates to get out and go guard last summer and from what I hear around my Det is that it probably will be offered for FY16 but has n't been made official yet . Then again , it may not be an option for the rated folks even if it is offered for FY16 . All that to say , obviously you should n't go and give up your AD slot without some sort of " guarantee " from that guard unit . <p> Also , how are they framing this UPT " offer " to you ? Are they planning on you commissioning through AFROTC and then going guard post-commission or are you getting out of AFROTC all together , graduating and then having them send you to OTS ? Because I have yet to discuss that with the unit I am in contact with and I 'm interested in what you have been told because that is a big question .

@@43194995 @3194995/ <h> What is Gouge ? <h> 32 posts in this topic <p> So , looking over all of the postings recently , there has been alot of talk about the tweet gouge . Everyone seems to agree that guys inbound for UPT should at least know the Boldface , but there has been alot of talk about the boldface having changed . Can it really change so much that it is nolonger worth looking at ? Also what is the Boldface test like , fill in the blank , multiple guess , or is it verbatium write out every boldface ? Any help would be appreciated . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Sorry about beating this dead horse but I think this topic might be a little more worthwhile than the several threads spent defending/crucifying the dudes at Columbus . It 's not about GOUGE , people ... <p> WHAT IS GOUGE ? <p> Anyone who flies in the AF knows there are only about 43,869 pubs/regs/afis/supps that govern how you fly . If I want to figure out how to fly tac form in my Viper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bunch of local supps AS A MINIMUM to figure out all the things I need to know . So long ago pilots got tired of going to brief with their instructor thinking they studied everything they needed to only to have the IP throw out questions from AFI 11-29383 Vol 3 Chapter69 IOS 4-4 ( amended FCIF 06-9 ) . <p> Enter gouge . Sometime shortly after we coined the phrase " think smarter not harder " someone thought it would be a great idea to consolidate info from all these sources into nice little study guides . Maybe those guides were a picture of the pattern with all airspeeds , radio calls , ground tracks , pitch and power settings , blah blah blah on one nice sheet . Maybe those guides were a list of bullet points from 11-217 that incorporates different techniques and organizes things by topics . This " gouge " just let individuals spend more study time actually memorizing than sifting through the endless stack of pubs we must live by . <p> Over the years gouge came to include old ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some idea of what evaluators like to concentrate on . <p> Fast forward to today . The term gouge has become overused to some extent if people think that ANYTHING that gives them or their class an edge is gouge . Gouge is study material , NOT things that you are not supposed to have . Gouge is unofficial but it has saved people a ton of time in their efforts to learn everything , as the SEFEs expect of us . <p> The point ? Aircrew , you know everything I said already . Those not in the community ( or newbies ) you need to understand what is gouge and what is not . If it feels wrong it 's probably cheating . You are officers ( the pilots at least , but we are ALL professionals ) and that 's why they pay you the big bucks , to make those judgement calls . We all had to make those choices in training and I hope I made all the right ones . I 'm just sick of hearing about stolen ( current ) EPQs ( not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement , etc and people throwing out the word " gouge " and hiding behind it . <p> ( me falling OF my soap box ) <p> PS comanche , I did not spell check if you want to do the liberty for me ... 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest TheBurt <p> Over the years I have had inumerable instructors , at SUNT , SUPT , Survival , Little Rock , etc. beat it into my head , " never take a test you have n't seen before , " with a foot stomp . I do n't know any details about the Columbus guys , so I withold any comments about them . I find it very hard to believe that anyone gets through Pilot training without " gouge " , a few people that responded to the gouge threads on this website took the moral high ground and said they personally never used it , and did n't want to fly with or trust anyone that did , and criticized " officership " and integrity of those who did . This is n't an integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ? The point is that " you know the answer " . Gouge is not cheating or a shortcut , it 's to get the information into your skull , so that you can spend your valuable time working on other important things ( it 's the pilot way of thinking , that is why we check Notams , airfield surveys , etc , so that we avoid flying into the unknown ) . You can not bluff your way through a checkride oral or flight check , you have to know the information , as mentioned earlier , it is working smarter not harder , that 's the person that I want sitting next to me in the airplane ! ! ! People that do not fly or have not flown outside of the AETC or training environment may not comprhend this . That is probably why instructors that have line experience are more apt to encourage gouge use . Real world missions require you operate in shades of gray , almost nothing is black and white . Maybe that 's another reason for gouge in the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gray area and work as a team to get your buds through , maybe the biggest reason is to show that you can keep the faith with your brothers . Nobody will fly with you if they think you are a rat , and every time you make a tough decision , you go back and tell management , think about that . <p> Let me say this , cheating is when you know that answer #5 is c , this is not gouge . Unfortunately , if you get caught in the gray area the commanders will hammer you , same as in the real world ! ! If what the Columbus studs had was truly gouge , I would hope their commanders will think back to their days as flyers and about all the gouge they used to get them to where they are ! ! If this is about somebody not hacking the program , and not keeping faith with their fellow students after they were eliminated , that is the only good thing to come out of this , that 's the person that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest justice12 <p> I 'm new in all this , but let me see if I can get this straight , so it 's ok , to have the questions that will be on the tests , ( or study guides as you are calling them , but come on we all know that the questions will be on one of those tests ) but if you have the questions and the answers , then that is cheating . I need to go to your colleges then , because I was never handed a mass question sheet or " study guides " and said that these questions , in some way shape or form will be on your tests , but you do n't know which ones . I just got the thing of that you need to study these sections and know everything of that chapter kind of stuff .

That 's great that AETC guys came to your bases , since they never came to CAFB and talked to anyone about the situation . And actually there were a lot of people that were waiting for them , so they could actually tell them the truth and not give the company answer . Let 's think about this , you do not think that people are scared right now to actually come forward and say that it is true that cheating ( or helping each other out , instructors leaving the room , or the table of knowledge ) is prevalent when they see that there are people that the military might screw up their whole lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Hey and if anyone knows the name of the AETC people that came to your base I would love the names .

Student , IP , Wing Commander , Janitor , Casual Student ? <p> The reason I spoke to these particular officers -- two Majors in flight suits and a JAG officer -- was because they wanted to talk to Flight Commanders in IFF .

Every single one of us ! All of us were UPT students at some point , so this would n't be the case unless we cheated on every single test we 've ever taken . <p> I defintely need to go to your school if that is the case and get my doctorate .

It 's flying ability that counts above all else . And by the way , in a tie-breaker , the tests most certainly can make or break you . However , they 're not as important as Flight Commander ranking because the latter is the supervisor 's overall impression of you as an entire person . That is what I care about when a new guy shows up to my squadron , not whether he tests poorly . <p> Let 's think about this , you do not think that people are scared right now to actually come forward and say that it is true that cheating ( or helping each other out , instructors leaving the room , or the table of knowledge ) is prevalent when they see that there are people that the military might screw up their whole lives over right now .

I 've seen way too many people use gouge as the only source , and they are not fully utilizing any course they are taking . I promise you , this will translate to how the do their day-to-day job , and these are the slap-dick douchebags that do n't know how to do their jobs . I had a guy take the same Master 's level courses as I did , and he tried to get all of my old papers off of my computer .

Some of that information is correct , some of it only points you in the right direction , and there is a lot of it that is just plain wrong . I will not sit here and define cheating , I think that with the exception of a few clear cut instances there are a lot of things that walk the thin line between gouge and cheating . I believe that what most people have said , " If you have any reservations about using the info , then it probably is cheating ... " , is an accurate statement . Most of us are officers and we are all professionals . Make a sound judgement call . That said , for the noobies , If the info is well publicized and you can talk about it in the flight room . You are probably golden . If noone feels comfortable talking about anywhere they may be overheard you may want to think twice . <p> My final statement concerns the SEFE/IP gouge . I have n't been to a squadron that does n't  talk about what a SEFE/IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care if it is a training environment or OPs .

Again , all the ' gouge ' in the world is not going help you right then and there when you 're in the aircraft on your checkride or sitting at the table with the evaluator getting a ground eval .

If it 's less than 20 , your good to go . If you 've already done this and it 's between 20 and 30 , you MIGHT get a waiver approved for non-ejection seat aircraft . The problem is , there is no such category for initial applicants ... you are either flying class I or you 're not . Non-ejection seat restrictions come for those who are already past the initial physical ... they are designated FCIIB . The B meaning , non-ejection seat . <p> WAIVER GUIDE : <p> CONDITION : ABNORMAL SPINAL CURVATURE <p> I. Overview . The center of gravity of the upper torso lies in front of the spine . Whenever loads are applied along the spinal axis , as in ejection , a torque is produced which increases as the disparity between the long axis of the spine and the line of application of the force is increased . While a Class IIB waiver may be granted to aircrew who are already trained , there is little point in considering for a waiver those who desire initial training involving ejection seat aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 30- is very favorable but above 30- is uncertain . Note that there is a 3-5- error in measurements taken by the Cobb method . Waiver is not necessary for cases of scoliosis of less than 25- . A waiver may be considered for individuals with scoliosis from 25-30- . Waiver is not normally granted when there is any noticeable deformity when the patient is dressed , when there is pain or interference with function or when the condition is progressive . <p> II . Aeromedical Concerns . Excessive kyphosis , scoliosis , lordosis or combinations of them may make the spine unstable during ejection and more prone to injuries . Symptomatic conditions may cause distracting backache during flight . Surgical treatment is disqualifying . <p> III . Information Required for Waiver Submission . Orthopedic consultation with measurement of any scoliosis by the Cobb method . Cardiology consultation may be required to exclude pulmonary hypertension in those cases where right axis deviation leads to ECG abnormalities . <p> IV . Waiver Considerations . Approximately 80% of applicants with the condition have been found qualified .

Especially tough is anything having to do with your spine because of ejection seats , etc . It is possible to get approved to only fly non-ejection seat aircraft , but that 's typically only for pilots who are already " in " and get injured . If you are AD , I think you will have an uphill battle . If you are ANG or AFRES , and you have a flight doc who will apply the personal touch and hard work to your case , you may have a chance . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest steeda30 <p> Have not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . I have my private license with 200 hrs and a so-so GPA ( 2.6 ) . The really bad news is that I have scoliosis in the lumbar , it is 35* . The surgeon/doctor that I have been seeing every 6 months says that in my case there is absolutely no reason that my spine is any less able to withstand an ejection or high G loading , than a normal spin . <p> I was wondering if I have any chance at getting a waiver for this , if I have excellent AFOQT/BAT scores and bring up the GPA , as well as letters of reccomendation , and perhaps a letter from the surgeon documenting my case . Would prefer a fighter slot , but any slot will do . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest nickr <p> I have 30 degree thoracic scoliosis , and if I were to get a waiver for this , it would only approve for non-ejection seat aircraft .

Sounds like a sinus block - I 've had them a couple times and I know they can be excruciatingly painful . I 'm sure F16PilotMD can give you all the technical medical jargon on why it happens , but basically it has to do with the pressure not equalizing in your sinus cavities . <p> One remedy is to slow or temporarily stop your descent to try to let the pressure equalize . Also , as a short term remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket when I fly - given to me by the flight doc . If I feel a sinus block coming on , I 'll take a squirt of it , which generally helps out . If you land after taking it , you need to go see the flight doc before you fly again ( ie you have self-medicated and have to DNIF yourself ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Typically , how long will you be DNIF after taking a couple shots of Afrin ? <p> The couple times I 've done it , I was only DNIF until I saw the flight doc .

This causes the opening to your sinuses to be blocked . As you ascend , the air pressure gets lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockage . As you descend , the air pressure increases and it ca n't get back into the sinuses past the blockage . The resulting vacuum causes pain . <p> Decrease the inflammation : this is what Afrin does . It causes the lining of the sinus to " shrink " temporarily .... not a cure , it just will help " get you down " . Also , you can use any number of medication ( Flonase , Allegra , Claritin ..... ) Problem .... most are not allowed for aviators . Civ rules are different from military . <p> Valsalva on DESCENT ONLY . Start early , just before descent and keep it up every few hundered feet . This will allow you to valsalva gently . Doing it ( sts ) too hard ( sts ) will INCREASE the inflammation and be counter productive . If low performance aircraft , you can typically keep up if you chew bubble gum during descent .

On the other hand , some people ( like me ) can have problems with the retention cysts , although scar tissue from a previous sinus surgery was a contributing factor .

Can anybody point me in the direction of the most recent , " official " reg or is that kind of thing not publicly available ? <p> From sources whose accuracy I can not be sure of , I have heard that a " small " right hydrocele is not disqualifying . When I went to MEPS over the summer , the doctor there thumbed through a HUGE book and said that a right hydrocele smaller than the testicle is NOT a DQ , larger IS . He determined mine was much smaller and not a DQ however , I was DQ'ed for an inguinial hernia that was also present . <p> Now I 'm finally in the process of getting the hernia repaired and am also trying to decide whether I should deal with the hydrocele as well . Civilian docs say " no way , its small and not bothering you " but I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all possible . If I know the official policy , I can present that to my civilian docs and ask for their assessment on how likely they think it is to end up out of regs ( get bigger , IDK ) , if at all . <p> I asked the recruiter I 've been dealing with for the past year about it and he said " o just have them take it out if they even mentioned it at MEPS " . He was unable or unwilling to track down any possibly relevant regs for me . I do n't want to make a medical decision on a " my recruiter said " so I 'm trying to do more research . The docs I 've talked to so far do not recommend doing anything w/the hydrocele as it can actually compromise the hernia repair if done at the same time .

Every person will give you a different answer . If you ask me , life is great . I am full time active duty ( AGR ) , same as I was for my first fifteen years before I came to the ANG . My life in the Guard was more fun before my current job but it is still better than just about anything I could be doing as a civilian . I retire in 8.5 months and I have no idea what I am going to do that will put me in an environment anything close to being with a bunch of fighter pilots . I just came back from my last ever Red Flag and I am bummed that I will probably never fly another sortie on the Nellis ranges . <p> You can deply as much as your boss will let you . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to avoid deployments you need to look at another job . If you want to deploy you are looking in the right place . <p> I 'm guessing Bozz was thinking you were trying to find out if ANG fighter guys got to stay home and look cool in their hometown without " having to " deploy like they were in the real military or something . You should want to be in the fight if you 're a fighter pilot . If the idea of flying over an enemy with live ordnance on your jet is not appealing , you might want to look for a job as a greeter at Wal-Mart . <p> As for the number of days a month flying when not deployed ... no more than 8 for a young guy . you will need 8 sorties . It is possible to get those 8 sorties in three days if you want to minimize your time ( and realistic training ) at the unit . Once you are experienced you will get 6 sorties a month . <p> FWIW , Bozz is right ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother to pirates to be one ... or you 're not .

I started AMS eleven months after hire and UPT at month 14 . From UPT to Viper RTU has been getting quicker all the time .

My class that just graduated UPT last week has about an average UPT-RTU time of about six months for C-Model , E-Model and Viper dudes . A reservist A-10 guy starts RTU in about three months but the active duty A-10 guy only has a date of fiscal year 11 or maybe 12 . So the answer is it still depends but F-15 and F-16 RTUs seem to be working " normally " . I start RTU five and a half months after UPT graduation and most of my time will be full between survival schools , IFF , a PCS and some leave .

My class that just graduated UPT last week has about an average UPT-RTU time of about six months for C-Model , E-Model and Viper dudes . A reservist A-10 guy starts RTU in about three months but the active duty A-10 guy only has a date of fiscal year 11 or maybe 12 . So the answer is it still depends but F-15 and F-16 RTUs seem to be working " normally " . I start RTU five and a half months after UPT graduation and most of my time will be full between survival schools , IFF , a PCS and some leave .

Does anyone have any good info for non-resident white tail and possibly hog hunting in AL ? I 'm down for driving anywhere in the state on the weekends . I 'm not much for outfitters ( do n't desire to pay $1400 for a white tail hunt ) , but if that 's the only realistic way to hunt I am not against it , assuming I can find something reasonably affordable .

If I were still there I would hook you up . Alabama has probably the best laws for making deer hunting easy . No tags , no check stations etc . About the only thing you ca n't do is hunt over corn and spotlight . From the start of bow season ( mid Oct ) to the end of gun season ( january 31 ) you can pretty much bag a buck AND a doe a day . I may have heard of people getting more than that in a day but they made sure they had enough people with them to claim the extras .

@@43195007 @3195007/ <h> Appealing a promotion board <h> 224 posts in this topic <p> So the new USAF captain board just posted their results and many of us believe there were some mistakes made . There are people who were wash backs in flight school who got promoted and others who graduated in the top half of their flight school class and top of their FTU class who were nonselected . There is a certain airframe in which everyone at that schoolhouse when the packages were sent in was nonselected . My understanding is that a promotion board can not discriminate based on the job . A promotion board has to select based on job performance while a retention board can discriminate based on the job . Maybe there was a paperwork issue out of that FTU ?

Finally caved in and went to the doc . After talking with the doc he sent me to Optometry . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about a slight lazy eye in a previous exam . After playing with the little black stick for awhile he asked me some very pointed questions . Do you read with you head tilted , is your head tilted in photos , do you see double when tired . Answer to all the questions is yes . He suspects Vertical Phoria and I undergo about another 3 hours of various tests . His analysis is vertical phoria with a left gaze diopter of 16 and a straight and right gaze diopter of 8 . He also discovers ( and I ca n't believe I never noticed this ) that I see double any time I look any father left than about 75 degrees and farther back . Of course I was immediately DNIF 'd . I was told that the waiver process was being started but I was being recommended to be sent to Brooks to the folks over at ACS . After doing some initial research I see a waiver as being highly unlikely . I know it can be corrected with prism 'd glass and even surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . My question is what are the chances of me remaining on flying status if i have to undergo the type of surgery it seems I will need . Any input or additional information by those a little more knowledge than myself would be greatly appreciated . <p> Poke <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just went to Wright-Patt last week for an FC1 exam and was medically disqualified . All went well with the physical until I got to the optometrist . After completing the evaluation and work up , the doctor told me I have an excessive Esophoria at 16 diopters of deviation . At that point , he told me I was disqualified with no waiver that will be submitted . The optometrist told me my only avenue now is a congressional waiver which might be very hard- to get since I am outside of regulations and acceptable standards. - I did well on all other eye tests such as depth perception , red lens test , visual acuity and- cycloplegic refraction . To my knowledge , this was the only issue I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've set up an appointment with an optometrist next week to get a second opinion and possible consultation for surgery . I read that surgery is disqualifying , but may be considered for waiver given that you pass all eye tests . I 'm definitely contemplating surgery but not sure if it is worth it or what risks are involved with the surgery . <p> I am a non-prior guy joining the Guard , slated to fly C-130 's .

@@43195010 @3195010/ <h> Navy Jet Attrite to ANG ? AF Reserves ? <h> 13 posts in this topic <p> Sorry if this has been covered before , but my prior search of the forums did not reveal much of what I 'm about to ask . <p> I 'm a Navy Jet student who is facing a possible attrition down the road . Still in training , but seems probable as I 'm just not getting carrier landings down cold and have grades on the verge as a result . I 'm 28 , had decent primary grades , and am interested in still flying for the military in some capacity if things do n't work out here . Has anyone heard of any protocol regarding a Naval Aviator attrite or a DOR applying to the guard ? Does attrition or DOR pretty much nuke any chances a guard unit or the Air Force Reserves would pick me up ? And of course what of the age limits ? Hate to turn this into a " What % chance " kind of question , but would like to at least know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Ca n't provide a reg quote ( because I 'm too lazy to go digging for the info ) , but I seem to remember that a DOR would prevent you from getting another flying position in the ANG . Do n't remember/know how a failure out of a program would affect you . Years ago , we had a guy come to us that had washed out of F-15s due to the inability to inflight refuel . Age could be an issue , but it appears that you have already completed a UPT type program with the Navy , is that correct ? If that is the case , you might be ok to attend an FTU . I will let other more knowledgeable folks pick it up from here . 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Termy , it seems in my case it 's been voiced that outcome is unlikely for what I can only guess is our own fiscal challenges/seat availability 's . <p> And to be honest , I 'm starting to sense what everyone has always told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart of . The Navy while great for some , is wearing down any hope I have of enjoying a career . Perhaps it 's a case of " grass is greener " syndrome , but from the personal conversations I 've had with some Air Force friends , I 'm thinking ( hoping ? ) I 'd be a better fit elsewhere . <p> I appreciate the replies everyone . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> My knowledge of the navy training pipeline is dated but if I remember correctly , ' back in the day ' jet track guys got their wings after the carrier phase was complete . If you ' attrite ' , will you have your wings ? or will you be short of wings ? That may be a factor in getting picked up for an AFRC or ANG unit . Graduated with wings generally = trainable in another jet without much hassle . No wings pretty much means you 'd have to go through AF UPT .

It talks about eligibility for flying training . It may not be a home run , but a good place to start at least . <p> Regardless of what the reg says , IMHO it would be better to attrite rather than DOR . At least you have a good explanation for it and can say , " I busted my ass as long as they let me , but ultimately boat flying was n't in the cards " rather than , " I was n't good at it so I quit " <p> It is not uncommon to find IFF/fighter FTU washouts in the AF heavy world .

While the OP has finished Primary , you have n't " graduated " until you get your wings . In the jet pipe that means carrier qual 'd . <p> To the OP , keep busting your ass , hit the sims ( drag your LSO over kicking and screaming if need be ) , and keep a positive attitude . If you attrite from the boat , having the command in your corner will be your best chance at moving to a different pipeline ( P-3/8 , Helos ) . Also , have your LSO go over LSO NATOPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . i.e. Just how big each cell is at the start , in the middle , and at the ramp . You 'll realize just how small/fast your corrections need to be . IIRC full high to full low is 21 ' of altitude at the start . <p> Yours would be a messy situation in the fact that you 're already commissioned , so you 'd need to be able to lat txfr ( basically resign , and swear back into the Guard ) ... and if you do n't have your wings be able to pick up a UPT slot . Age restrictions will be a player as well as whatever service obligation remains and getting big Navy to release you . If you already have your wings , it makes things easier as you can apply for an ARB board but getting your wings will require you to fulfill whatever service obligation your pipeline yields . <p> In a word , I 'd say ANG is a far fetched option if not impossible in your situation . <p> Final thought , ball flying ( yuck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet trimmed for on-speed prior to the abeam , make sure your abeam distance is consistent , and use the same angle of bank off the abeam to get you to a good start . 450-500 ' at the 90 , 380 ' at the 45 ( I have n't trapped in a few years , my gouge may be a little off ) . It 's all left hand . You should be checking your altitude wickets all the way around the turn to KNOW where the ball will be on the lens prior to ever rolling into the groove , it should never be a surprise . Total instrument turn , velocity vector " tail and wing " just touching the bottom of the horizon bar is a good place to start for your rate of descent around the turn increasing to 600-700 FPM as you come through the 45 . When you roll out in the groove , make your power off correction to establish your rate of decent ( remember you 're rolling wings level , lift increases , so a power off correction is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ) and then reset to your neutural power point . Get/keep the lens one ball high , bring it down to the middle , then push it back up again . Small , quick corrections . A cenetered ball is destined to go low so never leave it there . Your happy place is 1/2-one ball high , if you get under powered it will settle centered and you push it back up again . If you go high , pull power . If the ball stablizes high , that 's your neutual point . Pull a little more . The second it starts to come back down stop it , and recenter to your neutural power point . Three part corrections , all the way down the groove . Remember every line up correction requires power as you 're losing vertical component of left . A line up correction without a touch of power will result in a settle every time . Look long for line up ( end of the LA , the " T " ) , and back to the ball .

Ball flying and pattern is looking alot better than before ( still needs improvement though ) and I 'm still in the fight and doing whatever I humanly can .

( They did ask for rank when I made the reservations , so I assume it makes some difference , but they did n't care at check-in ) Nice size rooms with HI speed internet access ( PC included ) in some rooms . For dinner , we went off-base to a Sushi bar . Great food and service , the name escapes me , but it 's out the gate , down to the ' 4 corners ' and to the right . It 's about 50yds ( if that ) on the right . Ask at the desk , they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , just a traditional Japanese banner over the front of the door , but it 's nice . ( We walked past it the first time . ) They have English menus and the prices are reasonable . ( I went crazy buying Sake and Kirin for the crew plus loads of sushi for about $45 ) Enjoy <p> Kadena AB , Okinawa , Japan - O'club has excellent brunch starting at 1000 on Sunday . You get free pizza on Tuesday , and free " Chicago style dogs " ( Really mini weeners , about half normal size hot dogs ) on Wed . Of course Friday night still rocks with all the regular chicks there hanging out . 14$ for a 30 day temp membership is well worth it . When in Kadena with a short layover , try eating at The Four Seasons Steak House . Excellent lunch specials and good local beers too . Cooked right in front of you at a reasonable price to boot . Open daily from 1130-2300 . One block from there is the Tiger Embroidery shop . They make flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command post sells the old MAC purses , $10 ea , the inserts cost $2 ea . Okay , I have figured out all the places you do not want to stay at Kadena . The Sunabe is family style living , 8 to a room , enough said . Morimar near Tori Station is n't bad , but it is 3 bedrooms and a community living area , great for parties . Airway Inn near Naha is a 30 minute ride and as tiny as a room can get . The bathroom would be outdone by a airline bathroom . Rooms are hot and air kicks off when you pull your key out of wall . Not suitable for crew rest at all . Sunrise is borderline acceptable , across the street from Tigers and a 10 minute walk to the USO. the rooms were great compared to the above places we stayed at later on . Kadena is notorious for having bad , and I mean bad , ATOC/Pax terminal support . I do n't think I got a load on time and in correct order at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Command post will routinely not answer their radios , and no one meets you in parking despite a 2 hour out cal , 30 minute call and on the ground call . Customs is the same . <p> Misawa AB , Japan - The sign at the Misawa Inn says " best in PACAF " but it should also say " Slowest in PACAF . " We faxed ahead to get billeting and when we showed up they tried to put us off-base ( after they lost our reservations ) but there was nothing to be had so they put us up in the TLF 's which at Misawa are spread all over the base and the one we stayed at was in one of the base housing areas . If you are here more than a day or two you 'll want on-base . The TLF 's are three-bedroom houses ( scheduled for demolition ) with full kitchen but on the whole not to bad . FYI , you ca n't dial DSN from the TLF 's so call 226-9899 to get a phone patch . Food-wise there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are stuck on-base the Cafe Moketeki ( located inside the community center ) is open 24 hours and has a good selection of food and full coffee bar . If you get off-base , park at the BX and walk , it 's not far . Once out the gate , veer right down the alley where you 'll find the famous Stagger Inn . Good pizzas and beer , there 's a " mug club " which means cheaper beer and a mug you eventually keep . Also there is the Cheese Roll and Noodles which is farther down from the Stagger and is supposedly good . Trans was good to us but the vehicles were a little different . It looked like a standard small Japanese pickup truck but the shifting was different . It was a stick-shift with the shifter on the steering column instead of on the floor . Lastly , if you break here , call Outdoor Rec for information on local skiing . <p> Yokota AB , Japan - This place rocks . First of all , if you stay on base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they let you stay in Tachikawa , the perdiem is about $125 . Not a bad deal . On top of this , the Tachikawa Palace Hotel ( 042-527-1111 ) is a fully western hotel located near a major train station that has two department stores/malls adjacent to it . These places are filled with awesome restaurants and shops ( great Asian food as well as food for the typical uncultured American ) . The service is incredible at this place and bathrooms feature , check this out , a bidet . I was expecting a tiny room but it surprised me with its spaciousness . We deploy here often and here is the scoop . Communist Gyoza , AKA Gyoza Heaven , is located near the train station at Tachikawa , get a Tachikawa map from the Yujo Rec Center , take the train and look for the shake and 3 fries symbol for Tachikawa station . Called the Communist due to strict no doggie bag rules , great gyozas , like dumplings . Next place just outside Fussa gate and to the right 4 blocks is a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of Bruce Lee posters . Great chinese . Yujo Rec Center has a bunch of tours , like climb Fuji and other awesome trips , book early . Outback , next to O'club has good food and beer , especially if you are staying in building 120 , across the street . E'club has great pizza delivery .

Since they have to pay a BAH/OHA anyway , they do n't care the location , as long as they do n't have to pay to move the family there .

They could also only make appointments the day of , so it was space-a , Having said that , hospitals have ER rooms , so when out kid had a high fever and we could n't see the flight doc until 1630 that day , we just walked into the ER and were immediately taken care of .

What this means is that , while for all practical purposes , the non sponsored dependant will be able to enter and exit the UK on a " tourist visa " , they technically and legally will be an " illegal immigrant " . .

However , when we went through the passport control at the Calais Ferry terminal , the UK Border agent made us furnish evidence of their return plane ticket ( we had the e-ticket confirmation email so if was no big deal ) before they let them board the ferry . <p> Additionally , on the tourist visa stamp it says something like " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the NHS since I go on base for medical treatment but this condition may limit the types of services you could receive at the hospital .

So this could come up later if the non sponsored dependant tries to find work . <p> Certainly , they could get by Heathrow passport control with no issues , but the winters here are depressing enough without the prospect of never being able to travel and not being able to find a job . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the dependant is not command sponsored , they are not eligible for a dependant visa . ..

@@43195014 @3195014/ <h> Hematuria <h> 5 posts in this topic <h> Guest burrito <p> I was diagnosed with Benign Familial Hematuria , aka Thin-Basement-Membrane Nephropathy , years ago ( I 'm 18 ) . I was tested and found that my kidneys are completely healthy . It only shows up intermittently . As far as the rest of me goes , I am healthy , and I 'm not affected in any other way . <p> So , I just got back from my DODMERB for my ROTC scholarship , and my urine test came back with a positive on blood : 2+ and 8-12 RBC/HPF . I was n't that surprised , but I found a list of conditions that are disqualifying for FC1 , and " progressive or recurrent hematuria " is one of them . My question is , would my situation be considered disqualifying and , if it is , are there waivers available ? I am healthy otherwise , and if I did n't have this on my DODMERB , I 'm fairly sure it would go through without any problems ( my doc said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counting on getting the scholarship quite yet ) . <p> I could be worrying too much , but I 'd really like to know so I can decide whether to pursue military aviation or not . <p> Sorry for the long post , but thanks for any help . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27699 @qwx437699 <p> I. Overview . Gross hematuria is relatively common - one out of every 1000 visits to the emergency room is prompted by a patient 's discovery of gross hematuria . Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is even more common , with a prevalence of 1.2% to 5.2% in young adult males and as high as 13% in community population-based studies . Hematuria itself is not necessarily aeromedically significant . Discovering the underlying process , if any , causing the hematuria is the key to a proper aeromedical disposition . Hematuria may be essentially a normal variant , or it may be a sign of life-threatening disease . In 6 major studies of microscopic hematuria , between 1% and 12.5% had a neoplastic etiology and between 3.5% and 16.5% had calculi as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend evaluation of microscopic hematuria of greater than 3-5 RBC/hpf . In one study of 161 aviators with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria , no evident pathology developed over a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years ( Froom et al ) . <p> The differential diagnosis of asymptomatic hematuria without proteinuria or casts includes neoplasm , calculi , infection , trauma ( including exercise ) , analgesic and sickle cell nephropathies . Bleeding into the urinary tract from a source between the urethra and the renal pelvis results in no protein , cells or casts . Hematuria at the beginning or end of the stream usually indicates a urethral or prostatic source . <p> The differential diagnosis of hematuria with proteinuria or casts is extensive , and includes nephron damage and many forms of glomerulonephritis . <p> II . Aeromedical Concerns . Hematuria by itself is unlikely to be aeromedically significant . However , this sign must be evaluated fully . Calculi can cause extreme pain , lead to urinary tract infection and obstruction . Urinary neoplasms are often slow growing but must be diagnosed and treated early to optimize survival and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed to determine proper treatment and to address worldwide deployability ( e.g. renal reserve , ability to tolerate dehydration , etc . ) . <p> III . Information Required for Waiver Submission . The initial evaluation of persistent hematuria should include examination of external urethra and prostate , repeat urinalysis after discontinuing exercise , and urine cultures . BUN , creatinine CBC , and 24-hour urine for creatinine and protein should be obtained . If no etiology is determined on this initial workup , consultation with a urologist should be obtained to rule out collecting system disease . If no structural etiology is found , consultation with a nephrologist should also be obtained . Tests which may be requested by these consultants include : <p> IVP <p> renal ultrasound <p> cystoscopy <p> coagulation studies , urine cytology <p> CT <p> renal arteriography <p> renal biopsy <p> The amount of information required for waiver submission depends on the individual case . For instance , if exam , urine cultural , renal function , and blood count were normal , and the microscopic hematuria disappeared while the aviator refrained from exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 223 aviators in the USAF waiver file with the diagnosis of hematuria . Of these , 119 were waivered and 4 were disqualified . The disqualifications were all for worsening of renal function ( increasing proteinuria ) or renal biopsy results consistent with significant renal disease . <p> There are 35 aviators in the Aeromedical Consultation Service database who were diagnosed with hematuria while on active duty ( including ANG and AFR ) since August 1991 . This was the cause for grounding in 11 . Of these , 10 were recommended for waiver and one was treated and returned to flying duties without waiver . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27698 @qwx437698 <p> Bring all your documentation .

You 'll learn how to fly ILS , VOR , and GPS approaches to real-world airfields around the San Antonio area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academics . <p> The final stage , developed uniquely for RPA pilots , is known as the RPA Fundamentals Course , also at Randolph . During this final stage of undergraduate training , you will gain insight into the basic operation of " sensors , tactics , air tasking orders , " and the multitude of skills needed to ensure success transitioning to an RPA airframe . There will be more death-by-powerpoint , but a little more interesting . <p> Edited February 25 , 2013 by Keydet <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps and was recently informed that I will be attending IFS in Pueblo , CO followed by some school in San Antonio . Does anyone know what this process is like ? Have there been many Marines that have came through this pipeline in the past ? I understand what IFS is , but what is the curriculum in San Antonio geared towards ? <p> Any information on this topic would be very helpful . Thanks ! <p> You 're one of the first guys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's owned by the CO of MATSG-22 in Corpus Christi . The monitors did a road show and stopped by Kingsville . They gave us a presentation on the latest and greatest MOS in the Marine aviation world- your UAV MOS . They threw a bunch of buzzwords as us while our eyes glazed over . At the end of their spiel they asked if anyone was interested in leaving the jet world and lat moving to UAVs . Crickets ... FWIW I remember him saying something about training at Randolph and Ft Huachuca.

MY dad is a 73 ' USAFA grad and my brother just commisioned out of ROTC and is heading to ENJJPT . Based on both my fathers and brothers experiences , I am leaning towards ROTC . I am confident that I have a good shot at both ROTC scholarship and Academy acceptance ( 4.0 , sports , eagle scout ) . I just want to hear some pro 's and con 's about the Academy and ROTC . Thanks . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest waxgoblin <p> you 'll find people here probably will tilt towards the rotc route . if i got a full afrotc scholarship to the private colleges you can probably get into , i would probably take that over the zoo , and live a normal college life . <p> pretty much what it gets down to is , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Wax is very correct . I chose the ROTC route because I wanted to have a semi-normal college life . Chicks , booze , parties ... I am not sure you get that at USAFA . But , I will say that you will know pretty damn close to everyone and have a load of connections if you go that route . There are pros and cons to both . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest gtyj98 <p> i got both , and chose ROTC. after going through the USAFA summer seminar , then seeing a real college campus , there was no comparison . plus , why go through hell at the zoo when you can have a normal 4 years and still become a pilot ( and officer ) . <p> ROTC = A small amount of suck , but after a bad day you have the ability to go out , get sauced , and bang Mary Jane Rottencrotch . <p> And what do they call you when you finish either USAFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind is that you 'll actually make bank at the Academy since you will barley spend your stipend . But it is worth the smack year , daily marches to chow , and all of the new sensitivity training ? That 's up to you . A vast majority of my Zoomie friends say no . <p> I personally do n't know why anyone would want to give up the best four ( or seven ) years of their life . Besides , if you 're going to be a pilot you 're going to spend at least the first two years of your military career in a training environment . Do you really want to make that six ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> I bailed on the Zoo option after my second recruiting trip . Several guys on the football team told me not to come if I had good eyes and could get a pilot slot in ROTC . I took their advice and have had few regrets only because things worked out . My best friend went out there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly . I rarely saw in the summer him because he stayed at school to make up classes he tubed or some other reason . I saw him several times in Minnesota over the next 4 years when the USAFA hockey team came out to play and I was always amazed at the wacky appreciation they all had for the " freedom " on their team trips . I did stop into the Zoo to see him when we were playing in Colorado and he did not look like he was having a good time . Years later , we were together flying A-10s and there was no way to tell the difference in commissioning source . I thnk I had more fun in college but I was lucky . <p> I would 've had many regrets if things had not worked out in ROTC or if my eyes went south during college or if I needed any type of waiver or a lot of other ifs that are not a problem at the Zoo but a big problem if you 're just an ROTC shmuck . <p> My advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aware of all the risks if you end up with multiple options . <p> Remember , having fun in college is not worth it if you never end up at pilot training . <p> Good luck . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'll piggy-back on Rainman 's post . My experience was sort of the mirror opposite of his . <p> I turned down several full athletic scholarship offers from civilian universities in my home state . I was also recruited by all the service academies and several Ivy League schools . I will say that I did n't know squat about ROTC at the time . <p> When I took my recruiting trip to the Zoo , I was impressed by the dudes who hosted me . They were a bunch of top-notch individuals and warriors . I was a farm kid from Ohio . My dad thought I was an idiot to consider going to the Academy when I could get an education free--and closer to home . Looking back , part of my rational was probably defying my old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROTC . I did n't even know about ROTC then . But , the notion that you are n't going to have any " college experience " at the Academy is wrong . After the first year , I spent most weekends off-campus , doing the same sh ! t anybody else would have been doing at that age . <p> Again , without comparing to ROTC , I 'll throw out what I think were the positives in my case . I graduated from the Zoo in ' 87 so I 've had some time to let it sink in and ponder it . <p> 1 . I made some awesome friends for life . Just last winter , I took a ski trip with 6 of my old buds and our wives . It was as if we 'd never been apart . The sh ! t you go through together at the Academy bonds you . <p> 2 . You 'll never be around more smart people at the same time in your life ( maybe unless you go to an Ivy League School ) . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just talking about the sheer numbers at the Academy . <p> 3 . The education is top-notch . I 've never felt inferior , from an educational standpoint , at any time in my life since the Academy . <p> 4 . The extra-curricular activities and opportunities are cool . While still in college , I got to see a good bit of the world , play Div-1A football at very high level ( three bowl games in four years--all victories ! ) , fly gliders and airplanes , and do some things that would not have been financially feasible at another school . <p> 5 . The Academy opens doors for you in later life ; whether in the military , airlines , or business , there 's a network out there . <p> It was hard . It sucked at times . I do n't regret it . I 'm proud I did it . Since then , I 've flown A-10s my whole career . For someone who actually is in a position to choose between ROTC and the Academy ( and most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> Yep , Bozz and I had almost the exact same scenario with two different choices and we both ended up flying A-10s without it mattering one bit where we went to school . <p> I am the poster child for the saying it is better to be lucky than good . <p> I can say I was sweating blood my senior year with a torn rotator cuff , torn anterior deltoid , 13 shoulder separations and 9 games with a cast on my right leg for a " high ankle sprain " . I had less than zero chance for any medical waiver because I was ROTC . I only a couple months to recover after the season before my last pilot training physical . My ROTC PAS/DETCO told me I should seriously consider sitting out the season after my first significant injury . I lost a lot of sleep over that but never even considered sitting out a single play . Probably stupid , definitely lucky . <p> If I had been at the USAFA , no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in and you want to lock up a pilot slot . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Right , whatever . I had a good time at USAFA ... even as a frosh I partied on the weekends ( the ones I could get out ) , I was in a cheesy cover band . Made some good friends that I know will always be there , and vice versa . Granted I did n't always follow all the rules except the golden rule : " Do n't get Caught " . Did some fun stuff you could only do there . It was n't all fun and games ... 1st year kind of sucked , but I 'm glad I went that route . FWIW . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 16 ... for college it 's a personal choice . if you want the academy lifestyle then go there . if you want the real college lifestyle , go to normal school . what really sucks is having your cake and eating it too ( VMI ) . you get the miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotc route ... which wait a minute , sucks compared to having the academy where you 're guarenteed a slot if you can breathe . oh well , i did 4 years at the " I " and am a lot better for it . if you 're not sure what you want , go to a normal college . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm one of the few dudes around who 's been both an Academy and ROTC cadet . Honestly , I really do n't know which is better . Some food for thought : <p> 1 . Do you want to be a pilot ? I found that the USAFA system helps you get there much easier . Any medical issues you may have will be solved much easier at USAFA than in ROTC <p> 2 . How much do you value the typical American college experience ? Rush , parties , late night trips to who knows where , and having a beer and macaroni breakfast are all things you 'll never experience at the Zoo . <p> 3 . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some awesome summer programs ... none of which pay you any more than what you already get paid . ROTC will only steal 4 weeks of your junior summer . All the rest you can work , take classes , or be lazy . <p> 4 . Girls . Yes , its possible to date at the Zoo . However , she ca n't stay in your room . <p> 5 . How rebelious are you ? You 're a member of the Air Force when you 're at the Zoo .

I saw a group at Columbus AFB on my PDT that were about 19-20 , all of which were drinking beer at the bowling ally . Our POC ( Lt Col ) saw that and had a little " talk " with them . Of course on Columbus it is legal to drink at the age of 18 ( one of the only two bases left that allow this I think ) but the fact they were all drinking and planning to drive a government van back to where they were staying = unhappy Lt Col. Good times , wonder what ever happened to them . <p> Anyways , good luck with whoever it is . ; P I ca n't stand people who think they are better than everyone ( you and I both , lol ... even a little bit of it in ROTC ) . Oh well , what can you do . Just compliment them on how " hardcore " they are and maybe their head will get big enough and explode . ; ) 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that we had our fair amount of douches coming out of ROTC . Anytime I hear someone say , " what squadron were you in " or " I was the commander of my ROTC det " I think of the LT from Heartbreak Ridge talking to Gunny Highway . Nobody worth a damn is going to care where you got your bars . Get your job done and do it well , in my exp the guys who worry about this are usually not at the top of their game and lag behind their peers . 2 and a wake up ... <p> Cooter <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have to agree though with the fact that you definitely get the college experience more out of going the rotc route than the zoo . I studied my ass off and got to go to UPT ... but I gurantee I drank a lot more beer and hooked up with a lot more chicks than most academy guys did . But on the flip side coin of that argument is that a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a hell of a lot of fun to hang out with on the weekends in Acuna . So in the end , does n't really matter .

@@43195019 @3195019/ <h> CSO to Pilot <h> 26 posts in this topic <p> So I sit here now in Pensacola at UCT ( do they even have an official name for this training yet ? ) and I feel its time to really start figuring out which road to take that would best get me to UPT . I have roughly 150 hours of flight time , instrument rating , 98 PCSM , etc , but a crappy semester from my freshman year is what killed it for me ( that , and a brand new PAS at my det for the semester of boards , but I can hardly shift even a majority of the blame ) . <p> As of right now I 'm 26 and will be finishing up UCT later this year and that 's ( hopefully ) where the process starts . I , like many on this forum , am dedicated to making it to UPT . I spoke with my Flt/CC about this because he went through the same deal . He asked what I thought I would be , a pilot , a fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the A10 ) . I wanted to make that snap decision and say fighter pilot , I mean who would n't ? Its badass and that childhood dream kind of stuff . But then it occurred to me that even in the T6 I was n't enjoying it like I should . I absolutely love flying and everything about it , but I do n't know if its a control issue or pride or what , but if I 'm not the one flying , its just not right to me . I 've come to the realization that I would just be a pilot ( in answer to his question ) . I can whole-heartedly say that I would RATHER fly a C-5 , KC-135 , or whatever is the most opposite end of the spectrum from a fighter , than be a WSO on an F-15E . I 'd rather be in control of a heavy than ride in the back of a fighter . That 's not to say I would n't prefer flying an F-16 or something of that nature , but hopefully you get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and get down to it ... <p> Like I said , I 'm 26 . When I graduate I 'll almost be 27 . That scares the crap out of me due to the age limit of 30 for starting UPT . Sure there are waivers , but in today 's Air Force ? Really ? <p> So where can I go from here ? I do not want to try to blow my own horn here ( sts ) but as I sit now I am right near the top of my class and probably have the choice of airframe to go to provided its in the drop . Right now my plan is to go C-130 since that has the shortest FTU so that I can become operational and try to apply to the AD boards right away , instead of going F-15E WSO and having nearly 2 years of follow-on . <p> So any of you guys out there have any knowledge in this matter ? Any idea the earliest possible I can start applying for the boards ? Or should I even now start networking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other end of training ? And is there even an option for a switch mid-training ? Hell if they ripped me out of UCT today and said I was gon na start UPT in a week and pack my crap and get going I would be at U-Haul within the hour . But that 's not happening . <p> If you 've stuck with me this far I appreciate it , and any advice you may have to offer . I just hoped to express my desire to make it to UPT and not come across as some bitter kid who did n't get what he thought he deserved . I want to earn this . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Of all the navs and other cross-flow guys at UPT , it took them a good 3-4 years to get selected . The AF is n't going to send you to Nav school to turn around and then send you to UPT after you finish your FTU and move to your operational squadron . Most everyone I talk with said they work their butts off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then applied . Everyone that is a cross-flow from other career fields are junior Captains , so I would say you have a little while before you have a chance . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I thought you had to do your job for like 3 years before you can apply to switch jobs ? Maybe that 's for non rated officers applying to go rated , I 'm not sure . <p> But if that is the case , I would agree with Rainman and say just take the most bad ass thing you can get now and make the best of it .

Seriously dude , I get that you love flying but from where you sit now , at the CSO schoolhouse , you either need to bury those feelings deep or get your mind right that you are not a pilot , will not be a pilot in the very near future , and that other people are gon na fly you around for a little while . Buy your own plane and fly on the weekend , that 's great , but you need to learn to accept that you 're gon na be a CSO and you need to be the best damn CSO you can be if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't handle that you need to find a different path in life . And like I said ... if you eventually go to UPT and get heavies , you will be a copilot for several years anyways , letting someone else fly the jet is something you need to be OK with . <p> Right now my plan is to go C-130 since that has the shortest FTU so that I can become operational and try to apply to the AD boards right away , instead of going F-15E WSO and having nearly 2 years of follow-on . <p> Like Rainman said , do n't pick something you do n't want because you think it will work out for you better later . Look at all the jets available to you , choose the one you think sounds the best ( **35;1705;TOOLONG ) and take it .

I have been exactly where you are right now , wondering how to make it happen . And I had A-holes telling me to be a better CSO too , it may not be what you want to hear ( at the time i did n't want to hear it ) , it is however the reality . Without exception , every year I saw the BEST CSO 's in the wing get picked up .. logical conclusion was to be the best . open those doors for yourself and you will feel a sense of accomplishment . On my last chance to apply , I was rated #1 from my squadron -- maybe the wing who knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a CSO , I know nothing about putting the plane where it needs to be on parameters , that 's pilot business and I left it at that . However I did know how to do my job better then anyone in my peer group , and better than any of the applicants , and that is what got me selected . It certainly was n't scores on the AFOQT , or having a PPL , or my GPA . It was being the best in my wing . So , take it for what its worth , but what these guys are telling you , is 100% accurate . <p> /Bragging I know , but he needs to hear it from someone who has done it and been there . <p> Life is what is happening while you wait bro , learn to love CSO , choose a plane you want to fly and go enjoy it . If you get picked up later on for UPT , awesome , if not you can still have a great career from the back seat as well , plus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the pilots ever are , that 's a cool thing a lot of CSO 's do n't understand . <p> I 'm about to go to ABM training in a few months . What I 've heard for us rated guys is that we have to wait 2.5 years after we are winged to apply to the AD board <p> This is not true , you have to have 2.5 years of service from the date you are winged , you can apply earlier and your class date will just be later , as long as its within the scope of the board which if I recall correctly extends to the end of the Fiscal Year ... but do n't quote me on that . <p> Had a guy PCS in , and appied with about 1.5 years on station , you have to serve two right ? Got picked up and his PCS date was I believe 2-3 weeks after the 2 year mark , and his class date worked out with his winging date as well . Lucky guy , basically min time for everything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the opposite , I ran right up the TAFCSD limit . <p> You can control only so much , the rest is being at the right place at the right time , and of course , recognizing it helps too ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> I did know how to do my job better then anyone in my peer group , and better than any of the applicants , and that is what got me selected . <p> It certainly was n't scores on the AFOQT , or having a PPL , or my GPA .

Not that anyone could triangulate something like that . <p> They also need to be saved for a naming ceremony , if you graduate and there is such a thing wherever you end up . <p> in certain airframes you are 10x more involved in the mission than the pilots ever are , that 's a cool thing a lot of CSO 's do n't understand . <p> Interesting . <p> BTW , what jets are those , just so everyone knows what to avoid ? <p> Would n't it suck to be a CSO in one of those jets , go to UPT and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a worse job than you had before UPT ? <p> Damn . <p> Had a guy PCS in , and appied with about 1.5 years on station , you have to serve two right ?

My case has been the opposite , I ran right up the TAFCSD limit . <p> Wait , that dude who min ran his CSO time and got picked up in front of you was lucky and your situation where it took you max time to become the best of the best was all skill based ? <p> I 'm confused . <p> You can control only so much , the rest is being at the right place at the right time , and of course , recognizing it helps too ! <p> Wait , timing is everything ? I thought being the best CSO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up now . <p> I guess I 'll just go with work your ass off and be good at your job so that you are in a position to take advantage of good timing . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Of all the navs and other cross-flow guys at UPT , it took them a good 3-4 years to get selected . The AF is n't going to send you to Nav school to turn around and then send you to UPT after you finish your FTU and move to your operational squadron . Most everyone I talk with said they work their butts off to be the best at their job their first assignment and then applied . Everyone that is a cross-flow from other career fields are junior Captains , so I would say you have a little while before you have a chance . <p> I guess that kinda sucks for me then . By the time I 'm in my MWS for 3-4 years , I will be over 30 and beyond the cutoff for UPT . That was the whole point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell even a reserve/guard spot , whether part or full time , would be just fine for me . I have every intention of working my butt off here and at my FTU . Its not like I 'm slacking off at all , I 'm working hard and taking every bit of info in that I can . I am just trying to find out other 's experiences beyond " work hard " . I 'm speaking of other avenues to accomplish my goal or any other advice . <p> You should fly helicopters . <p> Those terrify me . But honestly , I 'd do it if it means flying . <p> I thought you had to do your job for like 3 years before you can apply to switch jobs ? Maybe that 's for non rated officers applying to go rated , I 'm not sure . <p> But if that is the case , I would agree with Rainman and say just take the most bad ass thing you can get now and make the best of it . If you really do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frickin strike eagle dropping bombs on shit , I think you 're just being greedy bro <p> Greedy ? Gotcha , ok well if I am ever an Eagle WSO and you happen to be flying some heavy , gim me a call and I 'll trade you . <p> I do not see it as being greedy . I see it as having a goal and knowing what makes you happy . We only have one life to live , if you 're not doing what you 're passionate about , you 're wrong . That 's what I 'm trying to get at . Sorry if I 'd rather be in the front seat than the back . You 're entitled to your opinion . <p> FIFY ... seriously , nsplayer 's comment was spot on . If becoming a pilot is your goal , you have to kick ass now as a CSO to have any kind of chance . Go with the mission that interests you , and you 'll succeed . <p> They are all " interesting " in the way that intro to chem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its not the " holy crap this is amazing $*** that I want to do every waking moment for the rest of my life and sleep when I die " stuff . That 's how flying feels to me lol . <p> I really appreciate all of the input here , but the sad fact is like I said previously ... after finishing up here I do not have the years left to be able to apply to UPT . What really brought this on is me starting a family , getting married soon ( no kids in the near future ) , etc . I am trying to think down the road at what happens next . Sure I 'm happy as long as I 'm in a jet , but being a CSO wo n't enable me to fly later on if the air force decides my services are no longer needed or something . Its not like I can go to the airlines or a charter company and be like " hey , I used to be a back-seater . Can I be a nav for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It might be looking at the negative side of things , but I 'm sure those of you with families can at least understand my perspective . That 's why I 'm asking for advice specifically regarding my age and timeframe I have to get into UPT. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I guess that kinda sucks for me then . By the time I 'm in my MWS for 3-4 years , I will be over 30 and beyond the cutoff for UPT . <p> It might be possible ... I know a guy who went sooner . Keep your dreams in mind , but ... <p> Greedy ? Gotcha , ok well if I am ever an Eagle WSO and you happen to be flying some heavy , gim me a call and I 'll trade you . <p> Lose this attitude ASAP . No one at Pensacola gives a shit that you really , really wanted to be a pilot and neither will anyone at your gaining unit . Like I said before , if you show up as a brand new CSO and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacting with other CSOs will probably not be great . <p> They are all " interesting " in the way that intro to chem was interesting back in college . Its ooohs and ahhhhs , but its not the " holy crap this is amazing $*** that I want to do every waking moment for the rest of my life and sleep when I die " stuff . That 's how flying feels to me lol . <p> The grass is always greener man , there are ups and downs in every job . There are great CSO missions out there , when it comes time to pick concentrate on those rather than what will lead you to the front seat fastest . <p> Sure I 'm happy as long as I 'm in a jet ... <p> It sure does n't sound that way . The biggest thing holding you back from what you want might well be your attitude and that 's one of the easiest things to fix . Fix it . <p> If you ca n't live with being a CSO for minimum of 3-4 years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not complete CSO training , do not pass GO , do not collect $200 . If you 're really so hard up to be a pilot , DOR , do your 4-6 years as a comm officer or whatever , get out and become a commercial pilot . <p> Edited March 18 , 2012 by nsplayr <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Lose this attitude ASAP .

If you 're really so hard up to be a pilot , DOR , do your 4-6 years as a comm officer or whatever , get out and become a commercial pilot . <p> Wow , some people here are really good at completely and totally destroying dreams . So in your opinion there is 100% no way for me to have a shot , is that what you 're getting at ? <p> Because I find that hard to believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc , there has to be some way to get in to UPT from where I am or where I 'll be in the future before I turn 30 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Some people just ca n't face the brutal reality and make a decision based on what they see . <p> The guy wants a magic answer that does n't exist . <p> He 's been given excellent advice which he chooses to rail against like a two year old in the midst of a tantrum . <p> No amount of coaching can correct that . <p> Game over . <p> No I 'm not looking for a magic answer . I 'm just looking for something that is n't the same thing that in reality gives me nothing .

I really do n't have time for useless ignorant posts such as this . <p> I made the mistake of not planning for the future when I was in school and when I realized my mistake , it was too little too late at the time , there was nothing I could do that could alter my course and get me to UPT . I do not want to make the same mistake twice . So that being said , and other than the glaringly obvious advice , I am curious as to other 's actual experiences . Not rumors or other BS . <p> I was told about a year ago by an F-15E pilot that he tracked WSO and upon arriving immediately went to UPT and that roughly 1 in 4 had the same opportunity . I am not sure if this sort of thing happens any longer , but things like this is what I 'm looking for , trying to gauge my odds of making it . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the " normal " way , i.e. 3-4 years in my MWS , apply to the AD boards and pray for a waiver , etc , then I would rather go Strike Eagles and hope for UPT from there . Its those sort of things that are other options separate from the " hey put on a smile and enjoy your fate " sort of thing . <p> And yes , Rainman , I can face a brutal truth . But there is no brutal truth here , only rumors and speculation . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> No I 'm not looking for a magic answer .

But there is no brutal truth here , only rumors and speculation . <p> Here 's some brutal truth : if you read the VSP/RIF/many other threads on here , the AF ca n't even figure out how many hundreds of thousands of people it 'll need next year , much less the number of WSO to pilot transitions in 2 years . Nobody on this board will give you a percentage because not even AFPC knows . Strike eagle guys go through the same boards as everyone else as well . The best method of planning for the future is to do what everyone has been advising you ; since timing is everything , being the best you can be keeps the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it be UPT , WIC , TPS ( yes WSOs can do the last 2 although they got their jobs due to poor grades ) , or just the sweet liason tour in Germany . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> First off be grateful that you are in the operational community at all . I spent 5 years of my life in CE and while I did n't completely despise mission support it was not where I wanted to be . I worked hard and applied to get into any flying program ( Pilot , CSO , ABM ) and was accepted into the CSO program and will never scoff at it . I wanted to be a pilot above everything else but the AF decided this was best for me and I was more than happy to take the position . <p> There was another individual in my flight at Pensacola who had the same experience as me but he still wanted to pursue the pilot program . He was 28 when he started the CSO program . He made his intentions known to leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPT while still enrolled in UCT . He even put together an application package and submitted it . It never left Pensacola ... <p> Do n't slap the AF in the face for a good thing that has been given to you ... it could be worse . There are waivers that you may be able to get for a Guard/Reserve unit . From what I have seen from the guy I know who was trying to do the same thing as you no units will really even talk to you until you finish UCT and the schoolhouse for your MWS ( whatever you end up getting . ) <p> If you have specific questions feel free to PM me . But as for the goings on down at P-Cola ; do well in academics and the flightline and keep your head down . If you make your intentions public the word will get around and it wo n't be looked upon very favorably ....

My rationale is that I will be able to perform better in CSO training to hopefully get the aircraft I want .

I understand that the role of CSOs on certain aircraft is limited and job satisfaction maybe low , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up there . <p> If I elect to go towards CSO will I face a " glass ceiling " down the road ? <p> I heard its hard to leave the AFSOC community , but would I still be able to pursue those foreign affairs jobs , etc ? <p> I really appreciate any feedback , thank you ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If you do n't love flying , do n't take a flying job ( of any flavor ) . Earning flight pay means punching a 12-hour duty clock then hammering through DTS , OPRs , or other minutia on the back end . It 's a lot of work for you to not love the flying aspect . <p> If you like flying and you 're qualified to be a pilot , go be a pilot .

After every landing and maneuver ask " what could I have done better ? " <p> This is good advice . Why did the flying go poorly ? Is it a stick and rudder problem or are you behind the aircraft ? You can learn the required motor skills with practice , especially if you get a little flying in on the side . If you ca n't mentally keep up , then you 've probably correctly assessed that you wo n't make a good pilot . However , if your issue is just being unable to land ( my UPT class lost 2 dudes for this ) , then also consider the 18x program . You do n't have to land the plane , you 'll get a decent chance at shooting , and you can be in AFSOC . Whatever you choose , good luck . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I could n't land on my own ; I had difficulties managing my air-brakes , rudder , and stick at the same time . <p> I thought about going down the RPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys , but what I did gain from soaring was appreciation for being in the air . Even if you do n't directly engage in combat , you 're still vital for the service . I want to support the special operators on the ground by either giving them firepower or taking them where they have to go . <p> I would rather be flying aboard an AC/MC-130 or U-28 as a CSO rather than being the pilot-in-command of a C-17 or other platform . <p> Good on your for choosing mission over everything else , but do n't sell your stick-monkey potential short . You are n't born with piloting skills , they are taught . <p> If you really want to be a CSO , go for it ... you can always change your mind later and apply for pilot training up until you are 30 . It is not uncommon . You have a long road ahead of you and you could end up in a variety of airframes as a pilot or a CSO that you may not like . Work hard enough and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . <p> Also a bit of advice : if you do end up going CSO keep it to yourself that you passed up a pilot slot .

" Having nav'ed both E-3s and BUFFs , working slightly more arcane issues like optimizing AWACS orbit placement in OEF to minimize the UHF radio jamming we got from the Army 's RCIED jammers on the ground ( to better delivery our " non-kinetic effect " ) was a lot more fun than sitting in the shack ( again ) , waiting for the klaxon . Simultaneously , do n't decide based on what particular airframes are doing right now , because it will almost certainly be different by the time you finish UPT/UNT , IQT , and MQT ( i.e. do n't discount the BUFF , for instance , because of a few Sad Pandas that ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen it ; when I got to E-3s a lot of **27;1742;TOOLONG people had picked AWACS because it was n't deploying--we were in a 3 year " reconstitution " period or whatever they called it--and sure enough the community started going to the desert again about the time I was starting IQT ) . Weigh in your mind the whole spectrum of that MDS 's missions , potential locations , and crewforce morale ( which you 'll only learn by asking people ) . <p> I was an oddball who put Nav and ABM as #1 and #2 on my dreamsheet in ROTC because I could n't imagine the 10 year commitment for UPT . I 've now been in for 7 1/2 years , so in hindsight that was a shitty reason . Would n't take back a second of my career as a nav , but highly recommend you spend some time pursuing the powered flight thing before you write off pilot over " bad hands . " At the very least , solo and get yourself 20-30 hours before you decide you hate it . 27701 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . My additions with some repeats for emphasis : <p> A ) Try powered flying and get to the point where you can solo . I 'm definitely in the category of liking flying without loving it , however I had a blast flying -172s in a civilian capacity . There are few people who are inclined to try flying that ca n't be taught how to do it safely enough to take a Cessna up and have a good time . <p> B ) If you still do n't love being at the controls but enjoy flying enough do wan na do it every day as a profession and you want to be involved in the big picture mission of the Air Force , becoming a CSO is a great way to do it . <p> C ) AFSOC is great for getting you " in the fight " so to speak and a great place to be a CSO . However it is pretty hard to escape and you will get ridden hard . There is absolutely no glass ceiling for CSOs in AFSOC ; Gen. Fiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A possible benefit of going CSO vs pilot is your commitment is noticeably shorter . As someone who 's getting out at the end of my initial flying commitment my pilot buddies who are leaning the same way are jealous that I 'm punching now and they have 4 years to go . <p> On the other hand , if you even think you might wan na be a pilot , do n't pass up the once in a lifetime opportunity to give it a shot from the start . Yea , you can always try to go to UPT later once you 're a CSO , but if you can get a pilot slot out of the zoo and you think you might wan na do it , give it a shot . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Also of note , platforms like the AC-130U/W/J are highly CSO centric , the pilots really are mostly stick monkeys , and you get to do the bad guy shooting . <p> False .

@@43195023 @3195023/ <h> Knee/ACL injury and surgery info <h> 63 posts in this topic <h> Guest cbire880 <p> So I injured my right knee skiing about a year ago . Now its time for me to go to MEPS for OTS and I 've got a predicament . The ortho I was seeing sent me for an MRI which returned with a possible ACL rupture . I was told to exercise it and come back to see him if the knee continued to bother me . I have n't had it give out on me since and am running appprox 20 miles a week on an indoor track . Does n't hurt to run , but I can tell its not as good as my left knee . So I was doing my research in prep for MEPS and came upon the DQ for ACL injuries . I know the reconstructions can be waivered , but has anyone heard of a waiver for a previous knee injury without surgery ? I 'm running out of time before I have to decide whether or not to get it done ( going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid surgery if at all possible , especially since I feel I 'm 100% , but I 'll do it if that 's the only way to get qualified . Any help would be appreciated . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27699 @qwx437699 <p> I do n't know of any specific individuals who have received a waiver for this on induction to the USAF . I know plenty of pilots who have blown out their knee , and worse , who are still in and still flying . <p> Make sure you have a no kidding diagnosis of an ACL injury before you state that to the MEPS . From what you wrote , I would say you have a history of knee injury with full functional recovery . An MRI that shows a " possible " anything is NOT a diagnosis . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I have a flying status waiver for PCL ( similar to ACL ) reconstructive surgery , and a titanium IM rod in my right femur . ACL and PCL require the same waiver . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tries ) for accessions and upgraded for flying duties . <p> I recently received a PM from a user here about this subject , and I will paste my response below . His case is very similar to yours . It 's pretty much a straight cut and paste , so not all of it applies directly to you : <p> **31;1771;TOOLONG <p> I do know alot about this subject unfortunately ... What I can tell you first off is to be honest and not hide anything ( only concerning actual doctor-diagnosed health issues ... not " I think I may have had a kidney stone one time ... " type stuff - you DO NOT want to open unnecessary cans of worms ) . If you can get your doctor to sign off on your knee saying that there is no residual instability and it is strong , then you might have a shot - though that does not sound like your case right now . I 'm not sure which avenue you are pursuing a commission though , but more than likely , you 'll go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial physical ( long before an FC1 ) , and when they find out about your knee trouble , they 'll send you on an orthopedic consult . No big deal , just another civilian doctor who will examine your knee and make an official recommendation . One thing with the ACL though , is that when they do the Lachman 's test , it will likely be positive . If it 's over +1 ( basically if instability is anything but very mild ) , you 're going to have problems with AETC and you 'll be disqualified . I know this because I was DQed - twice . ( I realize that Lachman 's is not really a function of the PCL , but it 's an issue I was dealing with ) The biggest reason for coming clean about this when you 're supposed to is because if they find out about it later , you are SCREWED . It could become a fraudulent enlistment case and that is not good . Save yourself worrying and headaches , get reconstructive surgery ( or get on a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% - at the advice of your doctor ) , get your waiver , and go in the right way . Now , having said all of that , let me just say this : if your injury is just a partial tear ( and your doctor is really the one who can tell you about this ) , you might have a good chance at building up your quadriceps and other leg muscles ( but most importantly the quads ) and making your knee stable . But I can tell you that if you require a brace for normal athletic activity , you wo n't make it . Also , on the form that you fill out when you do the physical , with about 100 questions starting out with " Have you ever had or do you now have .... " I think there is one question about torn ligaments . They also ask about surgeries , etc ... But with just a partial tear , you might be able to get by - just keep in mind that they are serious about knees . I suppose if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery or the need for a brace you 'll be good to go . But if this is a diagnosed condition and it 's in your medical records , be honest , do what you have to do for your knee , get your doctor 's sign off , and move forward . I know I 'm rambling a little but the bottom line is this : get your knee into shape and then apply . A medical disqualification is extremely disheartening . Do everything to avoid that in advance , whether it be surgery or a physical therapy regimen . <p> Sorry this went so long , but there 's alot to it . If you do get wrapped up in the waiver process , you 've got to be very persistent and patient . There is no good way around it , but do n't just give up . Best of luck and let me know if you have any more questions , <p> John <p> 03 February 2004 , 10:14 : Message edited by : John Thompson <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from several sources is the same .

I can tell you what my contact at HQ AETC/SGPS told me : if you have an uncomplicated recovery , no residual instability in that knee , and symmetrical size and strength ( and the doctor indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waiver IS likely . Keep that in mind and hang in there ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Correct : recovery after surgery . I feel very confident in saying that they will not waiver it if it is torn and unoperated . Not to say a waiver is impossible for a stable knee with a torn ligament - good ol ' FlightDoc even told me back in the day what I 'm telling you here - but strong ligaments ( and musculature ) are what stabilize knees ... so you can see where that gets you . I first attempted a waiver with an unoperated knee with a torn ligament . It was mildly unstable , but there was absolutely no functional deficit ( active in running , biking , and full contact sports with no need for a brace , etc ... ) . I also had favorable letters from both my doctor and the MEPS ortho consult doctor indicating this . Regardless , it was a pretty quick but painful DQ from all military service . The second DQ came over a year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite up to standard yet . A few months of hardcore physical training and the right doctor put me on the right path to an eventual waiver . Perhaps it can be done with a currently partially torn ligament ( I 'd give it an 80/20 , in favor of the DQ ) , but I would say with a completely torn ligament and anything more than mild instability , you will most definitely be disqualified . But again , my guesses are just that . I 'm certainly not the AETC . <p> Again , sorry for being wordy , but there 's alot to this . Definitely feel free to post more questions if you have them . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest cbire880 <p> I went and saw my family doctor today so I could get a referral to a specialist , got ta love HMOs . I 'm getting a new MRI done next friday , but from the look of things I 'd say there is an 80% chance that its shot and I 'll need surgery . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as possible with the waiver issue if I have to get cut . Do I need to get DQ 'd at MEPS before I can start the waiver process ? So should I go down there and get DQ 'd if I find out or wait to see them at all until after I recover ? I 'm not sure how much extra lag there will be if I go there after recovered and they send me home telling me I need a waiver . Thanks for all your help so far . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Whether or not to go to MEPS with a known disqualifying condition can be a tough decision . You know you will likely be DQ'ed ... but what if ? Somewhat of a crapshoot , though the odds are most definitely in favor of a DQ ( assuming you have a torn ligament or otherwise unstable knee ) . However , if you take the long road , get your knee squared away now ( for your own good as well - afterall , your health is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MEPS , the waiver process will go much more smoothly ( I wish I would have done it this way back in 2001 ) . It 'll also save you a lot of potential heartache . When you go to MEPS after your recovery , you will be sent on an ( or another ) orthopedic consult and will be disqualified by MEPS . Your MEPS information will then be forwarded to HQ AETC/SGPS for waiver/certification . The MEPS approval authority is DoDMERB ( DoD Medical Exam Review Board - not USAF ) and acts as a channel for all of your stuff going to AETC . <p> Do n't sweat a MEPS DQ too much ... it 's just a necessary process for your package to go up to the SG , and it WILL happen if you have a disqualifying factor . I used to get DQ'ed by MEPS all the time . Then when I finally had my waiver , and had it printed out and with me , it was like a force field against those MEPS people . <p> But as I 've said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's going to take tons of persistence and patience . And it is not unlikely that there will be significant paperwork errors and delays along the way . Hang in there and keep your eye on the ball .

We did the IFE song and dance followed by an emergency ground egress . When I jumped off the ramp I felt something tear in my knee . It was sore for a while but seemed to improve with time , but never completely healed . Last year at ACSC I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Now it is to the point where it hurts to go up stairs . Sometimes it is fine , but if I move laterally , I get some fairly severe pain . I completely stopped running in May in an attempt to give it a chance to heal , it has n't . I finally broke down last month and got a referral to see an orthopedic doc up at Bethesda . He looked at my knee and had them take 5-6 X-rays only to tell me I do n't have a torn ACL or MCL ( the flight doc thinks I have a torn meniscus ) . Bottom line , the doc acted like I do n't have a problem , perhaps some early arthritis , but nothing more . He gave me some Naproxen ordered some physical therapy to strengthen the upper muscles on the upper part of my knee and sent me on my way . I have a fairly high tolerance for pain , but this is really starting to cramp my style .

So , I 'm a bit long in the tooth and may be out of touch . <p> My experience while sitting on a TRB ( where we determined a stud 's fate ) and part of the Commander 's Review Process was that we would look at the stud 's training history and performance . Did the student have a history of failed rides ( not just check-rides ) . Were the busted check-rides one item busts or multiple item busts . We also looked at the student 's training continuity . Did he/she fly regularly and receive continuity with IPs ? This stud is obviously on CAP and therefore should only be flying with a few IPs . Did the stud have personality conflicts with any IPs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick child , etc . ) . Finally and most importantly , we would get the opinion of the Flight CC/ and IP/IPs to hear how many extra flights it would take to get the student up to speed and if they felt the stud could complete UPT within the constraints of the syllabus . That was key . <p> I had one student that failed his initial contact check , then his 88 , and then 89 . They were all one item busts due to bone-head mistakes . His daily performance was good , but he would get check-ride-itis . After his 89 bust , I want straight to the SQ/CC ( good guy and Vietnam Vet ) and told him this student can make it , but the CRB would keep him out of the jet for too long . He went to the OG/CC with my opinion and OG/CC reinstated the student on the spot . The stud did not get any 87 flights to " practice " and I told him that he had the ability to pass , but this next 89 was last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including T-38s ) . I had other students I had to give a thumbs down , which was in the best interest of all . <p> If your friend his having a lot of trouble ( is he in T-6 's ? ) , it might be in his best interest to wash-out . Its hard on the ego , but if a person is not meant to fly then they should move on . Otherwise , its a lot of pain for the stud and the AF. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Circa 2003-2004 , it was practically impossible for a stud to wash out of UPT .... guys were getting reinstated from CRBs regularly . <p> It is possible to lawyer up for a CRB , and have a skilled lawyer go through the student 's gradebook and find every little " error " in training documentation . I know in my previous life as an AETC IP , we wrote gradesheets using wording that specifically made the grades bulletproof in such an instance , though , so YMMV as far as that route goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest RubberSideDown <p> I hear what you guys are saying .

Flying time is expensive , and every hour he eats up is one not available for someone else . Sure , with 50 extra hours and a dedicated IP , nearly anybody can get through , but that 's not the idea . There 's an expectation that you should be able to fly out the syllabus and succeed within a pretty narrow window . History says if you ca n't , you will probably continue to have problems the rest of your career , and that 's dangerous ... not just for him , but for the people around him . So , by the time you 've gotten to the 89 , you 've already had several extra flights and lots of extra help . A magic term or clever arguement is not the real issue . Its the long view that the decision maker has to take . <p> Here 's another angle I 've told before . My T-38 flight had three Guard/Reserve guys that were all , frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , lots of extra rides , extra hours or instruction , hours of extra sim practice on basics , and barely getting through . Nice guys , but just not particularly suited for flying . Two were going to F-100s , one to an A-37 unit . We tried to wash them out for their own good , but could n't . We finally asked the DO to write to their unit and recommend transfer to a crew aircraft to get some more time to " grow " . Two units refused , one unit agreed and put their guy in a KC-97 . Before unit upgrade training was over , one F-100 guy and the A-37 guy were dead . The KC-97 guy lived to a ripe old age . It is n't pleasant , and I hated to see guys lose their dream , but sometimes it 's necessary to " call a spade a spade " and sit someone down to save lives ! ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I hear what you guys are saying .

It 's a military program , although it is contracted through some companies like CAE . They have military and civilian instructors . <p> Laughlin was the last location for FWQ- and had it 's last class in 2012 . Aside from the Army guys , the AF had previously used it to spool up the AF UHT graduates back when that was a thing . <p> They could bring it back but it would be quite a bit easier is to just make a blanket ETP for Army pilots and non-rated AF aircrew . Apparently the- FWQ course did n't save them much money even though it involved less flying time . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many IPs felt like they were rushing the students through . To my understanding , the T-38 syllabus was no different than the regular UPT one ( a good thing in my opinion ) , but the T-1 syllabus allowed them to complete the training at their own pace- and leave early . <p> Having completed full- UPT myself , I 'm very glad I did . Not only are planes much different than helicopters , but the way the AF conducts it 's flying operations in general- is vastly different and far more complicated . It was invaluable to get the whole experience from the mindset of- a clean slate , - much like the guys with a lot of civilian time have to if they want to be successful in the AF . <p> At Laughlin I saw a 38 year old Buff WSO get through T-38s just fine and become a T-38 FAIP .

If they could find a way to make it truly more efficient than regular UPT then maybe it could help , - especially for the prior Army Fixed Wing guys . <p> My limited knowledge came from talking to the three Army pilots that applied to the U-2 program many years ago when I worked the inter service transfers for pilots from other Services . - They were helicopter pilots that had gone through the Army 's fixed wing qual. - Two were flying King Airs , and one was flying the ARL. - It 's been close to 15 years since that happened , and possibly a lot has changed ... and your post alludes to the fact that it has . -

Bottomline , pick an airplane based on lifestyle and not how it looks or the perception you have duting UPT ...

Is there that big of a demand for low level infiltration to land on a dirt strip and offload ? Could n't they roll that into the airdrop mission ? Not bashing , just curious . <p> As for the C-17 bases , you really ca n't go wrong at any ( except Altus , of course ) .

@@43195033 @3195033/ <h> Blood in stool <h> 16 posts in this topic <h> Guest trondhjem <p> Big questions here ... I did a search but could n't find exactly what I was looking for . <p> I am here at my training base for UPT and have noticed bright red blood in my stool twice . The first time was a week ago and it was a fair amount . Then today I noticed a little again but nothing like last week . When it happened last week I had worked out for two hours and then was outside in the heat for three hours when I started to get some stomach pains and then noticed the blood in my stool a short time later . <p> Now , I have been experiencing certain things like this for a couple years . ( No blood or not much to my knowledge in the past though . ) I went to the doctor a while back for these stomach " issues " and he told me that it was only constipation . However , now I am getting this bright red blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . I have always wondered if it was an ulcer but am not sure . ( I do also realize that this could be serious or should at least be checked out . ) <p> Here is the problem ... I start UPT in September and I do n't really want to go into the Flight Doc and say " Hey , I 'm thinkin that I might have an ulcer and oh yeah there is bright red blood in my stool every now and then too . So ... should I just start outprocessing now while you work on DQing me or what ? " <p> So ... I am wondering if I could keep this to myself until I have started UPT ? If I am already in training would my chances of dodging the DQ bullet be greater ? Or , is this something that might just go away and be ok ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I know this sounds funny , but my wife is a nurse and says that it could be this : anal fissures . Sometimes when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that could cause the bleeding . If you really want to ruin a friendship , have someone look at your bunghole and see if there are any anal fissures . I 'm not kidding you man , it may cause a lot of stress to go away . And if it is , I would n't suggest using a band-aid ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest trondhjem <p> Thanks for the replies . It could be a fissure but I am not sure . I do think that whatever it is that it is not external or at least " shallow " . I am pretty sure that wherever the bleeding is coming from that it is somewhat deep internally . Also , I do not believe that the blood is actually in my stool but more like it is around or on it when it passes . ( It has not happened again though . ) And , a couple of weeks ago when the " main event " happened with the bright red blood my stool was rather soft at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better but I really appreciate the advice that you have given . Also , when I eat bran flakes in the morning my life goes much better ... except for the sudden 11:00am dash for the pony . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest bugmn20 <p> I believe that if the bleeding were comming from somewhere deep internally it would be more of a dark color or even black . Since the blood is bright red it is more than likely something close to the exit point . Like Spinner said , it could be a fissure . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest trondhjem <p> Ok ... we 'll go with it being somewhere closer to the exit point . However , there are times when I have very dark stool . I think that it just might be because it has been in there longer due to constipation though . How can you tell the difference between dark stool from blood and dark stool that has been " aged " ? <p> Also , when this all happened the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was pretty bad ... kind of like a dull pain that was almost like I was really hungry but then it went away . Could it have just been from the heat and because I had had so much physical activity ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest cutlas44 <p> You 're making a big mistake in leaving your diagnosis to folks ( here ) with no medical background .

I 'm not going to tell a flight doc about this with all of the force shaping crap going on right now . <p> 3 . I do n't think that it is a serious problem because this has not happen much nor has it happened since the last time that I mentioned it . <p> 4 . I agree with Rainman . Doc 's can be bad for your career . I have heard of more than one case where people have been forced into early retirement from flying because of some anal flight doc that wo n't let something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM me and he had almost the exact same thing happen . He has been on codeine and he got this problem . Well , guess what I 've been on codeine and then had n't taken any for a while . The night before the bloody stool happened I took some more codeine because I could n't sleep and had a bad cough . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yeah , ' cuz self-medicating codeine is a good idea for a flying career too ... <p> He does n't start until September , I 'm sure he does n't know the self-medication rules yet . Besides , I do n't think you can go pick up codeine at the local Walgreens over the counter . <p> If he had it from a previous perscription , though , just laying around the medicine chest , different story . Got ta be careful ... codeine is a narcotic . Do n't go messing with that stuff unless it 's perscribed. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest awfltdoc <p> You 're making a big mistake in leaving your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That reflex is to rule out the few bad things this could be . In older folks 50+ it 's cancer until proven otherwise . In your age group , the news is typically better . Most often benign , easily treated conditions ... but not always . <p> Bloody mucous vs. blood on/in normal stool = can be more serious conditions . Not cancer , but inflammatory bowel diseases , etc . Tougher to treat and DQ . This typically is associated with abdominal cramps . Also , in younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you had one . <p> A wait and see approach is not out of the question here . If it keeps up , you just have to be checked out . The dangers of flying with this ongoing are real . I do not think this is a ticket to DQ and outta UPT . <p> Drink lots of water . Keep your stools soft . Do not spend excessive amounts of time on the toilet . No reading in the bathroom . See what happens .

It happens , and it is happening more with the likelihood of getting a fighter in its current downward spiral . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I suspect once the UAV bomb is dropped , there 's going to be a big push to avoid 38s . There will always be at least one or two guys who are die-hard fighter and want to at least take the chance , but I bet we stop seeing classes of 5+ guys wanting 38s really soon . In my friend 's class there 's 5 dudes that want helos . He said it sounds like most are changing their mind about 38s , including him . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If that 's true about the Tones getting UAVs , then I foresee helos and 44s becoming very popular . <p> Yeah , but at least with Tones you 'll probably have about a 1 in 15 chance of getting a UAV compared to the 1 in 3 to 1 in 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always wanted to fly fighters and never even thought I would consider not putting them first , but I 'm coming up on track select and it looks like I 'll be putting Tones first and 38 's second . Of course I would still love to fly fighters and it 's been tough letting go of that dream , but sometimes you just have to face reality . <p> Honestly I still think there are plenty of dudes that will still put them first because of the chance that they will get fighters . I know I 'm just not one of them . It 's more important to me to actually fly a real aircraft than to roll the dice on the 38 side and maybe get a fighter or maybe get a UAV . <p> 2 years ago dudes worried about dropping a buff out of 38 's which really is n't that bad because at least your still flying something and blowing shit up . Now this year dudes had to worry about dropping a U-28 or NSA which sucks , but is definitely doable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dudes are going to be facing UAV 's out of the 38 side and I just think that is where I personally draw the line . Yeah sure I would love to be able to say I 'm going to work my ass off in Phase 3 so I do n't end up with UAV 's , but the truth of the matter is you 're going into Phase 3 with 2 other dudes who are probably shit hot pilots and to say you 're going to be better than them is just impossible to say and not to mention would be arrogant and out of line . Some may be able to predict whether they have what it takes to get a 38 out of Phase 2 , but to be able to predict that you 're going to be number one in Phase 3 is bull $hit because you 're probably going to be with 2 other great pilots and chances are your scores might be very similar when it 's all said and done . <p> Anyways that 's my take on it . I really hope it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 38 side . It 's just not a chance I 'm willing to take , but in the end I wish them the best . <p> Edited June 23 , 2008 by FLY6584 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Good point on the chances . At least if you go T-1s you 've still got a pretty good shot at not getting a UAV , but I heard pretty much what you posted in the UAV thread , so chances are going to be " good " on the 38 side to get one . Sucks ...

I bet by the time you drop there is either a UAV track or T-1 's and 38 's will have a " equal " portion of the UAV 's . It wo n't take long before someone realizes sending the best studs to worst A/C does n't make sense + nobody will choose -38 's . <p> 2 . Do n't give up the dream ..... fighters are worth the effort and worth the chance . Unless you have always dreamed of flying a heavy ( some have , more power to ' em ) you need to roll the dice to fly -38 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hudand stick sounds cool , but there is a reason AMC guys are skipping the bonus and gettin the hell out .

Heavy dudes will argue but if you go the fighter track ... you can always go fly a heavy later on . If you go T-1 's .... the dream is over . <p> 4 . The 38 is the ticket . There are a TON of guys out there flying fighters who did n't get one out of 38 's back in the 90 's . When the fighter shortage happened , those guys got snatched up from C-130 's , C-141 's etc to go fly F-16 's . No T-1 guy has ever gotten to Xfer to fighters . <p> 5 .

Not a toned ( excuse the expression ) down civi beechjet . <p> I feel it 's necessary to add an additional , slightly different perspective on this post for all the newer guys on here . If your ultimate dream is to fly a fighter and everything else comes second to that , and after all the research of what they do ( tons of time briefing and debriefing from what my buds tell me ) and how the community is ( a lot of eating their young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you should definitely try and go 38 's . Just know that right now it seems as if only the top couple guys in each 38 track is getting a fighter right out of UPT and the UAV 's are on their way . <p> Most guys in phase II tend to change their minds at least once of what track they want to pursue ... and I 'll say that 's a good thing . Guys just need to know that there 's a lot more out there than getting a ' chance ' to fly a fighter ... heavies , 130 's , helos ... they all have their pros and cons , just like the fighters . One of my good buddies from Tweets once said ( doubt he coined the phrase ) " There is no such thing as bad tracks , just bad drops " . Every track adds its own flavor and it 's wise to learn as much as you can prior about what assignments can be dropped out of each track and what those assignments are really like . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else that you 've flown a single seat supersonic ' trainer ' ... I think that 's pretty . Pick the track that makes the most sense to you . You can lay everything you have on the line for a chance to fly a fighter , but the reality is that unless you 're in the top few ( if that ) , that 's all you 're going to get to say ... " I got to fly a 38 for 6 months " . Now , I 'll caveat this by saying that there 's nothing at all wrong with getting bombers or the PC-12 's ... but it 's not that fighter you so desperately desired above everything else . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The problem with this so-called " rolling the dice " for the dream of flying a fighter is that when it does n't work out , the bitching starts . I 've seen it time and again that when someone takes a gamble and loses with the T-38 thing , they then turn around and start saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deserve a fighter ... why should I get a UAV , U-28 etc ... ? If you want to take a gamble , good for you ... but if it does n't work out , you knew the risk ... The face of the AF is changing ... The flavor of the week happens to be AFSOC , UAVs , the boring C-17 , etc ... It is time to start accepting it and realizing that entrance into the T-38 no longer necessarily endows you to fly a fighter . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The way I see it is , even if you do not get a fighter out of T-38 's , you have highly valuable training to fall back on in the future . If/when the JSF comes on line and they need pilots , you might have a chance at cross flowing ( 0% if you go heavies ) . Further , Guard/Reserve have hired heavy pilots without T-38 time , you 'll have a " chance " again at getting a guard/reserve fighter gig . It all comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fighter , know the facts and trends but do n't be scared by the stuff you ca n't control . TIMING . <p> For me , I want to fly fighters or AFSOC so U-28/NSA 's do n't worry me . Preds on the other hand are scary , but at the end of the day , you can still rest your head down at night knowing that you gave it your all and now are in the fight and doing more damage in one tour than a fighter guy does in his entire flying career . T-1 's would be nice but I want to do something in my AF career that I can not do in the civilian world and fighters or herks seem more closely aligned with that . I figure I 've got the rest of my life to worry about good deals . <p> Lastly , as trivial as it may sound , I do n't want my old man to be the only one in the family who 's flown the T-38 <p> Track select ( or as the navy calls it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see .

" I 've always known since I saw Top Gun like 69 times that being a fighter pilot ( a bro for all you shoe clerks out there ) was the ONLY real job in the Air Force . Seriously , going to " work " everyday in the 38 squadron , doing some killer boldface , getting stood up for some complex EP in front of my peers , is what being a pilot is all about . Then they let me fly a killer 50 year old , high performance , used-to-be-supersonic , afterburning , centerline thrust limited jet into a MOA for like 6-9 times a week ! Awesome ! This is what I dreamed about since I took my first shot of weed . We all know all those heavy guys barely scraped through all of their formal training programs . Getting 100 hours in a T-38 automatically makes you better than a heavy pilot with over 20 years of global flying experience . Plus you get shit tonnes of hours in U-28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to cross over for some lame flying ! <p> For all those SNAPs on the forum I 'm gon na include a list of some authorized bro aircraft as well as some dream killers : <p> BRO AIRCRAFT <p> 1 . F-15C- Ultimate bro machine . Do n't worry that most of the kills in this aircraft were made by the Israelis in the 1980s . With the new structural improvement program it should maybe last another 6-9 months . Plus I hear the naming parties are killer ! : rock <p> 2 . F-15E- Even though it drops bombs its still an Eagle therefore it kicks ass ! Its got LGBs , AAMs , nukes , knives , sharp sticks ... and a WSO you can yell at when you Over G. <p> 5 . U-28- Its like an airborne memorial to all the bros that got shafted on drop night . It might have a yolk and does n't require a type rating but at least you flew the 38 . <p> 6 . B-52- ....... <p> DREAM KILLERS <p> 1 . C-17- Its has a HUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wire system as complex as the B-2 , and can land over 170K lb of cargo in under 3,500ft . Remember though , its big , has four engines , and you had to fly the Toner to get there . Its the best option of the Dream Killers but I would n't be caught dead flying one . <p> 2 . C-130- The Four Fan Trash Can ! Its basically like flying a dump truck except the crews smell worse ! Even though its been shot at more than any pointynoise machines downrange it still means you could n't hack the fighter mentality . Plus it does n't have a G-Suit adaptor . Herks= Choke Yourself ! <p> 3 . KC-135s- Fighters only require tankers to be able to project our awesomeness at Red Flag . <p> 5 . C-5- This thing flies less than a 38 bro waiting for a IFF/RTU slot ( STS ) . <p> 6 . Helos- Just one question ... how do I get out of this chicken shit outfit ? ! <p> 6 . Any other aircraft not listed is also a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly a 38 regardless of the consequences . <p> For any of those bitter heavy drivers that will try to flame me , just realize you have you have a somewhat important mission projecting American power across the globe , and supporting our warfighters in austere environments . However , I have a date with destiny in the mighty T-38 Talon and any cadet worth his salt knows what I 'm talking about .

I also knew 2 H-1 pilots who were married and they had 3 assignments together before she got out ... again , much easier when you have the same airframe . <p> My personal opinion is that you have to determine both your #1 priorities--if it 's to get the airframe both of you want ( regardless of the other 's desire ) then it will be tough to live with each other unless you both want/receive the same airframe and it 's one of the more ' common ' aircraft dropped ( KC-135 's , C-17 's , etc ) . Either way , you 're rolling the dice as nothing in the AF is fair . <p> If you 're all about getting the same aircraft to increase the chances you will be stationed together , then I would definitely go T-1 's ( most common track select ) and then chose one of the more common aircraft that is typically dropped to the folks at the bottom half of the class ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a rough numbers assumption here ) . I think it 's smart to play the odds on this one if you want to live in the same location . <p> As you can see , IMO , it 's all about being able to live with each other ... else , why bother getting married if you 're in a constant long distance relationship ? To make the join spouse program work in your favor then you have to give AFPC/UPT assignment folks the best numbers to work with . Good luck . <p> My girlfriend and I are both going to be going to UPT ( 6 months staggered ) and we 're also planning on getting married .. I 've heard plenty of advice against it , but it 's going to happen . That being said , has anyone even heard of a successful pilot-pilot marriage ? What are the factors that would affect us ( air frame selection , deployments , etc ) ? Any info at all would be greatly appreciated . <p> There 's at least one KC-10 pilot-pilot marriage at WRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlapped while I was out there ) . I know there were a few at one point ; I have no idea if the others survived the deployment schedule/upgrade schedule/follow-on assignment shuffle . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I know 3 couples who are both U-28 pilots and they 've made it work so far despite numerous deployments/TDYs/etc . <p> One pair in particular was together during the later years of college , stayed together during UPT , both were able to drop U-28s ( about 9 months staggered from different UPT bases I believe ) and ended up in the same squadron . That 's a lot of dice rolls but I guess they won . <p> I 'm sure it can be done ( 2 pilots , just regular mil-to-mil ) , but I 'm damn glad my wife is able to tag along with me at a moment 's notice wherever the Wizard decides to send me next . <p> Good luck to ya ... if you guys are determined to make it work you can just have a clear head about the obstacles ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nsplayr <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've seen it work 135 to 135 ( 3 times ) and 135 to F-15 ( twice ) . 5 out of 5 seemed to be doing fine , but in two the cases one of the spouses either got out or is looking to get out . The other option is for you both to go RPAs , since those are easy to get . As stated earlier , your best bet is to try and go for airframes and locations considered less desirable . Good luck .

We never had a meeting with our flight commander in T-38s but I just looked at the AETC Form 1122 ( Summary Performance Report ) in my flight records and saw my class ranking for phase III . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest yogibehr555 <p> There is definitely a large disparity between the top and bottom of the class . You generally know who is doing very well and who is sucking since checkride scores and busted are hot topics in the flight room . As far as the middle tier goes , it 's harder to tell but I do n't think track select results are often decided on one or two daily rides or an academic exam . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> A lot has to do with commander 's ranking , too . Do n't be a jackass and be a good officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine here . Take it from a class SRO ... Jackassery ( like buffoonery , but on a much grander scale ) will get you to the basement faster than anything . <p> Like Ryan was saying , the top guys will be evident and the bottom dwellers will be as well . <p> Where you stand should become self-evident . If it does n't , you might be at the bottom . <p> In slight disagreement with Ryan , there will be a large group in the middle of the pack with mere tenths of percentage points between them . The difference between what you do want and what you do n't want may be the difference between a Stan Test or an academic test pass or bust . <p> I 've seen it happen . Happened to me at nav school . Twice . Everything worked out and I have had nothing but positives come out my career thus far ( which is another topic altogether ... be happy wherever you go ) . At the time , however , it really kind of sucked . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't do the best you can , you can only blame yourself . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We were told at the 1/2 way point in tweets , 1/2 way through T-1s , and the day before graduation ( although the results of assignment night give you a pretty good clue before that ) . <p> In my experience , the top and bottom of our class were pretty well settled by performance . The middle was the area of contention , and I believe that 's where the Flt/CC ranking had the most impact . There were people who got great assignments when their flying skills did n't justify it - but their good attitude and work ethic did . <p> The other intangible is ' group attitude ' . As a class/flight , if you have a good work ethic and positive can-do attitude , the flight commander is going to be more willing to make trades and go to bat on your behalf . If you 're a bunch of whiners that think everything should be handed to them , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your flt/cc will trade away your good assignments . ) Our flt/cc made some great trades - getting 9 of 12 active duty one of their top 3 choices . It would have been only 4 or 5 of 12 if he had n't done anything . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Having sat on both sides of this , I can give a little perspective from the instructors . <p> As Ryan said , your flight commander should give you a mid-mass rank where he ranks you as top , middle , or bottom third . I do n't believe it 's mandatory , though , because we skipped it several times just due to being so busy . On the final ranking , he should give you your actual position in the class ( if not , it will go on your 1122 as Ryan said ) . <p> And like PAB and Bergman mentioned , the top and bottom are usually obvious with the middle being the difficult ones to decide . The rankings usually involve all the instructors in the flight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , then picking the bottom one or two . On occassion , we 'd argue for over an hour trying to rank order the last four or five guys . This is where your attittude and ' officership ' comes into play . Neal and Bob may be running neck and neck until IP #1 says , " Yeah , well what about when Neal aced his formation checkride and did n't pass the info to any of his buds , and somebody hooked for the same EP . " Wham , Neal goes to the bottom . Also , IPs are very aware of things you may not realize - I could n't stand dudes who brown nosed us , then were dicks to their classmates . Straight to the bottom of the pile . <p> Also , we 've ranked people in that middle portion based on what type of aircraft it would get them . If a guy was good enough to graduate , but we really did n't think he belonged in a fighter , we 'd rank him so he 'd get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the top people in the top , and the bottom in the bottom ? Were the top people just naturally good pilots ? Did the bottom folks just have bad work ethics or attitudes ? <p> Because the highest rank scores come from daily and check rides , the people at the top were generally the best pilots and the people at the bottom were ... not . <p> That being said , a $hit-hot pilot with a crappy attitude ( negative or arrogant ) can find himself knocked down from that top spot by flight commander ranking and thrashing for one of the middle spots . Conversely , I 've seen guys who really were n't great sticks , but they made it up into the top half because they had great attitude and determination and/or they displayed lots of team attitude and helped out their classmates when they themselves may have been struggling . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Having also sat on both sides of this , let me give add to what Toro had to say . <p> -As a student , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process - concentrate on what you have control over - your own performance . What I mean is stuff outside of the cockpit . It 's all common sense , but to reiterate : have a good attitude- be positive no IPs are going to put up with a bad attitude or a whiner . Also , be a BIG team player - help out your flight , pass on the gouge , help the weaker guys , etc . Lastly , put out a BIG effort - never , ever , let it seem that you did not give over 100% whether it be for a test , flight , additional duty , snacko , whatever - what I mean is that perception is everything -- you do not want to be perceived as the guy that does n't give a crap or that puts in minimal effort ... I know this sounds trite , but it is dead on accurate . <p> I have seen the whole spectrum of " bad attitudes " as a student and IP -- complaining about being behind ( i.e. not flying ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to beat them ; disrespectful / unofficerlike ; late for class/flights ; the list goes on and on . Hope this proves helpful ... 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> How big of an impact do your test scores in phase I have on your track select ? <p> Flying scores are more important than test scores . Somebody who has seen the layout more recently than me can give specific percentages , but it was something like 40% checkride , 30% daily ride , 20% commanders ranking , 10% test scores . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Toro 's percentages looked right to me . Do n't forget that the 10% academics includes all of your EPQs ( we took 18 in tweets and 16 in T-1s ) , so it 's not ALL about tests . I will try to dig out my syllabus and see if it breaks down what percentage EPQs are of that 10% overall . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest C17Heavy <p> Toro and Baseops have given you a great insight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had when I was in UPT . Of course I 'm guard so the process did n't affect me like it does active duty pilots . Having said that , there was less induced stress put on me while in UPT . I watched a couple of my active classmates stress themselves out by worrying about the mass rankings . I understand that your class ranking in the mass severely impacts the rest of your career , and that everyone wants to finish at the top . However , stressing over it will just drive you crazy . If you approach UPT with a good attitude , professional officership , superior teamwork , and a high willingness to take instruction , you will be at the top . Be the stud that all the IPs want to fly with ! ( that 's how you get the all important high commander 's ranking ) If you are , you will be towards the top ! Do n't worry about the mass ! I know that is allot easier said than done , but if you can somehow put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ) you will be much happier and will perform better . Do your best in the areas you have direct control over ( academics , EPQs , ground evals , etc .. ) , chair fly your a$$ off , and go fly the jet ! ! Have fun and let the cards fall were they will . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Anyone know how this voodoo grading system works , ie - what line items carry more weight , if they do ? It does n't really make a difference , I 'll track however I track , but everyone seems to say something else . Most of what I 've heard is that the checkrides count for more ( 40/25 split for the overall grade ) and that the GK/EP line items are weighted more heavily on a line by line basis , but nobody seems to know the specifics ... also whether it 's your relation to the MIF that picks up points or the raw grade ( ie - a G on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a G MIF item ) Just curious ... thanks = ) <p> Also , tried a search , but it turns out that searching for " MASS " is a bad idea ... ha ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> This is the pub that governs aircrew training . You wo n't need to reference it as a student , but some of the rules are only listed here . <p> As far as if stuff is weighted differently ( EP , GK , SA , etc ) ... I do n't know . That is what I was always told , but I never really cared to look it up . TIMS pukes out a number and that is what we used . However , I do remember looking at the points that TIMS gave for two students who both got a 2E on their checkride . One stud had more points ( slightly ) than the other . I guess that means that some stuff is weighted more heaily than others , but I do n't think that it is significant . <p> I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking and academics , while not a very large always played a huge part in deciding the track select assignments . For example , a class finished up about a week early and the FC sat down with all the IPs and went through FC rankings . One guy was #4 and one was #5 . We all decided ( the FC did anyway ) that the rankings were accurate . After putting in the FC rankings , the #4 guy got the last T-38 slot and the #5 guy did n't get the -38 . The MASS difference was something like .00069 points between the two . We decided to reverse the FC ranking on both just to see what happened and yes , TIMS said the other guy should get the -38 . Point is , even though it might be a smaller percentage of the mass , do n't blow it off . Do your best at everything you do ( but this is something your Dad should have taught you a long time ago ) . I 've seen many of these type situations ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We were shown the exact thing Franchise posted back in T-6s prior to track . So that 's the math you should go by , but like Tweet said , FC ranking can make a big difference , even though it 's " only " 20% . If the FC ranks you high and your grades are n't in the shitter ( which they 're most likely not if you 're ranked highly to begin with ) , then you 'll probably get what you want . You can have good scores and a low FC ranking and you will probably not get what you want . I saw both situations when I went through UPT ... the guys who worked hard , helped others , volunteered for stuff , etc. had a better relationship w/ the IPs and thusly were ranked higher . The FC will usually try to hook up the studs he saw working hard and helping others . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The first 6 guys in my class was separated by less that .01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , but the Capt navigator in our class had served on a hard crew in BUFFs with the Flt CC for two years . The Flt CC moved the true #1 dude who had busted one ride in UPT down just enough in his rating to allow the Capt to finish #1 , despite a 17 down grade " I " check bust . <p> The really sad thing , the dude who should have been #1 wanted a B-52 from day one ... he lived BUFFs , he finished #2 and in the days of the banking system , there were no B-52 's as he ended up picking 9th in the overall draft ( five UPT bases and we picked 4th ) . He got a KC-10 which the #3 wanted , did his time then separated , it truly fvcked the entire class . <p> Perhaps that is why only 5 of 26 dudes in my UPT class are still in the USAF , including the Nav who should not have finished #1. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> That 's just a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . One stud gets the hard check pilot while the other gets the easy check pilot ( sts ) . Some fly an important ride on a perfect day while another has to deal w/ bad weather and a SOF wx recall ( SA gone ) , etc . It 's happened since day one of UPT 's existence and should be accepted as part of the deal . Do n't complain or use stuff like that as excuses ; there 's no such thing as one person getting " screwed " by stuff like this and another not . Everyone has to deal w/ this kind of stuff at points , so who cares , it 's all fair in the end . The phrase , roll with the punches , is the best way to look at UPT . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> How does this MASS mumbo-jumbo play out for Guard/Reserve UPT fighter folk . Because they already have an airframe , do they have to concern their selves with it , or just pass ' and off to -38 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437700 <p> I 've always heard guard/reserve guys have to be in the top 50% of their class in Phase II to continue to 38s . So yes , your MASS does matter ( as long as what I 've read/been told is still true ) . Someone correct me if I 'm wrong . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> That 's still the way it works in a some flights . A lot of classes end up with a bell curve scenario with a couple folks with stellar Mass scores and a couple poor scores . Those in the middle generally are separated by tenths of a point , which is great for the FLT/CC . Some FLT/CCs get together with thier IPs , rank the class according to non-flying score attributes like professionalism , officership , attitude , etc . Most of the time , that ranking mysteriously parallels graded scores . Other times , that ranking gets adjusted several times and the computer program spits out several reports until the FLT/CC is satisfied that most studs get what they want/deserve . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them more FAIPable . Example : Some SQ/CCs may have a policy that the #1 guy always gets what he wants and FAIPs must come from the top third - FLT/CC ranking can move someone into or out of that range . FLT/CC ranking can be used to mitigate checkride scores , based on whether he thinks a stud either got the shaft , or had it easy . Some FLT/CCs will spend hours trading with other bases to get the aircraft his studs want . Some do get hosed , but in the end , I 'd say most people end up very happy with their assignment . I 've seen classes where everyone got a top-3 choice , but never one where more than 1/2 to 2/3 did not . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest momann <p> I 've always heard guard/reserve guys have to be in the top 50% of their class in Phase II to continue to 38s . So yes , your MASS does matter ( as long as what I 've read/been told is still true ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think you 're right . <p> Two guys from my guard F. W. got sent back because one could not stay ahead or with the T 38 and the other did not perform well ( meet standards for -38 track ) before track . He busted a few rides , great academics and was given a second chance but could not save himself . Both came back to the wing and found some heavy unit that took them . 
@@43195041 @3195041/ <h> 18 posts in this topic <p> I need some help with supervision of a GS civilian . The background is that I am an Air Force O-4 at a Navy command . There is a civilian ( GS-14 ) who has been in her position for about 8 years . It is known in the command that she is completely incompetent , but because she is a minority she is afforded specific privileges . Additionally , she has filed a EO complaint and has ' whisteblower ' status which has made it significantly more difficult to give her honest feedback because it could be seen as retributional . <p> She currently works directly for an O-6 and has three employees ( GS-10 , E-6 , E-5 ) . There is some discussion about her PD ( position description ? ) that dictates she is in a supervisory role . <p> The bottom line is that the CO is terrified of an EO complaint and is risk adverse when it comes to punishment . I 'm trying to make a case to have her report directly to me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My question is whether or not I can directly supervise a GS-14 ? Further , does it matter what her PD is ? If so , what factors do I need to see in her PD that would make me ineligible ? <p> If anyone has SA to this , experience with , or more importantly a source document I can reference , that would be optimal . I 'll be more than happy to provide more info if required . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yes , O-4 can supervise a GS-14 . I do believe that the supervision must be inline with the PD , though . Meaning , if her PD has her as a flight commander , you would have to be in a position above that in order to supervisor her , like a DO . I would highly recommend consulting the civilian personnel office , they usually have a good handle on what is or is n't appropriate . For all you know , her current PD might say something totally different that what she is actually doing and her job may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which case you may have the opportunity to put her in a closet . I have seen this happen multiple times . Civilian employee gets tired of being jerked around and starts telling people to ###### off because their duties have nothing to do with the actual PD . Additionally , just because she may be coded as a supervisor does n't mean she has to supervise anyone . <p> Bottom line to your initial question , yes , O4 can supervise GS-14 . Whether or not you can write on them will depend on the PD and you should get with the pers office for details on that . Sometimes a " supervisor " and their official rater are two different people . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It sucks , but more circumspect methods are easier to deal with in staff bureaucracy .

The assignment is very prestigous . It is also very very busy ( depending on the President and what his travel preferences are ) . They are gone from home alot , and fly on other aircraft besides AF1 . I do n't know much about the pilot side , specifically , as my friend on AF1 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual job , the crew stays in the same hotels that the president does , you eat the same food on the airplane as the president ( on real **25;1833;TOOLONG no less ) and have the opportunity to meet some very interesting people . <p> From a pilot perspective , I do n't know if there is a rank requirement or not , but I know that when I asked about it , most of the pilots were Lt. Col 's or Col 's . The E-4 might be a good stepping off point . <p> If you are not currently flying in your MWS ( i.e. , on staff , flying as a UFT instructor in AETC , or flying in OSA ) you should have a minimum of two operational MWS tours ( equivalent to 6 yrs in an MWS ) . <p> If you are flying in an MWS you will be released based on your qualifications and manning requirements in the system . <p> Officers should expect return to a MWS rated requirement ( could be PME or staff ) after an assignment to the 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it true that if you Q3 any checkride ( outside of UPT of course ) you 're automatically disqualified from being a pilot in the unit ? <p> Not true .

Its basically SERE , just without the resistence and escape field part ( though we got the academics ) . Here 's some things off the top of my head to bring in the field : <p> - a notebook and pencil . Not just to take notes , but also to write your thoughts , etc down when you 're bored in some concealment position and ca n't talk to anyone . It gets very dreary out there , so you are going to want to keep your mind active . <p> - moleskin for blisters . I 'm sure most of us have boots that fit , but you 'll be in and out of water most likely and all that walking does n't help . The best thing to use is a product called Compeed . You can find it at an local drug store . <p> - a bible . Even if you are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can bring to read . Like the notepad , it will give you something to keep your mind occupied - even if you do n't agree with the storyline . I do n't consider myself a religous person , but I brought one anyway just so I 'd have something to read . This is definetely a personal preference issue though . <p> - a ton of those elastic BDU blousing straps with the velcro . These things have a ton of uses , and you 'll find they come in handy . <p> That 's what I can remember off the top of my head . If I think of more I 'll post them later . The main thing with SERE is apply the training you receive , and get friendly with your classmates - they are all you have in the field . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Pilot135 <p> Sure , I 'll add my 2 cents ...

Powerbars , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an MRE for the last night in the field BEFORE you get " captured to go to the RT camp . You 'll know when that is .

This is all in addition to the survival training you get at UPT during academics . And as to which planes have chutes , most or all fighter/bombers have ejection seats .

Of course I owned them prior to , I would n't have bought them just for that . <p> I would n't go buy anything- except MAYBE a Camleback- and even then , find the cheapest , no frills model so it will fit under your ALICE pack . <p> A lot of people say headlamps , but pop on your BDU cap and see if your little issued maglight will fit in there with your enormous mellon- if it does that will work just as well . Having said that , a lamp is only like $5 , not exactly breaking the bank . <p> They will give you knives , matches , rabbits , tent makin stuff , MREs , etc ... I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of things you COULD take , remember you 'll be humping it all out and back and REPACKING it every morning .

Many people did just fine with a FS the whole time , but I 'm glad I did n't for one reason . Every camp site had a SH*Thole . Not a privy or crapper or anything else , just a hole in the ground full of sh:t ( one exception was filled just shy of overflowing with a 50/50 mix of water and sh:t ) . I liked being able to remove my top and only have to worry about keeping my balance over the hole , not wheather or not I was dragging my sleeves ... 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I went into an outdoor store and the guy hooked me up with some poly socks to go under my wool socks . They are paper thin and it is like having mole skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my squad without blisters . Also I bought one of those little LED lights that attach to a key chain or ziper . They work great , unless you lose them like I did on the second night . Jolly Ranchers are good , so are sunflower seeds . Do n't bring them though unless your instructor says it 's OK . You would n't want to have to come back and start all over because of something stupid like bringing food you wer n't authorized . The most important thing to bring in my opinion is baby wipes .

I went 3 weeks after finishing AMS and I would suggest it if your unit will send you . A new class starts at Fairchild every Monday and the course is 17 days straight . The POC for this is probably your training manager at your unit , but the person that issues the dates is ( or used to be ) Sgt. Rico ? at the Guard Bureau . One reason that they might not send you to SERE before UPT is if you washout of UPT then they have wasted even more money on you ... and it happens more times than you would think . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Bullmastiff <p> Quick question ..

Five of the seven courses are taught at Fairchild . The other two courses are conducted at Naval Air Station Pensacola , Florida and Eielson Air Force Base , Alaska . <p> Combat Survival Training ( S-V80-A ) , which all Air Force aircrew members must attend , is conducted by the 22nd Training Squadron . Forty-nine classes are taught per year , with each class lasting 17 days . The majority of the course is taught at Fairchild ; however , six days are spent in the mountains of the Colville and Kaniksu National Forests , approximately 70 miles north of Fairchild . Instruction at Fairchild begins with classroom training on the physical and psychological stresses of survival . This is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , various life support of equipment procedures , survival medicine , and recovery device training . Students then transition to the mountains where they receive additional training including shelter construction , food procurement and preparation , day and night land navigation techniques , evasion travel and camouflage techniques , ground-to-air signals , and aircraft vectoring procedures . Finally , students are returned to Fairchild and given training in conduct after capture . <p> The SERE Specialist Course ( S-V81-A ) , conducted by the 66th Training Squadron , is also taught at Fairchild . This is a five-and-one-half-month program designed to teach future survival instructors how to instruct aircrew members to survive in any environment . The course includes instruction in basic survival , medical , navigation skills , overland travel , evasion , arctic survival , teaching techniques , rough land evacuation , coastal survival , tropics/river survival , and desert survival . Basic survival , navigation skills , overland travel , evasion , and teaching techniques are taught in the Colville National Forest ; arctic training is conducted on Calispell Mountain near Cusick , Wash ; desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , Wash. ; rough land evacuation is conducted near Tum-Tum , Wash. ; tropics/rivers survival is taught in the Olympic National Park , Wash. ; and coastal survival is conducted on Tillamook Bay off the Oregon coast . <p> The third course conducted at Fairchild is the non-ejection water survival course ( S-V90-A ) which trains aircrew members of nonparachute-equipped aircraft . The course lasts two days and includes instruction in signaling rescue aircraft , hazardous aquatic life , food and water procurement , medical aspects of water survival and life raft procedures . Group and personal survival are stressed throughout the course . <p> The fourth course is the underwater egress course ( S-V84-A ) . The 66th Training Squadron conducts the one day course for U. S. Air Force helicopter and designated Department of Defense aircrew members . The course covers the theories and principles needed to safely egress from a ditched aircraft . <p> The final course conducted by Fairchild is the SERE Sepcialist , 7-level upgrade course ( J3ACP1T071000 ) ) . This 19 day course , conducted annually , provides 5-level instructors with advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and open-ocean environments . Training is conducted at Eagle Summit , Alaska ( arctic ) ; Yuma Proving Grounds , Arizona ( desert ) ; Schofield Barracks Military Reservation , Oahu , Hawaii ( jungle ) ; and the Gulf of Mexico based out of Pensacola NAS , Florida ( open ocean ) . Instructors spend three to four days in each environment learning and applying skills required for surviving with minimum gear and support . <p> Arctic Survival Training ( S-V87-A ) is taught by Detachment 1 , 66th Training Squadron at Eielson AFB , Alaska . This is a five-day course conducted from October through March , and it is designed for aircrews assigned to flying duties in the northern regions . Instruction concentrates on food and water procurement , thermal shelter construction , firecraft , and various signaling techniques . This course prepares individuals to cope with the harsh arctic environment and familiarizes the student with cold weather survival equipment and procedures . <p> A second water survival course , parachuting ( S-V86-A ) , offered by the Survival School is conducted by Detachment 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course lasts four days and simulates in-flight over water emergency . The course centers its training on aircrews which utilize parachuting as the primary means of escape . Instruction includes initial academic training , parachute equipment procedures , parachute drag training , post egress and recovery training which includes a deep water landing , and a one to two hour raft familiarization exercise .

Minimize the BS and still get the career you want . Feel sorry for your ROTC ( to an extent ) and Academy peers that you got to the same place they did without all that pain . <p> Going to have to disagree with you there . Not knocking our Guard and OTS bros , but personally I think the ROTC/Academy gigs are the better routes if you 're shooting for the pilot gig . All will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just looking at the numbers the majority of slots are allocated to those two paths . But I will admit I 'm a little biased , I enjoyed my ROTC tour . In fact it 's pretty much what kept me at my school , you just got ta look past the BS and enjoy the opportunities it does provide you . Just my .02 though . Now as to deciding where you want to go , I completely recommend basing that off your school preference first and foremost . Not the Det or the awards they have recieved . Especially since most if not all ROTC Detachment awards are based of the queepy admin side of the house . As opposed to the daily cadet life it provides . In fact I would even argue that aspect is n't really even taken in to consideration . I just know that I have plenty of bros here on the active duty side of the house that had an amazing college experience at schools without any fancy awards or " noteriety " , and guess what ... they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say I did n't enjoy my time , I just think I would have really enjoyed goin to a large D-I school . Anyways , just some ramblings for those of you up in the air . Take it or leave it , and see ya on the other side ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Not sure if this has been brought up , but I do n't think people have brought up the importance of a good cadre . I have personally seen and dealt with cadre that make ROTC more than something it should be . You can get the grades , put in your face time , and rock at PT , but if the cadre does n't care for you for who knows what reasons they can make your chances slim to none at getting what you want . <p> Say for instance the det here . When I came in their was 4 cadre . The WC was a NAV and a graduate from the AFA . He was the only guy that 's belonged to an air crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He knew everything about the AF and was a very successful WSO with over 2,500 flt hours in 3 different platforms . Unfortunately , he 's recently retired and been replaced by a former S&amp;M junkie . <p> The other cadre was made up of fat bitter comm officers that hated their previous position and came to AFROTC to tell us to run faster and get better grades . The countless times they would try and talk people out of wanting to be pilots got extremely annoying . Every time someone said they wanted to be a pilot , they 'd roll their eyes like it was an expected reply . Not mention the constant reminder that the AF mission has changed , bla bla bla . <p> I 'm all for choosing a school you want to go to , have fun , and go for what you want , but I would suggest to anyone wanting to go the ROTC route . Go visit the det first and have a one on one talk with the cadre and maybe get a idea of what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your future and that you desire to be an officer but that being a pilot is what you want . Doing that in a respectful , non-toolish way may go a long way to help your stay be more tolerant and prosperous . It was n't until my second year as a 200 that I really got to start knowing the WC and building a better relationship where we 'd actually talk music , movies , and so on . It helps to be known and liked . <p> Good luck to anyone going ROTC .

Are we at the mercy of a new commander who could potentially shit shaft us on what we are gunning for ? <p> More or less , you are . Hopefully , your current commander will relay his rankings/thoughts on the different cadets and the new guy will go with that . But there is always the possibility that the new guy will totally disregard the old commander 's opinion and do his own thing <p> This happens all the time in ROTC and in the real AF . You just have to roll with the punches and figure out what the new commander likes/dislikes.

I did n't see any guidance in AFI 36-2205 beyond the necessary items . <p> Additionally , I was looking back at a post from 2003 that talked about a " cover letter " for the package . I did n't see that in the AFI either ... did any of you submit a cover letter ? If so , what did you put on it . <p> Thanks for the help . <p> MK <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest r6pilot <p> Did you get anything from the contact at the squadron outlining what they want ? Usually there 's some direction in there . It would probably be a good idea to call them and ask what they want in it and how they want it sent . <p> In the ones I did n't get much direction from , I put them in logical order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If your trying to go Active Duty , you need to apply to OTS first . Once you get accepted to that , then you go through their little boot camp deal which is when you would throw your name into the hat for UPT selection . This is tough seeing as OTS slots have been cut back drastically in the last couple years , which also means you have to be extremely competitive in your class to make sure you qualify to get one of the few UPT slots awarded to your class . I 'm not an OTS guy so you may want to do a little more research on it seeing as I could be a little off on exactly how the process works . <p> If your trying to go to UPT via the Guard or Reserve , then you contact the squadron(s) that you wish to apply to and talk to them about when their next UPT boards are and what kind of information , format , due date , etc that they like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I may be a little off on this as well but I 'm sure there 's other people who can clarify anything I may have missed in trying to explain this . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You need to talk to your Sq or GP exec for guidance on the application process . It basically works like this : 1 ) take the TBAS , AFOQT &amp; fill out your 215. 2 ) Send it up for your Sq/CC to review and rank you 3 ) Sq exec sends it up to the GP/CC then WG/CC to get review and then you 're rack and stacked at the WG level . 4 ) WG sends it up the chain and eventually ends up at AFPC . You do n't submit anything yourself . As far as how to package it ... just make it look professional . Your WG exec might have some tips for you . <p> Flyaf05 is correct that you should give your package to your sq exec and then they 'll foward it up the chain and send it to AFPC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to write the bullets for your sq commander and wg commander on the second page . The deadline for complete applications to AFPC is 14 Nov so you really need to get the ball rolling . <p> I was our sq exec last year and put together our squadron 's applications . This is how we put ours together.The package should be in the standard blue AF folder with a Staff Summary Sheet on top . The package should have five tabs inside : 1 . AF form 215 2 . ADSC letter ( ATCH 3 TO AFI 36-2205 ) 3 . SF 88/93 ( Flying Class 1 Physical and Medical History ) 4 . Copy of Private Pilot 's License and last page of logbook 5 . LORs . You can separate them with cardstock and use clips to attach to the folder . You should also include a 3.5 floppy that has your electronic version of 215 and any LORs . Hope that helps . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest txnative <p> For anyone out there that just went through the UPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your application packet ready ?

Also , what were the application requirements for your unit ? what were they looking for to be in a complete package to be considered ? Thanks in advance for any information . <p> I 'm in the process of putting my package together right now as well , but for the AD board first . I do n't think you 'll have time to put it together unless you 've already taken the AFOQT as you have to schedule the time for it and it generally takes 2-3 weeks to get your scores back . I contacted my recruiter back in January but did n't really start putting stuff together until about 3 weeks ago . I expect that my package will be complete by the end of July . If you really hustle , you can get stuff together in just a couple of weeks ( not including the AFOQT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average time to get a package together is about 3-4 months . This is based off of the time you first contact your recruiter and when you get it all finished . I took longer because my daughter was born and I wanted to wait till I had time to properly study for the AFOQT . <p> But like Getzen2 said , it can be done much faster if you really need it . Start hustling and you just might make it in time . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest CA <p> Toro consolidated this thread some and since I just finished my application process , I wanted to write up a detailed brief of what I did so fellow noobs applicants can get a better idea of what is expected . Just to be clear , this was for an Active Duty Rated Board Application from a civilian with no prior service . This will be kinda lengthy because I want to be rather detailed . Just note your experience will vary , but the events are the same . <p> Timeline - Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recruiter until my package was completed was 9 months . It can certainly take a lot less time but since I was having our first child in the middle of it all , I started early . January I called my recruiter . April I started studying for the AFOQT . Middle of June I took my AFOQT . End of June I took my TBAS . Middle of August I went to MEPS , end of August I did my Officer Interview , and in 6 days my package will arrive at the board . So in actuality it took 5 months . <p> Some of the big check points along the way are AFOQT , TBAS , MEPS , and Officer Interview , in that order . These are the 4 things that you have to do that will require you going somewhere . I never even saw my recruiter till my Officer Interview - did it all on email/phone . While you 're doing your testing and stuff , you need to be working on getting your Letters of Recommendation , Applicant Profile , Personal Statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . ( See attached form " APPLICATION CHECKLIST OFFICER PROGRAMS " ) <p> After I met with my recruiter I was given a checklist of things to get ( See attached form " Personal Interview Record " page 12 ) . I went through and got everything together in a folder . Not everything on that checklist is going to apply to you , JROTC/ROTC Certificate for example , most of you wo n't have one . After you fill out that application and gather all the forms , send it to your recruiter and they 'll get you in the system . <p> Next step is the AFOQT . Depending on the type of person you are , you 'll want to give yourself an appropriate amount of time to study . For me I had been out of HighSchool for 6 years when I took it so I had a hard time with the simple math and general science stuff . Take at least 4 weeks to study . I studied for about 2 months . You 'll want to buy or check out an AFOQT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Military Flight Aptitude Tests book . It has everything for the updated AFOQT in it and it was invaluable . If you know nothing about flying , it 's helpful , but I would also suggest picking up the Jeppesen Private Pilot manual and study up . I 'm sure that I only got about half of the Aviation Information section right because I just did n't know enough about the details of flying . I got the Jeppesen book afterward and have since learned a lot more . So grab the study book , read through it a couple times and take one of the practice tests . See where you need to study and do some specific studying . Search the internet for things that you 're struggling with and find more study material . One book is n't going to have all of the answers . Take the 2nd test and see where you stand . Keep taking them , even if you remember the answers . It will help you remember the style and format of the questions . <p> After you get the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can schedule your TBAS . Since the TBAS is super secret and nobody is allowed to talk about it , you can just visit their website and get information on about 80% of the test . Silly , I know . Search for TBAS on this forum and read up . Also check out the info on Wantscheck.com , same stuff as the first link but with an extra picture . The only way to really practice for the TBAS is to go buy a joystick ( again search around the forums for where they talk about the right joystick to get ) and practice using it while inverted ( pushing forward on the joystick makes the reticule move down ) and playing first person shooters like Quake or Unreal Tournament or whatever fancy new games are out these days . It 'll help you practice tracking with a reticule using a joystick . <p> OK . Once you have the AFOQT , TBAS , and all of your documents together and to your recruiter , he/she can schedule you for your MEPS physical . If you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look to see what the closest MEPS to you is and have your recruiter schedule you there . I drove an hour to my nearest MEPS as opposed to the MEPS that was near him which was 2 hours from me . You have that option , use it . When you go to MEPS you can either stay at the MEPS hotel the night before and get some breakfast in the morning or you can drive yourself there . If the MEPS in on a base where you need an I 'd card .. well , I do n't know , I have an I 'd so I just drove myself in . Work that out with your recruiter . If you 're already in your mid-20 's , the MEPS hotel might not be for you since most of the folks going to MEPS with you will me teenagers coming out of highschool , but your choice . <p> MEPS is an experience . If you 've had no interaction in a military setting , you 'll get an idea of what it 's going to be like while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and gather in a large room . You 'll get a short brief then you 'll file into your branch 's liaison office . Obviously you 'll be going to the AF office . You 'll see a long line for the Army , a little bit longer for the Marines and Navy , then the AF will have no more than about 10 , and then a couple for the Coast Guard . You 'll more than likely be the only person going for an AF commission . After this you 'll start your tests . You have a Hearing Test , Vision Test ( Color blindness and visual acuity ) , Blood Pressure test , an actual Physical Exam ( prepare to lose some dignity ) , a physical test where you have to do certain things like stand on one leg , walk like a duck , etc. , they 'll draw blood and you 'll pee in a cup . If you do drugs , do n't join the military , but if you insist , do n't do anything for a couple months before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't drink at all the day before you go . The last thing you want is to be DQ 'd for having drugs or alcohol in your system . You 'll live , I promise . For a commissioning physical you 'll probably be done before noon since you do n't have to stay to swear in and get your job . Plan accordingly . <p> After MEPS your recruiter will schedule you for your Officer Interview . You will have to fill out a questionnaire ( see attached form " Interview Questions " ) . This form may vary depending on the Recruiting Squadron Commander you get , I 'm not sure . But it 'll at least get you started . The Interview is the only chance you get to have a more personal touch to your application . Everything else is going to be very factual and to the point so the interviewing officer will be getting to know more about you and what you are about . He/she will then write up their own recommendation to the board on your behalf . My suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident in yourself and your answers , be comfortable , say " Yes Sir / No Sir " when responding , think about your answers while he 's still asking the question . Try not to say " Um , Uh , wellllll ... " Speak clearly and maintain eye contact . Have questions written down to ask . There is a 99% chance the recruiter will not be a former rated officer and wo n't have specific answers about pilot stuff , though they 'll have a general idea . More or less ask questions about OTS , being an officer in general , Air Force life , etc . Feel free to ask questions about rated stuff , but do n't expect detailed answers . <p> At this point you should be done , or at least 98% done with your application process . The recruiters will do a few things , maybe call you again and ask more questions , but you should be done . <p> The Form 56 ( Go to http : **26;1860;TOOLONG , search titles for " 56 " , it 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as it 's also referred to sometimes as your Personal Statement , should be filled out prior to going to your officer interview . You will need the proper viewer to open this form LONG ... Fill it out and send it back in . Make sure you spell check your Personal Statement and it 's best if you have several people proof read it and give you suggestions . Even have an Air Force officer take a look at it if you can as they 'll know what to look for . The Personal Statement is where you get to " plead your case " if you will as to why you should be an Air Force Officer . It 's also been suggested that you take a sentence or 2 to explain some of your negatives , for example your low GPA or what not . Do your best to explain them but spin them in a positive way and show how you 've become a better person blah blah blah . Again , search around the interweb for more stuff on the personal statements . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by reiterating that you need to take your time ( if you can ) and do it right . Start early and have someone look over everything before sending it to the recruiter . This is your package , a reflection of you , make it as good as possible . Recruiters are there to either push the good candidates along or resist the bad candidates . If you feel your recruiter is stalling or is trying to tell you to enlist instead , you have 2 choices : Find another recruiter or convince your recruiter that you 're a good choice . If they 're slacking , take initiative yourself . You can schedule the AFOQT and TBAS without the recruiter . Find the nearest testing center and call them yourself to schedule . They will have to escort you on base if you do n't have an I 'd but that 's OK . I scheduled and took both tests without a recruiters help . MEPS and the interview you ca n't do on your own , but the rest you can . So do what it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms . They will find out . <p> PM or ask here if you have any questions . It 's all still fresh in my mind . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest IFRpilot <p> Wow CA thanks a lot for that detailed timeline .

But if I had to guess I would say the Army seems to be encouraging its troops to travel on commercial air in ACUs . Is this the result of yet another clever Army recruiting campaign ?

Seemed like maybe he 's been in 1.5 yrs , went and did 6 months in Iraq and now is billy badass . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The 're probably all business travelers who bought some DCU 's on e-Bay . They 've figured out that if you 're wearing a uniform , most airlines will upgrade you to first class if they have open seats . <p> If you are in uniform , ethics rules forbid you to accept upgrades to first-class due to the public perception problem . They do n't want the public to think that the military is paying for that ticket . You can see the 20/20 and 60 minutes shows that will come from that . <p> Anyway , the reason those dudes are walking around in ACUs is that they are traveling to/from the AOR . They are n't authorized any civilian clothes in the AOR . At least that 's the collective wisdom of the Army dudes in my office . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I saw a marine in his dress choker black uniform ( think they call them blues ) at a bar/club last night in Texas . Obviously he thought it was a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform ... b/c the chick he was with was just wearing jeans , so it 's not like they came from something formal . And he obviously did n't just get off work or something . This was also at 130 am . WTFO on that one . <p> The Marines and Navy have different rules , i.e. i know in some cases they are allowed to wear their dress uniforms out . I doubt sincerely that this guy fell under one of those catergories , but you never know . I usually just ask him why he is in uniform if its 130am ... unless he 's just minding his business . <p> I cant say I have n't found a quiet bar after a flight and had a beer with a buddy with the flight suit still on . But I made damn sure it was a slow night . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> He just did n't have that " new guy " look . Seemed like maybe he 's been in 1.5 yrs , went and did 6 months in Iraq and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . Either way , what a tool . <p> So what , exactly , is your hard on with this guy ? <p> He 's wearing his uniform in a bar . He 's in a different service . I do n't know the rules for Marines wearing their Class A uniforms but I do know that I have seen them wear them often . I also know that if they are wearing them wrong or if they are acting like idiots they are likely to be corrected by another Marine , even if that Marine has been out of the service for 20 years . Marines have pride in their service that they wear proudly on their sleeve for life . Every single marine knows the history of their service , something very few Airmen can say . I think that is awesome . <p> As for your comment about " went and did six months in Iraq and now is billy badass " all I can say is it WTFO ? <p> Why do you think it is appropriate for you to talk shit about anyone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you would be prepared to give him his props instead of give him a bunch of shit on an internet message board . Maybe you should 've walked up and told him you used to be a cop and now you 're learning to be a pilot and that you think , but do n't know , that he was considering himself billy badass because he had been on the ground in Iraq and you had a problem with that . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Alright , so what I said came off a little wrong . You and Stiffler are correct ... he deserves a lot of respect for what he does/has done . I 'm not arguing against that . I 'm not saying I 'm better than him ... he 's most likely done far more than I have ( I only assumed he had been to Iraq b/c he had more ribbons and shit then I would expect a guy out of basic to have ) . I 'm sure he 's a good guy and obviously a great American . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on your " most dressed up " uniform solely to go out to a club at 130-300 is a " cool idea . " I just think a bar/club in THIS situation is not the right place to be putting on your dress uniform . <p> Stopping for beer after work , no problem . Going to something formal and you want to wear your dress uniform instead of a suit/tux , that 's totally fine . Throwing on your dress uniform to go to a college bar/club ... gay . It does n't change the fact that he 's probably done a lot of good things for this country , but that does n't mean he 's superman and does n't do something retarded on occasion . Everyone 's entitled to low SA situations ... the post was more of just wondering how much others have seen this type of thing . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I hear lots of folks saying " Well the Army/Marines are different .

I think that is pretty cool . <p> You do n't know if he was just back that day , glad to be alive , being treated to a night on the town by his friends and family or if he was , in your words , just " gay ' or " a tool . " <p> I had an airline flight cnx recently on a business trip and I strolled into the Armed Forces Service Center at the Minneapolis airport while I waited for my next flight . I had no idea the place existed . It was great . They had sodas and stuff to make sandwiches and bunks and a shower and a bunch of comfortable chairs for people to sit and watch a big screen TV . Very simple and very cool . The volunteers mentioned that the place was set up for Active Duty folks when I walked in but as a retiree I was OK to sit for a bit but would have to leave if the place got crowded . They were nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken advantage of the place . I told them I understood and I was n't looking to get anything for free . <p> There was no one in there and one of the volunteers struck up a conversation . He was a Marine Vietnam vet and we had a great conversation . Another volunteer came up and joined the conversation . This guy had flown B-17s in WWII . I was having a great time and the guys asked me if I would be interested in volunteering and I said yes . <p> In the blink of an eye five different young guys came into the place . They were looking at the patch collection and talking about where they were going . A couple were on leave prior to deploying and the others were on their mid-tour leave . Then a kid came in with his mother and several folks from the VA . He was in a wheelchair and was missing both legs . Everyone shut up while the kid , his mom and the VA folks talked about the plans for dinner and where they were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport at 0500 for their connecting flight . The other young kids were looking reality right in the kisser and they looked terrified . After a bit , everyone started talking and the kid in the wheelchair shared his story . He was very upbeat at first but at one point his expression changed and he said " I was n't supposed to get hurt . " You had to be there but it was a very important perspective gaining moment for everyone present . I 'm sure those other young troops will never forget it . I know I wo n't . <p> I was reminded that we are all on the same team in combat . I spent a career dedicated to helping others in need , either as a rescue pilot or as an Attack/CAS/CSAR pilot . There is no mission more important than helping a fellow airman on the ground in indian country or helping a scared shitless 18 year old American with an M-16 . I learned that from people my senior who had BTDT as Jolly/Sandy/Hobo/Jug pilots in previous fights . I also recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq without his legs when I felt guilty for enjoying my retirement on my hobby farm and driving a Lexus to a cush 9-5 job everyday ... with both my legs . I was not there when this kid needed me and that bothered me . It does n't matter that there was nothing I could 've done to prevent what happened to him . I still felt sad and guilty . The same sadness and guilt I feel when I watch the news or read the paper and hear about what the guys are going through in Afghanistan and Iraq everyday . I try to talk to every troop I meet and say thanks for doing what they do . <p> Anyway , next time you are annoyed by some guy wearing his uniform in a bar it might be worth it to buy him a drink and strike up a conversation before you tag him as " gay " or " a tool . " <p> Or not . <p> Technique only . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> True words Rainman ... maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one of those nights where I was n't thinking .

I figured I 'd finally attempt to get acquainted with the community rather than just lurk the boards endlessly . I came into the service last year as one of the first 18X officers behind the beta classes for the RPA pipeline . There is not a lot of information on what potential and impending 18X'ers will face in the training process , outside of the guys that got non-vol 'd or did n't go through the entire program . I figured I would at least cast the thread out there and attempt to she 'd any light on questions others might have on it . I 'm by no means an expert , but finishing up the training program here at Holloman right now , I 'm pretty fresh out of the Randolph schoolhouse . <p> Looking forward to getting into the convo 's on the other parts of the board ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm here at Holloman as a B course student as well for the 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even though you will be at Randolph before IFS and during RIQ and RFC , there may be waiting time before you start each portion . I arrived at Randolph in September of ' 11 and did n't  go to IFS until Jan ' 12 . Then had waiting time after RFC and now I 'm at Holloman . And yes you can get 9 's right out of randolph , that 's what I am doing right now . <p> The famous short answer : It depends . Those numbers are roughly correct concerning the pipeline , but casual status in between class dates ( IFS , RIQ , RFC , and FTU ) are all up in the air . You could come on active duty , sit for five months and then go to IFS . Or you could come on active duty and go to IFS two weeks later . This applies for the latter three classes , as well . You could come back from IFS and sit another two months before a slot opens for RIQ . <p> Mileage varies , of course . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended TDY to Randolph , you typically will class up pretty quickly and then return to your permanent station until you TDY-en-route to Holloman . <p> And yes , you can drop Reapers out of Randolph .

I understand IFS is not to benefit me so much as it is to benefit the Air Force . I 'm asking here , because I know the curriculum at IFS is different for RPA pilot trainees .

Thanks ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Some of the IFS syllabus activity may satisfy FAA PPL requirements , but not all , and certainly not all FAA req'ts are addressed at IFS . The instructors are fully licensed FAA instructors , so if you have a logbook and talk to the IPs you might get some activities signed off . However , to get your PPL you 'll probably have to go to a " normal " training facility and do a lot of it over , particularly the cross-country and solo work , I would suspect . The good news is that after 25-30 hours of time at IFS you should be able to get thru a PPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You will satisfy most of the requirements for a PPL through the Doss IFS RPA track . It 's unfortunate that RPA students are not allowed to land on solo cross-countries , because we actually DO all of it , except are only allowed to do low-approaches at the out fields . Pretty much everything else counts towards the PPL , though . I am finishing up mine right now and the main things you will have to focus on are : <p> - A few more night time landings . Two night flights are done at Doss , but they most are just touch and go 's . <p> - Cross country solo time . You 'll have to tack another flight or two on to get checked out at another flight school to go solo x-country . <p> - Precheck , checkride stuff . <p> All in all , I am ten hours away from finishing it . Lots of folks take the opportunity while at San Antonio to finish up the license . Can easily be done in two months at a moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for the info , HiFlyer ( as always ) and Keydet . Did you have no flight hours before IFS , Keydet ?

I did IFS locally in San Antonio when that still was an option and finished up my PPL afterwards at the same flight school . I flew with San Antonio Aero Club and in 2007 they had a DA-20 at least so if that 's what you 're used to that 's good . YMMV in 2012 . Flew both that and a -172 and neither is exactly rocket science so do n't be afraid to switch airplanes to finish your licence if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good estimate ... I think I paid something like that , maybe a little less , to finish up since I was able to get more requirements paid for by Uncle Sam during IFS ( i.e. landings on the cross-country , more night work , etc . ) . GL and have fun with it ... I 'm not a pilot and have n't flown in front seat since I did that flying but I had a great time and figured why not finish the PPL since I already had about 69% of the requirements done . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks again , guys .

@@43195052 @3195052/ <h> Asthma ( and waiver ) info <h> 52 posts in this topic <h> Guest dirtydog <p> I 'm in a bit of a fix ! I always wanted to be a military pilot when I was young , but I gave up those dreams because my vision was just too bad . Now I 've had PRK and am going for my PPL and then applying to OTS . After getting into the process I found that asthma was an issue . My problem is that I was diagnosed with asthma as a child , but now that I 've been studying up on A.F. and general medical diagnostic criteria , I think I was misdiagnosed ! After telling my recruiter my whole story , he thinks it 's best that I do n't go through a MEPS examiner and just go straight to the nearest base for an FC1 . I think he figures a flight doc will be more likely to not just see the word " asthma " in my records and throw me out without at least allowing me to do spirometry and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 1 . When I was around 6 years old I caught pneumonia . Soon after recovering , I woke up one night with some breathing difficulty . Over the next few days I was seen by an allergist , given a battery of tests , and then diagnosed with asthma . <p> 2 . I never had another episode of breathing difficulty . I did n't see the allergist for very long after that , maybe 2 or 3 years . My pediatrician kept giving me inhalers and theodur . I tended to get sick 3 or 4 times a year . The asthma medications and antihistamines never seemed to help me get better when I was sick , and they did n't seem to keep me from getting sick either , so eventually I stopped taking them regularly , and now I do n't take anything but Benadryl , Nyquil , and Robitussin , and I get over colds about 3 times faster . <p> 4 . When I first found that my past asthma diagnosis could DQ me , I went to my current PCP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEV1 and FVC are both a little low , but still within the A.F. definition of normal ( 80% and 82% of predicted ) . However , in the past few years I got married and had a couple of kids , so I have n't exactly stayed in top shape . My FEV1/FVC was 98% of predicted . After giving me a bronchodilator , none of the stats changed . All the data led my physician to say that I do have slightly abnormal lung function , but that it 's not anything to worry about , and that it certainly is not asthma . <p> 5 . So then I found out that my former allergist ended up in the same group that my physician is in . I went to him and asked about getting access to my records . I was diagnosed over 20 years ago , and he deletes all records after 7 years , so he has no record of ever even seeing me . So now I 've requested copies of my pediatrician 's records . He never destroys records , so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall him ever testing me for asthma himself . I 'm hoping that the allergists records might have been copied and kept by my pediatrician at this point . <p> My recruiter is wanting to send me for an FC1 in April . I 'm working on getting in shape and losing some weight . I 'm hoping that will help my spirometry stats out . I 'm just wanting to know if anyone else has gone through this sort of issue or knows of anyone else who has . Are A.F. flight surgeons more likely to focus on what my current results are or on what my records from 20 years ago say ? Lung problems have never kept me from doing anything . I 'm a SCUBA assistant instructor , I 've been active in many demanding sports , including ice hockey , swimming , and long distance running , so I 'm going to be really disappointed if I 'm DQ 'd simply because the word asthma appears on my childhood medical charts . <p> NOTE : Reliable diagnostic criteria should consist of any of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeze , and or dyspnea which persists or recurs over a prolonged period of time ( generally more than 6 months ) , or if the diagnosis of asthma is in doubt , ( B ) a test for reversible airflow obstruction ( greater than a 15 percent increase in FEV , following administration of an inhaled bronchodilator ) or airway hyperreactivity ( exaggerated decrease in airflow induced by a standard bronchoprovocation challenge such as methacholine inhalation or a demonstration of exercise-induced bronchospasms ) must be performed . Bronchoprovocation or exercise testing should be performed by a board certified pulmonologist or allergist . <p> A7.16.1.9 .

A little over 3 years later , I quit going to the allergist . In his last letter to my pediatrician he wrote : <p> My main question after going through my records is , what is the difference between acute asthma and chronic asthma ? Is acute asthma even recognized as a disqualifying condition ? I 'm looking at NIH pub 97-4051 , " Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma .

The flight doc for the guard unit did the narrative at the base and it has been sent to AETC for approval . <p> What is the time frame that I can expect .

I had to use my insurance with my civilian job . Does he have insurance ? His or his parents ? All I was responsible for was my $20 copay . It 's an expensive test without insurance though . I did n't need a referral with my insurance ( Blue Cross Blue Shield ) . I would have him call his insurance provider and tell them that he needs to go see a pulmonologist to have tests done for his childhood asthma ( tell them he thinks it 's acting up even if he does n't have it , you need to tell them that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from seeing a dr if you have medical problems ) . Call around to the pulmonologists in your area and ask if they do Methocoline Challenge . Not all of them perform the test so you do n't want to show up and not be able to take it .

Just from what I saw at my Det , 100% of people who stated they had asthma at any point in their lives was DQ'd/kicked out of ROTC . Yes they were given the whole challenge thing , yes they passed , yes they were kicked out . Does n't sound right at all , but ROTC is just looking for any reason to thin its ranks . Two people I knew had absolutely no asthma related anything pass the age of 5 ... did n't matter . Personally I would think about not mentioning it at all ... let the AF find it if they really want to , but you mentioning it gives you a very good chance of being kicked out for some complete bullshit . It 's one of those " if you check a single yes box , you just drastically magnified your chances of being DQ'd/kicked out .

What goes on at this point in training ? can anyone elaborate ? <p> Finally , how many block tests are there and how is each block broken down ? <p> At first I was n't too thrilled about working on the flightline ( wanted to work in ISO docks or R&amp;R ) but it gave me the opportunity to get to know some of the aircrew members , particularly the boomers . Some were nice enough to let me take a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I got back , I changed my focus from backshop maintenance to aircrew . Being on an air refueling mission really changed my outlook on life . As I am in the Guard I know the only way to obtain a slot with the boomers is to wait for one to retire or expire , whichever happens first . However I 've been in constant contact with them and they 'd let me know when a position opens up . I ca n't wait to finally step up and fly ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Where are you located ? I ca n't answer any of your questions about boom training but will offer up a suggestion . If you really want to get in the air , and do n't want to wait forever for someone to die off , you may want to consider the Herk . We recently picked up a 135 crew chief to be a load . He got tired of waiting around as well and says he never looks back on his decision . I , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since you have a crew chief AFSC you would qualify to go the FE route as well . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Where are you located ?

We 're currently training former TRANS and Finance guys to be FEs at the FTU . Not providing an opinion , just stating facts ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . It 's that basic aircrew training at Lackland , they teach you basics of how aircraft function , systems , weights arms and moments , stuff like that . Some will be easy as a wrench-turner , but it 's also an introduction into the math you 'll be doing in BBOC/BLM , among other things . I ca n't speak too much about it since I did n't have to go . <p> Booms deal a little less with pax since refueling is their primary mission , but there are plenty of -135s and -10s running around with pax and cargo onboard . For the -135s there were entire Guard units on orders for a long time flying the airborne cattlecars , the " 135 rotator " moving crews from one end of the system to the other , seemed they did n't do any A/R at all . KC-10s , being at such obvious hubs in the AMC system , seems they 'll always have ORF space-A 's tagging along whenever they go somewhere ( except Al Dhafra ) , plus they can carry a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so yeah , booms deal with pax and cargo too . <p> I ca n't speak too much about boom stuff since I 'm *not* a boom , but there 's plenty of booms around here to answer that stuff . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Boom <p> Enlisted Aviator Undergraduate Course ( Lackland ) - If you 're in the Guard , I think this is actually optional for you . It 's mandatory for Active Duty and Reservists . All it does is teach you basic aircrew stuff , make you go through the altitude chamber , how the Enlisted Aviator ( 1A 's ) careerfield is structured , etc . It 's about 2 1/2 weeks . <p> Basic Boom Operator Course ( Lackland ) - This is the three level ( and temp wing awarding ) course . It will teach you the history of the air refueling mission , tankers , etc . Also it will go into some basic information on the KC-135 and KC-10 . It wo n't go into actual specifics of either airframe due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same class . They 'll also teach you about some of the missions we fly ( Air Refueling , Coronet , Business Effort , Banner Support , etc ) . The course is about a month long . <p> Boom Initial Qualification ( Altus ) - This is the course that will get you qualified as a basic KC-135 Boom Operator . The first two months are academics taught by the civilians from the Flight Safety company . You 'll learn about the systems ( and take a lot of CBT 's ) like the APU 's , Electrics , Pneumatics , Hydraulics , Cargo ( you 'll also get a Cargo check ride during this phase ) , &amp; finally the Air Refueling system . The school is a standard 0730 to 1630 during the Academics phase . After the academics portion you 'll fly in the BOPTT which is the Boom Operator sims ( only one in the AF ) which will get you used to refueling in the boom pod and also help you trouble shoot some malfunctions . Once you 're done with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two flying squadron ( 54/55 ARS ) and be assigned one or two Instructor Booms ( IB 's ) . You 'll do ground knowledge ( GK ) over all the systems when you 're not flying but you 'll need eight flights and a check ride to graduate BIQ . You 'll also take a open and a closed book test before you get your check ride . The whole BIQ lasts about 3 1/2 months . <p> Combat Survival ( Fairchild ) - This is the SERE school that people always talk about . They 'll have academics for the first few days then they 'll take you out in the woods for six days with different activities that you and your element ( some junior enlisted and officers ) have to accomplish . The SERE instructors will also show you how to survive out in the woods if you do become find yourself in that situation . The last part of SERE is actually classified and no one here can go into detail about it . But let 's just say it 's a very vivid course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pensacola NAS ) - This course teaches how to survive out in the water if you become stranded . It 's very short and it 's a fun time down in Florida . It 's about 3-4 days . <p> After you finish all of those schools then you 'll go back to your unit and fly with IB 's to get mission qual 'd ( depends on your unit ) . You 'll have to get day/night heavy qualified ( C-17 , C-5 , KC-10 , B-2 ) and day/night fighter qualified ( all fighters ) . Then depending on your unit you 'll also get KC-135T model differences trained ( if your unit has them ) , MPRS ( Mult-Point Refueling System , I think only AD has MPRS ) , and any other mission qualification training your unit has . After you complete this then you 'll be a mission qualified Boom and you 'll be able to fly by yourself . <p> The whole pipeline takes from start to finish takes about a year . <p> I love being a Boom . And with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with when I applied to crosstrain . I put down Loadmaster ( I was a non-flyer in a C-130 squadron at the time ) . I 'm glad that I got to be a Boom and have n't regretted my decision one bit . I do agree with HerkFE that any job in the air is better than one on the ground . But I do think that Booms have more responsibility in the air obviously than Loadmasters do . If you go on the KC-135 , we do n't haul a lot of cargo . In fact most of the time we do it 's one or two pallets at a time and that 's going to and from the AOR . We do seem to haul a lot of passengers though , but that also depends on what base you 're stationed at too . I do n't know if you 'd haul a lot of pax out of Hickam with having C-17 's units there . <p> If you have any other questions let me know . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AF , with Boom Operator as my third . I enjoyed the other two and Boom still takes the cake ! If EAUC is only an option , i 'd still take it . We had ANG folks in our class . 3 were boom 's and 2 were C-5 Flight Engineers . You found the right place for answers . Those two Boom 's who commented above hit every thing on the nose . Just giving my $0.2 on how bad ass being a boom on the KC-135 is . I will say that I have some C-17 buddies that have a much better TDY and deployment selection/options than a boomer . Their stories sound more like what I have heard from ANG Boom 's - Which is a good thing . <p> Good luck <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I got approved for retraining to be a boom operator in August while I was deployed earlier this year . The class start date is May 2010 . Does anyone know if my class date can be moved to an earlier start date ? Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know I am leaving ; they wo n't even let me go TDY anymore even though my classes do n't start until May . Any suggestions or ideas about this ? Also , when should I receive a list of items that I need to get for my classes ? I always hear people talking about how the waiting sucks ; now I understand what they were talking about . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Highly doubtful your class date will change . There are many forces at work that determine who goes where and when and " wanting to go earlier " is n't one of them . They have to line you up not only for BBOC/BIQ at Altus , but EAUC at Lackland first and Survival at Fairchild/P-Cola . That 's a lot of moving parts to be moving around just because you do n't want to wait . Keep your chin up , you 'll be there before you know it . Hell , even if you were able to get it moved to the left , by the time all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sit back , relax and enjoy the dead time . Congrats on the retraining , you wo n't be dissapointed . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Thanks for the quick response . I love this site . My classes ( BBOC and EAUC ) start in Lackland and SERE/Water Survival are at Fairchild . No information on the Altus portion though . Do you think the change to training locations has something to do with it ? <p> When should I recieve that part from AFPC ? Who sends down the list of required equipment for training and when should I receive it ? Know any books I read to get ready for everything ? I went to the AETC site and it showed a big list but I forget where it was located at . Overall , how long do you think training will be ( would like to work with the 135s since I used to work on that airframe ) <p> When I was deployed , the Wisconsin aircrew let me check out the boom area on the 135 . Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make different size chairs for refueling ? I layed down and only a small portion of my chest was on the seat ( hope that is what you call it ) <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I personally did n't retrain into the career field an have never retrained period so I could n't tell you anything about that process . I can tell you to expect about 3-4 weeks EAUC , I think SERE was about 2 weeks and then another 3 days for water survival . Altus can be anywhere between 6-9 months due to flying schedules , weather cancels , hooked check rides , etc . As for books to read ... nothing out there really pertaining to A/R but you can always go here and read up on basic weight and balance as well as basic theory of flight . <p> Not to sound weird or anything , but grow bigger bewbs so more of your chest fits in the " chair " . No , they do n't make different sizes . I have a friend that is well over 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 " 160 and we both refuel using the same equipment .

Only time I was at Lackland was basic training , and I was ready to leave at that point and time . Screw sghtseeing . But now , of course , it 's a little different . So anyone have any suggestions on places to eat , sightseeing tips , and my favorite , were to stay if they do n't put me on base ? I hear there are a lot of things to do and see there so I am definitely ready for my training to begin . Any and all suggestions are welcome .

@@43195055 @3195055/ <h> Post-Pregnancy Deployment &amp; PCS Deferment <h> 8 posts in this topic <h> Guest <p> I saw a policy memo from AFPC of an upcoming guidance memorandum for AFI 36-2110 , Assignments , expected to publish on 30 June . Post-pregnancy deferments for Deployment and PCS ( aka Assignment Limitation Code " A " ) will increase from 6 months to a full year . This action will be retro-active for any child-births from March 2015 to present . Note that para 2.39.5. allows for members to voluntarily request removal of this deferment , which certainly will be a very important option as a year is a very LONG time and assignment possibilities will arise in that time . The change was also supposedly spear-headed by SECAF James . It 's also very important that this deferment is not pushed by medical action . The limitation is strictly a personnel and quality-of-life standard . There is no physiological requirement that the member be restricted beyond 6-8 weeks post-pregnancy , especially as it has IMR implications and no opportunity for voluntary request for removal . However that is n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be 6 months or 1 year is a different question . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 2.39.4 . During the 6-month period after the birth of a child to an Airman , deferment from PCS is authorized ( see Table 2.2 , ALC A ) . The intent is for the mother and child to bond during 6- month period . The military mother will be deferred from an assignment to a dependent- restricted overseas tour or an accompanied overseas tour when concurrent travel is denied . The military mother may waive this deferment . Unless the military mother waives the deferment , she is not to depart on PCS to an OS short location where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months unless permission has been granted to serve the accompanied by dependents tour ( when an accompanied tour is authorized ) . Regardless of the tour length of the OS location , concurrent travel must have been granted so the mother and child could travel OS together . The 6-month post-delivery deferment is not authorized if approval has been granted for the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to any TDY. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> Q : Sir , last week , the secretary of the Navy announced that effective immediately , women in the Navy and the Marine Corps will now have 18 weeks of maternity leave .

What are the differences between them ? I 'm browsing the AFI nunya posted and am under the impression that a short tour is one that is generally unaccompanied and less than 365 but can also be 18 months . And a long tour is any location accompanied or unaccompanied for 365+ ? These can either be flying and non flying right ? <p> What generally drives the requirement to do a short or long tour ? Are they mostly volunteer , or are people voluntold ? What about the CAOC ? Is that one of those mandatory check boxes in order to stay in ? Also , does an overseas assignment to somewhere like Kadena count the same as any other long overseas or remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point in the aviation career , meaning if you do n't volunteer for them at least once in your career you can count on getting stuck with one later on ?

Read relevant posts here and look around on the AFPC website . Assignments to Korea are pretty much all remote short tours . But if you get assigned to Osan , you could get command sponsorship for your spouse ( permission to bring your family over ) . The ' standard ' remote tour is one year but you can extend in six month or one year increments . However , if you extend all the way to three years , you will not get credit for a short tour . Depending on your airframe or job , you will probably have a short tour at some point in your career , so many volunteer in order to choose when/where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of training ( can be a good idea ) , you may get voluntold for a second tour down the road . The number of volunteers you will find at a given short tour will depend greatly on how good or bad of a deal it is . Flying assignment in Korea - probably 100% volunteers .

Short tours are huge in the LRO world with the expectation that we 'll do approx 6 in our careers ( including 365s ) . To hear that people are getting short tour credit despite not doing anything close to a short tour is annoying because it just screws everyone else over .

Whether it 's the 4 points you earn over a drill weekend , the 83 points you earn for ACSC , or 365 points for a year 's worth of Title 10 orders , they 're all the same . This article is excellent at explaining how the system works . <p> If you reach 7300 points ( i.e. 365 points x 20 years ) , you collect your retirement right away just like if you were AD . If not , assuming you have 20 good years ( good year = &gt; 50 points ) , then you get a reserve retirement that you do n't collect right away and that is calculated based on whatever points total you have when you retire . <p> On your other advice , you 're right that ACSC is necessary to make O-5 , but you can be an O-4 for 8 years so it 's not like you need to rush and knock it out on AD unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also forward that OPRs have been entirely meaningless in the Guard both in my ( limited ) experience and in that of much more senior dudes I 've tried to learn from . It 's a small , insestous family at whatever unit you 're in and your reputation for quality work and being a good dude is what carries you forward rather than wordsmithing a " great " OPR . <p> Also , as @nunya- said , most dudes are finding ways to complete that PME while on pay status , so you 're still doing the work somewhat on Big Blue 's time while you 're getting paid to be there , and you also earn the 83 points on top of whatever you earn money and points-wise just for being there at the squadron . <p> Edit to add : One wrinkle is that there 's a limit to the number of inactive duty points you can earn in a single year ( 130 is the current limit ) . That would be relevant if you maxed out UTAs ( 48 points ) , AFTPs ( 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year . Even doing ACSC and all your drills , i.e. not working any AFTPs , you 're at 131 points so I guess one of those points wo n't end up counting . All this to say , if you want to maximize your points for effort calculation , try to do ACSC on a year where you 're working other types of active orders i.e. you 're lighter on inactive duty time anyways so as to not go over the limit and waste those points . However also try not to do it in a year where you 're on Title 10 the whole time if you do n't have to , since the most points anyone can earn in a year is 365 or 366 for a leap year . <p> Edit to add more : crossing out stuff that is wrong <p> Edited March 12 by nsplayr <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> @nsplayer OPRs do count now .

There are no sitting height standards for FCIII ( AFI 48-123 , Attach 6.29 ) . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Birdie <p> Apparently my sitting height is less than 34 inches , but greater than 33 inches . Is this waiverable for pilot or do I need to grow inch in the next two years ? I am not too worried because I am sure there is some way around this , right ? <p> Or , if you could just tell me how to look up if it is waiverable or not that would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have no experience with this waiver . I 've heard about it going either way . <p> CONDITION : SHORT STATURE <p> I. Overview . Current height standards for flight status are : 1 ) standing height no less than 64 inches or greater than 77 inches ; 2 ) sitting height no less than 34 inches and no greater than 40 inches for FCI , no less than 33 inches and no greater than 40 inches for FCIA and Initial FCII for flight surgeons . There are no sitting height standards for FCIII ( AFI 48-123 , Attach 6.29 ) . <p> Short stature is not a health problem unless associated with an endocrine disorder . In most cases , it is not even an occupational hazard . However , many cockpit environments are currently ill-suited , and possibly even dangerous , for individuals below 64 inches or above 77 inches in height . This issue has emerged as an area of concern primarily as the result of the increasing number of female aviators and their recent introduction into high performance aircraft . Previous cockpit design was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caucasian male pilots . This range currently excludes many females and some males from particular ethnic backgrounds . Ongoing research is focusing on cockpit-specific anthropometric dimensions necessary for flight safety and potential cockpit modifications for future aircraft . <p> II . Aeromedical Concerns . The issues are more complex than height alone . Short stature is usually associated with a lower body weight . Weight is considered the most critical parameter in ejection seat safety due to its effect on acceleration of the system . Shorter individuals may be at increased risk for spinal injuries from ejection . Optimizing the field of vision often involves upward seat adjustment which in turn may interfere with arm reach for controls and/or leg reach for rudder control . Proper fit of shoulder harnesses for adequate seat retention and adequate strength to operate ejection and emergency releases are also critical issues . <p> III . Information Required for Waiver Submission . Currently , individuals outside the height standards for either standing or sitting height are not eligible for FCI/IA waiver . There are some exceptions in the Air National Guard when individuals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for FCII and III waivers depending on their duty position and weapon system assigned . Waiver requests should be submitted with standing and sitting height annotated . If appropriate , a cockpit-specific evaluation for leg and arm reach , field of vision , etc. by a flight surgeon and instructor pilot should be included in the waiver packet . Evaluation at the Aeromedical Consult Service is not required . <p> IV . Waiver Considerations . As research data on cockpit-specific anthropometrics become available , waivers may be granted on the basis of a panel of individual measurements . Most personnel currently granted FCII waivers for short stature are flight surgeons . Many individuals granted FCIII waivers are medical personnel , but waivers have been granted to other personnel as well . Refer to AFI 48-123 , Attach 15 for designated waiver authorities for different flying classes . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27698 @qwx437698 <p> When you go to Brooks for your physical , they will re-do all the measurements . If you are out of limits , there 's a whole process that you will go thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They decide on too short/too tall . They do waive it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yes , being under the min height requirements can be waived ( I have a waiver for both standing height and sitting height under mins ) . If you do n't do your initial IFC I physical @ Brooks , be sure the medical group that does your physical gets all the required anthro measurements at that time ( there are about 6-7 additional measurements , e.g. arm span ) . There is a matrix out that specifies requirements for each cockpit . I could n't track fighter/bomber due to not being able to meet the matrix for the T-38 ( even after a qualitying fit test in the actual cockpit ) . No biggie - I was going heavies anyways. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Rage - true . Based on the matrix completed prior to MFS @ Brooks ( did my IFC I physical at my home station ) , I was qualified to fly all the heavy a/c . After MFS , my waiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/50th of an inch difference is really important .... <p> Anyways , having the measurements ahead of MFS is beneficial , if only to know whether or not you would be disqulified from any aircraft . Additionally , having an existing waiver from AETC/SG based on anthro measurements on your IFC I physical can expedite the ( re-waiver ) process when you get re-measured at Brooks . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest SML <p> Just wanted to add some info ... I just went through a whole battle about this . Like the others said ... they will take your anthro measurements at Brooks ... then they will give it to your waiver authority ... who will spit out a bubble sheet color coded with what you can fly ... if your 1/2 inch height is the only issue you have ... you should be fine ... if you have reach ( arm or leg ) issues ... that is where you could have problems ... on your sheet ... planes that return red are no go .... yellow - you will need cockpit checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if you have anymore questions ... I would n't sweat it though until you actually go to Brooks ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest PilotKD <p> I went the off-the-street OTS route and did my FCI physical as a civilian while going through the application process for a pilot slot . During my FCI , the measured me 64.5 " standing . Shoes off , feet together , up against a tape measure on the wall . I forget what I measured sitting , but it was good enough to pass . <p> After OTS , I went to Brooks and measured up 63.7 " standing . Shoes off , feet apart , away from the wall using their **33;1916;TOOLONG . They measured me twice , but unfortunately I was not able to magically gain .3 " . I passed everything else that day ( sitting height included ) , but was DQ 'd for .3 " . To be honest , I really was n't worried about my height going into Brooks . It was literally the last thing on my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . I never imagined that my height would vary almost a full inch from what they had measured me before in the FCI . I always knew I was *around* 64 " and when I measured 64.5 , I figured I was good to go . Obviously , the individual who measured me during my FCI did n't do such an accurate job . <p> Because I failed the height requirements , they took additional measurements on me ( reach length , but to knee length , etc ... ) . This had given me some hope because I figured ; why would they take additional measurements if they were DQ'ing me ? However , at the end of the day , I got the walk-o-shame to the office for the , " I 'm sorry , but you 're going to have to go to the MPF tomorrow to pick another job in the Air Force . " spiel . <p> The staff at Brooks told me there was no such thing as a " height waiver " because it is not a medical condition . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , which at the time had to go all the way up to the Chief of Staff for approval and could take up to a year to be approved . In the meantime , they wanted me to reclassify and ship off to a new base somewhere while I worked the issue . <p> So there I was ... faced with having to reclassify to a new career field so I could start working up through a chain of command that most likely would n't have given two poops about me and my flying career . <p> What did I do ? Long story short ... I raised the BS flag and basically refused to reclassify . I had spent the past 10 years of my life flying airplanes , left a civilian flying job to go to OTS and I was n't going to give in and let them take the opportunity to go to UPT away from me because someone could n't read a damn tape measure . I was furious . : mad : This was something that could have been avoided . Things got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to proceed to my UPT base and spent 6 months as a casual Lt while I worked the waiver . It was a long process and was an emotional roller coaster , but thanks to a kickass commander and the help from the flight medicine staff at the base , I was granted a cockpit fit check and subsequent waiver to fly T-1 's . Overall , not a process I would want to go through again , although would if I had to . <p> It is my understanding , that due to this very thing getting more and more common ( especially with more and more women getting UPT slots ) , they have streamlined the process . I hope for their sake they have . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27698 @qwx437698 <p> How long ago was this ? Every aircraft has been measured .

Every aircraft has been measured . We 've mapped out the flying track for fighters and heavies . Have who makes it w/o problem , who is borderline , and who ca n't get to the switches no matter how hard they try . <p> This was March of ' 03 . Like I said , the staff at Brooks was absolutely no help with this issue when I was there . I spent an hour in the office talking to the MSgt , practically pleading with him to give me a waiver , but I was sent walking to the MPF to reclassify . He made it sound like it was going to be virtually impossible to get back into UPT and told me to plan on being at Brooks for 2-3 weeks during the reclassification process . Meanwhile , I had about 4 days worth of cloths and my car was 1,200 miles away sitting in an airport parking lot with the rest of my stuff in it . Not one of the best days of my life to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Something else that I found strange was that they T-1 tracked me from the get go . They did n't even offer a T-38 fit check . I just found it strange that if I had been .3 " taller standing , I would have walked out of there with flying colors , went to UPT and had the opportunity to track to anything in our inventory . I would have most likely picked T-1 's anyway , but that has always ticked me off a bit . <p> After everything was said and done , I got the waiver in June . <p> 27 .

Said it was a line/safety issue , not a medical one . That 's when the exception to policy thing came about . I went through that process ( which is very convoluted , and no one really knew anything about who needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Had the opportunity to travel to Columbus with one of our flight surgeons back in 2001 and get fit-checked in the T-37/38/1 . Luckily , the MDG/CC @ CBM at the time was able to procure the forms for the fit check ( great guy - went above and beyond for us ) . <p> Long story short , after my package was ping-ponged back and forth between the CSAF office and MAJCOM , it was determined that waiver authority would be back in the hands of SG . AETC/SG began granting waivers again in the summer of 2003 . It was at this time that the " bubble sheet " was getting refined , so the process really was n't streamlined . <p> For anyone else going through this process , do n't give up . Might take a little longer than some waivers , as I think the safety office @ AETC still needs to review the waiver request based on your fit check/bubble sheet . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest PilotKD <p> Yes , I would . If you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start looking into it now . Having someone to start pulling the strings now that knows you , ie : your Detachment Commander , will make things easier . Once you 're commissioned and go to Brooks , you 're pretty much on your own ( or at least that 's the way I felt ) . It 's been a while since I was there and it seems as though this process has been streamlined , so things may be fine for you . However , if you have n't learned it already , you will sooner or later , and that is : " Needs of the Air Force " . You are a number and they 've got plenty of people to take your pilot slot if you do n't make the height requirement . Unfortunately , this is the reality of it all . It 's easier to send you walking than it is to start a waiver process for you ( noone likes a paperwork trail ) . I 'm not trying to scare you , but just telling you to be prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , they 've got all the cockpits measured out and should know exactly what you can fly . You may not be able to fighter track ( T-38 's ) . Most of the people I know on height waivers were T-1 tracked . Be prepared for this since it may be devastating news for someone that has dreamed about flying fighters his whole life . However , there should be no reason why you should be pulled out of UPT altogether if there 's a few airframes you can track to . <p> I have my bubble sheet right in front of me ( I save everything ) and I was green for the T-6 , passed the fit check for the T-1 and was green for the KC-10 , KC-135 , C-5 , and C-21 ( and these were what my waiver was signed for ) . I was marginal on the C-17 and C-141 and would require a fit check to go to one of those . On the fighter side , I was red on the T-38 , A-10 and B-52 ( which means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-22 , F-15 , and F-16 . Since I was red on the T-38 , there was no way to get to all the marginal ones anyway . When you get into ejection seat aircraft , short stature ( and weight ) becomes a problem because of the chances of injury in the event of an ejection from flailing limbs and such . The T-38 's archaic seat is said to be voilent on body and not good for shorter people ( this is just what I 've heard ) . Funny enough , when we were ready to pick assignments at the end of the T-1 program , my flight commander knew nothing about me being on a height waiver ( I PCS 'd between phase II and III ) . C-17 's were more towards the end of my list , but I would be willing to bet I could have landed a C-17 assignment without anyone ever seeing that I technically needed a fit check in the aircraft to fly it . Unless AFPC keeps that sort of stuff in their system down there when they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my FCI was actually done at Patrick AFB . I had thought they were trying to send ROTC cadets to Brooks for both the FCI and MFS at the same time before they commissioned . Are they not doing this ? 27698 @qwx437698 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27702 @qwx437702 <p> ... 40 inches for sitting and 27 inches for buttocks to knee measurements ... if any one is interested . <p> PilotKD ... sorry to hear about your ordeal . " Anthropometrics " as we know it today has only been around since 2001 and since you 've been through it there have been some improvements in the process . The 2 acceptable sources for measurements are Brooks and the AFA . The measurements accomplished at Brooks ( AFROTC cadets , MFS only evals , and funded requests from the field ) typically cover the big three , standing , sitting , and BTK . If an applicant is above or below the standard then additional measurements are taken and the results are forwarded to both AETC/DOF ( Line ) and AETC/SGPA ( medics ) for certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they determine which aircraft , if any , an applicant can fly . For the AD MFS only folks AFPC , not Brooks , makes the decision of holding someone in place or letting them move on while awaiting the decision . AETC/SGPA waits for the DOF recommendation before making the final certification ... for the applicant , this can be an extremely slow and painful process . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest b2thep <p> I went to MFS at Brooks earlier this year and just recieved word that I am disqualified from my UPT slot because of my sitting height .

Go to Expenses and click Create Expense from GTC Statement or something like that . <p> Thoughts ( not GO safe ... sanitize ! ) -- <p> From an AMC standpoint , the most frustrating thing about DTS is the amount of information that has to be put in prior to going TDY and then all that information has to be edited once we have returned . When I am TDY 6-9 times a month and I have to enter ( 6-9 ) *2 things into DTS ( Auth + Voucher ) , I get annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Auth and then DTS throws a shitfit when we change the itinerary for the Voucher upon our return . Also , the -$16 glitch is super annoying when trying to select OINC for $3.50 a day when directed . Finally , the AF infatuation with 6-9 popups per web application is super fucking annoying . <p> Lose the finance jargon in every step of the process . Most of us do n't speak it . <p> My favorite feature is the page that let 's me adjust the split disbursement . However , everything good comes with a price , and if I use the feature , I then have to justify 6-9 flags for changing the split disbursement . <p> 1 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> 3 .

Training for the administrators using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel voucher through the system because each layer of bureaucracy does n't seem to be aware that you do n't need receipts for a $8 cab ride <p> 2 . GET RID OF ALL THE MOTHERF***ING POP-UPS . There 's no reason you ca n't do this in a simple , logical flow from the main page . <p> 3 . Create menu options that make sense . Do n't <p> 4 . Bring back group authorizations : it made things a LOT easier for groups <p> 5 . You want a hint ? Go to travelocity or any other site and set it up like theirs . The last page should be all of the funding site/approval work , the site loads up quickly because there is n't a BUNCH of overhead code to show simple graphics and text ( seriously , I can download a movie faster ) , and a simple page that shows all your uploaded files and allow you to name them for easy reference 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Would it be possible to just get rid of the authorization(s) for trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paper vouchers , we would just fly the mission using orders from the squadron aviation resource managers and then file the paper voucher once the mission is done . <p> When I was RA for my squadron , I would not accept anything except group authorizations for TDYs using air force aircraft . This saved me tons on time and it saved everyone else in the squadron tons of time , but the next best thing would be no authorization required . If this were to happen , a group travel voucher would be a good idea . The lead traveler would make the " shell " and then it would spawn to the individuals involved . The individuals would then only upload receipts and add additional nickel and dime items such as laundry , taxi , etc , if need be . <p> Already a half billion pumped into the current system and it still has some issues . <p> We 've pumped half billion into this POS ! ? ! ? ! <p> Go back to paper vouchers . <p> THIS ! <p> Just get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill out a paper voucher ! Prior to DTS , I never had a problem , getting airline tickets/hotels/rental cars . Since switching to DTS , I have yet to go on a TDY where something was n't totally fucked with DTS . We still have the same number of finance folks as before we switch to DTS . Now they spend most of their time fielding calls on how to un-fuck a DTS problem . Also please train your folks to screen the whole voucher before rejecting , rather than just sending it back at the first thing they find . <p> My favorite is having to put a statement in there as to why I ca n't accomplish my business via secure video teleconferencing ( SVTC ) ... on EVERY voucher ! Finance , apparently does n't think my justifications are as funny as I do . But seriously ... I 'm flying a fucking jet to DEPOT ! Is this statement really needed ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So ... I 'm a Captain with 5 years . I 've finally ( after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely well enough to get an authorization/voucher through without f'ing it up . That 's foul #1 . If an iPhone took 5 years to learn , it would have never existed . <p> I used PIPS for the first time the other day to create the voucher for my PCS . While it was n't perfect , it was a hell of a lot more user-friendly than DTS. eFinance and Virtual Finance need to disappear or be more like PIPS . They suck . <p> One of the previous posts mentioned that the systems need to use a logical , chronological flow of zero-finance-jargon questions so that somebody who has n't been to finance tech school can understand the first time around . ( i.e. Where are you going ? From where are you leaving ? When will you leave ? How do you plan to get there ? etc . ) <p> Another vote for ... bring back group authorizations ! ! ! When the entire squadron is picking up to go TDY somewhere , it makes no sense for every single person in the squadron to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has to go un-###### one at a time . <p> Another vote for ... get rid of the pop-ups &amp; re-directs . <p> Do n't spend time/money on creating ridiculous graphics that just take the already limited computing power on our five-year-old desktop PCs . The Google home-page works so well because it 's simple and loads quickly . <p> I know saying " bring back paper vouchers " makes you take this input less seriously , because it 'll probably never happen ... but seriously , $500M could go a long way to training bean-counters how to count beans better . <p> The secure-VTC statement is seriously ridiculous . Why do n't we trust out folks to know when they can or can not accomplish something via SVTC ? Do the bean-counters really think that when I 'm already TDY 200+ days per year for training and deployment that I REALLY want to go TDY to yet another meeting ? When I say I need to go TDY ( by turning in a travel auth ) then that means I need to go TDY ! ! ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No kidding , I really do need to go TDY ... " <p> Um ...

Fix it and make it so that when you scan a receipt , DTS reads it and automatically processes the expenses and you can apply the items from the receipts to the correct places in the vouchers . For example : hotel receipt - $69.00 . Scan it and then all you have to do is click on a button or dropdown to assign that amount to the correct night . <p> Also , actually do currency conversions IN DTS ! ! ! ! Ca n't it at least use historical data to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 20,000BAT and I do n't have to do the conversion myself ! <p> There should be more than 1 finance person involved in the entire DTS system for the entire base . Pilots should not be running an additional finance office so that DTS can actually work . <p> Make authorizations more simple , or get rid of them . <p> The interface between DTS and CTO 's system is unreliable . Ca n't there be only1 system ? Perhaps allow normal people can do CTO 's job for them , because they 're relatively unhelpful and charge a service fee to do something Expedia already does for everyone else . <p> Please take the Foreign Travel Office completely out of the loop . They serve absolutely no purpose . <p> I also like the ideas of others from above that mention making it more intuitive , no pop-ups ! ! ! ! ! ! , and some kind of logical flow . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> When I say I need to go TDY ( by turning in a travel auth ) then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't have to copy/paste in a ridiculous statement saying " No kidding , I really do need to go TDY ...

WTF ! ! ! ! Why would I be bashing my face into a Dell desktop monitor for God knows how long creating an Authorization in DTS if I was n't authorized ( i.e , getting sent on a TDY ! ! ! ) to be traveling in the first place ? ! ? <p> Has this been going on AF-wide while I was OCONUS for the last several years , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Honestly , maybe what we need is a container that you can check that reads something like " Skip the review , I 'm an officer and I 'm signing this under penalty of perjury so give me my fucking money or call the JAG instead .

In fact , every DOD program we have does a horrible job at being intuitive ( GTIMS , ePex , JMPS , etc ) . Give me $1 million and I bet I could find a couple college graduates in the web development/programming field that could create a program that is significantly easier to use , and that 's with me pocketing $900,000 of that . It has most of the functionality to get the job done , but the delivery is terrible . Most of the previous posts have already mentioned it but it needs a logical flow and when there are fields or options that might be confusing , maybe put a ? button next to the option/field that explains what it 's for and some examples of how it 's used . <p> In all seriousness , what does finance do on a daily basis ? I went into finance recently to in-process and they tell me , " oh sir , we ca n't in-process you here , you must do it on ePIPS " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you guys do here then ?

@@43195066 @3195066/ <h> TDY Gouge - Wake Island <p> Wake Island - Wake is almost Gilligan 's Island , except no MaryAnne and Ginger . This tiny atoll can be really fun to visit . It has one bar , Drifters Reef , they will make you buy the bar if you wear your hat . These dudes wait for weeks for you to make that mistake . Mike is the " mayor " of Wake , he will greet you when you land . Call early and ask what they might need from civilization . Newspapers , milk , whatever . The trick is to get a fishing trip , and/or a " mits " mini pickup truck . Tour the island , it 's beautiful , the MWR will loan you a PeeWee Herman bike- better with a " Mits " . Gov quarters are circa Pan-Am flying Boat , they suck . Shoppette is open for 1/2 hour 6 days a week , 1700-1730 . Per Diem and Lodging is $124 , they will charge you $120 every day whether you eat or not , max profit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grills everywhere- Still a fun place to go and goof around , lots of history . If you have n't done Wake , you do n't know what you are missing . Take heed to the signs about the sharks , they are not joking . Take the fishing trip , it costs $100 dollars us and can take 6 people , but you need to have closed toe shoes . The billeting is clean and is what you would expect in such an out of the way area . You will be too busy at the Drifters or fishing to use it so do n't worry about it . There is new management out there now . The Air Force has finally accomplished what the Japanese have never been able to do and that is kick the Marines out of Wake . Expect good things to come down range from that including new runway , ramps , billeting , K-loaders , and other things that work and are not from the 50 's . The new management is under a Mr. Carrol and John Hanna . Mr. Timmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional . They like it if you bring current magazines and newspapers for them . Also dog biscuits for their animals are always a plus . It is still same great place , just under new management . I anticipate a butt load of rules and regulations on the way now that the boys in blue have it , but there is nobody there to enforce them anyway so what difference does it make . <p> Update to Wake Island Information : ( 1 ) billeting renovation : -courtesy of USAF , they are now segregating O 's and E 's . Building 1115 ( by Drifter 's reef ) is being upgraded . Some rooms have new furniture , better lighting , tile floors , clean showers . First floor outdoor decking is coming soon . The E 's are placed in bldg 1175 and is average at best . ( 2 ) no change for drifters reef info . With the exception that the bridge to peale island burned to the waterline awhile ago . ( 3 ) VCR/DVDs are available to check out from the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now officially back in business . The cost is $35.00 , whether you have your own gear or not . Coordinate with Nick ( dive club president ) in Ops or with Capt Trinh ( base usaf " co " ) . The max is 3-5 divers per trip and that includes your dive master guide . One-day transient crews will not be allowed to dive , but if your delayed ... have at it . The rental gear is adequate , but there is more inbound . We dove out side of the channel markers . Our max depth was 70 feet with a great view of the abyss into deeper waters . The visibility was in excess of 80-90 feet and lots of sealife . Reef fish , sea turtles , spotted rays aplenty. ( 5 ) The runway resurfacing/repainting is finished . Plan for day operations only , for there are no runway lights in service right now . ( 6 ) Base ops has been given a facelift with remodeling , new paint , etc . The store has increased its ' variety and inventory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great there . It is $125 for the boat , max of 6 people . It starts at 1700 , and is with a Thai guide . Call early so you can reserve it ( Mike Price is the svc guy there , call the ops number on the Giant report and they can transfer you to him ) . If you do n't someone else may have it . We brought in some Jarhead fighter pilots and had the boat reserved , they did not , and were very pissed we beat them to the punch . We caught 14 in 2 hours . Also , it is cool to talk to the peace officer there , he can give you a nice tour of the island including the bunkers and pow rock . We brought plastic single person rafts ( $2 in Waikiki ) and swam out in the lagoon with those and our cooler of course .

If you could throw in specific examples ( ie specific base deployment rates ) that would help out a bunch .

As a C-130 pilot , my deployment time was about 1:2 , that is , for every 4 months deployed , I spent 8 months at home . Generally , that meant I was deploying at the same time of year . There were opportunities for people to volunteer more and take advantage of some interesting opportunities if they enjoyed the life on the road . <p> I found KC-135s to be more demanding . For many , it seemed to approach 1:1 or 1:1.5 . Furthermore , the tempo deployed was much more demanding . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions than in the KC-135--the crew ratios are very different , and I found myself flying many days in a row in the KC-135 while I was deployed--that eventually takes its toll . <p> Also , I actually prefer 4 month deployments to 2 months . Especially if you 're not going to be home much longer than you 're on the road . A little more time at home in between deployments helped me feel like life was more stable . Those who deployed every few months in the KC-135 for two months only to repeat the cycle seemed to disconnect from their community and families . It 's almost like " what 's the point of getting involved in friendships , activities ? You 'll be preparing to depart again in just over a month .

Right now young folks are getting about 500-600 hours a year . If you come into the C-5 now , you 'll be in on the beginnings of the C-5M , too , which is *supposed* to be a huge leap forward .

Another thing I found is it was pretty rare for a no-notice deployment to pop-up . If it did , it usually was because the person primarily scheduled was injured or failed a checkride and could n't go .

We all know how that 's been working out lately , not that I would have chosen differently . <p> Edited June 12 , 2010 by JeepGuyC17 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Dover C-5s are currently up and down - missions start at about 6 days but FRED is an angry beast and they can last more than 30 days for MX issues . Sometimes you 'll be gone back to back to back like the C-17 guys are experiencing with being home only a few days between , and other times you 'll be home for 2 months . Right now young folks are getting about 500-600 hours a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in on the beginnings of the C-5M , too , which is *supposed* to be a huge leap forward . You can also expect one deployment in your first assignment . Some folks are taking 120s to the CAOC and others 179 in the MC-12 . It 's not bad , but it 's ridiculously unpredictable . <p> This is a pretty good picture of FRED life style . You do n't deploy like other airframes but when you do it is non-flying and likely to the Deid which plain sucks ( see 100+ page thread on that ) . Flying has slowed down since the days when I was a CP there and the M transition will likely be a slow and painful process and less hours flown . <p> I 've talked to E-3 guys lately and they seem to have a pretty good life ... Between 4 dudes they averaged about 40 days gone in the last YEAR ! <p> BF <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just like it was stated above .... C17s are going nuts and the rumor is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it 's going to be much longer than that . Personally , I think its going to last until the economy picks up and there are jobs for people to get out and go to . Until then , they are going to squeeze us dry because they know there is no where to go . As far as deployments , our schedule is n't too bad , 4 months every 15 months or so . But you 'd never know it b/c when you are " home " you go on 15 day trips . For a new guy it 's pretty good for a little while , you get a chance to have repetition and learn alot very quickly . However , no matter how busy you are , they will still push for you to get your SOS done as a LT and complete you masters degree the day you step foot on station . Bottom line , if you are interested in the mission and traveling the world , try it out . If you hated it , it 's only 3-4 years then PCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Man , this is a tough question to answer . Only a few short years ago we were shipping off our co-pilots as fast as we legally could to TAMI-21 and alfa tour assignments . Of course , in the omnipotent wisdom of Big Blue , by doing that we ended up being short on young A/Cs , IP/WIC candidates , etc . <p> Ops tempo remains high with a 2:1 dwell , 6-on , 1-year off deployments to everyone 's favorite desert summer camp . Of course , during your year at home , you can expect Red and Green Flag and probably a few other TDYs for **29;1951;TOOLONG , so you end up with 9 months actually home . MX rates are low , especially if you 're not in deployment spin-up , so sorties are routinely delayed and duty days extended just to meet RAP and training requirements . To be honest , the last year in between my deployments ( I 'm currently down-range ) was pretty demanding as far as hours put in at work , and it often felt futile with the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some benefits as well . <p> Pros : <p> Young guys get combat experience quickly - obviously this is dependent on involvement in OEF , but since ' 06 Bones have provided 365 coverage in the AOR . As a Capt , I will leave this deployment with over 100 combat sorties ( high # for us considering we only fly a couple lines a day out here ) and over 1200 combat hours , which was unheard of a few years ago . I do n't want to get into the " bomber-CAS " argument , but the bottom line is we employ ordinance often in theater in a CAS role and I 've had some experiences out here that have completely validated my career - hearing a panicked 20 year old tell you on the radio that your bombs just saved his life and the lives of his buddies is something you 'll never forget . If my career ends tomorrow , that alone made it worthwhile . <p> Some cool upgrades are coming down the line that will make the B-1 much easier to integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad way ) when they see our cockpit/avionics set-up and the vintage 80s technology we 're working with , augmented by jury-rigged laptops , etc . The Sniper pod was a huge upgrade for us and gives us some awesome capes that we use everyday in theater . Glass cockpit and data-link upgrades are right around the corner and will make us more lethal . If you 're worried about whether the B-1 will get to play if any other conflicts kick off around the world , do n't . We will have an active role . <p> Squadron life is pretty good - it seems to be a good mix between the super alpha-male world of fighters and the more laid-back world of most crew aircraft/heavies/etc , while still retaining a definite combat mentality . The crew aspect fosters good relationships between pilots and WSOs and bar traditions are alive and well . <p> Personally I consider the no-nuke-mission as a definite pro . I really want no part of PRP or anything that involves , and it let 's us concentrate wholly on conventional employment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both people and jets . MX personnel are tough to retain because they 're either working 12s in a 130 degree desert or working 12s at home in -30 degree snowstorms to prep for OREs/ORIs . <p> Basing options - this could be seen as a pro or a con depending on your likes and dislikes . Personally , I 'm not a fan of TX but I do n't mind Rapid City . There 's tons of stuff to do outdoors and the city is very supportive . The winters suck , though , not gon na lie about that . Bottom line about duty stations is some guys love them both , some hate them both . That 's a personal preference . <p> Unpredictability of career track - like I alluded to earlier , every year the pendulum seems to swing on the assignment thing . I really ca n't give much advice to a new arrival beyond " work hard , make your preferences known , and fill out your ADP honestly and realistically . " I would say *most* guys are getting what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , go ALO , etc . White jets are few and far between , but they 're possible . <p> Hope this helps . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> hearing a panicked 20 year old tell you on the radio that your bombs just saved his life and the lives of his buddies is something you 'll never forget . If my career ends tomorrow , that alone made it worthwhile . <p> Do n't post alot , but your statement above tells me you get it ! I spent 20yrs preparing for a time to be useful ( light grey guy ) --happy I did , loved the majority of it , and it was worthwhile also--but never had the opportunity you describe . Always remember , its about the guys on the ground .

We could choose the Commissioning Officer and the enlisted member for the first salute . <p> Best of luck w/OTS . <p> EDIT : Sorry , my lack of SA caused me to not fully read your question .

I did n't have anybody there to render my " first salute " , so I guess my actual first salute was walking across Maxwell when I got to ASBC , they clearly had somewhere to be and so did I , hence , no silver dollars were given . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> We definitely did it . Someone from our OTS class went out and got everyone a silver dollar . I think he got them for a deal and only paid around $1 for each of them . A lot of people literally gave theirs to the first person to salute them . For some , that was in the commissioning ceremony , for others it was a gate guard . My personal technique - I did n't " count " the commissioning salutes , and I had a waiver to not give the gate guard mine , because I kind of thought it was a waste .

Back in the day , the best way to ensure bombing success was to be on parameters and pickle at the appropriate time . The guys with the most quarters were the guys with the best physical flying skills . With the advent of system deliveries , it is no longer the pilots with the best skills that make the quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar , the best INS alignment , the most recent TGP boresight , and who has the best batch of BDU-33s is the one who has the tallest chip stack . On top of that , combat deliveries are now exclusively PGMs that are not as sensitive to parameters but much more dependent on things that do n't even enter the BDU-33 range brief like laser spot placement , lase-time , TLE , or target coordinate category . My experience is that good procedures and being decently on parameters will get a BDU-33 inside the HAT every time and will occasionally , luck-dependent , get a shack . Buffonery will still generate buffonerous results . Bottom line is that I do n't think the accuracy of system-delivered BDU-33s correlates well with aviating ability or trains crews well for combat success thus making the bet a side game and not much more . A new bomb bet should still punish buffonery and reward success but take the " bent fin " factor out . <p> There is one area , however , where parameters still matter : Strafe . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , you damn well better be on parameters . An updated bomb bet needs to reflect this . <p> All this said , here 's my opinion on what the " Standard Bomb Bet " for the 21st century should be : For all BDU-33 deliveries : $1 a foul/gross error , $1 a shack ... nothing else . When you move over to the strafe rag , go nickel a bullet if the range can do accoustic scoring . If not , revert to $1 a hit . The new standard bet will reinforce good/bad behavior and may even get you a burger and a beer if you have a good day . <p> Ok ... maybe that was more than a side-bar . Still ... feel free to PM me with spears or your thoughts . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> One thing to consider - go to a trophy/engraving shop and maybe have something engraved on the silver dollar/coin ?

Apparently , the tradition was still in effect as recent as 1816 , when a second lieutenant still received a $1 monthly allowance for an enlisted advisor . While the allowance does n't exist today , that enlisted advisor relationship may be where the " dollar salute " originates from . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Anyone else besides me think that the tradition should be updated ?

There 's some level of instruction ( BFM , ACM , 2 v 2 TI , CAS , two ship missions ) involved to get through the FLUG , but you ca n't do gradesheets or anything .

@@43195073 @3195073/ <h> Early ROTC Graduation <h> 8 posts in this topic <h> Guest Buckeye14 <p> Ok , so my overall question is this : What happens if you get to AS400 and you have the opportunity to finish your classes early ? I know you fill out a form 48 for AFROTC but could that be changed ? Do you have to finish out the year to complete the AS400 ROTC course ? ( I 'm assuming this is the case but I wanted to ask ) . <p> Also , I am a recent transfer student about to enter ROTC . Since I am a transfer student , I have a good chunk of hours to ease the pressure of classes in the future should I choose to take 4 years of ROTC . The reasons I am considering taking that long to graduate is so that over the next two years I can take a lighter load of classes , have a stellar GPA because of it , and give myself more time to devote to ROTC and Guard commitment while the whole time maxing my flight hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , etc . <p> While I do n't mind staying in school that long ( I 'm 21 and so have plenty of time to get a pilot slot age-wise ) , I 'd like to get people 's opinions . Should I just rush through and graduate in 3 years ? Does it hurt my chances if I start ROTC in the 200-level ? <p> I also am trying to decide between two majors . The first is a realatively easy BA major that I know I could get straight A 's in or close to it , especially if spread out over four years . The second is an Engineering course that while I will be very interested in , it will take me the full four years to finish it and I know it will be a lot tougher to pull out an awe-inspiring GPA in . The reason I am considering this is because I know it will be a challenge , and it would be a worthwhile mental pursuit . <p> I look at it like this , my first major I feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would look like a really solid candidate . I feel in that case obtaining a pilot slot would not be nearly as much of a problem . For me , that is 100% the end goal and what I 've been working my whole life towards . The only thing I would be risking is knowing that I took the easy route , and honestly from what I 've seen so far the BA degree would forever feel like it was not much of a challenge to get . has anyone else thought about this ? Thanks for any input <p> Edited September 4 , 2010 by Buckeye14 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest yousayahhyes <p> Well I am supposed to commission this December and it will be early ( waiting approval from headquarters ) My cadre said it should be no problem as it will save the air force money . I am taking an independent study with my Det commander to finish the second part of my as 400 class as I am taking the first semester class as well . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and just need to finish my AS classes . So graduating early can be done . As far as your major goes , it really does n't matter too much what it is . Sure engineering will be more of a challenge but also you risk getting lower scores and possibly no pilot slot . Generally it does n't matter but I have a friend who did not get a pilot slot because he was an electrical engineering major but have other engineering friends who did . Take that for what its worth . I am a BA major in language and I got a pilot slot and started my 200 year as well . If you are a good cadet and are involved you will be fine . It just depends on what you really want to do . If you want to be an engineer then go for it but if your ultimate goal is to be a pilot then take whatever will give you the best opportunity for being a pilot and something you will be interested in . That is not to say your taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , sure they matter but if you have anywhere in the 3.2 or higher range than your grades are fine . Your commanders ranking is huge but if you have good grades this will help . I would say go for whatever you feel you would be most interested in . As long as you keep pretty good grades then you will be fine . As far as how long to stay and graduating early , you compete your junior year for a pilot slot . If you start at the 200 year and get a field training slot this summer then you will still have two years as a POC so three years total . Hope this helps .

I still ca n't figure out why the Current Ops guys have a sortie count that is 227 higher than mine , but only 91.3 hours higher though ! ! ! Something is askew ! <p> JAATTs are joint ( of course ) , but only one customer pays for any given JAATT in its entirety . It 's usually the other service , since we are typically serving a support role , but sometimes Big Blue pays the bill . You hear the term " JAATT buy " , but that 's a little misleading - that refers to the quaterly ( or whatever timeframe ) meeting that USAF units ' JAATT reps ( usually the Current Ops folks ) and the USA/USN/USMC reps get together and lay out their scheduled training they need joint support for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , based on O/M hours available , training reqmts , and $ available . In that sense , I 'm not " buying a JAATT " in the financial sense , I 'm buying the responsibility to cover it - I 've agreed to support it . Who actually pays the bills for the whole thing is/can be addressed separately ( based on who needs what more ) . However , if the USAF unit is paying for the JAATT , that money is always O/M , never TWCF . It is training after all ... <p> That 's the easiest way to delineate TWCF and O/M . O/M is always about training , even if joint . TWCF is always real-world , off-station mission support , whether it 's joint or USAF . <p> FCF/OCF are O/M . AFAIK , MAF exercises are also always O/M . <p> The primary difference about SAAMs versus Channels are that SAAMs are not routine misions ( schedule or otherwise ) , for instance , all BANNER missions are SAAMs . Channels are typically routinely &amp; regularly scheduled off-station support missions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread the wealth around units . Once the channels drop from TACC , bases/units can horse-trade with each other ( with TACC 's nod ) to accomodate local scheduling issues . <p> SAAMs and Channels are ALWAYS from TWCF money . <p> Contingency is a whole different pot of money aside from TWCF and O/M . <p> That 's a nutshell explanation from what I remember years ago as a barrelmaster , I never did work Current Ops -level scheduling , so I am certainly no expert on this stuff ... <p> If you want to real story , sit down with AndyMac and have him explain it to you -- the flying hours program is THE meat-and-potatoes of any airlift DO 's administrative responsibilities . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Hydro130 <p> PM me if you 're still confused . I was an Airlift Director in the 374th a while back . I du n no if things changed since 2002 though . <p> Coasta <p> Good call . <p> I forgot to mention that the JAATT-buy process in PACAF is an abortion ( well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) compared to how it " should " work . Progress was being made , but it was still unbelieveably painful . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest arcnav <p> Theoretically , TWCF funds are reimbursed soon after a unit provides airlift . Users ( i.e. the Army , USMC , etc ) are given money needed for Trans costs at the begining of the year , and are supposed to use that money to " buy " airlift , which means " reimburse " the unit providing the airlift . <p> DoD takes the money for anticipated trans costs ( submitted by users for the FY ) and gives to individual units to " buy " airlift from AMC . Then when those units get their airlift , they are billed and the money is put into the TWCF account since the TWCF money is what was used to provide the airlift . <p> What typically happenend ( until around 2001 ) , was that at the end of the year the USAF would pay O&amp;M $$ into TWCF to make up the shortfall from not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for undercharging routes ( TWCF loses money -- used to be .01/lb and $1.00/seat -- on channel missions ) , and for the training received from flying TWCF missions . <p> When I got off AD , however , TWCF was actually not only being reimbursed fully , but actually making money ( which is a no-no for a revolving fund , and causing the Army , USMC and other users to demand a " refund " ) . In the past however , USAF O&amp;M money was used to make up those shortfalls , and we never heard the USMC and USA offer to help make the difference . <p> Also , SAAM 's were reimbursed around 90% since we got " training " on those missions in addition to providing a service . I think channels were ( on average ) recovering about 70% of actual cost in the late 90 's . <p> I hope this makes sense ... I just polished off a bottle of 04 Cabernet Franc and am reminiscening about when I used to teach a TWCF class ( that 's actually why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

My boyfriend graduates OTS here in November , and we are n't quite sure where we 'll be stationed for UPT ( hopefully Vance , or Witchita Falls for ENJPT . ) I know everyone says to get married cause AF life is easier that way , but we 're just not ready for that . What I want to know is if girlfriends are welcome to the ' officer spouse 's club ' functions .

Here at Vance , it was explained to me that the OSC did not include girlfriends . I actually ran into a problem because my last name did n't match my husbands , so they automatically assumed that I was a girlfriend and was told it was a " no-no " to belong if I was a girlfriend . That was when a group of girls started the Student Officers ' Spouses ' Club .

I love my man to death and by the time he starts UPT ( July 06 ) we may already be married . But I think its snotty for girlfriends to be excluded from the officer wives club . I 'm a fun girl and just wan na meet some people and hang out with . I 'll be in the city and hanging around wether I 'm invited to tea or not ... but I REALLY WAN NA BE INVITED TO THE TEA PARTIES ! hehe , okay anyway , y'all do n't ' hate on me ' I 'm just trying to figure out how I 'm going to survive in a strange place , but the ultimate answer to that question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invites me to their club or meetings , I will be with my best friend and the love of my life .

I would n't put so much emphasis on making it into the Officer 's Spouses Club(s) . There will likely be at least a few girlfriends/wives you can make friends with in your man 's class without having to look at the BIG picture of joining clubs on base . There will be plenty of time for that kind of thing in the future when you get to a base permanently ( well , as permanent as the AF can get ) . <p> This may step on some toes ... but sometimes those clubs are a little overrated . I 've been to a couple of the gatherings and went home not feeling like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well been my own fault . Maybe I did n't " put myself out there " like I should 've . <p> Over all , it 's important to pick your friends wisely while your man is in pilot training because even though the classmates grow to be quite close during that year ... they are still competing for their assignments in the end . <p> Wives can become very involved in " getting the scoop " on other classmates performance , assignment hopes , and attitudes towards others in the class . So just know that if you are at a function with other wives , what you say will most surely get back to their husbands and eventually back to yours ... and usually completely different from what you originally said ! <p> My advice ? ? Make good friends while you are there ... have a great time , but know that in the end , friends that you thought you had made may fade away when competition gets the best of the friendship . Sorry if I step on toes , but I bet the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband has either been in this same situation or witnessed it within their class . <p> Good luck and do n't stress ... you 'll find a niche and have a good time ! <p> V. <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Wives can become very involved in " getting the scoop " on other classmates performance , assignment hopes , and attitudes towards others in the class .

I have made friends during UPT , at training bases , at PCS bases and recently the few months my husband went through PIT . Is there competition at UPT sure , but we are still friends with a lot of people we went through UPT with . Did we want a certain plane , location , etc. yes , but I also wanted others to do well too . Also , our squadron includes fiancees and girlfriends in activities and the wives groups are what you make of it . Most of the time if you are friendly others will be friendly . In the Air Force make friends when you can because when your husband deploys ( and he will ) you 'll need as many friends as you can get to pass the time . <p> 08 .

Once the seal is cracked , there 's no amount of superglue that will put the cap back on ( kind of like a bottle of weed ) . <p> You will never know how good a pilot anyone is , including your own hubby/BF .

Timing is everything and the type of aircraft someone flys has nothing to do with their skill as a pilot .

It will also get back to all of the other people in their class . If you think you may embarass yourself and/or your significant other with what you have to say , do n't say it . Gossip is a no-no , and for obvious reasons . I 've seen it backfire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close relationship between classmates has been ruined at spouses ' club meetings . <p> Another thing to add --&gt; no matter how good your intentions are , you are not going to be able to do anything to enhance your sig other 's career . Kissing heinie only makes you look foolish , and has the opposite effect of what you had hoped for . <p> Hate on me if that makes you feel better , but I 've been there , done that . Let the guys/gals do it on their own , and use the clubs to make friends and kvetch about the hardships of being a spouse . It 's not your career , and you can be supportive without interfering . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest homewith4 <p> I think G/F are welcome at informal stuff ( most of the fun ones are informal ) . As far as the OSC , there are still some places where an o'club membership is required to be an OSC member . You may certainly go as a guest of a member several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

What has happened to you or someone you know that makes you feel that way ? <p> I do want to point out a grim reality of the profession . You will not be treated as next of kin in a worst case scenario unless you have a marriage license . That may seem unfair , but it would probably take an act of congress to change it .

A Flight Engineer is an enlisted flying position . It is not a rated position , as only officers can be rated . The Flight Engineer is responsible to the Aircraft Commander for in-flight aircraft systems operation and troubleshooting , as well as computing takeoff and landing data ( TOLD ) . <p> Flight Engineers used to be essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new technology , the Flight Engineer is becoming extinct . Little black boxes and computers are replacing Flight Engineers , just as they did to the Navigators . New aircraft being built today incorporate a 2-person cockpit concept , including only a pilot and copilot . Computers and advanced systems now perform all tasks the Flight Engineer used to perform . <p> I am now a pilot . I can tell you that nothing I accomplished as a Flight Engineer transferred to my pilot world . My engineer flight hours do not count towards my total pilot hours , nor do my years of aviation experience as a Flight Engineer count . In fact , my flight pay went DOWN when I became a pilot because the enlisted and the officer flight pay systems do not complement each other . Pilot flight pay is determined by years of rated service . I sure wish the Flight Engineer was a rated position for that reason . <p> That being said , I have all the respect in the world for enlisted flight crewmembers and I have never regretted the path I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flight Engineer experience , as well as my Crew Chief experience has given me greater air sense and situational awareness . And by the way , I am proof that engineers can fly airplanes . I agree with crewdawg though , you 've got to cut the applicants off somewhere . The Air Force trains the best and college is just one more step in the process to make you the best . <p> " ABM 's will be rated when they attend a graduate level E-3/E-8 FTU course that leads to the award of the aeronautical rating or designation . " <p> Although observers wear the same wings that navigators wear , they have a distinct and separate rating , unlike EWO and WSO who are rated navigators . They get their rating after graduating from " NASA Mission Specialist training " . <p> " When an AF member qualifies for the Astronaut qualifier , the Astronaut Qualifier symbol may be worn ( superimposed ) on the rated badge they are eligible to wear . This is not a separate USAF rating .

It used to be that engs had to do a tour as a maitenance troop and then they could crosstrain . Now they are accepting applicants from all AFSCs , but you still ca n't do it right out of basic training . You have to have time in . <p> 2 ) It is almost certain that they wo n't be training new engineers by the time you would be able to cross train . The AF is trying to buy J-models and slots for engineers have been dwindling for years . <p> 3 ) If you were to become a flight engineer , you would have to reenlist .

Not a slam on loads but it will be harder to get picked up as a fixed wing FE without any Aircraft MX experience . The exception would be if you have a civilian A&amp;P or a civilian pilot 's license . Some guys I know with a break in service like yours joined as a crew chief for a few years , got to know the airplane and the crews and then applied for and got hired as a FE . So basically , do the MX thing first . You will be glad that you did in the end especially if your end goal is to be a FE . It is possible to still become a FE , but not right away . Good luck ! JG 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Boom <p> I 've heard FE 's do n't come straight out of Basic Training but are retrainees from other career fields . <p> Fixed wing FE 's ( KC-10 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They come from " feeder " AFSC 's like Maintenance , Missile Maintenance , Vehicle Maintenance , etc . You can get a waiver if you do n't come out of a feeder careerfield . Helo 's as of last year when I retrained you can come straight into as a new Airman . I have a Airman Basic in my Enlisted Undergraduate Aircrew Course ( EAUC ) at Lackland who was going to be a helo Engineer . <p> What careers have you had before becoming a FE ? <p> N/A I 'm a Boom . But had Engineers in my last squadron ( C-130 's ) and they loved their jobs . Except with the pending doom of the J-Model coming . <p> What is the deployment rate and does your career field effect family life ? <p> Depends on your airframe . But it 's pretty much set in stone you 'll be deployed alot no matter what airframe you pick . <p> Are you able to take classes/college courses ? <p> Alot of Engineers already have their bachelors degree and I knew one with a masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TDY 's , schools , etc . <p> What are your likes and dislikes about being a FE ? <p> I 'm not a Engineer but they are phasing them out . That probably would be one dislike . <p> What is the Enlisted Aircrew Undergraduate Course ? <p> It 's a course designed to washout new Airmen who probably would n't hack it trying to be a Enlisted flyer . So before the AF spends big money on them to go through training they go there . As a retrainee you 'll be extremely bored learning what the difference is between a C-130 and a KC-135 . <p> What was Combat Survival School like ? <p> You go hiking in the woods , then you get caught . Everyone gets caught . <p> What was Tech School like for your airframe ? <p> I know you go to wonderful Altus AFB for Basic Flight Engineer school , then your airframe 's FTU after that if you 're fixed wing . Du n no about helos . <p> Was there a high washout rate for any of these schools ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on fixed wing or helos , or is this assigned based on AF needs ? <p> When you retrain you put down the AFSC 's you want then you put down the bases you want to go to . You 'll find out your base before you start retraining . And actually since you 're overseas you 'll PCS to your incoming base before you even retraining as an Engineer . I found out I was going to be a KC-135 Boom before I even started retraining . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Boom beat me to alot of the questions , but since I already typed them out here ya ' go .... <p> I 've heard FE 's do n't come straight out of Basic Training but are retrainees from other career fields . What careers have you had before becoming a FE ? <p> This is true for the most part . They did put a few guys through the FE pipeline straight out of Basic ( fixed wing ) , but 99% are retrainees . Most FE 's have a maintainence AFSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've met FE 's that were prior POL , cops , medical and admin guys . <p> What is the deployment rate and does your career field effect family life ? <p> Depends . Different airframes have different deployment rates . C-130 guys do n't fall into the typical AEF rotation and are deploying to the AOR quite often , roughly 4 months there and 8-12 months home . KC-10 and C-5 guys are home more often but are out on the road for weeks at a time . Helo 's and AFSOC guys deploy quite often also . AWACS ... not much lately . <p> Family life is the same as any other career field that deploys ... if you have a strong marriage then it is the standard stuff . For those of us that are Mil to Mil it is a little tougher when your spouse is deployed and you have to juggle work , flying , kids ect ... but it can be done . <p> What are your likes and dislikes about being a FE ? <p> Likes : Working with some very professional dudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the job done is a great feeling . And no matter what anyone else tells you , when you put a flight suit on , you are treated a little differently ( whether better or worse depends , but mostly better ) . When you go TDY you are travelling with officers and they like to stay at nice hotels and know how to party . <p> Dislikes : Nothing big enough to list here ... you know the standard stuff , deployments , additional duties ect . We 're not being phased out too quickly though , but the writing is on the wall . It will be many years before we are gone because they still have to replace the KC-10 , AWACS , C-5 , C-130 's and helo 's . Oh , the Osprey has 2 FE 's , so they 'll be around for awhile . <p> What is the Enlisted Aircrew Undergraduate Course ? <p> 2 week class down at Lackland where they teach you about being in the Enlisted Aircrew career field . Learn about airplanes and 781 forms and career path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be pretty easy ( good opportunity to party ) . <p> What was Combat Survival School like ? <p> A blast . Search this forum ... I think there are a few threads about survival school . Down and dirty ... 2 weeks of classroom , hiking in the woods , learning really cool stuff and playing POW . <p> What was Tech School like for your airframe ? Was there a high washout rate for any of these schools ? <p> Basic Flight Engineer course . 6 weeks at Altus where you will learn basic aircraft systems and theory , takeoff and landing data , forms , weight and balance . A long time ago this used to have a high washout rate but with the shortage of FE 's that is no longer the case . I 'm not saying they made it easier but they give you every opportunity to get through it . At the FTU course you might get 1 or 2 that wash out either in the sim phase or the flying phase . Flying is n't for everyone and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go to your particular airframe schoolhouse . Herks are here at Little Rock . AWACS is Tinker , C-5 's at Altus , KC-10 's I think is at Maquire . Lenght of course depends on airframe . Herk one is 3 months at the schoolhouse and then a month in one of the training squadrons where you will fly with an instructor . <p> Do FE 's get to choose wether to work on fixed wing or helos , or is this assigned based on AF needs ? <p> You can contact our functional at Randolph and tell him what you 'd like to go to , although as always , needs of the AF come first . But they are pretty good with working with you to get what you want . <p> PM me and I can try to answer any more questions for ya ' . Overall I 'd say it 's one of the best career fields in the Air Force for an enlisted guy .

The MiG 's had used slash and run attacks to which they were well suited , to avoid the air-to-air armed Phantom fighters and to press their attacks against the heavily bomb-laden F-105 's . They scored their first kill in October of 1966 and in December had shot down two attacking F-105 Thunderchiefs . More importantly though , the small number of MiG 's , being able to carefully pick their battles , and operating from the safety of airfields that the US military was not allowed to attack , caused 20% of all strike sorties to jettison their weapons prior to attacking their targets . <p> But what if a plan could be put into place to fool the North Vietnamese into attacking a strike force of Thunderchiefs , that turned out not to be heavy strike aircraft , but air-to-air armed Phantoms - ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guest <p> Thanks Mike , that 's a great picture and it really says all that needs to be said about the foundation of leadership . <p> The O-6 leading and the O-1s thru O-4s who are looking on with rapt attention and ready to follow him anywhere and do absolutely anything he said . <p> Can you imagine a Chief walking in on that scene and making some stupid fucking comment about mustaches or sleeves or ball caps ?

Knowing this , I 'm going to make sure to try to keep a lid on my need to feel significant around my peers . <p> Does anyone else have anything to add on to here ? <p> Coming from a know-nothing ROTC cadet , this list is absolutely spot on . You essentially hit every point of the program on the head and minus the prior-E items I think every ROTC cadet should read and live by this . <p> Now , I highlighted 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare opportunity to give back to the Air Force in very small but critical way . Most cadets who join the program know precisely zip about how the AF or the military in general works and only learn through the minimal exposure that ROTC gives us . With your AD experience you have valuable insight into how the " real " AF operates , and that puts you in a position to help better prepare folks who have n't commissioned yet . <p> My advice , take advantage of this opportunity and use your experience to mentor your fellow cadets . Give them insight into what its like on AD and tell them the sort of things you saw leaders do that worked/did n't . Give them real world perspectives they might not have thought of during discussions and GLPs . Help them out with simple things like uniforms and customs &amp; courtesies ( yes I know it sucks but it is " the mission " in ROTC ) . And most of all be a good bro and treat your cadets like you would your fellow Airmen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see your occupation badge on LLAB 1 . So , set a good example for the new cadets and very quickly you 'll become the go-to dude for help on the things they 're learning especially during Field Training Prep . And as you reach POC status you can jump in and talk about some of the lessons your AS instructor is teaching from first hand accounts . Again , as long as you 're humble and approachable you can make a difference in your det . <p> The reward here is you 'll get tremendous respect from your peers , POC , and the cadre , and the AF may get higher quality new 2nd Lts from your Det . This increases the chances of them going off and fixing their corners of the AF and hopefully one day becoming generals who care about the mission and will help stomp out the shoe mentality . <p> That 's my 2 cents .

Realize the most of the cadets will have zero exposure to the actual military , a lot will have done JROTC and some will have done CAP . However , ROTC can become one of those domino effect deals where you have people just implementing something based on some other policy another cadet had implemented and it turns into insanity that has no resemblance or usefulness to the military . I would use our prior-E guys as a resource for sanity checks when things just started becoming retarded , and they usually had zero tolerance for such BS and would speak their mind anyways .

" It can be done either way , but the enlisted guys will get looked at first . My own personal opionion , I wish I would have enlisted . <p> Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Great way to spread yourself out to get that slot . <p> Fifth , ahh hell , I could write a book here on how to go about trying to get a slot , but if you want to talk more just PM me .

PCSM , AFOQT , etc to make sure the people selected met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a waiver was needed and then write a staff summary sheet and start it in the waiver loop , which is a 90-150 day process it seems . Of course , not everyone needs a waiver , so those that are otheriwse eligible and have everything ( AETC approved flight physical seems to be a common holdup ) they approve it and give out the dates . <p> IIRC , they were processing them first-come , first-served but that was a couple of years ago now . Do n't know how the " new " guy is handling it ( sts ) . We had one guy who was waiting on a vision waiver and passed the age limit while his package was at NGB , so they just re-wrote the SSS and added a caveat for the age limit . Having seen that process ... does n't sound like they give priority to age-critical folks , as there is always a backlog of age-critical folks so none of the young pups would ever get a class date if that was the case . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was selected in August 2003 as a FY05 pilot . In October 03 I completed and passed the flight physical . Then I sat and waited until October 04 when I finally wsa told to come and swear in as an E-3 . I signed all the paperwork that I needed to sign ( ones saying that I am not gay , that I am not addicted to drugs , etc ... ) then the packet sat on someones desk until Jan when they finally decided that they should send it to State HQ , then they approved it and then they sent it to NGB . <p> This is how things work at the 108th and NJ , I do n't  know if its like that everywhere but that 's how things went for me . Now remeber I am not prior service either and I live 6 hours away , so I may have been forgot about because I did harass them , then again I was told that I was select for FY05 which starts in October 04 and goes to September 05 . <p> Its been alot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rolling along now , and hopefully I will be in the May AMS class .

The fact that you 're prior service will help . The odds that it will all happen in time are not good .

I , however , had to wait for a medical waiver and my security clearance took a full year . The sooner you can start talking to the recruiters at all the units you 're interested in , the better .

Just found out that my waiver for contact lenses wont be approved . After serching on this site I think that I might be in the limits for the vision waiver for the AF . <p> So here is my question : <p> -Does the ANG or AFRES have someone like the OSO ( Marine Officer Selection Officer ) to help a candidate put together their packet ? The enlisted ANG recruiter that I talked to just gave me a list of things to have for my packet but no contact info or how to get the items completed . <p> -The enlisted recruiter also said that I would not get a flight physical until I had been accepted by a unit .

LOTS of folks on here have been through the process . Read and search this board and the aviation jobs listings at baseops.net , and if your questions still remain unanswered , we 'd be happy to help you out . <p> There is no specific person for the ANG to help you get your stuff together , but a lot of units typically have websites with all of the requirements listed ( NH , AK , ME , VT all have good Officer Hiring pages on their websites - you should check them out ) as well as a POC . The POC is usually either the chief pilot , DO , or a new pilot who 's responsibility is to collect the apps and make sure they are complete before they meet the board . They are also a good source of info . <p> I will caveat that by saying do n't call them and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call them ( I 'm one of them for now ) and ask them a question that is clearly stated on the website , you are wasting everyone 's time . Plenty of folks out there are able to find the answers on their own and take the initiative . <p> It 's not a secret .

@@43195090 @3195090/ <h> Air Force vs Navy <h> 40 posts in this topic <h> Guest WannaFly4Life <p> Hey , I was just wondering what you all think about the pilot selection between Air Force and the Navy . I know the Navy has more planes then the air force , and they Navy gives " extra points " to people with technical degrees . I also know that the air force acceptance rate is around 55% . What are all of your thoughts on which branch it is easier to fly for ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Xtndr50boom <p> Keep in mind , both services offer outstanding opportunities for some really exotic poontang . But the AF strat-lifters seem to have the best deal ; they 're not stuck in tents for months on end like the other communities , and by the time the girls in any one spot realize they 've all been banged by a guy who has 15 different names but all look alike you 'll be gear up/feet up going to Hawaii for 18 hours of drunken debauchery with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your choice .... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest kirkhac <p> I do n't think anyone here will really be able to answer your question very well about which is easier to get a pilot slot through . There was a Navy guy in my class at Corpus that cross-commissioned from the Air Force to get a Navy pilot slot but that was a medical issue . I think the requirements and competition will be similar whichever route you take . To rephrase what some others have already said so eloquintly , you should decide what type of flying you want to do and make your choice from there . The easiest route is n't always the best so that should n't really factor too much into your decision . If you have questions about Navy vs . Air Force training there are plenty of guys here that can answer any question you have . Good luck . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As for which branch is easier to fly for ... depends on what you mean " easier " I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Navy we have NATOPS- a thick book that tells us the things we are not allowed to do in the aircraft . <p> Appearently the Air Force has -1 which is a thicker book which tells of everything a pilot is allowed to do in the aircraft . <p> There are pros and cons with each service but , like someone said earlier , apply to both and jump on the first offer you get .

As I understand it , both fly differently . <p> In the Navy we have NATOPS- a thick book that tells us the things we are not allowed to do in the aircraft . <p> Appearently the Air Force has -1 which is a thicker book which tells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are pros and cons with each service but , like someone said earlier , apply to both and jump on the first offer you get .

Flying for either one would be an honor . <p> The NATOPS and the -1 are not regulations that tell you what you can or can not do . They are the flight manuals that tell about the systems of the plane , etc . The Navy 's regulations about what they can and can not do come from the FAR/AIM and the Air Force has the 11-217 vols 1 and 2 , 11-202 vol 3 , 11X-### , etc and many , many more regulations . <p> It may seem cool to have less regulations and less people looking over your shoulder when you go fly until you have any IP who wants to go fly a low level VFR beneath 500 ' ceilings and then continue said low level in the weather at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling agency and without a map . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest HH-60H <p> First off , I am in the Navy , but I did Phase 1 and 2 of JSUPT at Vance , so I am about as close as you can get to having done both , without having done all of both . <p> Second , to answer wanna 's questions , I would say that the AF gives you a better chance to fly . In my UPT class , there were many officers who started in other AFOSCs ( is that right ? ) who then went on to become pilots . In my mind that gives me the impression that overall there is a better chance to fly that the Navy . However , I know several people in the Navy who started as other things and became pilots . In fact the CO of my last sqdn did that . Now if you are looking to fly FW , then AF is overall the better shot , IMO . <p> Third , the Navy does not treat aviators as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not sure where you had that experience FourFans . If it was in flight school , then yes , SNA 's do get treated like major crap , even worse than SP 's in the AF . Once you get your wings and hit the fleet it 's a whole other story . <p> Fourth , the NATOPS does in fact contain regulations regarding how to operate the aircraft , in addition to being flight manuals . The Navy 's primary flight reg is OPNAV 3710 ( NATOPS ) , which in a few cases supercedes the FAR/AIM , and obviously totally does when we are sea . <p> Fifth , when I first looked at my -1 it sure was hard to find things , because I did n't know where to look , but once I learned how it was setup , it was easy .... just like the NATOPS . <p> If anyone would like to clear up the misconceptions of the Navy , feel free to PM me anytime . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> HH-60 : Yes , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , but also from what the IPs told me as well . Obviously , I 'm not in the Navy so I do n't have a good vantage point to speak from . <p> What really looked bad to me was the career progression . Please correct me if I 'm wrong , but it sounded like after your first tour as an aviator in the fleet , you are required to do a surface ( non-flying ) tour , then an instructor tour , then if you 're lucky , you get to go back to the fleet to fly operationally . If that 's right , it that just does seem like a good development track to get experienced aviators , IMHO . <p> Please fill in all the blanks I left open ( sts ) . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest HH-60H <p> The career track you mentioned is close . After your first fleet tour , you have shore tour ( which is what I am on now ) , it may or may not be a flying tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely ) ship/sea tour . After that I would go fly again in a sqdn . While that does not make the best pilot , we are shooting for developing a naval officer , and like it or not the navy is not all about aviation , so it is important that we learn the other stuff . Whereas warfighting in the AF is all about aviation . <p> However , this has nothing to do with us being 2nd/3rd class citizens . I ca n't count how many times I have a fellow 0-1/2/3 mention how they wanted to fly but .... While I am not qualified to say it , I would say alot of other officers in other warfare communities wish they could run things like we do in aviation , not just the flying , but unit morale and atmosphere among other things . <p> It 's hard to explain . It 's not like the pilot/nav relationship I observed at Vance . It 's more like we are equal BUT ... <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest silvereagle <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sound egocentric but that is my dream and I have been pursuing for it for the past 4 years of my life . So here is my question ; which branch has more percentage of getting a fighter slot ? I have always thought that it would be cool to fly in the navy because of the carrier landings . In addition , a naval chopper is not a bad alternative compare to heavy ( cargos ) in the AF . I have to decide this pretty soon because I have to choose either the AFROTC or NROTC since I was accepted to attend Embry Riddle Aeronautical University . Any thoughts will be appreciated .

They practically shoved them down our throats . Maybe that has changed or maybe that has absolutely no bearing on your decision . Just something to think about if you need someone else to pick up the tab at ERAU . <p> Also in my personal experience , the people in navy ROTC going to flight school were definitely not in the top of their class . I do n't know how their cadidiates are selected , but it seemed a lot easier than the AF . I hear navy flight school is more fun , though . <p> I say ' in my personal experience ' for that exact reason ... this is just what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lots of things to think about besides which pretty airplane is best . Good luck with your decision . <p> -Pilot slots are a little tougher to get in the AF than the Navy . AF UPT is regimented and tough . <p> -As a young pilot right out of FTU , you can expect to fly for three assignments before being assigned to a non-flying staff gig . That 's basically eight to ten years of flying . <p> -The AF has more airplanes than the Navy . That includes fighters . <p> Navy- <p> -The Navy is just that , a maritme service . <p> -A pilot slot in the Navy is a little easier to get . <p> -Navy flight school is easier in that it runs on the big boy program and you do n't have a set graduation date . <p> -Flexible grad dates are also a bad thing . Navy guys in the jet track train almost two years before they get their wings and a good portion of that time is spent sitting on your butt ( reference movable grad date ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot , you 'll be a naval aviator . <p> -You will have to rotate ship and ground tours every assignment . <p> -You can expect to pull non-flying gigs aboard boats since you are a naval officer . <p> -The Navy has a small percentage of guys that go jets . Around 60-70% of Navy pilots fly helos . <p> -There are some fun missions in Navy helos like ASW and SAR . But you can expect to spend plenty of time hauling trash between boats . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Totally true man . And if you have your private license before starting w/ the Navy , they 'll guarantee you fighters ( because they do n't have to waste time with teaching you easy stuff like how to manipulate flight controls and what it means to fly without running out of gas ... that sort of stuff ) . Of course you can still choose to fly helos , but anyone with a license before Navy flight training would just be wasting their skillz . <p> 03 .

When my class went through API ( Navy version of Slackademics , and very much a weed-out program ) , it was announced that they were pilot-heavy and anyone with less than a 55 NSS ( Naval Standard Score ) in API would be removed from trianing . A 55 was a really good score ( 35 was the min to graduate and anything over 60 usually allowed you your pick of aircraft ) . Since your NSS is , in a way , partially based on the performance of your peers , this led to lots of competition and stress . Lots of good dudes washed out . Later , as I was getting ready to PCS , the word was they were once again pilot-heavy and were flat out dumping dudes right and left ( first offering no-strings-attached separation , but what Ensign/LT wants to get out when they 've been in less than 3 months to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally I liked it much better . Less restrictive , less queepy , and more of an emphasis on tactics . Training was nice too - the Navy does n't spoon-feed you or force you to study . They provide you with the instruction you need , clear expectations for every sortie , and leave it up to you to sink or swim ( no pun intended ) on your own . <p> From talking to my Navy AD friends though , it catches up with you in the fleet . Quality of life is definitively worse than the AF . Talking to a Tomcat RIO right before they were decomissioned , I asked him how he enjoyed his recent cruise . He said , " I sleep in a room that 's over 100 degrees at night ( his bunk was a foot or two away from a steam or hot water pipe or something ) , and I spend 14-16 hours a day working/flying while we 're underway . I hardly ever see my family .

I 'm feeling sick just thinking about it ... <p> ( poster 's real experience ) When I got to fly on an MH-53 , I remember the noise , the shakiness , and the absolute blast I had . I also remember as I was sitting on a makeshift bunk looking up and seeing hydraulic fluid leaking out . I tapped the shoulder of one of the gunners and pointed out the leak . He yelled back in my ear , " It always does that ! The only time we 're concerned is when it is n't leaking . That means we 're out of hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a saying in the Corps about the -53 : <p> " If it ai n't leaking , it ai n't flying ! " <p> Even the grunts knew that one . I once had a Marine infantry company 1st Sgt ( that 's a rank in the Corps ( E-8 ) as well as a billet , for those of you who did n't know ) waving frantically at me in-flight to get my attention . When I got to him , he was really upset that there were no leaks in the cabin while we were flying . I had to explain to him that the aircraft was nearly brand-new - we had just picked it up from Sikorsky a couple months prior , and it had less than 50hrs on it . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You know the Navy flies off of ships for like 6 months at a time , right ?

Your goal of becoming a fighter pilot is impressive and a fine way to serve your country . As you requested , I 'd be happy to share some insight into which service would be the best choice . <p> Each service has a distinctly different culture .

All pilots are groomed to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-notch and extremely well maintained . Their facilities are excellent . Their enlisted personnel are the brightest and the best trained . The USAF is homogenous and macro . No matter where you go , you 'll know what to expect , what is expected of you , and you 'll be given the training &amp; tools you need to meet those expectations . You will never be put in a situation over your head . Over a 20-year career , you will be home for most important family events . Your Mom would want you to be an Air Force pilot ... so would your wife . Your Dad would want your sister to marry one . <p> Navy Snapshot : Aviators are part of the Navy , but so are Black shoes ( surface warfare ) and bubble heads ( submariners ) . Furthermore , the Navy is split into two distinctly different Fleets ( West and East Coast ) . The Navy is heterogeneous and micro . Your squadron is your home ; it may be great , average , or awful . A squadron can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will spend months preparing for cruise and months on cruise . The quality of the aircraft varies directly with the availability of parts . Senior Navy enlisted are salt of the earth ; you 'll be proud if you earn their respect . Junior enlisted vary from terrific to the troubled kid the judge made join the service . You will be given the opportunity to lead these people during your career ; you will be humbled and get your hands dirty . The quality of your training will vary and sometimes you will be over your head . You will miss many important family events . There will be long stretches of tedious duty aboard ship . You will fly in very bad weather and/or at night and you will be scared many times . You will fly with legends in the Navy and they will kick your ass until you become a lethal force .

Does n't mean your situation is the same , just related . <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some feedback . First , you 're not concerned with a Flying Class II at this time ( trained pilot ) . You need to get a Flying Class I waiver ( UPT applicant ) . I can tell you that in my experience , I 've never recalled someone with PTSD applying for UPT . I would assume that this is mostly due to the fact that the vast majority of UPT applicants do n't have prior military experience . It 's my gut feeling ( and it 's purely speculation ) that you may not be DQ 'd outright , but you 'd likely be heavily scrutinized . <p> PTSD is disqualifying for all aviation duties in the USAF . It is not mentioned specifically in AFI 48-123 for FC I/IA , II or III , but would be covered under the general category of anxiety . It is mentioned specifically in the UAS section as disqualifying . It would be wise to limit waivers to those with six months of sustained remission and off all pharmacotherapy . <p> *Must clearly demonstrate complete resolution of all PTSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentation from mental health providers . <p> #Must be reviewed by the ACS prior to consideration for a waiver . <p> AIMWTS review in December 2009 revealed a total of 36 aviator cases submitted with a diagnosis of PTSD .

Note that UCMJ charges can trump an MEB or normal administrative separation . JAG rulings will dictate what happens to the member and the MDG will not be much of a shield . <p> First understand that PTSD is a potentially " unsuiting " condition rather than " unfitting , " meaning the Commander first has the option to administratively separate the member . For Enlisted , the standard is AFI 36-3208 , para . 5.11.10. , which has very specific procedures for any ENLISTED member with PTSD that is negatively impacting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFFICERS with PTSD instead fall under AFI 36-3206 , para . 2.2.6. and 2.3.7 . Essentially , OFFICERS COULD be discharged much faster than ENLISTED , however they SHOULD receive the same level of care and treatment while still within the Military Healthcare System ( MHS ) . In my experience , OFFICER and ENLISTED PTSD cases both undergo substantial scrutiny and personnel are given significant access to treatment and other resoources--noone to my knowledge has been rushed out of the service for PTSD . However it could conceivably happen to an OFFICER if an especially callous Commander and the local Chief of the Medical Staff ( MDG/SGH ) made it so . Once separated/retired , all Airmen certainly do receive the same level of care through the VA ( presuming you consider the VA capable of actually providing any semblance of care amid their intense incompetence ) . <p> Note that administrative separation does not prohibit a servicemembers benefits within the Disability Evaluation System ( DES ) , but that it only circumvents the normal Medical Evaluation Board processing . An administrative separation does not cheat the member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not for UCMJ charges or some other form of dishonorable discharge . See DoDI 1332.38 for more info--Enclosure 4 is most applicable , but observe that Enclosure 5 does NOT list PTSD . <p> If a Commander chooses not to pursue administrative separation because in their opinion the member 's PTSD is not substantially " unsuiting " for duty , the MDG can still pursue an MEB for an " unfitting " condition at the discretion of the Flight Doc/PCM , Chief of Aerospace Medicine ( MDG/SGP ) , and the MDG/SGH per AFI 48-123 and the Medical Standards Directory ( MSD ) . Applicable standards include MSD , para . Q7 , which states : " Mental Health conditions associated with recurrent duty impairment . " There are other applicable standards within Section Q of the MSD , but you get the gist . <p> If the MEB does n't medically retire the member ( usually by retention on ALC ) or the MDG does n't pursue MEB because the condition is n't significant enough to prevent ground duties , the Flight Doc and MDG/SGP would still likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q18 , which state : " PTSD/ASD/Adjustment Disorder/other Specified Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder that interferes with safety of flight/controlling/alert or if member is unable to return to full duty within 60 days of diagnosis ( minor residual symptoms are acceptable ) . " &amp; " PTSD/Adjustment Disorder/other Specified Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder if greater than 60 days , or if member experiences a recurrence of debilitating symptoms upon return to the operational environment . " The first step is applying for a flight waiver . <p> For flight waiver approval , ALL personnel MUST be evaluated by the Aeromedical Consultation Service ( ACS ) , which usually requires a TDY at WPAFB in addition to any previous treatment/consultation . A review of AIMWTS shows that only about a third of all cases are granted a waiver . If a member is retained but permanently DQ 'd from flight duty ( waiver denied ) , they would undergo personnel force shaping programs for possible AFSC re-assignment , becoming an AFPC function . For PTSD waiver consideration , the member must stable and symptom for AT LEAST 6 months , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight waiver denial are persistent symptoms , required medications not approved for aircrew , or other conditions that also require a waiver . Even if the individual conditions are considered waiverable , but the member has multiple conditions requiring waiver , the chances of waiver approval drop greatly .

It 's not easy to predict the best way to change airframes later on , but as a general rule LJ Driver was correct , AFSOC ( HC-130 's ) to AFSOC ( AC/MC-130 's ) would be easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have low-level experience ) . If AFSOC is his ultimate goal , I think EC-130 's might be the toughest way to go . But you never know , I went from EC-130 's ( ABCCC ) to MC-130 's 6 years ago . <p> Also , Tucson is an outstanding place to be stationed , my wife and I had almost 5 great years there . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest SUMA <p> If AFSOC is his ultimate goal , I think EC-130 's might be the toughest way to go . <p> I would disagree . People I have talked to tell me that EC-130s are a good feeder into the Gunship world ( one of my instructors took that route ) . Since neither airframe requires a Tac Qual , the bean counters at AFPC see it as an even trade . If they send a slick driver to gunships , they just lost all the time and money they put into giving that pilot his Tac Qual . Some studs at Corpus even talk about taking EC-130s for just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step too far . I hope I 'm wrong , because my dream career would be Talon II out of Corpus for two tours followed by a gunship tour . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Not necessarily your whole career , probably until you are an O-5/O-6 . AFSOC is not going to want to move an experienced Talon II pilot ( probably an IP , maybe an evaluator ) to gunships . It is bad for the officer , and bad for the command . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I personally know of three pilots who upgraded to IP and transferred to the TII shortly thereafter to get experience in another AFSOC platform . All three have since tried to return to the gunship and none of them has been successful . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was in the EC-130s in the late 90s and it turned out to be a blessing . Tucson is a great town for married and single folks--U of A and 4th Avenue provide great entertainment . <p> As for the flying , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much faster than most units . In fact , we had pilots going to IP school at the same time their buddies from copilot school were arriving back to LR for the AC course . <p> The reason for our abundant number of flying hours ( 500-600/yr ) was our deployments to the Balkins . The EC-130s were flying 10-12 hr sorties , boring holes in the sky . Only good news was we got to do aerial refueling , which I think is more rewarding than assault landings . <p> I know the EC-130 are still deploying but ca n't say for sure how many flight hours they 're getting right now . Their pilot manning was very high about a year ago , so perhaps the flying hours are only going to those that deploy and less for the folks back home . <p> Deployments will be just like the rest of the AF . Expect to be gone for 1/2 the year at least . I was going on-average , 230 days/year in the EC-130--of which 80% were deployments and the other 20% SOS , AC/IP school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and things got better my last year--closer to 190/yr . <p> Expect to be gone for 3-4 months at a time and then come back for 3-4 months at Tucson . <p> As for going to Special Ops--we had pilots/navs crossing over all the time . In fact , most pilots went to AC-130s , MC-130s , including Talons . Others went to C-21s , C-5s , and U-2s . A couple even went to slick C-130s ( Dyess ) . I went to the schoolhouse from EC-130s with AFPC sending me to Phase 2 and 3 , enroute . One of our navigators left the EC-130 for one of Little Rock 's active duty , operational slick squadrons . <p> Overall , a great town and although the mission is n't the most exciting it can be very rewarding and set your husband up for other aviation opportunities . <p> Best of luck . <p> -Batman <p> 13 .

Little Rock is phase 1 only , no tac approaches , low-level , or formation . Study hard and do n't forget everything you learned on the way to DM , because you may be sitting up to two months waiting for a flight deck academic class to start . Instructors and evaluators are getting frustrated with students who ca n't remember basic aircraft systems and checklist procedures when they finally get back in the right seat . Do n't fall in love with SCNS at Little Rock , because ECs do n't have it . <p> 2 . Academics go by quickly ; mostly aircraft difference training and mission familiarization , then off to the flight line . Expect lots of down time and a few breaks in training because the airplanes are old and maintenance delays/cancellations are very common . There is no flight deck simulator at DM , at least not for the next couple of years , but you can practice procedures in the familiarization trainer across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down time ( once again ) stay in the books to maintain your Dash One knowledge and learn the AFTTP 3-1 . Air refueling is a blast , and learning to stay behind the tanker will take up the majority of your syllabus . <p> 3 . There are two ops squadrons and you 'll likely fly with both of them while you work your way through the syllabus . You should find out which one you are going to when you arrive at the FTU . <p> 4 . I guarantee that your name is already on a deployment schedule ( it 's spelled FNG for now ... ) and they are anxiously awaiting your arrival . The EC-130 has been ACCs most deployed fixed-wing asset for the last couple of years . You will deploy constantly in this airframe , and can expect around 260 to 300 hours for every 90 days deployed . Make sure your significant other ( if applicable ) is prepared for this , because you will be spending a lot of time away from home and you will need to manage expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . The mission is good , but the flying can be underwhelming ... <p> 5 . Cross-flow opportunities have not been great for the last couple of years , especially with regard to AFSOC . We used to see a few pilots flowing to AC-130s , but the last one I was aware of was three years ago . There is still a rescue unit down the street but I have only seen one pilot move there in the last 5 years . Most pilots who leave the EC-130 are doing so to go to white jets or an OSA . There have also been a few cats and dogs that go up to the parent wing at Offutt to fly the RJ . <p> 6 . Tucson is a great town : U of A is right in the middle of downtown , and the scenery is n't bad . Lots of golf courses if you are so inclined , and Phoenix is about a 2 to 2.5 hour drive north . Find something you like about Tucson , because tour lengths are longer than average : pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6 years , so do n't burn your bridges when your name shows up on the VML , because it doesn ' t mean anything ... <p> I enjoyed my time in Tucson , and the mission can be very rewarding . I flew as much as I could and had a blast most of the time . Years and years of deployed ops are taking a toll on the airplanes , but you 're going to see that wherever you go . PM me if you have any specific questions , and good luck . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Bill Lumbergh <p> The EWO side of the house has a much more rigorous syllabus and you 'll spend significantly more time in the academic and flight phases . The EWO is trained to be a mission crew commander from ride one , so expectations are higher than in other platforms . Washout rate is pretty low , but the syllabus can get bloody in a hurry , so it does happen ... not a good thing to have on your record with Force Shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ( sts ) . Had n't seen any students from the new CSO pipeline , so ca n't offer any advice on how the new program is preparing them for their MWS ; there is some apprehension that basic EWO knowledge wo n't be on par with graduates from Randolph , but we 'll see how it plays out . EWO manning was a little better than the pilots , so deployment schedule is n't as rigorous : you can still expect to deploy at least once a year . Also , EWOs tend to soak up a lot of the CAOC LNO billets after their first or second deployment . <p> The EC-130H is a great platform for EWOs : Offensive platform with a good , challenging mission set , and the opportunity to execute some of your core mission competencies every day downrange. 
@@43195096 @3195096/ <h> 6 posts in this topic <p> So , looks like I have 1390 pts toward the 1460 points needed for O-1E. - I have a few more drills and annual tour to get me over 1400 , but my question is will I be able to hit that magic 1460 during OTS ?

She only mentioned that it would be a good idea to include a note to include the current years points in the point summary , all the way up to day prior to commission . She also verified for guard reserve is is 1460 points towards RETIREMENT . So got the answer , now others do too .

It 's as in-depth as you want it to be and for as much time as the doc has ( which is usually 10 min face time , tops ) . If you have a lot to discuss , be sure to tell that to the booking nurse/technician and request multiple slots to be combined . <p> Most of the ones I 've read/seen are pretty short and only address one or two things tops . A select few for really broke people are lengthy . They 're a good idea if you intend to make a VA disability/injury claim , as it 's likely the last medical note from AD that will document the status of your condition . It is not meant to be the document that shows the first instance of a major , chronic medical concern , as you should have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have had a big medical concern , but kept it to yourself for the last 12 months and suddenly now you want the Air Force to pay you big bucks , you just built your own case against you . My advice to anyone looking to separate/retire , if you want anything really evaluated , but have never brought it up before , start about 18 months out from your final out date . Even if it 's a massively disqualifying condition , I-RILO 's ( Initial Review in Lieu of Medical Evaluation Board ) take at least 6 months . The majority of the time , you 'll be retained on ALC . Even if you lose on the I-RILOand go to full MEB/PEB with early medical separation , you can easily draw out the separation by appealing to SECAF and the Uniform Corrections Board ( you have a 99% likelihood of losing the appeals ) . In the mean time , you 'll rack up the months to meet the 20 year minimum , but we 're talking about worst case scenario . <p> Here 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why you get them : <p> 8.2 . Purpose . To identify medical conditions requiring attention and to document current medical status to determine continued fitness for duty . <p> 8.3 . Presumption of Fitness . If performance of duty in the 12 months before scheduled retirement is satisfactory , the member is presumed to be physically fit for continued active duty or retirement , unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary . ( See AFI 41-210 for presumption of fitness prior to retirement ) ... <p> 8.5.1 . A medical assessment by a credentialed provider and documented on DD Form 2697 and supporting documents as outlined in 8.5.2 is mandatory when : <p> 8.5.1.1 . Member has not had a PHA within one year . ... <p> 8.5.1.2 . Medical authority requires an examination to be done for either clinical or administrative reasons . <p> 8.5.1.3 . Separation is involuntary ... <p> 8.5.1.4 . ... The DD Form 2697 will be accomplished not earlier than 180 days prior to projected separation or retirement and <p> not later than 30 days prior to projected separation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 8.5.2.1.1 . A completed DD Form 2697 ... <p> 8.5.2.1.2 . Clear documentation of any significant medical history and/or new signs or symptoms of medical problems since the member 's last medical assessment/medical examination . See the last two sentences in Section II , DD Form 2697 for additional guidance . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Current flight doc here . I read the boards from time to time and enjoy it , so I figure that I should contribute and make myself useful ! <p> Retirement or voluntary separation physicals are only required if the member has conditions for which he or she is seeking VA disability benefits ( ie continued medical care , stipend , etc ) . All patient conditions which are specifically brought up by the patient will be discussed and examined . Specialty consultation may be required prior to separation . This physical and your medical record will be reviewed by the VA . The VA now does their own independent review and process . You should contact the VA rep in your med group to start this lengthy process immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 6 months or so who come in with a laundry list of complaints which they have been stock piling . As a previous poster said , if conditions which are disqualifying for continued flying duties or retention ( meaning MEB ) , you will be grounded and possibly boarded . This could hold up your separation , or your job in the reserves , civilian contractor flying DoD aircraft job , and so on so forth . If it is a legitimate concern , then by all means please discuss it with your physician . Just be aware of the above consequences . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Almost noone else is active with your level of credentials ; post more , if you can . <p> Also required if : <p> 8.5.1.1 . Member has not had a PHA within one year ... <p> 8.5.1.2 . Medical authority requires an examination ... <p> 8.5.1.3 . Separation is involuntary ... <p> I will check in frequently then ! For legal purposes I wo n't post direct medical advice , but aeromedical considerations are fair game . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule since most of my patients are aircrew and are required a ( flight ) PHA every 12-15 months . Luckily I have great techs which remind me ! Also , I have done too many involuntary separation physicals ( non continuation , PT failures , RIF , personality disorders , and even for confinement ) in my career . Just plain sad . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> 1 . Separation / Retirement Physicals are now mandatory for everyone and should be completed 6 months before separation / retirement ( AFI 48-123 , para . 7.5.1 . ) . Technically , you could just complete the DD 2697 without actually seeing the Doc , but I do n't know of any base that actually uses this built-in loophole ( I know I personally would n't sign the form without putting eyes on the member ) . <p> 2. " ... report any new medical condition ... to the appropriate medical provider at the time of onset ... " ( AFI 10-203 , para . 2.18.1. ) 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new medical requirement* for separating personnel and is a substantially different change in policy from the current separation physical . Local units will implement as soon as their mission and capabilities allow--the VA/DOD-wide implementation deadline is rumored at Jan 2015 . All AD will receive a SHPE before the date of separation . Any RC servicemembers on AD orders for &gt;30 days in support of a contingency operation will receive a SHPE before the date of separation for EACH , future activated period . RC members on AD orders for &gt;180 for training or certain non-mobilization orders instead complete the shorter DD 2697 . Reservists not entitled to a SHPE may still request it within 180 days pre-separation . The first step is that the member submits a completed DD 2807-1 to the MSME for review . The MSME will ask if you intend to submit a VA claim . <p> If the member is not filing a VA claim , the DOD MTF completes the SHPE . The SHPE should be done 90 to 30 days pre-separation , but possibly up to 180 days prior with some additional steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the VA clinic completes the SHPE , initiated via the VA eBenefits site . For AD and RC filing a VA claim , it can be completed 180 to 30 days pre-separation . As the VA is infamous for very long delays , you really ought to do it at the 180-day mark . <p> What are the components of this new exam ? <p> More comprehensive documents ( DD 2807-1 and 2808 ) , a face to face with a doc , an audiogram ( hearing test ) , and a record review . Referrals and additional testing are ordered as warranted . Yes , everybody that wanted a hearing test now gets one . How this will be used in consideration of your entrance hearing , age-related hearing loss , non-AF related exposure , and non-HCP ( Hearing Conservation Program ) folks , I do n't know . <p> Okay , but what is the real bottom line ? How does it affect me ? <p> 1 ) For AD , this creates more opportunities for you to be evaluated and submit a VA claim . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more red tape in the separation process . However , it protects the AF when you want to file a claim 30 years later but conveniently omitted your problems from those post-deployment questionnaires and the SHPE . Patient 's frequently lie , and it usually hurts them in the long run . <p> 2 ) RC on temporary AD orders and not permanently separating from the RC are building a case for or against VA and LOD determinations . VA claims must be filed before each separation . LOD claims currently have no timeline restriction per AFI 36-2910 , however the pending re-write of this regulation will shorten that to 180 days post-separation . So your options for submitting LOD cases will be greatly reduced , and realistically should be supported by any future SHPE documentation or you 'll be fighting a steep , uphill battle . If you have any LOD concerns but have not yet submitted them , I recommend you submit them now and definitely no later than the end of any 180+ day activated period . Otherwise , you may be looking at FFD rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any very major medical problems affecting your retention . Again , this is protecting the AF from heavily delayed LOD/VA claims . <p> *When is the SHPE not required ? <p> 1 ) The member voluntarily waives the exam and the member 's commander concurs , nullifying most options for VA disability claims . This is n't explicit in the AFI but is detailed in the AFMOA SHPE Guide . Member and the MDG would remotely complete a DD 2697 for CYA . This loophole is likely only for unique situations in which the member would be heavily burdened to go to an MTF and has no intention to file any VA claims . Even then , there wo n't be many of these instances . This policy may change in the future . <p> 2 ) Member is medically separated following the IDES process ( aka the way more detailed and super lengthy MEB ) . There are MANY opportunities to file a VA claim in this process . <p> Important Notes <p> Regulation for this process is the DOD Directive-type Memorandum ( DTM ) 14-006 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in AFI 48-123 , AFGM 2014-01 published 31 Oct 2014 . The " AFMOA SHPE Guide " is a mostly-finished AF regulation--it 's intended for the test sites but provides some operational guidance to the AF at large . For the purpose of this post , I combined the terms retirement and separation to just separation--the specifics of this program are the same for each . Separation timelines are calculated as the " date of separation " if the member is not taking any terminal leave , or the terminal leave start date if the member is taking terminal leave . AD is Active Duty ; RC is Reserve Component . SHPE is pronounced by most folks as " shippy . " <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest <p> Claiming a VA disability , especially for musculoskeletal concerns like back pain or history of broken wrist , after you separate from Active Duty WILL create problems if you try to join the Guard/Reserve . If you are now healthy enough to re-join the AF , why do you still have disability rating from the VA ?

This was the pilots ' preferences on what kind of field to land the aircraft . I imagine this is different from your T-6 's and T-37 's because of the stall speed , glide speed , less weight of the cessna . I was always taught to find a nice flat grassy green patch of land ( obviously not cornfields , just grass ) . Then one instructor said he preferred a brown piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land was tilled and the aircraft would n't cartwheel going against the grain . With grassy earth , you ca n't distinguish that and could unfortunately go against the rows of mounds . Opinions ? What about picking the best spot for a T-6/T-37 ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Yes , land with the furrows , and not with a tailwind . There was a checkpilot that used to hang around at the airport who would talk to the CFIs about what he busts people for ( besides not meeting PTS ) and he actually busted a student pilot for landing with a tail wind during the simulated engine failure . <p> I read in an issue of AOPA 's Flight Training a while back that you should go full nose up trim in a C-152 or C-172 for a simulated/actual engine failure to maintain best glide speed . Honestly , I was a bit skeptical , but it really works . Just be ready to push the stick forward when you apply power or if the engine does restart in the event of an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guest comanche <p> If you are above best glide speed and put full nose up trim be ready to push forward also . It 's best to put it in slowly . It will work ..... your airspeed maybe different then what 's published but it will be close and will vary with weight . It works for all single engine Cessna 's .

Stay away from brown farm fields if you can . Brown farm fields are generally plowed and the earth is soft . In other words , if you try to land in it , you 'll probably stick the nose wheel and flip the plane , a good way to turn a good emergency landing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instructor said he preferred a brown piece of earth before crops grew because he could distinguish the direction the land was tilled and the aircraft would n't cartwheel going against the grain . With grassy earth , you ca n't distinguish that and could unfortunately go against the rows of mounds . <p> Sounds like your instructor had never been to a farm before . If there 's grass on a large field that means the owner has either a ) not tilled in a long time ( if ever ) , thus no/small rows to worry about or B ) growing grass for hay , again no rows . Corn has very tough stocks that would slow you down faster than grass would ( plus has very obvious rows ) , so that would probably be preferable so you do n't hit that tree at the end of the field . Everyone talks about the fields , but what about the farm roads surrounding all the fields ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest kpaul <p> If you are in a dry climate hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to see if the hay has not been cut . <p> I went on a accident investigation with the FAA in which a dumb a$$ doctor ran his C-182 out of fuel landed in a field .

I 'd forget it and write it off to a mistake/misunderstanding . <p> If you were on it for six months , that 's a little tougher to " forget " . <p> If you notify them you took it , you will then likely be asked for all the documentation ( when diagnosed , what meds , how long , what effect the meds had .... ) <p> These situations are not covered in the regs . It 's all or nothin ' . <p> If I recall , you said your BP was 140 over something . That 's not even " high " by reg ... it 's the upper limit of normal ... <p> Let me know the details again and I can give you a better opinion . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest wtn001 <p> When the doctor prescribed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some where around the same the visit before that ( about a month elapsed between the two visits ) . My doctor prescribed me the medication in late March . I am a very bad pill taker anyway and forgot to take the medication most days . I took my blood pressure this morning with my machine and I believe it was 134 over 88 ( off the medication ) . I going to stop by the doctor 's office later today and get them to check it as well . I will let you know the results . Again thanks for your time 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27699 @qwx437699 <p> High blood pressure , or hypertension , in pilot applicants is defined as systolic ( top number ) greater than 140 or diastolic ( bottom number ) over 90 . Both are averaged over 5 days of consecutive blood pressure checks . Your doctor jumped the gun . Some primary care docs believe that you should " treat " anything over 130 . Well , " treat " for you would NOT be medications as the first-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including an aggressive exercise program , etc . From what you tell me , YOU DO NOT HAVE HYPERTENSION . <p> There is no good answer for how to deal with this in the regs so it comes down to flight doc common sense ... which you hope is followed by AETC/SG common sense when they approve your physical . You have three options as I see it . <p> One is have your doctor measure your BP every day for five days and have him document the results and ( if you are normal ) have him document the fact that he was wrong and your previous 140/92 was likely due to anxiety ( so called " white coat syndrome " ) etc . Then you hope that the USAF buys it IF you admit it ever happened . <p> Two is find another doctor . Tell him/her that you are going to apply to UPT , etc and would like a physical to see if you 're okay . Do not mention the BP issue from the other doc . The idea is to have a civilian doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least you DO have a civilian medical record stating you do not have hypertension . <p> Your third option is to forget it ever happened . <p> The integrity warning flags go off but look , just because some dumbass does the wrong thing for you and labels you with a diagnosis does n't mean he 's correct . How far you carry that logic ... as I usually say , let your conscience be your guide . <p> The bottom line for ME is you were never really ' ON ' a medication for this condition and your BP is not higher than 140/90 . In my opinion , you do not have a condition that puts anyone at risk and you are not violating the intent of the regulations . The end . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27699 @qwx437699 <p> jtpuro , your BP can vary dramatically over time . How much ? It depends . Everyone is different and there is no " normal " amount that I know of . There is at least one other doc on this board ( Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 'm pretty new to this message board , but I 've got a question before my FC1 in a few months ( Apr 2005 ) . When I got my DoDMERB physical done in 2001 , everything came out fine and I was labeled PPQ . Since then , however , every once in a while , I have a slightly high blood pressure reading ( over 140/90 ) , and other times I 'm right in the middle ( very close to 120/70 ) . Is there anything I can do to get a more stable reading along the 120/70 reading , not just for my FC1 , but for my long term health and lowering my risk for heart disease later in life ? <p> As far as lowering your risk for heart disease , all of the above ( and keep your blood pressure controlled with meds if/when it becomes necessary ) , and make sure you get appropriate cholesterol and diabetes screening . <p> Finally , choose your parents wisely . If either of your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at higher risk for heart disease , making it more important to control all the risk factors mentioned above . <p> 31 .

The only " cure " for that is to relax . Some people with this so called " white coat hypertension " have to do a week of BP checks in an attempt to get a " real " BP .

The list of approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoops " to jump through for each drug ( i.e. : 14-day grounding , centrifuge , etc ) are outlined pretty clearly .

That totally sucketh . Had to do the 5-day blood pressure thing . 120 's over 70 's was the result , my doctor kept asking why I was there . For me , it was the stress of the FC1 .

My suspicion is that this waiver will not be look upon favorably because it is an indicator of future health problems that the USAF does not want to inherit and pay for . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy but I 'm an Air Force student on a Navy base . I 'm currently flying T-44s . My flight doctor is claiming my blood pressure is 138/92 . Which is considered hypertension if its over 140 or 90 . I have my own blood pressure machine at home and the results I 'm getting at home is way different from the flight doctor . I feel a huge burden is off of my shoulders when I 'm away from the doctors office . <p> Personally , I 'm very fit and I know I have white coat syndrome for sure . I eat fruits and veggies like there is no tomorrow but when I step in the doctors office my nerves gets the best of me . What will a flight doctor do ? If I show the flight doctor the readings from my blood pressure machine at home will he still try to put me on blood pressure medication ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Tlicious1020 <p> I walked on a treadmill for 1 hour before I went to bed . Then I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 2 hours before I went to the doctors ' office to have my blood pressure checked . My pusle was high but my BP was 124/82 . How do you go from 138/92 one day to 124/82 the next I do n't know . I know the BP machine I have at home never reads high so I know I have white coat syndrome . And the nurse did the BP check manually . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest awfltdoc <p> How do you go from 138/92 one day to 124/82 the next I do n't know . I know the BP machine I have at home never reads high so I know I have white coat syndrome . And the nurse did the BP check manually . <p> Your blood pressure fluctuates normally . There is constant correction by your body by the kidneys to maintain your blood pressure , electrolyte levels , hydration state , etc . It is a highly dynamic system with constant corrections being made . Its kinda like flying fingertip formation , you maintain your position on the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot . Anyway , it sounds like your gon na be okay . <p> BTW , your b/p was n't all that high in the first place . However , new research is showing that controlling blood pressure , lipids , blood sugar decreases mortality for all causes . More to come in the future based on ongoing research . <p> BTW #2 hehe , During the G-X your blood pressure is likely up in the 200 mmHg + range to drive blood to the nugget to maintain conciousness . This is perfectly okay for short durations. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest jhk1220 <p> I 've had a couple of bp readings recently that seem a little out of whack . <p> The last four , taken over 2 weeks , were : <p> 149/81 <p> 142/83 <p> 160/80 ( I was freaking out for this one ) <p> 143/86 <p> I know I have white coat syndrome ...

My university health clinic is n't being too helpful with this ... I need a medical letter attesting my bp is normal for me to move on to MEPS ...

@@43195107 @3195107/ <h> Marriage/wedding - Best time to Marry ? <h> 75 posts in this topic <p> I 'm an AFROTC cadet graduating next may ( 05 ) and then will be heading to UPT . My girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about when is a good time for us to get hitched , and i was really curious as to how ' newly wed ' life would be getting married right after commissioning and then heading to UPT . For those of you who have been through it , is it pretty hard on the spouse having your husband gone all day and then preoccupied with flying for the rest of it ? If we held off for awhile can you live on base with someone without being married ? Is getting married right before UPT a particularly bad time ? <p> I would really appreciate any insight you might have on the subject . Thanks a lot for you time . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> OK , here we go . First and foremost , congrats . On to business at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd couples . I mean newly wed as in graduated from OTS , got married , went to UPT . Another graduated from ROTC , got married , went to UPT . Now that you know where I am coming from I will say this : if your wife is going to be a stay at home wife , its going to be rough on her at times . Namely , until you are off formal release in Phase II and Phase III . It can get LONELY for them to say the least because you are going to be busy as hell . She can expect to see you about 3-4 hrs a day , in between all your flying and studying , and on weekends and that 's about it . The good part is that chances are there will be other wives in similar situations married to guys in your class ... so the support of a ' family ' will be there . <p> That being said , if she 's going to have a job , things could be much better on her and you . Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock because you are going to be paying more attension to a 45 year old airplane than you will her . For newly weds , this can pose a difficult situation . <p> Do n't  count on living on base unless you are already married if you plan to go to UPT together . If you are n't  married , you 'll be in the Q 's at most bases by yourself . There are always exceptions to this rule , but in general , I think that 's what you 'll find . <p> Now for my REAL reason for the reply . If you are thinking about getting married , more power to you . My one message to you is to NOT GET MARRIED DURING UPT . A stud in my class ( 2 actually ) did this . One for real and one only on paper . Long story there , not the point . The point I am trying to make can only be summed up by saying that once this dude got married , his flying skills , General Knowledge , concentration and SA all went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time with his new wife and forgot about UPT . It showed . But currently he 's loving life at Warner-Robins flying E-8s ... Get me ? <p> I 'm all for getting married . I am actually set to tie the knot here in about 2 months ( and to another AF type ... and we are n't  going to be stationed together : mad : ) , just do n't  do it in the middle of UPT or right before . You need to be focused on FLYING and that 's it . No offense to your lady ( or mine for that matter ) , but everything else goes on the back burner for a year and she needs to understand , respect and support you and your decisions ... which if you are talking marriage , I am sure she will . Trust me , if you can make it through a year of UPT together , you 've got something special ! <p> 04 .

Also , we had plenty of time for a honeymoon . It 's nice to have someone to help you study , but in my opinion , use the time you have in UPT as your last bachelor time and ENJOY it ! LOL <p> PD <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest IAGuardWife <p> I think a lot will depend on the type of woman your girlfriend is . I know that sounds wierd , but it 's true . Is she strong willed and independant ? Does she make new friends quickly on her own ? Then she may be an ideal candidate for a new UPT wife . If she is unsure of herself or clingy to you , then maybe you should wait until after UPT . Yes , long distance is hard . I lived in Atlanta while my husband was in Nav School in San Antonio . It was hard , but at least I had my familiar surroundings , my friends and my family . <p> When my husband and I first got married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to him during UPT it probably would have ended our marriage and/or our lives . ( his , not mine ! ! ) We were married for just over 5 years when he started at UPT . I am not the person I was when I married my husband . I am more confident and self sufficiant . You really need to be that kind of person to be a wife during UPT . <p> If you can handle the long distance and put off marriage for another year , I would recommend it highly . There was someone in our class that got married less than 3 weeks before UPT started ( as ChuckFlys17s said ) . I ca n't imagine how hard that was for both of them . The first year of marriage is the hardest year ( esp . when you have to move to a new state to do it ) and UPT is the toughest year of your life . Can the two of you handle doing both of those things at the same time ? <p> Another word of advice on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck mentioned above , someone from our class got married in the middle to T-1s . He was given 2 days of leave and that included driving to and from Del Rio and Colorado . Also , 4 of his 5 groomsmen were in UPT . And with less than 72 hours notice , all three groomsmen that were in T-38s ( one at XL and two in CB ) had their leave turned down . That 's about the quickest way to kill a bride , tell her that you lost all of your groomsmen . <p> Either way you decide , remember , UPT is about you . Make sure you do everything you can to make this wedding be about her . She 'll thank you in the long run . <p> 04 .

My fiance is headed to Sheppard in July for UPT , and we were supposed to get married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to have surgery , and now have two more scheduled , so we had to postpone the wedding . My last surgery wo n't be until August ... will there be an opportunity for us to be married before the end of UPT in August of 2006 ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Vistar1 <p> If you consider an " opportunity " being able to fly out on a Friday night , get married Saturday , and come back Sunday ... sure , he 'll have that opportunity . But there 's no extended leave allowed for honeymoons , etc. unless he wants to get rolled back to the next class . <p> We have a couple guys in our class that are just going home for the weekend and coming back to UPT immediately . It 's unfortunate , but they want to get you through as quickly as possible ... otherwise UPT would be longer than just 1 year ( and who wants that ? ? ) . <p> Good Luck ! <p> V. <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to stall things ! I 'm all for the quickie/elope thing , but he 's a bit more into the bigger/traditional wedding , so we 'll see how it goes ! Maybe I 'll convince him . So now that leads me to another question ... if we set a date for say January of 2006 - middle of UPT - will he live in the single-guys housing on base ( whatever it 's called - dorms ? ) and then move somewhere with me or will they allow him to live in married housing or off-base considering the situation ? Or do I move into his dorm or whatever ? I do n't give a damn , I just want to NOT be in Michigan while he 's in Texas . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ViperDriver98 <p> UPT bases generally give you days off over the Christmas/New Years holidays . The break could be up to 2 weeks , it all depends on the base , timeline , the command and the commanders at the time . ( The 4 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from approx. 20 Dec until 2 Jan . ) Your fiancee should be able to find out when the holiday non-fly days are when he begins UPT . You may even be able to get a honeymoon in ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Vistar1 <p> I agree with Viper ... we had a full week off during Christmas/New Year this year which with the weekends included was a whole 10 days . If you can postpone your wedding until then , that will give you ample time to get married and go for a honeymoon like Viper said . <p> He wo n't be allowed to be in married housing until you two are actually married . And once you are married , you can go live in base housing or get a place off-base ... it 's up to you . I 'm not sure however , how soon he is allowed to get on the housing waitlist PRIOR to being married . I 'll try to find out and post later . <p> V. <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPT , the living situation becomes very wierd . We had a guy in our class who was married but did n't have his wife move out until six months after upt began . The housing people would n't move him into the dorm rooms either because he was married or because he was going to move into married housing . Yet he was n't allowed to move into married housing because he did n't have his wife there yet . So he stayed in the hotel the whole time , did n't really unpack and his stuff stayed in storage . To live off base , at least at Laughlin , its hit and miss . The only two people that I know that lived all of UPT off base had pets and therefore could n't live in the dorms . And even then , they had to write letters stating they could n't find another place for their pet , had to live with it , etc and then get it signed off by the group commander . <p> My suggestion , for what its worth , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before your boy gets to UPT and then if he can live off base , you are for sure going to live with him when you come here . If they do n't  allow him , then you can work the living situation onbase . If you are headed to Laughlin , and need anymore advice/help , let me know . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It 's also commander 's discretion on this one , and also the availability of the dorms and housing . My buddy got to Sheppard in November and was allowed to get off base , or get onbase housing . He chose off base , but he did n't get married until Jan . He did have to get commander approval on that one though . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just something to consider , but due to a pending PCS , my wife and I got legally married ahead of our scheduled church wedding . The USAF chaplain that was going to conduct the church ceremony took care of the legal one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had an I 'd card , medical coverage , etc . It was our little secret , and I came back for the church wedding as scheduled . No one was the wiser . <p> Actually , we just celebrated the tenth anniversary of our " secret " wedding ( we later told our family ) , and I tracked down the chaplain--who retired about two years after later--to let him know how things were going . <p> Cheers !

I do n't recommend the later , though it can be done . Being married while in UPT is a huge help ... I really do n't think I could have done so well w/o my wife 's help . The days are long and sometimes there will be a strain , but that 's just something you guys have to work through . She has to understand that in some ways you will have to put her on hold for studying , etc . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living together is still a lot easier than doing the long distance thing . I would suggest having the wedding prior to UPT or after UPT ... during is just far too much headache , especially at a time you can not afford to have any additional stress . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Other things before that will most likely be casual somewhere , ASBC , and IFS out in CO .

Yes , it sucked(I 'm sure it was worse for other wives then what I had .. ) . and at that time , no I did n't take it as a vacation , but as a learning tool .

He said before .. it helps to have a " partner " . -- No , my DH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't get in trouble either ... <p> You need to get married when you both are ready for it , I do n't think there 's ever a right time to get married , if you both are n't mentaly and emotionaly prepared for it . <p> Edited June 11 , 2007 by Kayla <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AFwife62406 <p> My husband and I got married while he was on casual a month or two before he started UPT . We were living together before we got married though so I was with him during IFT/IFS . He had originally planned on waiting until after UPT to get married , until I pointed out that I was not going to move all over the place with him , without being able to get on base without him , having to move all my own junk , without health insurance etc .

To start with , we did n't get engaged until he was already a few months into UPT . For the first phase , he was stationed at Moody , only about 6 hours away from home , so I drove down every other weekend to see him . It worked out well , because he could focus and study during the week and then we had fun on the weekends . When he moved to Texas , it was a lot harder , and we only saw each other once every 2 months or so . In the end , we had a 15 month engagement . ( Four months of that time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of some medical issues ) . It was stressful doing the long distance thing , but it also gave us a chance to save up enough money to pay for the wedding ourselves , which was important to us . We got married right before our first PCS , and it worked out well for us . <p> That being said , each situation is different and I think you should do what is best for you . I 've heard that being a spouse during UPT is very hard , especially on newlyweds . Sometimes wives do n't understand why they do n't get to spend more time with their husbands . It was best for both us to wait . Good luck ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I am a married LT . I love it .

Spend time with each other whenever possible because eventually you wo n't be able to . <p> As long as you keep her informed/involved you guys can make it work . My personal opinion would be to get married before UPT if you 're ready to . If you both want to get hitched why wait ? If you 're not married during UPT she wo n't be able to live with you ( unless you live off base ) , she ca n't get on base without you , she 'll be responsible for her own health insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest jojo61397 <p> We were married before UPT-- Long before UPT . That was because I was AD and we wanted to hedge our join-spouse bets . We were not stationed together during UPT though .

I 'm a spouse and we 've been married for just under two years . My husband and I have a wonderful marriage and he feels as though he has a leg up on others who are here unaccompanied . However , I have to stress big time that you need to ensure that she knows you will not be around a lot , even at the beginning , and when you are at home , you will be at home concentrating on other things A LOT . She will have to find friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get a hobby or a job ( good luck on finding goods ones ) . However , if she is an idler , she may be resentful towards you . It 's not her fault because it often gets the best of us . Some of us strong-willed ladies do not like being told that they are going to be in what some consider a " subservient " role while here at pilot training . Granted , for you , it 's a great deal because you will have lunch prepared for you every day and when you come home , it will be as if room service came while you were away from the hotel ! If she 's ok with it , she should be fine . It 's only a year of your life and you have the rest of it split responsibilities 50/50 ! <p> Getting married right before pilot training for some can make married life even more of a challenge at home , especially if you do n't know what she wants from you in the relationship ( i.e. , flowers every Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of appreciation . ) Everything needs to be worked out in advance , and I even recommend premarital counseling ( for anyone ! ) so there are no surprises . I 've seen a lot of couples around here that give off the " new puppy " vibe , but when the " puppy " grows up and still acts like a puppy , they are n't so cute . I hope you get the comparison ! ; ) Also , I hate to say this , but when you are gone all day , the wives have an excellent opportunity to get together and size up their marriages and women insecure in theirs can have understandable problems with the things that you do or do n't do . Some do n't understand that you may want to play X-box or go to the gym as a way to clear your mind instead of being with them all of the time and that can cause a rift . There are so many other things that can go wrong , not to say that it will break up the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year they wish they could forget ? I hope this helps , and if she has any questions , tell her to get in touch with me , I 'd love to tell her all about it . Oh yea , if you think these problems may not apply to you , that 's impossible because the curriculum is what makes you like this ! : ) <p> Crystal <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It has n't really been discussed yet , but BEING MARRIED = MORE $$$ I 'm not saying to get married just for the cash , do it because you 're in love and all that too . Get married right after you get commissioned because if you are married , you get dislocation allowance for your initial PCS . I did n't know that until I got an extra chunk of cash deposited in my account from finance . I actually thought it was a mistake and tried to get them to take it back , but they said you get it if you have dependents . <p> " 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blast , just make sure your prospective spouse knows what they 're getting into . Some guys get their wives to help them study and all that , but for me the most helpful thing my wife did was just be understanding of the fact that for that year , I was going to be extremely busy and that there would be times when I would be at work for 12 hours , come home , eat a quick sandwich , shut myself up in the office and study for three hours , go to bed , wake up , and repeat for days on end . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AFWIFE03 <p> We were married the week before my husband commissioned . He started UPT three months later . From our experience being married during UPT was a great experience . Yet at times it was tough to have to take the " back burner " and not be able to spend alot of time with my husband . Looking back on the experince I would not change anything . We met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed with some of them to this day . His UPT class was very close , everyone got along and we were all supporting one another . <p> Yes , the pilots work long hours and have very stressfull jobs . I was fortunate enough to find a job I loved , this kept me busy and out of the house during the day . Even though we were both working 10 to 12 hours a day , it was so refreshing to come home to one another at the end of the day . Your wife will have to be aware of the long hours required from you to get through UPT successfully . I was always ready to help my husband study when needed or just be there to let him vent about things . There were rough days where he was second guessing what he was doing and second guessing himself . I was there to support him and talk him through his doubts . Also prasing him when he did well , passing checkrides , passing tests , getting his assignment . All of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to let him know how proud I am of him is always fun . <p> My husband has told me that it was the " little " things I did that made getting through UPT bearable . Keeping the house in order , cooking him meals and having them ready when he got home if possible . Even giving him back massages before he went to bed to help him realx was time we could spend together . You have to get creative . While the time may not be much , or real exciting , doing those small things to help him relax made me feel better . I would know when he was having a particularly rough day just from the expression on his face as he walked in the door . Knowing what he needed to do to unwind was also helpful . Many times it was just coming home and not talking about the day , he would play video games or get on the computer . I was there ready to listen when he was ready to talk , but did not push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with communication about what each of us needed from the other . Communication is key , as it is in any realtionship . <p> Weekends are definately the time to get away and have time either to yourselfs as a couple or to spend them with classmates . Since he was at UPT at Sheppard , Dallas was a easy trip on the weekends . Friday nights and Saturdays were our time to hang out together with the class and try to forget about work . Although the pilots would end up talking about the past weeks flights and such . There were always good stories about who messed up what and who did something really good . <p> While I would not reccomend rushing into marrige just to be there before UPT , if you are both ready then doing it before is a good choice . Not to say that she ca n't move there into her own apartment while you are at UPT , she will just not have the benefits of a military spouse . The first year of marrige is rough on any couple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My husband and I had lived together for two years prior to UPT so nothing changed in the aspect of having to get used to living together . <p> Good luck in whatever you decide to do , and with UPT . It is a time in your life that you will never forget due to the hard work , fun times and the friends you wll make .

I have also heard that you can request a remote assignment to improve your chances of getting an assignment that 's higher up on your dream sheet . <p> Sort of , and it depends . The deal is that the AF tries to fill its undesirable assignments voluntarily ( remote unaccompanied , 365s ) , in exchange for which it will sometimes offer your choice of a follow on . I can only speak to the rated side of the house here ( personal experience with Saudi and a few buds who have been to Korea ) , and I 'll say that it can be done but you will need to coordinate with your AFPC functional ( the guy who handles assignments for your AFSC ) , get it in writing , then realize that it could still be changed based off needs of the AF .

Some short-notice assignments from the AFPC Roboto specify the minimum TOS required . <p> What are the remote locations ? <p> Korea and Saudi are the big ones for my group . Realize that Iraq/Afghanistan are NOT remotes , they are 365s and they fall under a completely different set of rules . AFPC is not as committed to offering you your choice of follow on ( I know two guys gearing up to go who have no idea what their follow on is ) .

At least it did when I was enlisted in 2006 . It was on AMS and was like a craigs list with people requesting assignment swaps . I 've seen it done twice and both times money was involved behind the scene ; One airman pays the other $XXXX amount of dollars so they can get that assignment . <p> I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not incur any expense .

Bottom line if you take a 365 you 're at the top of the list but its still needs of the Air Force first . Also keep in mind that job type will trump job location every time . <p> Also , these cats are right , your CC 's word means about 100 times more than yours with AFPC .

" These selects will go to IDE in residence -- that could be ACSC , a sister service program , an exchange school , or some other program . For these 20% , the promote rate to O-5 is about 100% . So , if you can get yourself racked and stacked as a " select " at your majors board , you pretty much have it made to O-5 . Not necessarily a command slot -- different bowl of cherries -- but O-5 . <p> For the remaining 80% who are not " selects , " they compete every year for 3 years for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 30% ( round numbers ) of O-4s do IDE in residence -- those 20% plus the others that got picked up along the way . <p> The promote rate from O-3 to O-4 is in the mid 90s . If you do your PME and have no negative OPRs then you are probably safe for O-4 . No PME = no O-4 . <p> As far as how to be a " select , " it takes more than just DG or Top Third out of SOS , but that certainly helps . If you have crappy OPRs but DG , I would guess you would n't be a select . But if you have strong OPRs with consistently strong strats and do well at SOS , then your chances of being a select are pretty good . I think that combat time and normal career progression helps . Guys that are late to rate and meet the majors board as basic ACs or even FPs ( as opposed to IPs and EPs ) might not do as well -- that would be my guess . <p> Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Phoenix programs , etc. ) makes you more competitive at the O-4 board . <p> So yes , it is possible to do well enough as a captain to almost coast to O-5 . But those type of dudes are n't typically coasters . And those 6 weeks at SOS might not make or break you , but you could certainly argue that they are the most important 6 weeks in your first 8 years of service , if you want to get promoted above O-4 . <p> But if you just want to fly and be a good dude in your unit , here 's my advice : do the best you can at the job you 're given , pick your battles , do your PME and you 'll probably be fine , and you 'll still have a good chance of making O-5 . <p> And all this is from the experience of one line O-4 , not an AFPC dude or somebody who knows how the system works from their perspective . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I think it takes more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for LtCol . I would hope they look at the whole person not just a training report . <p> I got a training report from SOS ? ? ? <p> Everything said so far is correct . Most guys who DG out of SOS are usually set through LtCol . However , they do not always make the Phoenix Eagle list . If you do ACSC in residence you will make LtCol unless you are caught with a live boy or a dead girl and vise versa for the female officers . <p> Additionally , I have seen plenty of people never DG anything and do just fine . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Guys that are late to rate and meet the majors board as basic ACs or even FPs ( as opposed to IPs and EPs ) might not do as well -- that would be my guess . <p> You were on solid ground up to that point . Do n't know if you are late to rate or not , but from my experirence , this is not the case . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowmover did , but he is spot on evry where else . Obviously , my earlier statement like Bergman 's is grossly oversimplified , but still a valid point . As has been said , the folks who are getting SOS DG are probably not slackersi n their day jobs . That is not to say that those that do n't get DG are slackers . It is yet one more validator for a board , but carries much weight . You may be #1 in your Sq for such and such but you are not being eval 'd against 599 of your peers in that group usually . Each and every " meaningful " strat that get is useful . <p> I would point out though that this and beign a good dude in the squadron are not mutually exclusive as slowmover eluded to , " But if you just want to fly and be a good dude in your unit , here 's my advice : do the best you can at the job you 're given , pick your battles , do your PME and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what you are given . Piss and moan every know and again . Be a leader and get sh ! t done . Make a difference . You will do well . <p> Between you and me ...

( While I was working , we did grilled cheese and quick meals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was gone , because he had no time to do laundry , make dinner , clean , etc . So the house was a wreck when I got home ! <p> The best thing you can do is to NOT act needy . The guys have enough on their plate without having to worry about problems at home . If something serious comes up , address it right away and get past is ASAP so he can move on . There was one time when he walked in the door , I gave him a hug and he pushed me away and said " I do n't have time ...... " as he walked away to get his stuff to study ! I was a little frustrated , but after a short reminder that I WAS still his wife and I DID need a hug every now and then , we were fine . Communicate and everything will be fine . <p> There is usually a lot to do on base with the other wives . Get out and do stuff . Organize stuff yourself if there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that I knew did , too . There was only one break-up between a girlfriend/boyfriend that I knew about . The rest of the class got through it just fine . <p> There will be REALLY long days , and there will be really short days , too . Enjoy the time he 's home during academics . Sundays were my hardest day , because I was n't prepared for my husband to study ALL day . But he did . Hardly a break for lunch . So after a few weeks of that , I found things to occupy my time on Sundays . Saturdays he was all mine , and we would usually go out to eat with friends , see a movie , go to the lake , etc . Sunday mornings was my date with him at IHOP , and I found myself helping him to study those mornings , too . The year goes fast , and it 's so worth it in the end . People say UPT is bad , and it is in ways , but I think deployments are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so enjoy it . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest 1derwoman <p> I had a very difficult time while my husband was in UPT . Looking back now ( only a few months later ) I could 've sucked it up a little more . Here is my advice to you . <p> There will be very long days for him . There were times my kids did n't see my husband for weeks on end . Make friends with your neighbors and have a community meal night once a week so you do n't feel like you are making crappy meals . This is especially important when he night flies . This way you can get together with other spouses and get to know each other . <p> Get involved in the spouses groups . They will help pass the time and there are many women you can learn a lot from . <p> Be patient ! This will only last a few months , then you will have time to figure everything else out . <p> Find at least one woman who you can talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who will say to suck it up and it could be worse , or how horrible you are for being selfish and missing your husband . Do n't listen to those guys . Talk it out to your friend who is going through or has been through the same thing . Sometimes it helps to just hear that someone understands and you are n't crazy for feeling a little lonely . <p> When you think you ca n't take anymore , say tomorrow will be better . It will be over before you know it . <p> Some of the people on here may disagree with me , and maybe they were n't as weak as I was , but this is just my opinion alone . <p> Try to have as much fun as possible and take up a new hobby ! Make this time for you as well as him . They need support , but do n't forget about yourself . <p> Oh yeah , and have study groups at your house ! The single guys , especially , love it when someone cooks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive ! <p> Good luck ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest KC <p> How bad UPT is probably depends on a few factors . The most imporant is how well your husband does . The guys who fly well handle things , the guys who end up hooking rides or failing tests are obviously going to be way stressed out . I think a lot of it is how naturally inclined your husband is to be a pilot , I do n't know how much you can fix that . The vast majority do OK . I will mention that my husband went and paid for 10 aerobatic flight hours before coming here and he said it helped his confidence . <p> Yes there are days they come home and study the rest of the night , but it 's not every night . The weekends are really a good time to have fun together , no one can physically and mentally study ALL weekend . My husband started out saying I have to study " all weekend " . Later he realized that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So pick a time or a day to just have fun , guilt free . <p> Yes there are days that are long , but I 've said it before on this forum , if you husband has not had a career before UPT , it can seem like a lot of work . Welcome to the real world where many career fields are high stress , demanding , and include 12 hour days , at least in flying they 're not stuck in an office . My husband loves to watch Office Space to remind him how fun it is to be a UPT student . <p> Now if you have kids that 's a whole different story . We 've ate dinner anywhere from 4:30 to 11:00 at night depending on when he comes home . If you have kids that would not work so well , so keep that in mind when you hear from people with children who have had a rough time here . <p> Good luck ! <p> KC <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest 1derwoman <p> I admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a very needy person . I needed a lot of attention from my husband . Not a good thing , not something I am proud of , but the truth . I am trying to change that now , of course . I think more independent people would probably do better . <p> I think that everybody 's situation is different . My husband was doing very well flying , but he was determined to be the best , so he was stressing himself out . My husband also had a career before this in the military and the scheduling was totally different . The bad part for me was not knowing until the day before what he was going to be doing , whereas in his other career field , his schedule was generally posted a month in advance . <p> We just all have different experiences in life . Everything is what you make of it . I try to keep that in mind with everything we do now . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Good advice all around ... just try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I spend maybe 15 min of time w/ my wife during the day ( not all days are like this , but probably 95% are ) ... and that 's when I 'm shoveling food into my mouth at dinner so I can hurry up and get in the office to study . Luckily for me , she 's a very independent person , works 40 hrs a week , etc , so I think she has dealt w/ it pretty well . Are you planning on working ? No offense to wives who do n't work , but at least from my perspective , it 'll be much easier for you if you have a big thing ( like a job ) to keep you busy during the day . It will be much worse on you guys if you just sit at home/bake cookies all day and just wait for him to come home from work . I 'm sure that works for some people , but sitting at home most of the day is probably going to eat at you , thus leading to you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend to do things together ( or at least Fri night thru Sun morning/early afternoon ) . You just have to be willing to deal w/ him not having much time at all for you during the week . I think this is harder during your first year of marriage , but as long as you fully understand that he will not have time for you during the week , then both of your lives will be much better . Sometimes you may have to let things slide that maybe at other times you normally would n't , but he 'll need you to just support him , not nag him about things and do n't take it personally when he comes home all stressed out and needs to get shit done and does n't have time to ask you about your day . Those nights will happen , so the more you can just let that roll off your back , the better support you will give him . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The most imporant thing is how well your husband does . The guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up hooking rides or failing tests are obviously going to be way stressed out . I think a lot of it is how naturally inclined your husband is to be a pilot <p> I disagree . <p> 1 ) Everyone is stressed out in UPT . <p> 2 ) Flying well and natural ability have little to do with the overall experience . UPT is desgined to suck . <p> 3 ) The overall experience in UPT depends on your attitude and your classmates. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AFNurse <p> All of the advice that has been given so far is very helpful ! From my experience , there were three pieces of advice that helped me get through UPT as a soon-to-be-spouse . <p> First , realize that sometimes you have to be placed on the backburner . That does n't mean that your spouse loves you any less or is n't thinking about you every spare second that they can , but when life is throwing a lot of stress at you , sometimes it 's easier to take for granted the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll notice it when your spouse forgets to call their parents/etc for a month at a time . Your family is supposed to be your staple , something that you can always rely on and even though they are the most important thing to you , sometimes life dictates that you have to give all your attention to something else for a while ... just do n't let it be a pattern and do n't be afraid to say when you need family time too , maybe just not the first thing you say when they walk in the door after flying all day . <p> Second , be independent ! ! The previous posting on this subject really hit the nail on the head . Keep in mind that does n't mean you have to go to work . Depending on your family situation and where pilot training is , it may be hard to find a job , but find something to keep you occupied . The worst times were when I sat around all day , waiting for my husband to come home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused an argument . Spend time with the other spouses , a large portion of your class will be married or have significant others , these people can be your outlets . Take up a hobby , volunteer , just do something so that you have something other than just your spouse to look forward to every day . <p> Thirdly , stay involved . Do n't think of UPT as something temporary that you have to get through , this is part of your life . My husband often thinks about UPT and says it was the busiest , but the best year of his life . You 'll make friends that will last a lifetime and will always be running into the folks you met , the military is a small community . Go to the O-Club , cook dinner for the single guys , help your spouse study and nod your head when you have NO IDEA what they are talking about . Remember that life is what you make of it and sometimes these may be the only quality time that you get . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this horrible thing you have to get through , we had a wonderful time ! You work hard but you play hard too ! Just learn to enjoy it when you can and do n't hold grudges , as those can ruin the fun times you do have . It 's a crazy ride , for both the pilot and their family , but for a large number of people it 's also your introduction to military life so take it in a stride , learn what you can and have fun ! ! ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest PWMOMOF2 <p> OK guys , ( and gals ) sorry but I 'm new to this so if these questions have ben asked before I 'm sorry .

My Husband starts UPT next month , what is zero day ? is there any way that the spouses of the class members get together to get to know eachother ? How involved are the spouses ? <p> Thanks for any replies ... <p> I 've never heard the term " zero day " . My guess is you 're referring to the first day of UPT . The first day is nothing more than inprocessing , meeting classmates , and briefings . <p> For class spouses , there are n't any official functions . It 's up to the students and their wives to plan activities for the class outside of duty hours . It 's a good idea to have the class get together for a cookout/boozefest the first weekend . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest PWMOMOF2 <p> It just seems like there is n't a whole lot to do here in wondeful Enid . So I was just wondering about other ways to get to know people . and I was n't sure if the spouses got together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events planned or Christmas dinner or anything like that . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> and I was n't sure if the spouses got together at all to do things for the squadron like getting events planned or Christmas dinner or anything like that . <p> While your husband 's in UPT , you wo n't be doing a lot of stuff with the actual squadron . The students , although officially stationed at Vance , are n't really " squadron members " per se . The whole permanent party vs. student thing . The class has to take care of itself when it comes to social stuff . It will be what you make of it . Some classes do zero stuff outside of the flight room and some classes are like a frat house . <p> The initial cookout/boozefest is a great opportunity for the class members to get together and for the wives to get to know each other . From there you can exchange contact info and start hatching plans . Plan to have class parties for all of the " next steps " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solos complete , track select , etc. etc. etc . <p> If the studs have something to look forward to outside of training , UPT will be easier for everyone . <p> HD <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest PWMOMOF2 <p> While your husband 's in UPT , you wo n't be doing a lot of stuff with the actual squadron .

The fact of the matter is that there will be married guys/gals in the class and single guys/gals in the class ... they will most likely hang out with their own kind ( married and married ... single guys hangin ' with single guys ) . The single guys will all party together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them out on the weekend : ) The age difference is n't going to be as much as you think .... your husband wo n't be much more than 3-4 years older than the youngest students , remember the non-prior students spent 4-5 years in college and the better part of last year casual as Lt 's . I was a prior E student pilot on active duty as well , and was n't more then 2-3 years older than the youngest student and many of the students were actually my age . This will only be for the next year ... you will have plenty of future opportunities to participate again in the future with ya'lls next squadrons . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> If I remember correctly , the 71st has a spouse 's " club " -- and I use that word sparingly- and I want to say that some of the other squads have like a group of wives that put together the fundraisers and what have you .

As mentioned , you do n't get per diem for PTDY and in fact you do n't get paid for anything relating to it .

Mindbeit that there is the human factor as well , and assumption plays a major role in subjection ... as in any evaluation - which is what EVERY ride is . <p> If one Sq washes out more than other , I 'd find that a mere fact of " weaker studs " than a notion of harder IP 's , etc . <p> For what it 's worth , I have n't walked those halls . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Hoser <p> Not sure which squadron you are talking about , but I went through the 49th Black Knights back in Apr 02 . I 'm sure most of the dudes that I flew with are gone by now ( in fact one of them just showed up in my current squadron ) , but I throw in my 2 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dudes and the other gets all the weak swimmers . As with anything else , it all depends . During my T-38 FAIP days , there would be some classes where it was almost a 6 way tie for DG , and then there would be a class where you could n't figure out how any of them made it to T-38 's in the first place . There is a new IFF class starting every couple of weeks , and the classes alternate between the 2 squadrons . I would n't say it 's a washout mentality at all . <p> As for what you can do , you 've already listed them . " 2 , Joker/Bingo , Lead your on fire , I 'll take the fat one " . As for answering a question from an IP in the breif/de-brief , do n't try to wow them with your infinite knowledge of a particular system , or start quoting 11-2T/AT-38 , just answer his quesion with as few words as possible . I found myself answering many questions with " I suck " and that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's IP , it 's having a negative learning curve . There was nothing more frustraing to me than seeing a student make the same mistake over and over again . It not the end of the flight if you make mistakes , but the flight will get painful if you do n't learn from your previous mistakes . The IP 's know you are not going to master Defensive BFM in 4 rides , but they are looking to see if you can progress in the phase and if you have what it takes move onto your FTU . <p> I 'm sure Hacker will have more words as well .

We have standards and if you demonstrate the ability to meet those standards , you pass . Simple as that . These horror stories always seem to get worse when they make their way back to the UPT bases . I can assure you that we are not looking to washout anyone . What students do not see is what goes on behind the scenes when someone is struggling . We go out of our way to make sure that someone on increased or marginal status gets the utmost support from the squadron . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the bottom line : You can not control which squadron you get assigned to , so do n't worry about it .

That 's my biggest piece of advice . Even if you fly terrible that day ( and it 's not demo pro ) , you may make it out unscathed if you prepared well . I found that in the debrief , most questions can be answered with " yes , no , good , bad " ( or I suck as mentioned earlier ) , or " I do n't remember .

My observation was there was no difference ... there is a lot of *****ing b/c a dude would hook a ride b/c he busted the " bubble " in squadron X , but another guy passed in squadron Y. You will find that most students exagerate a great deal when they hook ( i.e they busted the bubble multiple times not just once ) . Most of us were so petrified we thought hooked every other ride before the de-brief b/c of one thing we screwed up ... i found that was just NOT the case . <p> best advice : <p> 1 ) Keep your mouth shut and only answer the question they ask ... i.e. do n't ramble , or try to b.s and if you do n't know , say you do n't know ! <p> 2 ) I sucked or screwed up is always the best answer ( See a pattern ? ) <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admin ... they will teach you the rest ... notice i said " strive " <p> 5 ) Finally , understand ... it is a bit of a haze , but you are about to be a fighter pilot , there is no room for the UPT , hold my hand mentality anymore ... but once you are through it is all worth it . <p> Good luck and do n't stress too much ... you wo n't have a lot of studying so that 's a positive , and Valdosta kicks more ass than any UPT base ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> One more question , what impact does the particular rtu have on IFF ? If Luke gets a bunch of guys that ca n't hack it and washout , does this cause viper drivers to go under more scrutiny at IFF ? Or is it just handled at Luke ? Likewise with A-10 's and all the other fighters . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Again , Hacker would be the definite authority , but I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viper guy a Viper guy is the fact that he chose that assignment at the end of UPT . When he begins IFF he is generally no different than the F-15C , F-15E , and A-10 guys that show up . Even by the end of IFF , the different syllabi do n't make a huge difference . <p> If a bunch of guys washed out of FTU , I would question the UPT or IFF system for letting them through , not the group of students . That being said , I 've never seen or heard of a ' bunch of guys ' washing out of the FTU. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 27703 @qwx437703 <p> Toro is right . No consideration is given to what weapon system the student is going to . <p> I had a ton of fun at Holloman . I liked learning BFM , loved raging around low level and I had an absolute blast dropping bombs for quarters . I never once worried about washing out , you should n't either . Successful fighter pilots do n't focus on failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . The IPs could be XXXtreme pricks . I now know why but back then it just seemed like they were sometimes trying a little too hard and were a little over the top . When I went through LIFT I seemed to end up flying with the Eagle guys . They would say derogatory stuff about the A-10 and how stupid I was for asking for an A-10 and how slow the A-10 guys were and how it was no wonder I sucked at BFM because I was going to an A-10 and A-10s suck and dropping bombs is a waste of time and dropping a bomb is easy , just like flying an ILS and all sorts of crap like that . I did n't need to take that sh ! t off those guys but I also did n't take it personally and I did n't care what they thought about the A-10 or my decision to fly it . I learned a lot form them ... both good and bad examples of instructional technique . <p> Again , I did n't give a sh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-10 . I knew they were there to teach me the fundamentals of being a fighter pilot and the tough guy/cool guy/editorial comments about how much the A-10 sucked compared to the F-15 mattered more to them than they did to me . I had spent most of my life with someone grabbing me by the facemask screaming at me how I needed to get smarter and more aggressive and kick the sh ! t out of my opponent or anyone with a different colored jersey so this was nothing new . This was all pre-Desert Storm and before either the A-10 or the F-15 had seen any combat . I was there for 25 rides and then I was going off to fly my number one choice and I was never going to see them again . <p> Oops , not quite true . I ended up seeing a bunch of them again . I saw one Eagle guy a couple years later at Long Rifle ... he had transitioned to the Strike Eagle . As I stood holding with the big gun I had just won I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a sh ! tty instrument pilot . I bumped into more of those guys down the road while I was having a blast in the A-10 and the guys who had been the biggest asspipes at Holloman seemed to be the most unhappy back in the real world ... maybe it was a personal/attitude problem ? It was fun to see them as average pilots out in the real world after they had acted like they were the greatest fighter pilots on earth back at Holloman . <p> Big picture , do n't be a or they will eat you alive ( you need to get some courage before you start flying the A-10 ... Hog combat sorties are much more of a threat than IFF will ever be ) . Try to pay attention to what they are really trying to teach you , they have been there and done that and they all know what they are talking about . Most importantly ( except for not being a ) ... keep your mouth shut . <p> Enjoy the flying , it will be the most fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are pissing down your leg everyday on your way into work . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As far as I know , IFF is still operating at Randolph , Laughlin , Columbus and Sheppard . Word on the street is that Laughlin 's is on the verge of shutting down . I do n't know all the specifics , but there are 2 blocks of BFM - OB and DB , about 4 rides each . Then , airframe dependent , there are some ACM rides thrown into the mix . The program is supposed to last six weeks . Again , those with better or recent knowledge please chime in. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Hacker , are they still teaching range rides for the Strike Eagle , Fighting Falcon , and Hawg studs ? <p> I assume ( you know what that means ) they are because they show up kind of sort of familiar with ITP bombing in the FTU . <p> Yes , all the B and C track studs do both conventional and tactical range patterns . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITP bombing to the Hog students , with DIL/BFL % being taught to the F-15E and F-16 students . My understanding is that ITP/IAA bombing is now the prevailing technique taught to all students . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> It does n't apply to *any* of the aircraft beyond fundamentals . Sorta why the course is titled that , ya know . <p> Every aircraft has a different way of skinning the BFM cat . Jet performance and weapon capability is the cornerstone of development of BFM tactics.Unless you 're out shooting AIM-9Ps and gun only in a T-38 , OF COURSE your BFM tactic is going to be different . <p> It was funny to see new upgrading IPs come to Moody , with each thinking that their MWS ' way to fly BFM was the way to do it , and whatever " we " were teaching was wrong . The same thing applied to bombing , too . <p> Regardless , if you think that IFF is about learning BFM or bombing , then you 've completely missed the point . <p> Edited January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Mouse <p> To answer your question , I 'm a former fighter pilot ( originally Navy but finished up USAF Reserve F-16s ) and wrote a book on fighter tactics ( Fighter Combat-Tactics and Maneuvering ) . I 'm currently a defense contractor and we 're proposing some research to determine the cost-effectiveness tradeoffs of teaching INITIAL/INTRODUCTION TO BFM ( and maybe some other topics ) in something other than T-38s . For instance , we 'd like to look at prop trainers ( like the CJ-6A , Yak-52 , Marchetti S-260 ) , the new dynamic ( centrifugal ) simulators , and even fixed-base sims .

Based on aircraft that IFF grads are going on to in the future , there would be absolutely nothing gained by doing that . <p> Remember that the whole benefit of IFF is teaching in an aircraft that students are all ready familiar with , so they can go right to the tactical portion without having to waste time/fuel/money learning a new aircraft . <p> That whole course could be combined into the the end of the UPT syllabus for what it teaches . <p> This was an object of significant discussion when Moody was broken up and BRAC mandated that IFF moved to the SUPT bases . There was at least one OG and Wing CC who DEMANDED that IFF simply become a flight attached to the T-38 squadron on his base ... that it was not going to be a separate squadron . <p> The problem with that line of thinking is that a significant portion of IFF also has to do with how to function in a fighter squadron VS a SUPT squadron -- organization , mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fighter dudes , who all have at least one tour of real world experience to back up what they 're teaching . I 've personally been involved with trying to make an SUPT T-38 squadron resemble an IFF squadron in what they 're teaching and how they 're teaching it , and unfortunately that is just a bridge too far . The whole makeup of the SUPT squadron would have to change , less a major portion of what 's taught at IFF be lost . <p> There are also issues with teaching the SUPT IPs how to do all of the stuff that is taught in IFF . Do n't forget that the IFF UIP program is just as long as PIT , and more difficult . Think about having to maintain currency and competency in all of the different IFF tasks ON TOP OF all of the different SUPT tasks . Just not realistic . <p> I do n't know of a single IFF IP who would ever advocate that . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I agree with Hacker ; IFF having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc is key to its mission .

They were desperately trying to bring such a mentality to the SUPT Phase III pipeline . Despite some very extensive efforts to change the way things were taught and executed ( lots of academics for the IPs , etc ) , it was n't possible to make the change -- it was trying to change the direction of a cargo ship with swim flippers . All of that with a relatively supportive Deputy OG and OG who saw validity in such a push . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUPT way ' for a long time ... with FAIPs .... with bomber dudes .... it just wast WAY too much effort to even move things in the direction of running like an IFF squadron . It was really a failing enterprise . How can you teach an IP to instruct the fighter way if he 's never been in a fighter before ? How can you enforce fighter-style briefing and debriefing standards/etiquette with a flight lead who has never led such a sortie in real life ? If you ca n't even get the IPs to operate using that standard , it 's impossible to get those guys to teach the STUDENTS to do it . <p> I was the one teaching many of the academics at the squadron in question , and it was very defeating to stand in front of a room teaching guys how to teach something as simple as a G Ex , and then face 30 minutes of " questions " afterward of dudes ( all the non-fighter guys or reservists who 'd been doing it a particular way forever ) telling me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the way it is done across the way in the IFF squadron quite successfully . <p> If someone was really serious about making such a change permanently , they 'd have to flush the current cadre of IPs , ensure there was a complete buy-in at PIT ( which , oh my God , is a completely different conversation all together ) , and train up IPs from the start to foster that fighter squadron attitude , operations standards , and instructional techniques . <p> The bottom line is this : the fighter squadron mentality of an IFF squadron is something that is fostered and cultivated intentionally . If it were n't , it would atrophy into any other " ai n't even thinkin ' combat " squadron very easily . It 's just about fucking impossible to push the SUPT squadrons the other direction , ESPECIALLY in the time when T-38 students are getting assigned to all different airframes . Not to mention that there are OG/CCs and CDs who may not see value in bringing such a mentality to Phase III ( believe it or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it 's separate fighter-only attitude and mentality , is key to the process .

I just finished API ( both pilots and navs go through this together ) , and I have at least 3 weeks off before I start Primary Nav training . I was originally selected for OTS as a pilot but was DQed for PRK pre-op being out of limits so I was redesignated as a Nav . The AF just changed the reg so my PRK pre-op is now well within limits . I 've thought on this for nearly a week now and I ca n't decide whether to pursue getting my original assignment of pilot back or not . I 'm THRILLED at the chance to be a WSO . On the other hand , I 've always wanted to be a pilot . I 'm age-critical ( prior-enlisted ) so I do n't have a realistic chance of going nav to pilot down the road . <p> My dilemna is I do n't know whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with ( being a WSO ) , for a shot at fulfilling my ultimate dream of being a fighter-pilot . I THINK I would be happier being a WSO than being a pilot of a non-tactical aircraft . On the other hand , I know I would give it my all in pilot training ( as I would in WSO training ) and I will be proud of whatever plane I am priveleged to fly . There is also my family ... as a WSO I know that ( right now anyways ) my deployment rate is relatively low . This , plus the tactical nature of the WSO lean me toward staying in the WSO training pipeline . However , it seems like Navs always play 2nd fiddle to pilots . This makes me lean back towards being a pilot . I 'm a laid back Type A personality ( if you can imagine such a thing ) so all the ridicule in the world for being a Nav/WSO wo n't bother me , but not having equal opportunity ( or close to it at least ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead , and I take the study of leadership as seriously as I take flying so this point is important to me . However , having just turned 30 , maybe I 'm coming into this game so late that I wo n't ever be competitive for command whether or not I 'm pilot ( in which case my choice would be stay a WSO ) ? <p> Ultimately I must make this decision on my own ( and soon ) , but any comments you have will help . Thank you ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> This , plus the tactical nature of the WSO lean me toward staying in the WSO training pipeline .

I mean , is your primary motivation here penis envy ? You say you like the tactical nature of WSO , but you apparently have a problem with limited command opportunties and not being in charge of the jet . You say you became an officer to lead , but you picked one of the few officer jobs that offers the least capacity for leadership ( as opposed to a Mx guy who 's in charge of a 100-man flight ) . <p> It seems to me that you need to figure out what your priorities are , because many of them are conflicting . You obviously understand the risks and ramifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it for the rest of your life because you really do n't get anymore shots at it . The best thing you can do is research your options and find out what you really want from your Air Force career based on your priorities .

That goes against the very definition of a type A personality . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Re command , both pilots and WSOs can , depending on the MWS , of course , command if you get the opportunity and are good enough ; it 's not just a game for pilots . <p> However , this is one of those questions will you second guess yourself in five years ? <p> In the interest of full disclosure , I 'm neither pilot or WSO so you may opt to cease reading as of now , but given a choice , I 'd recommend pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you , generally , more options . <p> Finally , if you go pilot and , God forbid , do n't make it , would you have the option to reattack as a WSO considering the age ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I think since he is age-critical if something did go wrong with him switching to pilot it might keep him out of any rated position . <p> ggg308 , <p> Personally I would keep the " for sure " position if it is something you can see yourself doing and enjoying . If you were n't age critical I would take the chance , but I can only assume there are going to be a lot of people in situations like yours looking into the switch with the new rules ( I have no proof of this , just a guess ) . But , take my advice with a grain of salt , I 'm just an OTS select waiting on my FC1 to be signed off on , there are many people ( aka almost everyone ) on this board with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whatever you do ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest Hoser <p> Why do you think WSO training is a sure thing ? Just becuase you are there does n't mean that you wo n't wash out . <p> As for Pilot or WSO , I say go for it if you are able . I 'm not sure of the process ( or the ability ) of trying to get into one formal training program while already in another formal training program .

One route is a gamble , one route is the safer play . Either way , make it through training and you will be flying aircraft for a living . No one can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time when I was a copiglet , I got out of the seat for a second and went to the back . A few minutes later , I returning to the flight deck and saw the nav reaching over my seat and flying the turn to the next waypoint .

" I thought for half a second and replied , " Nav , there are lots of people who love to be in your shoes too . " <p> The point here being , there are tons of people who did n't get picked up for OTS , are medically unqualified to be a rated officer or lack the aptitude to be aircrew , etc .

Anything to help me think this through . Here 's a little history to give you an idea of where I 'm coming from . <p> When I originally applied for OTS , I wanted to be a pilot or a non-rated officer . I did n't want to be a Nav at all because I was just stupid back then . I felt I would be bitter as a Nav , as Rocker alluded to , so at that time if it was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nav because there 's a ton of leadership stuff to do in non-rated work as Joe1234 pointed out . Well , I got the pilot slot , but ended up being med DQ for ALL rated positions and my attempts to fight it were futile . I was bummed and ended up asking the AF to reclassify me to whatever non-rated job they needed the most . Well , they told me they did n't need non-rated officers and took away my OTS slot . I was n't done fighting the DQ , however , so I kept pressing the flight docs until finally two years later I got the DQ overturned ... but I was still DQ for FCI because of the PRK pre-op limits . It was good enough for Nav though and with the help of my commander I got my OTS slot back as a Nav . <p> At this point I realized how fortunate I was to have the opportunity to fly and be an officer , whether as a Nav or a Pilot , as HerkDerka pointed out ( especially since my brother also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being bitter about being a Nav , I was elated , did well at OTS and got selected to go through WSO training . I 'm here and I 'm loving it . That 's what makes the decision so hard ... I am totally happy with what I 'm doing now and having been DQ I appreciate each day of training that much more . On the other hand , will I look back upon this 5,10 years from now and wish I had tried the pilot route ? That 's my biggest fear , I do n't want to regret whatever decision I make . If I do pick the pilot route , there 's a chance I can get DQ at Brooks ( probably not , but I 'm paranoid of docs now ) , I could wash out of training ( same for WSO , but bigger chance I think for pilot ... sorry Hoser , did n't intend to sound in original post as if I presumed I would finish training ) , or end up flying something that I 'm not as excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That being said , I can tell I set my standards higher than most of my peers in API ( 32 pilots and 11 navs ) and have accordingly outperformed most of them ( finished in top 10% ) . Whether that will hold under the stress of the cockpit remains to be seen , but I would n't be tempted to go for pilot if I did n't think I was going to do well . <p> So , in a nutshell , HerkDerka is right , it 's the safebet vs. the gamble , and only I can decide . I 'm trying to determine if the risk is worth the benefit , given that I 'm happy already . What ARE the benefits and what do they mean to me ... that 's what I 'm really struggling with . Putting this out here and hearing your opinions helps me to see things more clearly . I know there are many who would kill to be in the same dilemna , so I feel priveleged just to have a say in the matter . Thanks for bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx437700 <h> Guest ggg308 <p> Dude , are you kidding ? Flying anything as a pilot is 10 times better then being a passenger in any capacity . A so-called type A personality would know that . <p> Before I was DQed I thought the exact same thing . It took not having a chance to be on a plane at all to make me realize all crew members carry out the mission and that pride of service comes from fulfilling the mission , not flying the plane . That 's why I have no problems with being a Nav . <p> Be a WSO . Leave the pilot slot for someone who sees flying the jet as a passion , not a better opportunity for command . It maybe difficult to make it through pilot training with that attitude . <p> IMHO <p> This is a good point . A few days ago , I told myself I was going to stay a WSO and I was content and happy with that . But today I climbed into the front seat of a T-6A static cockpit to familirize myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pensacola fly in the front seat and act as a pilot for the first 6 flights so that they can appreciate what a pilot does ) . It was at this time I started second guessing myself ... I knew that when the time came to move to the back seat I just would n't want to do it . But I do n't know how strong that passion is until I actually fly the T-6A , at which time it will be too late to switch pipelines . On the other hand I 'd still be happy being a Nav for the reason above . Also , I see lots of pilot-selects ( ok , some ) who THINK they have a passion for flying until they actually do it . <p> As for trying to be a pilot just to get better opportunity for command , I did n't mean it like that . I do n't want a glass ceiling over me just because I 'm a nav . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest ggg308 <p> So , if you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " perfect " world ) ? <p> Also , what 's a " non-tactical aircraft " , in your eyes ? <p> WSOs are limited to F-15Es , B-1s , and B-52s . Right now , there are lots of F-15E slots ( what I want ) , a few B-1 slots , and some B-52 slots here and there . You can also do a tour with the Navy in the EA-6B , but that 's not common . <p> A non-tactical craft in my eyes is one that does n't get told , here are your targets , destroy them . I 'd be happy with other aircraft too as they all contribute to the destruction of the enemy in the end . I just want to be as close to the pointy tip as possible . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I 've previously posted my unpopular opinion about " passion " being a prerequisite to be a pilot and I wo n't go into it .

Not trying to kick you around , but Big Blue generally does n't do that . When I was a lad the requirements were age 26 and 20/20 vision ... that changed to 29 and 20/70 when I was 29 with 20/25 in one eye so I figured I could just reapply and it would all be good ... NOT . Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unit converting to pilot-only aircraft I doubt they 'd let you just leave to go to UPT .

It 'll probably be one of the coolest things you 've done in your life , to realize you 're getting paid to do it , and then 6 rides later it 's taken from you . I do n't see how that could n't affect you . I agree that being a WSO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than any other non-rated job , but like others have said here before , regardless of what you fly , you 'll love it ( majority speaking ) ... and in most of our opinions , flying anything is better than being in the backseat of anything , regardless if it 's a strike eagle .

" <p> Most civilians would be far more impressed if you told them you flew as a WSO in an F-15E than if you said you flew a C-130 .

If you have specific questions , call your local TMO shop and have them walk you or your husband through the process .

" Bottom line , I got paid . <p> NB , I 'm sort of opposite from you--the vast majority of weight in my trailer is the bikes , though I do put other stuff in there ( generally outsized stuff that wo n't fit in the truck ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Do n't forget they tax you on your reimbursement on the difference between your reimbursement and the receipts you provide .

@@43195127 @3195127/ <h> Is it worth getting a type rating for getting hired by the airlines ? <h> 17 posts in this topic <p> Can anyone say with any authority how much having a type rating helps when interviewing for an airline ? Before I drop 6-9 thousand on a B737 or A320 when there is a good chance I may not be assigned to said type , does it really add that much to my military background in Strike Eagles ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> There is quite a bit of discussion on this very topic over at **26;2230;TOOLONG <p> Granted , nobody who is saying anything is from the HR department over there-- but , most folks claim that if you " really " want SWA , then go get the 737 ticket .

With over 5000 hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see the need .

Your training and experience points to your ability to successfully complete any training program you start . <p> Longer answer : maybe . The name of the game ( stop me if you 've heard this one ) is seniority and if Southwest is what you 're looking for ( honestly do n't know who is requiring Bus types to attend training ) than do everything you can to make you hire date as soon as possible .

Guys in the mid-2000s who had 737 types were routinely asked about why they had them in interviews with other companies . And not in a " tell me about all of this great experience and training you got with your 737 type rating " kind of way . SWA was growing fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , other carriers were losing tons of guys to SWA soon after they hired them ( guys took other jobs waiting for SWA to call ) , so yes the type was a bit of a warning flag to other companies .

There 's no real way to know the specific impacts on granting interviews or hiring decisions because companies would never admit it publicly . But anecdotally , guys at the time who had the type had a more difficult time getting called by the other companies hiring . <p> The hiring market is drastically different today though .

Even though an airline training program will be easier than IFF , the B-Course , FLUG , and IPUG , for me , it was nice having an idea about 121 ops ( flows , call outs , profiles , etc ) before I had to do it for real . The best thing was it allowed me to test whether or not I wanted to fly airliners for the next 35 years . I did Higher Power back in 2012 and I have zero regrets about it . I was asked about it in my US Airways interview by the way . My answer - I wanted to experience a 121-type program since I had no crew experience . Every case and person is different .

I am pretty much looking for any advice , as to when would be best in your career to deal with a new pet , how easy it is to PCS/TDY with pets , etc . Anything would be helpful . <p> Also , please share what ( if any ) type of pet you have , and how well it works out for you , and any problems you have run into while on active duty . <p> I am really wanting to buy a puppy right now , but do n't want to regret it a few months from now when it becomes a headache ... thanks in advance ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I got a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( bad idea on the apartment ) . I was typically only done a couple days a month ( C-21s ) and had friends who could feed/let the dog out while I was gone . If I was going on a multiple-day trip , I 'd put her in a kennel . Once I moved into a house and had a roommate , it was much easier . When I deployed , I shipped for back to my folks ' house , which is a major pain in the ass . <p> Bottom line -- dogs need a lot of attention from you , and if you 're willing to shell out $ to make sure they 're taken care of if you 're gone , cool . Otherwise , pet somebody else 's dog .

I also was towing a 6x8 trailer with all our personal stuff ( clothes , irreplaceables ' , etc ) <p> I do n't know of any base billeting that will take pets , so we opted for a local hotel ( Best Western , Holiday Inn , etc ) that did allow pets and just paid out of my own pocket . Putting them in kennels would have been another option , but without having the time to look around and see them firsthand , I did n't feel comfortable doing that . <p> When the dogs were puppies , my wife was working as well . We would leave the dogs outside in the backyard on nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to their small bladders , there would sometimes be messes to clean up , but these became less and less as they got older . The other reason for leaving them in their cages was becuase they were in the chewing stage and we were trying to save our furniture . <p> Now that they are older , they roam the house freely while my wife and I are in work . The furniture is still in one piece and their bladders can easily handling an 8-10 hour work day . The downside to being inside all day is that when you get home , you better have about 30-45 minutes of playtime because those dogs are going to want to run alot . <p> Hope this helps . <p> Cap-10 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest AF2ANG <p> I always had horses while active duty , and most bases have stables right on the installation .

In other words , this only applies to areas that have mandatory quarantine reqt 's , like the UK . Other areas that do n't have quarantine reqt 's do n't rate such reimbursement . I suspect your pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pets moving to the UK . So , yes , you got partially reimbursed while were house hunting and your pets were in a kennel . However , they do n't reimburse for straight up kennel costs though and definitely not for a TDY. 
@@43195131 @3195131/ <h> Help with AF215 <h> 17 posts in this topic <p> Ok everyone so I am putting the finishing touches on my 215 for the upcoming AD board and had a quick question . I have been told in the past the 215 is not an OPR so it should not include a great deal of OPR type information . That it should be written more towards what 's going to make you a better pilot not just how good you are at your job . As a navigator the majority of the things that I excel at in my current job are things that will help make me a better pilot . Well my question is where does one draw the line on what information to include or exclude . <p> Any help is greatly appreciated ... Just trying to give my package that platinum touch needed to achieve the desired results . <p> Thanks <p> ShadowNav <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was confused on that as well because my job does n't exactly have to do with flying . However , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was fortunate enough to get picked up last board . So obviously you can use some . If you want , I can email you my 215 and hopefully it will help you make a better determination on what you can use . If anything , yours should be easier to write since your bullets could carry directly over to how well you can fly . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I used OPR bullets on the back side and wrote not OPR style bullets about my desire to fly on the front side for last year 's board and got picked up . I looked at a bunch of good 215s before writing mine and that seemed to be the general style . Just my $.02 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I did something similar to flyaf05 . Just style to OPR bullets to have sort of an " ops " twist , if that makes sense . Try for strat on the back too . <p> On the front , its all about desire and what qualifies you to fly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for and what exactly is the 215 ? I am currently putting my app together for pilot as well , and have n't heard of either of these things . Anyone have an example 215 that they might be willing to share as a good example ? Thanks ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I also think writing bullets that show what you bring different to the pilot world .

I 've made some changes for this last time and it would be nice to have something to compare it to , PM me if you 're willing . Thanks ! <p> Back in the 90s internet forums and websites on becoming a USAF pilot simply did not exist . Resourceful Lieutenants and Captains instead used the basic networking skills and tools they had -- people , phones , and fax machines -- to gather data about how to be successful on the active duty UFT selection board . <p> In my case , a friend from another ROTC unit whom I 'd met at AFROTC field training also wanted to go to UPT , so he and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the process . I also had a couple friends from my own AFROTC unit who were a year or two senior to me and had obtained active duty pilot slots or were in the process of re-treading from WSOs/Navs to pilots . <p> So , I asked the guys I knew to fax me copies of their successful 215s ... and those guys usually had one or two that they 'd gotten their hands on to help them write theirs . Eventually the collection grew and grew and grew . <p> After I got selected , my buddy from Field Training still had n't , so we continued to swap faxes . I collected more when I went to Brooks , and even when I started SUPT myself . One day I realized that a I had a ton of these things . Unfortunately , they have been sitting on my shelf for the better part of 10 years gathering dust when they SHOULD HAVE been available for others . So ... here they are . <p> There are three different categories of applications in the bunch presented for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by a couple AWACS controllers , and then the non-rated dudes last . <p> Most of the forms you see in the collection were written and submitted between 1995 and 2000 , but do n't let their age or difference in format phase you -- " Air Force " writing has n't changed during that time . Of course there are style differences -- if I were to write one today , I 'd format it like a PRF and use as much stratification , etc , as possible , but the core basics behind successfully writing in the USAF have not significiantly changed in decades . I know as a Lieutenant I had no idea about the secret to USAF writing . I 'd never seen an OPR , awards application package , or PRF in my life so I had no idea what is was supposed to look and smell like . It was quite a surprise to see what these were like when I first laid eyes on them -- the classes in AFROTC that I 'd had on Air Force writing never said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unfortunately , the collection I have here is only about half as many as I used to have -- I loaned out this big binder I had of the collected forms to several guys in my squadrons who were trying to apply to the boards , and many of the ones I 'd collected were borrowed and not returned . Hopefully this group of 215s is still enough to be helpful . <p> One thing I will add to reinforce the point : stratification is the rage right now , and it is as close to being " required " as possible . Your raters on the 215 need to stratify you ( preferably HIGH , of course ! ) , so make sure they find a way to make that happen . Either strats among your fellow UPT applicants , or among other people in your career field , or your rank , whatever ... got ta have it . That 's what 's going to make a difference between an average 215 and one that grabs the attention of the board . <p> In addition , search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two ago after our Commander participated in the active duty selection board . His observations were worth their weight in gold , IMHO. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I was picked up for an F-16 slot by an ANG unit .

Ostensibly to fund more F-35 's ( like we had that game cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic : the jets in those squadrons were F-18A 's , unable to pitch into the current fight without expensive upgrades , which are a tough sell on old airframes .

Not always the case , we took a Passat to Germany and the local dealership actually did a US recall fix on it , but it was a German car in Germany so we had a bit of an advantage . And you will be limited to how much gas you can get on-base , I think it is equivelent to only going back and forth to work ; and if you have to fill up on the local economy , be prepared for a shock . Gas is $7-8/gal over there , maybe even higher . <p> And , do n't bother going to the UK customs web site , as your vehicle will be transported over via the US military . Contact TMO for the info . You do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it to the UK ( some white running light up front and a rear fog light if I remember correctly ) ; but you will not be subject to import customs . <p> However , you will stick out as an American . Not a big thing in the UK , but you never really want to stand out overseas . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Valid points , and thanks for the info . The warranty alone is something to think about . <p> They sell Toyota Hilux ( is it hiluxi , or hiluxes ? ) there , which is the same truck , but I 'm pretty good at doing the work myself . Hell , I own a Jeep . And if the Taco is a mammoth over there I might think again about going in the first place . <p> Not to get too personal , but wifey is an RN , and this truck is her primary . I had thought ( which is dangerous ) about taking the Yota , leaving the TJ here with family and getting something on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I just steering myself into staying CONUS , where I can keep the 4x4 's , hunt , and eat BBQ ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Just a side point ... vehicles are VERY EXPENSIVE here in the UK . Pricing is about double what you can expect to pay in the US for a comparable used car . In other words , if a used car were to sell for , say $3,000 in the states , it will sell for about -3,000 here -- which makes it cost nearly $6,000 . In fact , pretty much everything in the UK has a price that is similar to what it costs in the states , only in Pounds , which makes the actual price to us Yanks double . <p> I think it 's valuable to have a right-hand-drive car here for a number of reasons ( safety , first and foremost ) , but if you want to be " fiscally " responsible bring your own car . As mentioned , everything here from the road lanes to the parking spaces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the Ford Contour in the states from the late 90s ) and that is comparatively a larger car that sometimes I ca n't even fit into parking spaces lengthwise ( sts ) . <p> You can buy as much gas on base as you want ... you are restricted on how many coupons for off-base fuel you can buy . So , a drive to Scotland can be made from Lakenheath/Mildenhall if you plan your fuel stops very carefully ( and can make 400+ miles on one tank ) , otherwise you 'll have to fill up on the $8/gallon economy . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> You do have to make some mods to a US vehicle if you bring it to the UK ( some white running light up front and a rear fog light if I remember correctly ) ; but you will not be subject to import customs . <p> Also you have to have the headlights switched to the opposite side ( so the higher beam wo n't shine into ocomming traffic ) , and every car has to have fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 years since I lived there , but I found buying a Europen car a huge advantage . The lemon lot at Lakenheath or Mildenhall will be full of decent ( and crappy ) cars of guys PCSing , and the local towns have a bunch of used but still in good condition wheeels as well . Sitting on the left but driving on the left will scare the hell out of you on the country roads in Suffolk that have 7 foot hedges comming litterally within inches of the roadside around a tight turn where the speed limit is 70 mph . <p> I bought a Rover ( UK make of Honda ) for $3k when I showed up , and sold it 14 months later for $2.9k . Repairs were a breeze , parts were easy to find , and I did n't stick out as a foreigner . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> All good advice . I was stationed in the UK and have been back there TDY on a few occassions . Even drove over from Belgium via the Chunnel on two trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the land of right-hand driving can be harrowing . For one , as HercDude said the hedges are scary , and I swear you can even see the groove in them cut out by the mirrors of passing vehicles . Secondly , you really have to pay attention at intersections when you turn , on numerous occassions I had think twice about what I was doing as I almost turned into on-coming traffic . I found driving a right-hand car to be a lot easier . <p> Heck , if you like Jeeps ( I own an LJ myself ) , go find a newer RHD TJ and take that with you ! Or , as sugested , but a secondhand car while you are there . Although not as cheap as they used to be , you can still get a lot of your money back when you leave , as long as you take halfway decent care of it . I just think the Tacoma would be a lot to handle on the UK roads ... and maybe even moreso for you wife . <p> But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an assignment there . I love the UK , the people , the culture and the countryside are all wonderful , and you have n't lived until you 've done a real pub crawl ! Even though things have changed a lot since I lived there ( it was always expensive , but now with the even stronger Pound it is a lot worse ) , I still enjoy my trip back and if I ever had the chance to move there again , I would gladly do so . There is a lot to do and see , and a lot of history there ! <p> Cheers ! M2 <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> There are Excursions , Tacomas , Tahoes , Expeditions , and all the other big American vehicles all over this base now . I 'm assuming most live on base but there is an Expedition across the street from my house off base . It all depends on where you plan on living and the condition of the roads on your way to work . If you ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them but buy a vehicle off the lemon lot when you get here to travel around in . Like M2 said , I have driven on some pretty crazy roads in my british honda accord and ca n't imagine trying to squeeze some big American gas hogs on them , but , if you know where those roads are they are easily avoidable . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> The left hand drive on the right side of the road takes some getting used to , but so does driving on the right side of the road with a right hand drive . We took both our cars over there and never had any problem . I had a compact , my wife had an SUV - I only drove a right-hand drive once . Roads were never really a problem ( again , takes some getting used to ) , but the parking can definitely be a pain the ass . I had a bud who brought over an Expedition and , other than some parking issues , never had any problems . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a engine part fail that would have cost me $2000 on the economy to fix . The AAFES auto shop ( where we got our cars tuned up regularly ) was fortunately able to order and fix it for significantly cheaper . <p> I had thought ( which is dangerous ) about taking the Yota , leaving the TJ here with family and getting something on the economy for to and from work . <p> We planned to only take one car and buy one when we get there , but were unable to sell the second . If you do take a second car over , it will be on your dime . It cost about a grand when we took ours over ( 2001 ) and when we brought it back ( 2004 ) . It 's also a mild ass pain to take the second car because you 're only paying to get it to the port of entry ( which for Lakenheath was about a 5 hour drive ) , whereas your first car will be delivered to Brandon ( about 10 minutes north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy extra to throw it on one of his trucks and bring it up . <p> Or am I just steering myself into staying CONUS , where I can keep the 4x4 's , hunt , and eat BBQ ? <p> No way , go England ! <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> While the UK is out for me , I do have a 69% chance of going to Spang or Aviano . Anyone feel differently about bringing their good car to either of those locations ? ( ok , ok , I 'll lose some cool points here ... we have a Dodge Caravan .... any issues with bringing this ? ) <p> Also , thoughts on bringing a motorcycle to either of those locations ? <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Europe is a different animal . For one , the drive on the right side of the road , meaning you wo n't have to worry about new headlights or anything . Two , as there is more room on the Continent , roads are usually wider . Not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being used as a road ; but for the most part having a larger vehicle is not as much of a problem . I did a tour in Germany and Belgium , and although your minivan will stick out somewhat ( they do have them over there , but they are n't as popular as they are in the States . And do n't feel bad , we 've got an Odyssey ) , you 'll enjoy the hauling capability when you go shopping ! Parts may be a problem , but if you find a good mechanic it should n't be an issue unless it is a piece of shit and breaks down all the time . <p> As for motorcycles , most definitely bring one ! It can go in your HHG and riding in Europe is a experience of a lifetime . A bud and I rode south through the Alps into Italy and it was the best motorcycle trip I have ever taken . Plus , you can haul ass on the roads over there , and drivers are much more motorcycle-friendly than they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as I like Aviano I would take Spang over it in a heartbeat . Driving/riding in Italy can be nerve racking , the Italians do deserve the reputation they have . However , Germany and especially the Eifel region around Spang is a lot less crowded and quite beautiful . We used to go there from Belgium all the time , it was a much nicer drive than going back down to Ramstein where we 'd been stationed previously . Either place would be great , but given the preference I would chose Spang over Aviano . I am sure many would disagree with me ; but if those are your options , then consider yourself quite lucky ! 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Make sure you plan for the tranist time on your vehicle . You can either bum/rent before you PCS or throw your car to the shipper , jump on the airplane , and ship/rent while you wait for your car on the other end . Either way , it takes about 60-90 days to get your car accross. 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you throw your vehicle on the bo-at ? <p> If you ship through a military contractor , they will be Nazis about cleaning it - do n't give them anything to call you on . I have shipped two cars to and from England without problem . My only suggestion would be to make sure you have all the paperwork when you show up to pick it up ( in addition to the shipping papers - title , insurance , etc ) . I will say that when we shipped ours back from England , the idiots at the car port left it outside when a HURRICANE rolled through and it flooded the floor boards . F***nuts at the port of acceptance tried to write " a little water damage " on my receipt and I told him I was n't taking the car until he wrote " floorboards are flooded , " and then I went and got my camera and took a picture of the sidewalls that had debris halfway up the door where the stagnant water had reached during the storm <p> Also , the paper suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> I am on a 1yr remote . I did not ship a vehicle over , but I am thinking about shipping my current car back to the states <p> Have n't done it , but I 've done the car to Europe thing twice now . Ditto Nole96 that if you were authorized to ship one over , you should be authorized to ship one back ( regardless of whether you actually shipped one ) . If anybody else there has a car they shipped over , you should be good to go . But to clarify Nole 's statement , it does n't need to be an American car , only have American specs ( a lot of military folks shipped backed BMWs , Mercedes , Volvos , and the such straight from the factory that were built to American specs ) . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> A question on overseas auto insurance . Has anyone been able to save more using USAA overseas , or do they even cover the UK , Germany , or Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know for a fact that they insure in the UK and Germany ( used them for both ) . If you have USAA , I would use them . Your US providers are limited ( I think Geico was the only other that provided coverage in the UK ) , but I would stick with a US company . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest cheap <p> I have some questions as the Mrs and I are trying to make our way over there . <p> What 's the general policy regarding classics in the UK ?

I 'm trying to gauge how ( if ) my kit car will go over there ... smallblock V8 , no emissions equipment at all , and very loud side exhaust but titled and registered in the states as a 1965 . Definetly NOT a daily driver , more of a weekend toy ( it has no top at all ) . <p> What kinds of inspections or registration/insurance troubles have popped up in the past ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage-wise or something else ) ? <p> Thanks for the help , <p> Dave <p> Edited November 12 , 2008 by cheap <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Ca n't answer all of your questions , but be aware that we have emissions laws that will determine whether it will be legal to drive your car on public roads . If you get caught driving a vehicle that does not conform , you will be given a roadside fixed penalty ( a fine ) by the Police . <p> We also have regulations that relate to noise from the exhaust , although many young people over here regularly flout these ! <p> One thing to note is that if your vehicle is more than three years old ( which it is ) , you must have an annual Ministry of Transport ( MOT ) inspection , without which it is illegal to drive on public roads . Emissions and sound checks are conducted during the MOT test , and you will automatically fail if you do not meet the standards . Getting caught driving without a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will get a fixed penalty and points on your UK driver 's license . The Police have cameras on their cars that scan all of the license plates and check a database for MOT and Insurance , so driving without either has become an increasingly silly thing to do . <p> Hope this helps a little . <p> Cheers <p> Steve <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <h> Guest IncompletePete <p> Yea , as Steve said , you 'll need to have some sort of silencer and catalytic convertor fitted , although a lot of people fit them for the MOT and remove immediately afterwards ( I 'm not condoning that , mind ! ) . <p> You are in luck , however , in regards to road tax as what I 'm guessing will be a monsterously big engine . As it 's pre 1975 , you 're tax exempt , therefore saving yourself about -500 - -1000 per year . <p> There are a smattering of lock ups to hire around the UK , whether they 'll be large enough to accomodate your car is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for UK cars .

You get all the perks of being a reservist while generally working less ( most IMA positions I 've seen are cat B , with only 24 IDT 's versus 48 for traditional ) , and never having to give up your weekend . There are a few considerations though . First , there are no longer any flying IMA positions . It requires AFRC/A3 approval to fly now . Since you belong to an active duty unit , who generally do n't work weekends , you have to work your days during the week . I see this as a positive because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an issue with some jobs . I was a civil service employee , so I got a boatload of paid days for military leave , then I could use regular leave or unpaid leave if I needed . Plus I worked both jobs on the same base ( actually across the street from each other ! ) , so there was no travel involved . <p> Some units will let you do some or all of your IDT 's via telework . I know one guy living overseas but is an IMA stateside and does as much as he can remotely and then knocks out the rest when able . Then there 's the jobs where you can knock it out all at once . There was a nav job posted for awhile in Germany where they wanted you to do all your days at once each year . The advantage for you is that since the IDT 's are in conjunction with AT , all travel is paid for . Free trip to Europe each year !

Good luck with that ; it 's the military , no matter what job you do . Maybe you can dodge it for a while based on enough volunteers , but at some point it 's going to happen . <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Not an expert , but the short answer is maybe . Most RPA missions are flown from GCSs in CONUS , but because of the 2 sec delay of the satellite feed from overseas pilots are needed in deployed locations to do the takeoffs/recoveries . Having flown the sim at HO , I would say good luck trying to land the real thing in a crosswind with a 2 sec delay on the controls ! <p> Edited June 21 , 2014 by Justanothercadet <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Actual RPA UDM here . Yes , RPA crews deploy . Not every squadron deploys people , but the community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , squadron and crew position . An LRE deployment is a great experience for a new Lt/Airman . They return with better flying skills , systems knowledge , understanding of datalink architecture , improved situational awareness , and a renewed appreciation for supporting the dudes on the ground . So CCs like to send them after they 've built some experience ( normally a minimum of a few hundred flight hours ) . BLOB* : expect one 4month-ish deployment during your first assignment .

I was CMR'ed for 3 days when I was told I was deploying the first time . And I also agree that the prereq was a little much . MCE and LRE flying are two different skill sets . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> Any of the other hundred guys in the squadron who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us who deploy 4 on , 4 off for years a chance to stay home rather than fly a desk . <p> Sounds like you need to volunteer for a broadening tour in RPAs to get a break from your 4 on , 4 off deployment cycle . Talk to your CC I 'm sure he can work an cushy drone assignment for you in the Spring VML . <p> All these other " hundred " guys in the squadron are in the non-flying GCSs too . Manning seems to be always critical when virtually all your folks separate once they fulfill their ADSC . Such is the current drone squadron where you can count FGOs on one hand . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So like I said , I 'm going into the RPA career , mid 20 's , single , no children .... <p> By the sounds of some people , this may be a boring black hole of a career for my situation . <p> I 'll admit it was my last choice of all the rated jobs but i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds like I wo n't have any time to study to go for a masters degree ? <p> Someone earlier mentioned a broadening opportunity ....

Is there a limit to how often you can volunteer ?

It 's 96.9% takeoff and land , with some base defense if your deployed location requires/can accommodate it . You 'll just be closer . <p> Edited October 6 , 2014 by SurelySerious <p> 0 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> As long as you are cool with a masters from an online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in deploying a lot talk to one of the instructors at Holloman about it soon after you get there .

The busier ones require crews to be launching or recovering for 12 hours a day , 120 days straight , and the less busy ones are similar but less compact scheduling . <p> No one deploys constantly ; everyone flies MCE missions stateside . It 's a compartmentalization like any other because the squadron environment is at the squadron and is n't like your home , and your home is at home and is n't like your squadron . You drive to work and then , like other professionals , brief the sortie , fly the sortie , debrief the sortie , and leave the sortie at work before driving home . Sometimes it involves having seen frustrating things , having seen graphic things , or having felt really good about some assistance you provided ... the end state is all the same , though , it stays at work . 27701 @qwx437701 27696 @qwx437696 27700 @qwx437700 <p> So if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do while the guys back home are flying the mission ? <p> And maybe not " being in the action " is the best way to describe it but I 'd rather be out there than going back to regular civilian life then switching back to military everyday .... sounds mentally and emotionally exhausting .

I 'm glad you were able to get some good info from the guys here as most of them are/have been in the business . When I was interested in going the RPA route , I was doing some heavy research and found one source in particular to be very informative and helpful . The author was the dude who implemented the LRE " base defense " aspect that SurelySerious mentioned . It 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RPA related acronyms out there
