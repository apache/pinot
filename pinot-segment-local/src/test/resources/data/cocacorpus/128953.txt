Since Bryant McIntosh 's heroics against Wake Forest last November came at Welsh-Ryan Arena , the Wildcats will hit the road this year . They 're just 3-6 all-time in ACC-Big Ten road games . <p> In theory , coming off of the best season in program history , Northwestern should be in line for a higher-profile ACC matchup than the likes of Wake , Virginia Tech , Georgia Tech and North Carolina State , who make up all of the Wildcats ' opponents since 2009 ( excluding current Big Ten member Maryland ) . With everything from team quality and potential narratives to arenas and fun individual matchups under consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opponent for this year 's challenge . <p> Will Ragatz : Syracuse <p> This pick is less about the specific players on the other bench and more about the opposing coach , system and environment . Syracuse loses a lot from its 2017 NIT team ( that was snubbed from the NCAA Tournament ) ; grad transfers John Gillon and Andrew White III are gone and Tyler Lydon left early to be a likely first round NBA Draft pick . Still , the Orange are just two years removed from a Final Four run , and any matchup against Jim Boeheim at the Carrier Dome is bound to be a great test for a team . Of course , the defining feature of Boeheim 's system is the 2-3 defense . I 'd love to see how Chris Collins , one of the young stars in the profession , attempts to solve one of the toughest puzzles in college basketball . Would he play Skelly and Pardon together to try to get high-low ball movement in the paint ? Would he have B-Mac , Lindsey , Law and Falzon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? McIntosh and Pardon will have their hands full with talented sophomores Tyus Battle and Taurean Thompson , respectively . There 's no better way to come together as a team than to battle it out in front of 22,000 fans on the road . As always , Purple &gt; Orange . <p> Chris Grismer : Virginia <p> The Cavaliers , who finished fifth in the conference and were eliminated in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament last season , have given the Wildcats a hard time throughout the history of this competition , winning all three head-to-head matchups . Tony Bennett 's squad has been a top-10 defense per Kenpom for four straight years , and that will be the focus of this matchup , should it materialize . Last year , Virginia held opponents to just 31.7 percent shooting from deep and was effective in turning teams over . Under head coach Chris Collins , Northwestern has run a disciplined offense that minimizes turnovers , so this game could come down to who wins that battle . However , the Cavaliers are losing guard London Perrantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . His replacement , redshirt freshman De'Andre Hunter , is a former four-star recruit with a versatile offensive skillset , but losing the experience and clutch shot-making of Perrantes will be tough . All in all , a matchup between these two teams would be a fun defensive battle , and it would give the Wildcats a good test against a respected , unique opponent . Be warned , though : both Northwestern and Virginia play at a snail 's pace . If you 're looking for a high-scoring affair , this wo n't be it . <p> Caleb Friedman : Notre Dame <p> The Fighting Irish would be ideal for a few reasons . Notre Dame figures to be a borderline top-25 caliber team , and , because there are n't too many other teams like that on the Wildcats ' non-conference schedule ( so far ) , getting another opportunity to pick up a signature win would be beneficial . Also , Northwestern will be comfortable with the half-court pace Notre Dame traditionally plays at ; the Irish were 298th in average possession length last season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2017-2018 than it did in 2016-2017 , but running up and down with Duke or Louisville would be a difficult task for a team that is n't itching to push the tempo all that much . We saw how well Northwestern matches up with Notre Dame in last season 's Legends Classic Final when NU came one inbounds pass away from taking down the Irish in Brooklyn . With Sanjay Lumpkin gone , Bonzie Colson would be a difficult cover , but not one that should be insurmountable . Let 's get some revenge . <p> Martin Oppegaard : Duke <p> You simply ca n't write a better script than this . Collins vs . Coach K is the matchup that we have all been waiting for , and the ACC-Big Ten challenge is the perfect opportunity to make that happen . The Blue Devils are featuring a lot of roster turnover ; the losses of Jayson Tatum , Harry Giles , Luke Kennard and Frank Jackson to the NBA will loom large . However , Grayson Allen and Marques Bolden are back and as always , Coach K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 2 recruiting class in the nation . THREE five-star freshmen " Trevon Duval , Wendell Carter , and Gary Trent Jr . " should combine to have Duke in the preseason top 5 . The Blue Devils have n't finished outside the top 10 in Kenpom adjusted offensive efficiency since 2008 . Playing at legendary Cameron Indoor against an uber-athletic team would be an awesome challenge for this experienced Northwestern team , and a chance for a huge resume victory in Collins ' return to Durham . This feels like an ESPN prime time game to me . It would be an incredibly tough matchup , but against a very young Duke team that could still be finding its legs in non-conference play , Northwestern just might be able to hang around . If the Wildcats play like they did in the final half of the 2016-17 season , anything is possible . <p> Josh Burton : Florida State <p> I just think this would be a fascinating clash of styles , rosters , coaches , you name it . Leonard Hamilton churns out five-star recruits year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college basketball this season , but he has advanced past the Round of 32 just once in his 15 years in Tallahassee . The Seminoles will lose Michael Ojo , Dwayne Bacon and Jonathan Isaac to the NBA Draft this June , but still have a solid core and are adding the No. 25 overall recruit in MJ Walker . When playing well , Hamilton 's team was one of the best in college basketball , at one point going 5-1 in a stretch of six consecutive games against ranked ACC foes and reaching a season-high ranking of No. 6 . It would be an awesome early-season test for Northwestern to play such a talented and athletic team . Is it as flashy as a Northwestern-Duke matchup ? Probably not , but in terms of serving as a barometer for a team trying to carry the momentum over from a year prior , it would get the job done . <p> Tristan Jung : Louisville <p> It 's time to shoot for the big time , right ? Rick Pitino 's team was a two-seed in the NCAA Tournament and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's NCAA Tournament , Michigan showed that a Big Ten team could hang with and defeat Louisville , and Northwestern could certainly be competitive in this matchup . Above all , we 'd get to see Collins coach against Rick Pitino for the first time . Although it would n't be quite as narrative-heavy as Richard Pitino vs. his dad , it would still be a good battle of coaching styles . <p> Louisville can easily match Northwestern with backcourt experience and talent . Point guard Quentin Snider will be back for his senior season , along with athletic freak Donovan Mitchell . Deng Adel recently withdrew from the NBA Draft and will also return . If this matchup occurs , it will be a battle of two experienced cores . Louisville 's guards have a slight advantage , but with Mathiang leaving , there is a void at center . None of the new recruits play center , which will presumably leave 6-foot-10 Ray Spalding with more minutes . He averaged 5.9 points and 5.5 boards in 19.2 minutes per game last year , and you could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louisville , in its first three years of ACC-B1G action , has only drawn Ohio State , Michigan State and Purdue . The odds the Cardinals get Northwestern are n't high , but I certainly hope it happens . <p> Ragatz : Miami is a possibility too . The Canes will boast a talented trio of players in Bruce Brown , Lonnie Walker and Dewan Huell , and they finished pretty similarly to Northwestern in their conference last season . <p> For comparison , here are the standings for both the ACC and Big Ten in 2016-17 . Virginia Tech and Wake Forest both make some sense standings-wise , but ideally Northwestern wo n't have to play in Blacksburg for the second time in three years or play Wake twice in a row . <p> Who do you want to see Northwestern play in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge ?

How does Clayton Thorson look without his safety blanket ? <p> Thorson made a massive jump in every major statistical category last season after a rocky freshman campaign , but did so with the help of one of the country 's best receivers .

It seemed like every single time the sophomore QB needed someone to go to on third down , Carr was the man . Now Carr 's off to ( hopefully ) the NFL , and Thorson will need to show he can continue to be just as productive without him . This spring , we 'll especially be watching for Thorson 's decisiveness and his ability to throw on the run , both of which were question marks at times last year . Oh , and I 'm very curious to see who he 's established a strong connection with during the early stages of the offseason , which leads into my next question(s) ... <h> 2 . Can Flynn Nagel take over for Austin Carr ? Who else could emerge at receiver ? <p> Nagel is the obvious leading candidate to become Thorson 's new go-to target this season . He got plenty of experience last year and showed great hands and impressive quickness . If he can take a major step forward as a route-runner this offseason , Nagel could be a problem for Big Ten secondaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapport between Thorson and Nagel looks like . Spring practices should also help give us a sense of who else is likely to play important roles at the position . Last year , Andrew Scanlan impressed in the spring and wound up having a career year . Can Macan Wilson step up into the No. 2 role ? How will Oregon transfer Jalen Brown look in the offense ? Does Bennett Skowronek have the speed to be a prominent option on the outside ? Will a player like Riley Lees or Charlie Fessler stand out ? We should know more pretty soon . <h> 3 . Is the offensive line getting better ? <p> Of course , any improvements from Thorson and his targets will be hard to spot if the offensive line does n't do its job . The line was much-maligned a season ago but returns four of five starters and added grad transfer Trey Klock , which should help with depth . Ideally , we wo n't be talking about this unit much after the two spring practices , because if we are talking about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've said it before : the line is the x-factor . If it becomes consistently solid , watch out for this offense. <h> 4 . Can the linebackers survive the loss of Anthony Walker Jr. ? <p> Anthony Walker Jr . is gon na be an early to mid-round draft pick , which is awesome . However , his departure leaves a gaping hole in the middle of Mike Hankwitz 's defense . Nathan Fox appears to be the most likely replacement ; it 'll be interesting to see how he looks in a greatly elevated role . Outside linebackers Brett Walsh and Nate Hall have more experience but will both need to improve for this defense to be at its best . Also , who 's first in line behind those three ? Paddy Fisher and Jango Glackin are names to follow . <h> 5 .

@@97967914 @2167914/ <h> Gonzaga is rated the No. 1 team in the country by Ken Pomeroy . <p> After narrowly escaping in a 68-66 win over Vanderbilt , it certainly does n't get any easier for Northwestern . The Wildcats are dancing their way into a Round of 32 matchup against the No. 1 seed in the west , the Gonzaga Bulldogs . <p> Northwestern 's win was n't necessarily pretty , but they gutted out a win . Gonzaga had a similar Round of 64 experience against the Summit League Champion South Dakota State Jackrabbits . Although Gonzaga would close out a 66-46 win , the Jackrabbits hung around far too long for comfort . Gonzaga saw itself trailing for much of the first half , and carried only a 26-22 lead at the interval . <p> The game will tip-off at 4:15 p.m . CST . Northwestern opened as 10.5 point underdogs , and nothing will come easy against the battle-tested Bulldogs . This will be the toughest test for Chris Collins ' team this season . Here 's everything you need to know about the Gonzaga Bulldogs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 16.9 ppg , 5.7 rpg , 4.8 apg ) <p> In his first season for Gonzaga since transferring from Washington after the 2014-2015 season , Williams-Goss has emerged as the Bulldogs ' leading scorer by over four points . He 's an incredibly efficient player , shooting 52.1 percent from the field . The junior point guard has scored at least ten points in all but four games this season , and up until Gonzaga 's first round win over South Dakota State , Williams-Goss had scored double digits in 12 consecutive games ( he scored 9 in Thursday 's win ) . <p> Williams-Goss is deadly from mid-range and excels at getting to the rim . He 's perfected Gonzaga 's ball screen heavy offense , which let 's him turn the corner and take it himself or kick it to an open shooter . That 's helped him accumulate 157 assists to just 69 turnovers . Williams-Goss is also capable of scoring from beyond the arc . He takes nearly three triples a game , shooting them at a 36.1 percent clip . Do n't let the savvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws at 90.4 percent , good for 15th in the nation . Couple his offensive prowess with sound defense and 5.7 rebounds per game , and you have one of the best point guards in the country . In fact , Williams-Goss is a Bob Cousy Award Finalist . <p> Przemek Karnowski , senior center ( 12.6 ppg , 6.0 rpg , 2.0 apg ) <p> Northwestern 's seen some big centers this season ( Purdue 's Isaac Haas comes to mind ) , but none compare to Przemek Karnowski . The big man is listed at 7-foot-1 and 300 pounds , but he 's incredibly talented . Karnowski 's senior season was cut short last year due to back surgery , but his redshirt senior has been his best . His scoring is at a career high , and his field goal percentage sits at an impressive 60.2% . Karnowski is a weapon offensively and a presence on the defense end , and that 's helped him become a semifinalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award . <p> Against South Dakota State , Karnowski was limited in the first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good job of doubling Karnowski , something Northwestern will absolutely have to do . He 's a lefty much more comfortable using his left hand , and in the first half SDSU took away his right shoulder and forced him to fade to his left . Gonzaga still got the win , a routine occurrence for the NCAA all-time wins leader . Karnowski 's most underrated talent is his passing . The 7-footer is terrific at passing out of double teams and finding shooters on the perimeter . He 's a tough matchup for anyone , and Northwestern will have its hands full . Perhaps Karnowski 's one weakness is he 's only a 58.4 percent free throw shooter . <p> Zach Collins , freshman forward/center ( 10.2 ppg , 5.7 rpg , 1.5 bpg ) <p> Out of this entire Gonzaga team , its best NBA prospect is undeniably Zach Collins . The highly touted freshman has n't played a whole lot this season , and that 's because he has n't had to . He averages only 17.1 minutes per game and spends most of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four . Leave Collins open and he can hit the three ( 9-for-20 on the season ) , but he does his damage within the three-point arc , shooting 67.7 percent on two-point attempts . <p> Collins is a force on the glass on both ends , boasting an excellent 12.3 offensive rebounding percentage and a 22.7 defensive rebounding percentage . Perhaps more impressive is his 8.9 block percentage . Either way , Collins is an incredibly athletic player that will have a big impact on this game off the bench . <p> Jordan Mathews , senior forward ( 10.4 ppg , 3.2 rpg , 39.5% from three ) <p> After playing his first three years at Cal , Mathews has had an immediate impact for Gonzaga . He 's an volatile scorer , capable of pouring in 16 points like he did on Thursday , or notching only 3 points in 27 minutes as he did in the WCC Championship against St. Mary 's . As is the Gonzaga offense , with five players averaging in double digits , Mathews does not need to put up big numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and five of which are usually threes . He 's a balanced forward who takes care of the ball very well . However , he may be a bit undersized at 6-foot-4 for the three , and this could be a matchup to emphasize on the offensive end for Northwestern . <p> Josh Perkins , junior guard ( 8.4 ppg , 2.2 rpg , 3.4 apg ) <p> Perkins is Gonzaga 's starting two-guard , but he also serves as the backup to Williams-Goss when the star point guard takes a rare breather . The addition of Williams-Goss has affected Perkins ' minutes and production just a tick , but the junior guard has still put up solid numbers . He 's an excellent shooter , 40.1% from three , and is more than capable of distributing the basketball . His Achilles ' heel might be his tendency to press ; Perkins averages two turnovers per game . <p> Johnathan Williams , junior forward ( 10.2 ppg , 6.5 rpg , 59.9 fg % ) <p> The junior transfer from Missouri sat out last season , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coaching staff . Williams has emerged as Gonzaga 's leading rebounder and its starting power forward . Much like Collins , Williams takes high percentage shots and his two-point field goal percentage of 62.8 supports that fact . Williams is very strong on the defensive end , which he demonstrated on Thursday by locking up South Dakota State 's Mike Daum . Daum came into the game averaging 25.3 points per game , but Williams held him to 17 , his lowest scoring game in over a month . Williams is incredibly athletic and has shown his capability of defending the perimeter . I could see him on Sanjay Lumpkin or even Vic Law . <p> Silas Melson , junior guard ( 7.6 ppg , 2.4 rpg , 1.5 apg ) <p> It 's not often a preview goes seven players deep , but Melson is worth watching . He averages nearly 25 minute per game off the bench , primarily backing up Perkins but also spelling Mathews at times . The former Jefferson High School standout plays somewhat of a limited role on offense , he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the Gonzaga team . He 'll play down the stretch in big moments , and when Mark Few is in need of a big shot , Melson shoots at 53.8 percent from two and 38.2 percent from three . He 's a savvy player . <h> Game Analysis <p> On the bright side , if there was any one seed Northwestern had to play , Gonzaga is probably the one you pick . The recipe for beating the Bulldogs is nearly a secret ; they have only lost once this season and that was to an inspired BYU team who pulled off the upset on Senior Night in Spokane . They caught Gonzaga on an extremely cold shooting night ( 3-for-16 from three ) and were able to rebound with the Bulldogs ( both teams had 38 boards ) . BYU 's star center Eric Mika scored 29 points while holding Karnowski to 10 and Collins to 6 , and its shooters hit nine threes which helped carry the Cougars to a 79-71 win . <p> During his 18 years at Gonzaga , Mark Few has made 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1-seed was in 2013 when they finished the regular season 31-2 and then proceeded to fall to No. 9 seed Wichita State in the Round of 32 . Few has also lost in the Round of 32 eight different times . <p> Realistically , this might be the best Gonzaga team ever . KenPom loves Gonzaga 's efficiency ratings ; they are 12th in adjusted offensive efficiency and 1st in adjusted defense efficiency . Williams-Goss is an elite point guard , Karnowski is unlike any other player at his position , Collins is a legit NBA prospect , and the supporting cast is deep . This is a Gonzaga team that had a few tests in non-conference play , but it 's been a long time since they 've played a Top 50 team not named St. Mary 's . <p> So how does Northwestern match up with the West Coast powerhouse ? Can Dererk Pardon and the rest of the frontcourt battle with Karnowski and Collins ? Can Vic Law shut down Williams-Goss ? Does Northwestern have the depth to play 40 minutes with a team that boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , as they say , this is March . Northwestern 's young and na+ve , and they wo n't be intimidated on Saturday .

While he is n't quite as good of an outside shooter as his German counterpart , Wilson is a better rebounder and shot-blocker .

Northwestern needs to prioritize preventing open looks on the perimeter , but ca n't let the Wolverines get driving lanes or beat the Wildcats up in the paint . It will be interesting to see how Chris Collins matches up with Michigan 's duo of versatile big men ; Sanjay Lumpkin will have a size disadvantage against either Wilson or Wagner and Dererk Pardon may struggle when extended out to the three-point line .

Is it time to expect at least an NIT berth ? <p> With Northwestern basketball under two weeks away , it 's time to start addressing the most important issues facing this team and the questions it must answer as it hopes to progress toward the program 's first-ever NCAA Tournament . We 'll call this segment the " Eight Questions of Fate , " as the answers to these questions will likely determine how close Northwestern gets to that goal . Today we 're discussing the intermediate step between where NU is right now and the NCAA tournament : the NIT . <p> Northwestern basketball looks wholly different than it did on March 27 , 2013 . <p> That 's when Northwestern AD Jim Phillips hired Chris Collins , then the Associate Head Coach at Duke , to usher in a " NU era " of Wildcat basketball . An immediate boost in program visibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiting success and , thus , on-court talent . <p> The first recruiting coup came in the form of Vic Law , whose signing was significant not only because of his 4-star status , but also because he 's from the Chicagoland area , a region Collins ' predecessor Bill Carmody had trouble mining . But it was the signing of a 3-star point guard from Indiana by the name of Bryant McIntosh that has been most impactful . McIntosh has developed into one of the conference 's best point guards and is the undisputed leader of this team . <p> The next year brought another 4-star in New Hampshire native Aaron Falzon , the stretch-4 that Collins coveted , as well as Dererk Pardon , who will start at center this season . More success followed in 2016 in the form borderline 4-stars Rapolas Ivanauskas and Barret Benson as well as the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Washington , Isaiah Brown , whose performance in the season-opening scrimmage against Illinois-Springfield suggested he 'll see significant minutes . <p> By and large , the significant contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only seniors Nathan Taphorn and Sanjay Lumpkin are leftover from the Carmody era . The " Collins still does n't have his players " justification just is n't valid anymore , as he 's had three classes to tailor this team to his desired style of play . And the team has shown marked signs of improvement : after going 6-12 in conference in 2013-14 and 2014-15 , Northwestern went 8-10 last year and won 20 games . The total win count was spurred on by a really soft nonconference schedule , but 20 wins are 20 wins . <p> Collins has this program trending upward via sustained recruiting success , securing a desperately-needed , $100 million-plus renovation of Welsh-Ryan Arena , and marginal yet consistent improvement in actual basketball games . There is , however , one tangible marker of progress that Northwestern has failed to achieve in the Collins era , and that 's a berth in a meaningful postseason tournament . <p> The answer to the question that heads this article is a nuanced one . The progress off the court is there ; the recruiting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited shelf life without a corresponding uptick in on-court success . ( The recruiting pitch of " we 're building something special " recruiting pitch is n't effective forever " it preferably evolves into " come be a part of something special .

Washington finished 66th and made the NIT as did Georgia , which finished 71st . Yes , kenpom.com is n't the sole criteria for the NIT selection committee , but Northwestern was n't far off from reaching that tournament last year . At least , Northwestern was n't much worse than the teams that did receive an invite . If this year 's team is better than last year 's " which was the best of the three Collins has coached " they will almost certainly make the NIT . Thus , the type of on-court progress Collins and his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The loss of Tre Demps and Alex Olah , two of Northwestern 's top three offensive contributors per kenpom.com , wo n't make that any easier this year , that 's for certain . But Northwestern gets Law back from injury and will be led by a more experienced and physically mature McIntosh . The two freshmen , Brown and Benson , should contribute immediately on what will be the most athletic Northwestern team in years , if not ever . There 's enough talent and depth to make up for the loss of Demps and Olah , who were undoubtedly crucial but undeniably flawed players . <p> Not making the NIT would n't be catastrophic , though , given the loss of those two . Plus , it 's the 2017-2018 roster that looks most dangerous " McIntosh will be a senior , Law and Falzon and Pardon juniors , and Benson and Brown sophomores .

Anthony Walker , Tyler Lancaster <p> There are a lot of worries about the amount of turnover that Northwestern 's top five defense will face in 2016 and for the most part it 's justified . The team loses five seniors and that will be difficult to overcome if their replacements do n't produce . However , let 's focus on what Northwestern brings back .

But enough about Walker ; let 's talk about Tyler Lancaster . <p> Lancaster is an absolute beast . He can bench 225 pounds 32 times and still probably runs a sub 5.0 40-yard dash . You might not hear a lot about Lancaster in season , and that 's the way he likes it . He started all 13 games last year , recorded 33 tackles and 5.5 TFLs , and was overshadowed by guys like Walker and Dean Lowry . Lancaster will be one of the best lineman in the nation this season ; lock it down . <p> And that 's not even to mention Matt Harris and Godwin Igwebuike in the secondary .

According to Pat Fitzgerald , about 400 personal records have been set this offseason . The Big Ten Media Day attendees were even setting PRs in the hotel workout room the night before Media Days opened . That 's how committed they were . This is going to be one of the strongest teams in Northwestern history , and the quality of play will benefit from it . <h> 3 . Clayton Thorson will be better <p> This truly is the point on which the entire season will hinge , but Clayton Thorson will absolutely be better in 2016 .

He 'll be more accurate , more confident , and smarter in the pocket . We do n't know how much Thorson will actually improve , and expecting too much of him would be ill advised , but we do know that Northwestern will have a better quarterback in 2016 than they did in 2015. <h> 4 .

They Won 10 Games Last Year ! <p> Finally , here 's the kicker : no matter what happened in the Outback Bowl , and no matter what the national media might say , the Wildcats won 10 games last season . For only the fourth time ever ! The analytics say they should n't have , but they did , and we like wins , no matter how they come about ! They 're taking that momentum with them into 2016 . Sure 2013 was n't the follow up everyone hoped for after 2012 , but this is n't 2013 . It 's a new season with new players and no unionization efforts . This will be a good team , maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just has to hope that the win column reflects that . It 's still the offseason for another week , so before we all start tearing our hair out analyzing this team , let 's just sit back and enjoy the fact that Northwestern won 10 games last season .

@@97968001 @2168001/ <h> Saturday 's road tilt in Minneapolis is a huge chance for the Wildcats to get a much-needed win over a reeling Minnesota team . <p> Before the start of the 2015-16 season , the big question surrounding the Northwestern basketball program was whether or not this year was going to be the year . Chris Collins , who regularly participated in the Big Dance as a player and coach at Duke , had built a promising program in Evanston , and it seemed like this season could be the one for Northwestern to do what no team in school history has ever done . <p> With a 12-1 record through conference play ( the only loss coming against highly ranked North Carolina ) , the Wildcats appeared well on their way to pushing themselves squarely onto the NCAA Tournament bubble , even with the injuries to Vic Law and Alex Olah . But , after a win over Nebraska to begin conference play , the Wildcats have fallen short in their last two games , home losses to Maryland and Ohio State . <p> In fact , Northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last season through three conference games . In the 2014-15 campaign , the Wildcats were 9-4 through non-conference play , beat Rutgers in their Big Ten opener and then lost back-to-back games against very good teams in Wisconsin and Michigan State . After those setbacks , Northwestern would lose its next eight games to drop to 1-10 in conference and eliminate any positive momentum from the decent start . <p> The key for this year 's team , in order to distinguish it from last year 's version and potentially compete for a spot in the NCAA Tournament , is to stop this two-game losing skid before it picks up steam and sends this season spiraling out of control . <p> " You 've got ta stop the bleeding , " Collins said after Wednesday 's loss to Ohio State . " I do n't want to draw upon last year too much because it 's a new year , new group , but we had a chance to stop the losing streak five or six times , and ... we had a number of close losses . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta hate losing , and put whatever you can into that next game . " <p> Luckily for the Wildcats , that next game is against lowly Minnesota ( 6-9 overall , 0-3 Big Ten ) Saturday afternoon in a game that , for NCAA Tournament purposes , has nearly turned into a must-win . <p> Richard Pitino 's Golden Gophers have lost four games in a row and seven of their last eight overall as they have struggled mightily without their two leading scorers from last season , Andre Hollins and Maurice Walker , who have since graduated . <p> While Minnesota has had issues on the offensive end of the floor " the Golden Gophers are actually down two points per game from last year even with the new 30-second shot clocks " its defense has been the biggest issue . Minnesota has allowed 73.5 points per game so far this season , which is third-worst in the Big Ten , and is dead last in the conference in adjusted defensive efficiency , giving up an adjusted 1.05 points per possession ( Northwestern gives up 0.997 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Ten in field goal percentage ) , rebounding ( tied for last in rebounding margin ) and a host of other key categories , so it 's clear the Gophers are an inferior team , at least talent-wise , to Northwestern , even without Law and Olah . <p> Northwestern simply can not afford to lose this game . Outside of Rutgers , Minnesota might be the worst team the Wildcats will face this season in the Big Ten , and is a team the Wildcats have to beat if they want to maintain any semblance of hope of appearing in the NCAA Tournament in a few months . A loss , which would be NU 's fourth of the season , would put the Wildcats ' tourney hopes on life support . <p> It 's hard to count a team out of the tournament picture in early January , but with NU 's subpar non-conference schedule , major injuries and uneven start to conference play , Saturday 's game is as close to a must-win as an early January game can be . Last season , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss " the third of the eventual 10-game skid " it continued the stretch of poor play that ruined the entire season . <p> Tomorrow 's game could either be like that Illinois loss , and derail the promising start , or it could be a streak-breaking win that turns NU 's season around . It 's that important .

@@97968003 @2168003/ <h> The Slow-Down Offense is Here to Stay ... At Least for This Year <p> After last Thursday 's blowout loss to Michigan , Bill Carmody said Northwestern had to slow things down on offense . Before the season , Carmody had looked forward to pushing the tempo more than most years in his time at Northwestern , but due to unexpected injuries and the need to play a lot of freshman , the idea of an up-tempo offense may need to be shelved this year . <p> For the first half of Sunday night 's game at Minnesota , it looked like the slow tempo could work . NU was down just 17-14 at the break , due in part to solid defense , but also to the fact that the Wildcats drained the clock on every possession . However , the Gophers dictated the tempo in the second half and ran away with the game . <p> First off , a lot of teams are going to lose to Minnesota by double-digits at The Barn . The Gophers are ranked No. 13 in the country and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the fact that NU was able to control the tempo for as long as it did was surprising .

The fewer opportunities a team has to score , the less of a chance there is that they can run away with the game . With this strategy , NU probably wo n't be blown out all that much , but can the Wildcats win with it ? <p> Last year 's Northwestern team actually played this style of offense a lot last year . The Wildcats could n't get the ball inside effectively , so they would pass it around the perimeter and shoot a three as the shot clock wound down . That worked with a team that had outstanding shooters in John Shurna and Drew Crawford , but this team does n't shoot nearly as well . Reggie Hearn , Kale Abrahamson and Tre Demps have three-point shooting abilities , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On paper , this team looks like it would be better off trying to run through a conventional offense , pound the ball down low and run .

Demps is the most dynamic scorer that the Wildcats have , and while he shoots a lot " probably too much sometimes " his scoring will be valuable in games where points will be hard to come by . He needs to work on being more patient with the shot clock , but it makes a lot more sense to have him out there , especially among so many average shooters . <p> Next year , with the freshmen a year older and JerShon Cobb and Crawford back , NU should be able to run its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wildcats will be able to push the ball at times and they 'll get production inside .

" <p> Elon was carried by guard Tanner Samson , who took 13 threes and made eight of them . He finished with 24 points , and 30 of Elon 's 67 points came from the three ball . Northwestern allowed Samson to get too many open looks , and Olah gave up several easy lay-ups . Outside the handful of lapses , the defense played well and really stepped up in crunch time to get the victory . <p> Playing tight games with Elon , North Florida and Houston Baptist provides some reason for concern , but right now getting wins is extremely important . There are n't many W 's to be had in the conference slate , so if the Wildcats want any shot at postseason play , they have to own November and December . Collins said it 's good to see his young team finding ways to win . <p> " At the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Cancun . We 've done that . We have n't played our best basketball . We have a big area of growth with this team , and we 'll keep striving for that . " <p> Northwestern 's best basketball is still a long way off . Half of their players are new to the team .

Last week , it was third straight three-point win , this time by a score of 27-24 over Ohio . <p> With every scare , Minnesota looked like less and less of a contender in the Big Ten West . The preseason perception of the Gophers was that the offense would be average and the defense would be outstanding . So far , that 's been proven a bit off base . The offense is nowhere close to average right now " it 's in the bottom fourth of Division I by any core statistical measure ... <p> ... and the defense , while good , has only been outstanding in one game , and really good in one other . <h> 2 .

@@97968015 @2168015/ <h> Inside JerShon Cobb 's fight to stay healthy <h> JerShon Cobb has spent four years at Northwestern . During three of those four , his body has , time and time again , betrayed him . But coming off meniscus surgery and going into his senior year , there are multiple reasons to believe that this is the year -- the year that Cobb finally stays healthy . <p> Ever since the highly-touted guard arrived in Evanston in 2010 , his basketball career has been a story of what could have been . His undoubtedly tremendous talent has been inhibited by injury and suspension . His potential remains unfulfilled . <p> " We 've had some ups and downs , " assistant director of sports performance Mike Schweigert says resignedly . " We 've had some ups and downs . " <p> The ups and downs began immediately for Cobb from the outset of his freshman year at Northwestern . A hip injury hampered him throughout the season and caused him to miss seven games , and then required offseason surgery . <p> Coming off the surgery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . He practiced and played only intermittently , missing twelve games and participating in others at less than full strength . This time around , tendonitis in his knee and pain throughout his leg were the culprits . <p> The story of last season was nothing new to Cobb ; it 's a tale with which he 's become all too familiar . Heading into his senior year , he knows that the plot has to change . <p> Then , prior to the 2012-13 season , head coach Bill Carmody announced that Cobb would be suspended for the entire campaign , reportedly for academic reasons . <p> Going into last season , everything seemed to be falling into place . Cobb had a fresh start . He was back from suspension , had a clean bill of health , and figured to be a key player for new coach Chris Collins in his first season . <p> But as the year wore on , Cobb 's body wore down . First came an ankle injury in December that cost him two contests . Then , throughout the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was an ailment through which he was able to play , but it was a significant hindrance . And finally , after sustaining a foot injury against Ohio State , he was shut down for the remainder of the season . <p> So , three years of eligibility consumed , three seasons marred by injury . And that 's the disconcerting thing . The story of last season was nothing new to Cobb ; it 's a tale with which he 's become all too familiar . Heading into his senior year , he knows that the plot has to change . <p> So does his coach . " When we had JerShon last year , we were a pretty good team , " Collins says . " When he went down , it really hurt us . " <p> But what can he or they do to alter it ? Or , perhaps , a more frightening rephrasing of the question : Can they even do anything ? <p> *** <p> As for the latter of the two questions , Cobb is n't sure . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former is the pertinent one , answers are aplenty . And there 's a wide range of them . <p> Primarily , of course , there is the physical side of things . Cobb has worked with doctors , physical therapists , athletic trainers and Schweigert , who is in charge of the team 's strength and conditioning regiments , in an attempt to get his body in peak condition . That means everything from traditional rehab , to strength training , to advanced upper body conditioning to anti-gravity pool exercises . <p> But these are all part of what Schweigert calls a " normal progression . " So Cobb has n't stopped there . Another big focus of his has been his diet . <p> Back in June , for the first time , Northwestern hired a full-time sports dietician , Katie Knappenberger , to work with athletes on nutrition and body supplementation . It 's a move concurrent with the new wave of sports science that is becoming increasingly prevalent in professional and college athletics . <p> Cobb believes that the new approaches to meals and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , " he says . " I think she 's really giving us an edge . " <p> " I would n't say I was n't taking strength and conditioning seriously enough . But I 'd say I did n't take some steps that I could 've taken to prevent stuff . " -JerShon Cobb <p> In fact , Cobb 's newfound attention to what he puts in his body might provide insight into what has gone wrong for him in the past . It 's not that a faulty diet has been the reason for his multitude of injuries ; it 's that in previous years , he was more oblivious to what he needed to do to prevent them . <p> In high school , Cobb confesses , strength and conditioning programs like those through which Schweigert puts him were nearly non-existent . " Our practices were pretty tough in high school , " he says , " but it was n't anything compared to now . " The same can be said for nutrition guidelines , and in general , expectations for focus and dedication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transition to college basketball . " How much we had to do in the weight room , on the court , how much we had to do in class , everything was a shock . " <p> More than anything else , perhaps it 's that shock that Cobb 's injury issues can be attributed to . Perhaps Cobb was n't prepared to take the proactive approach to building his body that the college game necessitates , and as a result , his body was n't prepared for the grind . <p> " I would n't say I was n't taking strength and conditioning seriously enough , " Cobb says looking back on his years as an underclassman . " But I 'd say I did n't take some steps that I could 've taken to prevent stuff . " <p> But if it was that shock and that ill-preparedness that were major causes of the trips to the sideline and the training room , there 's also reason to believe that this year could be different ; that Cobb could successfully alter the plot . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes go through on the collegiate level , " Schweigert says , referencing Cobb 's period of adaptation early in his career , " where you 're just not as aware of things as you are when you 've gone through it a bit . I think those things happened for JerShon this summer . " <p> Collins concurs . " I think he 's been better taking care of himself , " the second-year head coach says . " With his nutrition , with his weightlifting , with his strength and conditioning , getting rest -- all those things help . Sometimes getting hurt is freak accidents , but I think he 's been more mature with how he 's taken care of himself . " <p> " This summer is the most focused JerShon has been since he 's been here . " -Mike Schweigert <p> " This summer is the most focused JerShon has been since he 's been here , " Schweigert continues , now with a great deal of confidence . " He knew that he had to deal with something , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some players going through some of that stuff , they probably would 've called it quits , but he 's worked hard to get himself back into the shape he needs to be in to be a player . " <p> When asked about his fellow captain , Tre Demps echoes the thoughts of Schweigert and Collins . He ca n't help but repeat the word " hungry . " <p> " He seems real confident about himself right now , " Demps says . " Where his mind is at , and how hungry he is , and just talking to him and seeing his body language , there 's something different about him . " <p> Whether " different " equals " better " remains to be seen . But in Cobb 's situation , it 's an imperative first step to rewriting the script of his so-far injury-riddled career at Northwestern . <p> *** <p> Is JerShon Cobb injury prone ? <p> Nobody , not even Schweigert , an expert on the body , knows for sure . <p> Cobb 's history , coupled with logic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard seems to be sidelined more often than not , and it 's the consistency with which he 's banged up that is most worrying . <p> But with any injury , there is undoubtedly an element of luck - or a lack thereof - involved too . <p> " Most major injuries are not preventable , " Schweigert says . " You can do your best to minimize those things , but if those things are going to happen , they 're probably going to happen . " <p> Schweigert makes an important distinction though . " There 's two things , " he says . " There 's the actual breakdown of the body . And then there 's just freak things that happen in play . " <p> But the question for Cobb is , which category do most of his issues - the hip and knee tendinitis , the fractured foot , the torn meniscus - belong in ? As Collins hinted at ( above ) , it 's probably a mixed bag . <p> The tendinitis would be considered a breakdown of the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be classified as such . The foot though , which ended his season , would probably be described as more of an outlier . <p> But the key to Cobb 's problems is that they 're likely not isolated incidents . The body is an intricate , connected unit , and one injury can lead to the next . <p> " A lot of times what happen is , if somebody gets injured in one area , then a lot of times there 's a compensation , " Schweigert says . " For instance , Cobb hurt his hip ; well there 's a good probability that because of his hip injury and surgery , something else for a while had to take up the slack . <p> " It happens a lot with ankles and knees , where you 're favoring one side and it puts a little more stress on the other . We work our best to minimize those things , but sometimes it just happens . " <p> It 's this knock-on effect that Cobb has been particularly vulnerable to . And it 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one muscle or joint falls behind , the rest follow . Weakness in one part of his body , particularly his lower body , puts more stress on another part of his body . And it 's that added stress with which he 's been unable to cope . <p> Schweigert admits that Cobb is probably more prone to these bodily breakdowns than other athletes . " He 's had a tough road from that standpoint , " Schweigert says . <p> But Cobb is determined to prove that he can stay on the court . " It 's one of my goals this year , not missing any games , " he says . And that 's why that aforementioned hunger and focus have become so apparent . <p> *** <p> It 's not going to be easy . <p> In fact , it has n't been easy . JerShon Cobb 's summer was one of exertion and struggle . <p> Cobb went under the knife in late March , shortly after the end of Northwestern 's season , for a repair of his meniscus . <p> His road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knee for roughly six weeks . It was n't until late May or early June that Cobb could even start jogging . As he progressed , leg strength and stability became the focuses , with a particular emphasis on the quadriceps muscle . <p> As with any rehabilitation process , the progress was not linear . Instead , it mirrored Cobb 's career . There were ups and downs . And as with any rehabilitation process , the hurdles were both physical and mental . <p> " It was sore a lot after I would do things , " Cobb says . " But knowing that I could n't do things that I have been doing my whole career , that was tough . " <p> " It 's tough to say , yeah , he 's ready , ' or no , he 's not . ' But you trust your process , and have faith in what you do , and hope that things bounce your way . " -Mike Schweigert <p> However , Cobb says he has already cleared those hurdles . Now , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has been fully cleared to play , and says he feels 100 percent . But Collins and Schweigert know that to treat him as such would be a mistake . <p> " With an injury like that , it 's managing the volume , " Schweigert says . " Is Cobb going to go every rep ? No . Are there days he will ? Yes . But it 's a communication process between the player , the athletic training staff , myself , and the coaches to manage that and give him the best chance to make it through the season . " <p> Collins also seems to imply that he has been and is planning on taking things slow with his senior guard . He 's even been using another player he 's been around recently as a point of comparison . <p> " We use Derrick Rose as an example , " Collins says , referring to the Bulls guard who had the same meniscus surgery as Cobb . " Rose is just starting to come back into his own after his surgery . JerShon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea of keeping the reigns on his return , perhaps unnecessarily as a precaution , is n't exactly something Cobb welcomes with open arms . As any player would , Cobb wants to be on the floor , liberated and unrestrained . But in the end , he and Collins share a common goal . <p> " We need to keep him on the floor , " Collins says matter-of-factly . " Our goal is to have him suited up and healthy and ready to go every game this season . " <p> That likely will mean a decrease in minutes . Cobb 's playing time rose astronomically last year , from 20.4 minutes per game in 2011/12 to 33.6 in his first season under Collins . And they both know that that type of heavy workload ca n't be sustained . But with increased backcourt depth , Collins thinks such reliance on Cobb wo n't be necessary . <p> So will all of this - the offseason strength training , the new diet , the renewed focus , and the curtailed workload - enable Cobb to finally put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he is capable of ? Is this the year he finally stays healthy ? <p> " It 's tough to say , yeah , he 's ready , ' or no , he 's not , ' " Schweigert explains .

In the Big Ten , that maxim becomes especially true as teams batter you until the clock hits zero . <p> But for Northwestern , stopping the run is essential because the Wildcats have a dangerous play-action game led by a dual-threat quarterback and a bevy of players on the outside who can get open , especially in the right scheme . <p> After a disjointed and disappointing first half , the Wildcats came out and utterly dominated . They scored touchdowns on their first four drives of the half and probably could have scored on every single drive of the half if they had wanted to . <p> But for the meaningful part of the second half " before Tom Hruby got carries on Veteran 's Day weekend and before Northwestern left West Lafayette with a convincing win " Northwestern pulled away .

The Wildcats went 71 yards in seven plays , with 66 yards coming off five runs . Here are four of them : <p> Each play is important .

At half speed , the offensive line movement looks very similar . It 's easy to see how the Purdue defense would be confused . <p> Notice how in both clips , Northwestern pulls an interior lineman around to the right , acting as a lead blocker for the running back .

That reaction resulted in one of the easiest pitch-and-catches Thorson and Dickerson will enjoy all year . <p> The floodgates were opened not by this play , but by the success of a simple stretch run .

@@97968050 @2168050/ <h> The Commodores are three-point dependent , almost to a fault . <p> CBS made Northwestern wait until the final region of the 2017 NCAA Tournament field to hear its name called for the first time in program history , but that did n't limit the celebration in Evanston . Now , the Wildcats are tasked with slowing down a Vanderbilt team that is lethal from beyond the arc . <p> Both teams had a nice conference tournament win ( over Maryland and Florida , respectively ) to lock up their bids to the NCAA Tournament . They were each ousted in the ensuing semifinals , however . <p> They 'll meet on Thursday afternoon in Salt Lake City at 3:30 p.m . CST on TBS . Here 's everything you need to know about the Commodores before tip-off : <p> Head coach : Bryce Drew , first season . 19-15 with Vanderbilt , 143-64 in his career . Previous head coaching position(s) : Valparaiso from 2011-2016 <h> Players to Watch <p> Matthew Fisher-Davis , junior guard ( 13.6 ppg , 3.2 rpg , 37.2% 3FG ) <p> Fisher-Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging double digit points . Efficiency is not Fisher-Davis ' strength ; the junior takes over 10 shots a night and hits at just over a 40 percent clip from the field . He has struggled down the stretch as well , reaching double figures in just two of Vanderbilt 's final six games . <p> Additionally , Fisher-Davis was benched twice earlier this season by Drew , and did not make the trip to Arkansas in early February due to a violation of athletic department policy . He 's somewhat of an eclectic scorer and has the ability to score from anywhere on the floor but is a shooter first and foremost , taking nearly seven three-point attempts per game . <p> Jeff Roberson , junior forward ( 11.0 ppg , 7.1 rpg , 1.8 apg ) <p> Roberson has seen his minutes and his numbers increase each year in Nashville . At 6-foot-6 , he 's a bit undersized for a power forward , but his 18 percent defensive rebounding rate leads the team . Offensively , Roberson 's biggest strength is his ability to stretch the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only won four games in which he did n't make a three . <p> Luke Kornet , senior center ( 13.2 ppg , 6.2 rpg , 1.4-4.6 3PM-3PA ) <p> The biggest test for Northwestern 's front court will assuredly be Kornet . The senior is 7-foot-1 and will be a handful for Dererk Pardon and Barret Benson to deal with . He is n't a force on the glass , though , but is a huge part of Vanderbilt 's offense . He takes over 10 shots per game , nearly five of which are from beyond the arc . <p> One of the Commodores ' best attributes is the top-to-bottom shooting they boast from all positions . Kornet is no exception and even shoots over 85 percent from the free throw line . On the defensive end , Kornet uses his size effectively . His 6.6 percent block rate is good for 87th in the country . <p> Riley LaChance , junior guard ( 10.5 ppg , 3.3 rpg , 3.9 apg ) <p> The junior point guard is the leader of this team and , like Roberson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's also Vanderbilt 's most efficient shooter , as his 49.3 three-point percentage is good for ninth nationally . However , he does commit around two turnovers a game , so ball pressure can throw him off his game and limit the good looks he gets . <p> Joe Toye , sophomore forward ( 6.4 ppg , 2.6 rpg , 1.1 apg ) <p> The sophomore from Chicago was the No. 6 player in Illinois ( per 247 Sports ) in the 2015 recruiting class . As Drew has become much more comfortable using Toye down the stretch of the season , the 6-foot-7 wing has seen his minutes increase drastically . He played over 30 minutes per game in the SEC Tournament . He also shoots nearly 41 percent from three . Sense a trend ? <p> Nolan Cressler , senior guard ( 7.9 ppg , 4.1 rpg , 1.8 apg ) <p> Cressler is Vanderbilt 's sixth man , capable of spelling Fisher-Davis at the two or Toye at the three and shoots 52 percent from the field . Vanderbilt is 10-4 when Cressler reaches double figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Drew 's glue guys . The Cornell transfer is also a 43 percent three-point shooter . <h> Game Analysis <p> This is a good draw for Northwestern . It was surprising to see Vanderbilt as a No. 9 seed as most brackets had the Commodores pegged as a 10 . With that said , it 's hard to overlook the Commodores ' strength of schedule . They fell to NCAA Tournament teams Marquette , Bucknell , Butler , Minnesota , Middle Tennessee and Dayton , all before SEC play , so it would be a massive understatement to say Vanderbilt is battle tested . <p> What got Vanderbilt back to the Big Dance in Drew 's first season in Nashville was three-point shooting . Vandy has made made 337 triples , the seventh-most in the country , and every player in the rotation can knock one down . The Commodores are n't inefficient from three either , shooting just under 38 percent as a team , which is 52nd nationally . They also get to the foul line a lot and convert when they get there , going 77.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , this game figures to be won or lost from the perimeter . Vanderbilt does not have a good enough interior scoring presence to withstand a cold shooting game . Northwestern 's perimeter defense will be put to the test , and if it passes , Drew 's team will struggle to put up points . That 's when the Commodores are vulnerable and , ultimately , beatable.

Yes , all their players graduate . So do Northwestern 's ! In fact , Northwestern does this better than Notre Dame does ! That 's insufferable - on both ends - but it does n't really hurt NU on its face . That said , Northwestern has staked its claim on recruiting the best players in the country who want good educations , a recruiting strategy that 's worked out well for Northwestern . But even then , Northwestern will never win that battle with Notre Dame : they use that as a pitch and land five star recruits , where Northwestern gets four stars . As long as Notre Dame 's **41;0;TOOLONG thing is a thing , it 's hard to imagine Northwestern winning a lot of head-to-head recruiting battles against them , which is annoying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles . <p> If you scared , say you scared : Notre Dame used to play Northwestern a lot . Between 1965 and 1994 , the two teams played 14 times - basically , once every two years . There were a few big gaps , including one of over a decade , but Northwestern was a consistent feature on Notre Dame 's schedules . Coincidentally , Notre Dame won every last one of those games . Northwestern was a local rollover win . They played four games against Northwestern in the 1990 's - two in South Bend , two in Chicago where they could draw huge crowds . Sorry , Ryan Field . <p> Then came 1995 , when Northwestern won 17-15 in South Bend , the game that sparked the renaissance of Northwestern football . NU would win the Big Ten title three times in six years and be a pretty okay team at other times . <p> Weird - all of a sudden , Notre Dame was n't interested in playing Northwestern .

Generous , you guys ! <p> Chicago 's Big Ten team : Those words are very carefully chosen . The argument that Northwestern is Chicago 's Big Ten team is a tenuous one , but at least it 's plausible .

The Wildcats were co-champions of the Western Conference with Michigan that year and did lose to a quality team in Notre Dame .

Northwestern largely contained the Commodores typically potent perimeter scoring , holding Vanderbilt to 4-of-10 from three in the opening 20 minutes . Northwestern shot 5-of-7 from three in the half . <p> Out of the break , McIntosh 's hot-shooting continued . The Junior from Greensburg , Indiana hit a pair of jumpers to extend the Northwestern lead to 38-28 and force Drew to call another timeout . After Vic Law Jr . got his first points of the day with a jumper , McIntosh hit yet another floater , giving him 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting . <p> Vanderbilt then went cold from the outside , as Northwestern kept rolling .

That nine-point outburst took just over 90 seconds of game time . <p> Lindsey proceeded to miss a three on the other end , and Fisher-Davis then hit another three , this time an off-balance shot from the corner to make the score 49-46 . <p> Pardon stopped the scoring run at 12 with a midrange jumper , before Lindsey took a steal to the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , as Willis added an easy bucket . <p> Northwestern then slowed things down offensively , and Pardon followed a miss by Lindsey to make the lead seven again at 55-48 . Drew then called his final timeout with 7:12 to play . <p> Fisher-Davis hit two shots out of the timeout , cutting the lead to 55-52 . McIntosh answered with another floater , but Kornet hit his first three since the early moments of the game to make it a two-point game . <p> As the clock ticked down under five minutes , Pardon drew a foul , and went on to hit both free throws to make the score 59-55 . Cressler then missed two shots at the rim , but Jeff Roberson tracked down the offensive rebound , and Fisher-Davis was fouled on a three-point shot with 2:40 left in the game . <p> Fisher-Davis hit all three at the line , but got loose on the next possession , drawing a foul and hitting a pair of free throws with 2:30 left . <p> With Northwestern leading 61-58 , Law Jr . was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of two from at the stripe . <p> McIntosh was stuffed at the rim on the next possession , and LaChance buried a deep three with Pardon switched on him to give Vanderbilt its first lead since 5-4 . But McIntosh kept coming . The Captain got into the paint once again , calmly hitting another floater , giving Northwestern the lead right back at 63-62 with 1:11 to play . <p> Fisher-Davis missed a long three on the following possession , and Law Jr . skied for the rebound , drawing the fourth foul on Kornet in the process . Law Jr . missed the front end of the one-and-one though , and Robertson found himself wide open for a layup on the other end . <p> McIntosh drove in again , this time missing . But Pardon was right there for the rebound , and drew the fifth foul on Luke Kornet in the process . Pardon drained the ensuing pair , and Vanderbilt brought the ball up with 26.1 seconds to play , down by one . LaChance found space inside , though , and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commodores . <p> But , Fisher-Davis seemingly intentionally fouled McIntosh on the next possession , and McIntosh hit a pair of free throws with 14 seconds to play to give a Northwestern 67-66 advantage . That lead would be decisive . <p> LaChance clanged a three with less than 10 seconds to play , and the rebound went out of bounds to Northwestern with 1.4 seconds to play . <p> Vanderbilt would get one more chance after Lumpkin hit 1-of-2 at the line , but its three-quarter-court heave would not fall . As the final buzzer sounded , the scoreboard read 68 Northwestern-66 Vanderbilt.

This is the Purple Drank . <p> If you 're here , you 're probably a fan of one of two things : either Northwestern athletics , or the promathazine-based hallucinogenic drug widely referred to as purple drank . ( Really , Wikipedia ? You have a purple drank page ? Anyway , back to the post . ) <p> In this inaugural post , I will poorly summarize both by providing a brief primer for people who came here looking for one of those things , but know little about the other . <p> First , drank fans : Northwestern University is a proud academic institution founded in 1857 , that , for some reason or another , decided to give a rats ass about athletics from its founding until roughly 1995 . Somewhere along the line , its administrators had the bright idea to join an athletic conference with nine ten other schools , all of whom give multiple rats asses about athletics , are literally all at least three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with the exception of whatever the hell Purdue is supposed to mean ) and who carry tremendous amounts of civic/state pride in their taxpayer funded athletic teams . Northwestern , on the other hand , is , like , really small , named after some directions which the location of the school really does n't represent at all , and , the fanbase consist of approximately 1/3 of the already small school and it 's alumni . You do n't have to be one of the uncomfortably studious athletes to figure out how those matchups went for the vast majority of the school 's history . <p> Now , NU fans : Purple Drank is a mixture of cough syrup , Sprite , and generally , Jolly Ranchers popular throughout the southern hip-hop community . Sizzurp influenced music is generally really slow , repetitive , and awfulasall hell . Syrup gave rise to the screwed-and-chopped music scene , which involves taking normal songs , slowing them down , and randomly repeating some words over and over again so that nobody could possibly enjoy it as much as the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - full disclosure , I love me some southern hip-hop - but for better or worse , drank has given creative aide to every rapper from Weezy to UGK to all these clowns . <p> At face value , not much . In fact , I went ahead and cross-checked the database of all people who have ever attended a Northwestern football game and all people who have ever sipped purple drank and made a Venn diagram , the results of which are below . <p> Anyway , here 's where I finish this post and wrap this convoluted , terrible metaphor up nice and tight . To me , the similarity is this : both the purple drank scene and NU sports have come a long way - chopped-n-screwed music used to just be a couple of dj 's in Houston dicking around with records and getting overwhelmingly messed up by cough syrup , now it 's a friggin youtube cottage industry , with random heads from Houston with approximately no talent going platinum . The phrase " doormat of the Big Ten " has been used in approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below mediocrity from an NU football team would be considered a major disappointment . <p> So , basically , sipping the purple drank is about slowing down and enjoying those moments . For southern rap songs , the slowing down is literal - its sort of the side effect of all the codeine in your blood system - but with NU , you need to slow your roll and force yourself to savor the good times . Right now , we 're in the midst of those good times - like I said earlier , people expect mediocrity , at least , from our football team , and with Kevin Coble graduating , we 're looking at a now or never year for our basketball team , and , truth be told , I 'm feeling now more than never . So , that 's what this blog is about . Northwestern fans have to accept our place in the sports universe , and that , plus the Sprite and jolly ranchers , can make the good times so much sweeter . So sip some sizzurp with me and enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank is purple , kinda like the uniforms our team wears .

But that reflects the fact that he 's been trending up . And stars ca n't show you that he chose Northwestern over Purdue and Iowa , who had both offered , and all of the following schools that had shown interest : <p> Shortly before his commitment , Ivanauskas had talked about how dedicated Northwestern had been in its recruitment of him . Collins ' and assistant coach Armon Gates ' commitment will be key as they pursue another big man and another point guard to back up ( and eventually succeed ) Bryant McIntosh . <p> So who 's on the radar ?

The Barrington , Ill. product is an early cornerstone for this recruiting class , and this gives Collins and company a lot of time to pursue other major recruits . With two open spots to play with currently and one solid commitment already , Chris Collins has Northwestern not only competing with , but beating out other Big Ten schools for highly-rated high schoolers .

Just look at what happened last year against Nebraska . <p> Photo credit : Sylvan Lane <p> The Nebraska game might be the most glaring example of a Ryan Field takeover by opposing fans , but it 's not the only one . Michigan , Iowa and Ohio State have shown up in Evanston in similar droves in recent years , and the TV cameras face the " away " section of the stands , so Ryan Field looks even less purple on TV than it really is . The Nebraska game is a good case study of what went wrong with NU 's ticket policy , and how the athletic department can change things to make the stadium more purple against Ohio State . <p> NU already has a few , non-ticket policy factors going in its favor . First off , the Ohio State game is Homecoming this year , which should bring more alumni to town than a regular home games " even one of this magnitude " would have . Secondly , the Wildcats have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 , so there should be a high demand for tickets for all games , especially this one . <p> But still , even with those factors in play , NU would have struggled to achieve a good purple-to-red ratio had it kept last year 's season ticket policy . This year , the Wildcats are changing things up to avoid a similar attendance embarrassment . <p> As Lake the Posts wrote , in the past , Northwestern season ticket holders have received perks not available at other schools . The biggest perk is that season tickets holders could buy as many additional single game tickets as they wanted before those tickets went on sale to the general public . However , that perk backfired on NU for last year 's Nebraska game . NU season ticket holders recognized the large demand for that game from Nebraska fans , so they gobbled up tickets and sold the game out before tickets went on sale to the general public . Subsequently , they sold their tickets to Nebraska fans on the secondary market . The plan did backfire on season ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secondary market that they were going for dirt cheap just before game day .

However , in an effort to keep its showcase game purple , the NU athletic department changed things up . Assistant Athletic Director of Athletic Communications Paul Kennedy outlined the new policy : <p> - Season ticket holders are able to purchase a limited number of additional tickets to games designated as " premium marquee " contests . Those games this year are Michigan and Ohio State . <p> - This is the first time we have imposed a limit . <p> - The number of additional tickets that STH 's will be able to secure will depend on how many season tickets they have . <p> - 1 season ticket " Up to 2 additional tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets <p> - 5+ season tickets " Up to 12 additional tickets <p> - The reasoning is that demand ( for both season tickets and single-game tickets ) continues to grow at unprecedented rates and we want to make sure that single-game tickets are an available option for fans to enjoy Northwestern football <p> Of course , the only way this will make any difference is if NU fans buy more season tickets than they have in the past . If they do n't , then Ohio State fans will have the ability to buy more single game tickets when they go on sale to the general public , which would create an environment similar to last year 's . However , given the increased excitement surrounding the program , there should be more demand for season tickets than there has been in reason seasons . <p> Filling Ryan Field with purple will always be a problem , and there figures to be a lot of red in the stadium on October 5 .

@@97968128 @2168128/ <h> More and more people are coming down on the side of paying college athletes , but it 's embarrassing that there 's even a debate at all . If you 're against players being paid , you should be ashamed of yourself . <p> Over the last few years , the movement to pay college athletes has gained significant momentum , thanks in part to Taylor Branch 's brilliant 2011 article eviscerating the college sports system and Ed O'Bannon 's lawsuit against the NCAA for profiting off his image in video games without paying him . This is a good thing , because to any reasonable person , it is outrageous that college athletes , in particular football and men 's basketball players , not only get zero percent of the billions of dollars in revenue they generate , but also are n't allowed to make a dime in profit off their skills from any source at all . Unfortunately , a disturbingly large percentage of fans , journalists , coaches and administrators continue to defend this indefensible system . <p> To see just how crazy the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen if the music industry came under the NCAA umbrella . Flash back to 1992 , when Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton , two Atlanta high school students , meet and form the hip-hop group OutKast . They release their number 1 single " Player 's Ball " in 1993 , and it 's clear the two are on the way to superstardom . But as amateurs , they are not allowed to make any money and have to go to college for three years ( say , at Georgia ) before being eligible to be drafted by a professional label . While at college , they release ATLiens and Aquemini , but because they are still amateurs , they can not profit from these wildly successful albums . When they are finally allowed to become professionals , they reach their peak fame with " Hey-Ya ! " in 2003 , but are still not allowed to profit off the success of their " amateur " songs and albums . Meanwhile , Georgia and whatever company produced those songs and albums makes a killing in royalties . <p> Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system makes no logical sense to anyone . Not even someone who supports the NCAA would ever support a system in which supremely talented young musicians and actors were not allowed to be paid . Yet somehow , due to a combination of ignorance , stupidity , jealousy and selfishness , these same people support an identical system for athletes . <p> Others have already spent considerable time obliterating the arguments from the don't-pay-the-players crowd ( this Q&amp;A with Sports On Earth 's Patrick Hruby is very good ) , but there 's one in particular I want to focus on , and that 's the argument that players are already paid with an education , and that this education is sufficient ( all three of the pieces arguing against paying players linked above make that point ) . There are several problems with this logic . <p> First of all , education is not money . While a scholarship unquestionably has significant value , it can not be exchanged for money . A student who comes from a poor family can not use the " payment " of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow money from anyone for this purpose , he will get suspended on the eve of the biggest game of his career . Click that link . Jamar Samuels was n't allowed to play in a tournament that CBS and Turner paid the NCAA billions of dollars to broadcast because he accepted $200 to feed his family . He was " paid " in education while everyone else involved was paid in cash . <p> But more significantly , an education is a nebulous form of payment because of the wildly different academic backgrounds of Division I athletes . If a kid is good enough , most schools will accept him no matter how poor his academic track record is and how ill-suited he is to attend college . Although 30% of high school graduates do not attend college , as far as I can tell , every single top prospect in both basketball and football is able to get into college . From Ohio State stand-out point guard and pre-med student Aaron Craft to Oklahoma State 's illiterate star defensive end Dexter Manley and everyone in between , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot for you . And for guys like Manley , an " education " is basically worthless if you can not read . <p> But even if the colleges and universities in question stayed true to their purpose as institutions of higher education and only admitted qualified students and made sure those students took real classes , being paid in education alone still would n't be enough . There are no other businesses in which the people doing the actual work do n't get paid . In fact , there are plenty of boosters out there who are more than willing to pay players , yet the NCAA and the schools involved actively collude to keep them from being paid . This is not only morally wrong , it 's clearly a violation of American laws forbidding monopolies , anti-competitive collusion , and price-fixing . It should be obvious to anyone with a clue that the system is wrong . I recall explaining major college sports to a friend of mine , a young woman born and raised in China who had just come to Boston for school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as professional sports , yet the players are only given a scholarship , and her jaw literally dropped . She could n't believe that the players were forbidden from being paid . " I thought this was the Land of the Free ? ! ? ! " she exclaimed , without irony . <p> So there you go , defenders of this nonsense . You 're supporting an economic policy so outrageous that it shocked someone from a Communist country . Some of you support it because you are jealous of incredibly talented players getting a free education while you had to pay for yours because you were n't incredibly talented at anything . Some of you support it because you fear the changes that would inevitably result , selfishly caring more about yourself than changing a incredibly unjust system . And some of you are just hopelessly foolish or ignorant and will never accept reason . <p> As for how much the players should be paid and by whom , I really do n't care , as long as they are given reasonable compensation . Give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model where they can accept endorsements and payment from third parties , give them an hourly wage , whatever . Just give them something . And more importantly , stop supporting a system that is obviously wrong . Bomani Jones on his podcast said this best a while ago , in a lengthy rant that you can listen to in its entirety here ( the part I quoted starts at around 14:30 ) : <p> If you do n't agree with me that players should be paid , you 're wrong . I do n't mean that you 're wrong as in like factually being wrong , I mean like inside of who you are , you are wrong , you are reprehensibly wrong ..... I do n't see any way in the world that you can argue the idea that people put in work and do n't get paid a currency that the market should bear out , and we 're not talking about star NBA players making 14 , 15 million dollars and having their wages capped , we 're talking about guys that ca n't get anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the schools to keep them broke . Either you on the side over here with me and mine , or you 're wrong , you 're wrong inside , you 're wrong as a person , and you are wrong logically , and if you are one of those people who believe that capitalism is a core principle of this country , then you are also wrong as an American , I can tell you a zillion levels on which YOU . ARE . WRONG . and me and my side is right , and if you just wan na be wrong , that 's cool , but someone 's got ta look you dead in your grill and tell you : YOU . ARE . WRONG .... and if that 's what it is and you just want to ride out with it , then ride out with it , but ride out with the knowledge that you 're wrong and you just do n't care , and do n't come in my face talking about anything moral on any level ever again , because you are consciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... you just tell me , if you pay someone with something they ca n't spend , while you know they 're out hungry , while you know some of these cats ca n't afford to drive cars and stuff like that , and on top of that you know there 's efforts made at every turn to KEEP . THEM . BROKE .... you know this at every single turn , and you know that on the back end , people are out here getting paid millions of dollars off their backs ... tell me how you do n't know that you 're wrong . <p> Jones ' attitude is the perfect response to this " debate " , because there should n't be a debate . If Jones is ever on ESPN in some contrived debate about whether or not to pay players , I hope he takes that some tone to anyone arguing the other side , because being on the other side is not acceptable . You are obviously in the wrong if you think the current system is okay , as obviously wrong as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with someone without their consent is okay . Just as obviously , collusion and price-fixing are not nearly as evil as racism or rape , but all of them are equally indefensible . And someday , when Ed O'Bannon or someone like him beats the NCAA in court and players start getting paid like they should , we will look back on the days when college athletes were n't paid while others made millions off their backs as an embarrassing chapter in our history as Americans that we took too long to rectify . And if you somehow still do n't agree with players being paid , look yourself in the mirror and realize just how wrong you are , and try to find some logic and compassion within yourself .

When you consider the recent history of the athletic department , its more than likely he wo n't be axed . <p> Athletic director Jim Phillips enjoys coaching stability . Often , it makes sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program around , he also likes to keep his staff stable . Kelly Amonte Hiller has built a dynasty .

Regardless , a brief scan around Northwestern 's 19 sports shows a lot of people that have been in charge for long periods of time - and in situations where they have n't been , the previous job-holder had been in charge for a long period of time . <p> I feel like I 've done this before ? But I could n't find evidence of it anywhere . <h> No changes under Phillips <p> Football : Obviously . Still Fitz . <p> Women 's lax : Kelly Amonte Hiller is the only women 's lacrosse coach Northwestern has ever had , and with a whole bunch of national titles , that 'll remain the case as long as she wants it to be . <p> Women 's tennis : Claire Pollard is in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Big Ten titles , that makes sense . <p> Softball : Kate Drohan is in her 12th season as NU 's coach , and with a consistently ranked team and some deep postseason runs , that also makes sense . <p> Men 's golf : Pat Goss is in his 17th year here , is n't leaving anytime soon . NU is his alma mater and he 's produced some talented golfers and won some Big Ten titles . Plus , him being Luke Donald 's personal coach gives NU some airtime . <p> Men 's soccer : Tim Lenahan really turned the program around when he took over , with a team that was a perennial cellar-dweller now competing for Big Ten championships pretty much every year . <p> Fencing : Laurie Schiller has been the coach for 36 years . Dude 's also a history professor , so Philips would also have to wrangle with academic people in the weird situation he wanted to make a change here . <p> Women 's swimming : Jimmy Tierney has been in charge for 19 years , and they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chan is in his 13th year , and although they 've made the NCAA Tournament four times under Chan , they 've only done it once in the past seven years .

How long does that make her the coach for ? A long time , I guess is my point . <p> Baseball : Paul Stevens has been the coach for 26 years , which is unreal considering the team is consistently last place in the Big Ten and has never made the NCAA Tournament , often failing to qualify for the six-team Big Ten tournament even though the conference is really weak in baseball . Like I wrote for the Daily a few years back , I 'm not really sure why or how he still has a job , but I think it would be cool to be a baseball coach with really high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college .

That 's why we 're here . <h> Longtime Successors <p> Women 's golf : Emily Fletcher was one of Jim Phillips ' first hires - she was hired about a month after he took the AD job - but she came in not because of a previous firing , but because the program 's first and then-only head coach , Chris Regenberg , stepped down after almost two decades . The team 's been competitive under her . <p> Men 's swimming : Jared Schroeder took over after Bob Groseth , then in charge for 20 years , retired . I covered the swim team as a freshman , and if I remember correctly , this was sort of a hand-picked thing by the retiring coach . <p> Wrestling : Drew Pariano has been the coach since 2010 , when Tim Cysewski - who had also been coach for 20 years - handed over the reins of the program to his assistant , a guy he had coached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team always has some competitive guys on it . <p> Men 's tennis : Arvid Swan left DePaul in 2007 when Paul Toricelli stepped down after 24 years as head coach . They 've done decently , making the NCAA Tournament twice in his six years . This technically should n't even count as a change under Phillips , but its close enough . <h> Actual honest-to-goodness coaching changes <p> Women 's basketball : Beth Combs stepped down in 2008 , leading to the hiring of Joe McKeown . It does n't count as a " firing " , but it was a coaching change caused by the team 's lack of success . Although McKeown definitely changed the women 's basketball culture at NU and made the team more successful , he still has n't made it to the NCAA Tournament here after turning George Washington into a contender . <p> Women 's soccer : Phillips did n't renew Stephanie Foster 's contract after the team went 2-16-1 in the Big Ten in 2011 . He hired Michael Moynihan , who had been successful at Milwaukee , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Phillips fired Kelly McCollum in 2008 after her first season under his tenure . McCollum was 32-63 in charge of the Wildcats , her successor , Tracy Fuchs , has completely changed the program , which is now consistently ranked and went 16-4 this past year . <h> Conclusion <p> So there you have it : In Northwestern 's 19 varsity sports , 13 have retained the same head coach under Phillips . In some , there 's been good reason to keep the same head coach , in others , its been questionable . In three other sports - four , if you include the men 's tennis coaching change in 2007 - the current coach is the first successor for somebody who had over 20 years at the helm of their program . In those other three - women 's basketball , women 's soccer , and field hockey - Northwestern made a switch at head coach , and the person who took over immediately and evidently made the program better . <p> Am I arguing Phillips should be firing coaches left and right ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done so , I 'd say about 10-12 have coaches who are doing really strong jobs on the field , and most of the other sports are n't big money-makers , and on-field success is just as important as developing individual student-athletes and maintaining strong standards as a program . I do n't think Northwestern is particularly notable in having over a dozen coaches with more than a decade under their belt . If anything , it 's a testament to NU treating their coaches well that other schools have n't been able to hire away people who have achieved success at NU . <p> But there 's a few head scratchers in there . You can find them by reading all the little blurbs I wrote . Whether it be Phillips or the administration , whether it be good or bad , there does seem to be a tendency at Northwestern to give coaches the benefit of the doubt if they 're underperforming . It 's already happened several times with Bill Carmody . Will it happen again when this season is over ? 
@@97968133 @2168133/ <h> The Wildcats do not have a season-defining moment or game . That leaves them with one opportunity . <p> For the past several seasons , Northwestern 's seasons have been pretty clearly defined by a single game or even a small set of games . The 2013 Wildcats were defined by Ohio State , a brutal loss in the program 's most important game of the millennium , and the fallout after . In 2014 , one could point to Northwestern 's shocking win over Notre Dame in South Bend " surely the highlight of the year by a long shot " but the Wildcats were defined by its season-ending loss to Illinois . A combination of bad luck and underachievement led that team to a second straight bowl-less campaign . Then there was 2015 . The Wildcats won 10 games but were blown out in three of its four biggest games , including the Outback Bowl against Tennessee , showing the limited ceiling of that team . <p> And now Northwestern is here at 6-6 .

A team that missed out on opportunities to contend in the Big Ten West ? A team that rebounded from a nightmarish start to salvage a bowl berth , defeat its biggest rivals , Iowa and Illinois ? Somewhere in between ? <p> The truth lies somewhere in the middle and that 's why Northwestern 's 2016 will be remembered by its bowl game . <p> The Wildcats are going to end up in a third tier bowl " the popular destinations from experts are the Pinstripe Bowl and the Foster Farms Bowl " and play , in all likelihood , a similarly middle-of-the-pack Power Five team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACC while Foster Farms would land Northwestern a Pac-12 foe . <p> This leaves Northwestern with one final opportunity to define itself . The general consensus surrounding this team is that it is better than its record . Had they not massively underachieved early in the year , the Wildcats would have a much different outlook , both in the win-loss column and in how we perceive the success of this team as a whole . <p> Right now , it 's tough to pass judgment on this team . It 's a team that persevered through a bad start , played good football for a spell and fell somewhat flat in the final month .

Finishing the season with a bowl win would not only give the team a record over .500 , but it would show a team that truly rebounded from a brutal start to win seven of its last 11 games . Also , Northwestern would get a bowl win , which is nothing to sneeze at given the team 's history . Of teams with at least 10 bowl game appearances , Northwestern has the worst winning percentage at 2-10 . Winning a bowl game " especially after a season that most deem a disappointment in the win-loss column " would be an important and very positive way to end the year and give the fanbase hope . <p> But if Northwestern were to lose its bowl game , it would mean a losing record following a double-digit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for and win big games . Whatever team Northwestern draws this postseason will be beatable , especially according to S&amp;P+ , and to lose would create a feeling that this team , instead of rebounding from a bad start , never reached its full potential . And even if beating a mediocre team does n't say that much about this team this year , per se , it would be important for the program and for Pat Fitzgerald 's bowl legacy , one that certainly could use some help . <p> While this team 's record probably does not accurately reflect its skill , Northwestern has to prove that , rather than pride itself on making a bowl after a rough start . A bowl game needs to be the baseline , not the end goal . Thus , winning a very winnable bowl game would somewhat salvage a difficult season and be an important second step for this program .

Gibson has a more all-around game , and experience is on his side , but Odenigbo 's raw ability and athleticism are hard to keep on the sideline . <p> No matter who is starting , Odenigbo and Gibson will each get their fair share of play time , and junior Max Chapman will likely move between tackle and end to mix up looks on the defensive line . Odenigbo is going to own third-downs again . It 's just a matter of if he can earn the starting spot through developing his overall game . <p> To do so , Odenigbo needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tackles last season were sacks , so he obviously did n't contribute much to taking down running backs . He 's bulked up a bit and will get more snaps in practice with the first team , so his run defense will improve some . His biggest contribution though will still be in the pass rush and pressuring the quarterback . <p> Expectations for Odenigbo are going to vary , but I think he can at least double his tackles total from a year ago and take down the quarterback a couple more times . Deonte Gibson had 22 tackles last season as a back-up and Dean Lowry totaled 33 . Odenigbo is bigger , more experienced and going to have an increased role in 2014 , so getting 20 tackles is definitely an attainable mark . And unless opponents determine Odenigbo requires a double team in pass protection , he should bump his sack total up to 7 or 8 . <p> For Odenigbo , it 's not all about tackling though . Rushing the passer and forcing hurries will help the secondary out . And just having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on him and frustrate offensive tackles . His athleticism and size crate mismatches and confusion that no other Northwestern player can . <p> Production on the field and statistics are always nice , but this is just Odenigbo 's sophomore season . While ' Cats fans want to see him grab 30 tackles and get to double digit sacks , the most important thing for Odenigbo this year is development . He has several years left in Evanston , and could become the best player on the entire Northwestern roster . Odenigbo wo n't be thrown into an every-down role if he 's not ready . His future as a Wildcat is too valuable .

Just one quarterback hurry in a crazy 42-41 Northwestern win against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome . <p> But fast forward to Oct. 24 , 2015 and senior Dean Lowry is donning his purple number 94 for the 43rd time in Lincoln , Nebraska . He is setting a program record with six tackles for a loss . He is making 10 tackles , notching two sacks , and leading Northwestern to a huge road win . <p> Lowry 's 43rd game as a Wildcat was a far cry from his first . In just four short years , Lowry has become one of Northwestern 's best players , and quite possibly one of the best defensive ends in the Big Ten . With a strong finish to the season , he has a legitimate shot of playing professionally after graduation . <p> Lowry is also a far cry from who he was when he stepped onto the Carrier Dome field as a true freshman . <p> That Dean Lowry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and one that college recruiters called a work in progress . ' A two-star recruit according to 247 Sports , the native of Rockford , Illinois did have offers from schools such as Iowa , Minnesota and Illinois , coming out of Boylan High School , but Lowry chose to come to Northwestern . <p> " I think it just sort of instilled a blue collar work ethic , that mentality that you want to prove people wrong , " Lowry says . " I just really think it helps your work ethic each day to go out there and prove people wrong . " <p> And prove people wrong he has , but not without a little help . <p> During the entirety of Lowry 's freshman year he played mostly as the backup to then Northwestern junior and 2012 team defensive MVP Tyler Scott . Scott was a mentor to Lowry during both the 2012 and 2013 seasons , helping him learn the defense and get adjusted to college play . He also helped instill something else in Lowry , something more important than just defensive schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ethic and attitude , you know , it 's your daily approach of how you do things and how you watch film , come to practice each day , " Lowry says . " It 's a long season , so you got to have the right mentality each day to be successful . " <p> However , even the mentor could see that there was something special about Dean Lowry . <p> " He 's a lot bigger than most freshman are , he 's 6-6 , 250 , " Scott said back in September of 2012 . " It 's pretty special stuff , and it 's pretty cool to see how much he 's picked up already . " <p> It became clear pretty early on that Lowry had been underrated as a high schooler . But Lowry 's story is more about what he 's done to become the player he is today . <p> Getting bigger and stronger is something that Lowry also cited as a reason for his constant improvement . It allowed him to add another layer to his game , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <p> Here 's the difference : when Lowry was smaller he had to be lined up on the outside because he could n't match up physically with bigger offensive lineman . He 's always been a talented enough pass rusher to beat opposing tackles with his speed , but his size seriously hurt his versatility and his rush defense . <p> This was Lowry as a freshman : <p> Lowry simply beats Michigan State 's right tackle off the snap with his speed , no strength required . <p> Now that he 's 40 pounds heavier , Northwestern can line Lowry up closer to the center , and instead of only rushing outside the tackles , he can now rush the B-gap between the tackle and the guard . This helps add more variability to his pass rushing , but most notably improves Lowry 's rush defense . <p> That aspect of Lowry 's arsenal was on display Saturday , when he regularly shot into the backfield : <p> Lowry now uses a combo of both speed and strength . He gets a great jump off the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the running back as Nebraska 's tight end hangs off of him . Getting bigger and stronger has allowed Lowry the freedom to expand his game inside the tackles and he 's taken advantage of it . <p> Getting stronger is only going to get you so far though . " I think a big key to a good defensive lineman is just effort , just the will to get there , " Lowry says . " A lot of guys are big and strong and fast , but being able to have that motor and that relentless attitude to get to the quarterback is why guys have a lot of sacks . " <p> The fourth quarter against Nebraska offered up a great example of the full Dean Lowry experience : <p> Lowry 's increased strength has allowed Northwestern to move him around the defensive formation . Here , he 's lined up as a defensive tackle . He gets double teamed , but is strong enough to push the guard who initially engages him back into the pocket . When his progress is stopped though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He keeps pushing , eventually breaking free and taking down Tommy Armstrong Jr . as offensive linemen , worn down , just stand and watch . <p> Lowry 's strength helps him and his will guides him , but his awareness is what makes him a great player . Many players with his size just put their head down and rush for the quarterback . Lowry always makes sure he knows what 's going on around him . That 's how he 's tallied 18 pass breakups and three interceptions as a defensive end . <p> " It helps being a little taller than most guys so I can see over the tackles , so you can have that vision to know when to jump and get your hands up , " Lowry says . " But also just film study , having the awareness to do that and having that repetition in practice and the second nature , the intuition to get your hands up there . " <p> That intuition allowed Lowry to make one of the biggest plays of the season against Duke : <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tip and catch , but it 's the read that 's the most impressive part . As soon as he sees the right tackle disengage , he pulls up and waits for the throw . It truly is a brilliant piece of defense , and who better to break it down than Lowry himself . <p> " Duke , all game , was throwing more quick passes and three step drops , so our emphasis in that game was getting our hands up , " says Lowry . " They were getting the ball out pretty quick , so we knew that we could affect the game by getting our hands up and tipping passes . " <p> This , of course , was n't Lowry 's first interception . He had a pick-six in 2013 . But when comparing the two , Lowry favors the pick against Duke , just not for the reason you 'd think . <p> " I was really really tired that time , so I got the pick and we were off the field , " says Lowry with a laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Dean Lowry finishes a stellar Northwestern career over the next month , it may be time to start thinking about the question that might literally be worth a million dollars : What about the NFL Draft ? <p> " I really have n't thought about it , no , " says Lowry . " I think that if I play well this year , things will take care of themselves , so my focus is just one game each time , just getting this team to a bowl game and winning a bowl game . " <p> It seems that Lowry has learned more than just football from Fitzgerald . But coach-speak aside , this is just who Dean Lowry is . He ' s had to work every day to get to where he is now , and that mentality is n't ebbing away anytime soon . With the way he 's been playing and has played the last four years , Dean Lowry should be expecting a phone call from someone very important next May .

Vic Law Jr. , one game after breaking out of a massive shooting slump , was just 2-of-13 from the field . Northwestern 's two athletic wings went a combined 5-of-24 , a stat that not even Lumpkin and Dererk Pardon 's combined 24 points on 10-of-11 shooting could negate . <p> " We need to continue to look for those guys and get them good shots , " Collins said .

" <p> So looking forward , Northwestern can be proud of its accomplishments : A program record for total wins , a best-ever conference record and a first-ever tournament bid all but locked up are nothing to scoff at .

" <p> Northwestern 's opponent is still to be determined " the Wildcats will face either Ohio State or Rutgers in the second round of the conference tournament " but for Collins , that 's actually an advantage for his team : " Sometimes it 's good when you do n't really know who you 're gon na play because you can really work on you .

He 's an integral cog in Purdue 's high octane and efficient offense as a threat in the post , from the outside and even as a distributor .

The Wildcats showed very little capacity to enact either strategy in the team 's previous matchup . They have no logical defensive answer for Swanigan 's multi-faceted offensive game and if Purdue gets out to a hot start , as it did back in February , Northwestern will have a difficult time playing from behind against a longer , smarter , more athletic and hotter team .

They seem to have a certain level of magic in them recently . However , Purdue feels like a significantly better team and capable of coming into Evanston and taking this one by double digits .

@@97968160 @2168160/ <h> Fitz 's excuses for his staff make no sense . <p> Pat Fitzgerald likes to say that the goal for Northwestern 's program should be to compete for championships , at least on the Big Ten West level . That 's a lofty goal for a program like this one , especially considering that the Wildcats have never seriously competed for a conference or division championship in Fitzgerald 's 10 years as head coach . But it can be done in the modern era ( see : 1995 , 1996 and 2000 ) , and it 's the publicly stated goal of the program . <p> That 's why , when asked about potential staff changes after NU 's win over Duke to move to 1-2 on the season , Fitzgerald 's answer was puzzling . <p> Fitz , on criticism of his staff : " I think they shut that off pretty well " after win against Duke <p> This comes after the much-maligned offensive staff " one almost every fan thinks needs some sort of change " commanded an offense that averaged 4.77 yards per play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 112th in the country , which is exactly where the Wildcats ranked . The offense against Duke was , in fact , pretty miserable , hitting on a few big plays and doing next to nothing the rest of the time . <p> Fast-forward a week , after a 24-13 loss to Nebraska , and suddenly Fitzgerald was angry . The offense was actually better , averaging 5.54 yards per play " that average would be good for a whopping 84th nationally ( ! ! ! ) " but Fitzgerald laid it on the team . Well , the players . Not the coaches . <p> He blamed the starters for " not performing " : <p> " I think we had an opportunity to win all three losses and we did n't ... When you go out with the 1s starters , you 're expected to perform , and if you do n't , you do n't deserve to be out there . " <p> And the offense in general : <p> " I 'll have to look at the entire tape before we pass judgement . The narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad holding penalties on ... The young men in that locker room have got to figure out the discipline that it takes to become a winner . " <p> Four games into a nightmare season , followed by two previous seasons of offensive nightmares , Fitzgerald is not going to blame his coaches for clear coaching issues . He 's going to praise the coaches when the offense plays poorly in wins " as it did 10 times last year " and simply ignore how they do in losses . So with that in mind , how on earth can fans expect NU to compete for championships , or even get better ? <p> They ca n't . <p> To be clear , the players were not good in the loss to Nebraska , nor in any other game this season . The offensive line was abysmal yet again , the baseball player-turned-kicker looked like a baseball player-turned-kicker , Clayton Thorson had one consistent target ( Austin Carr ) and was terribly inaccurate on a number of throws and the backup defensive backs gave up easy yards on every pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivers . The question is , how did Fitzgerald expect anything different ? <p> The team that showed up against Nebraska was the exact same team we saw in the first three games , and the offense that has shown up this season was the same offense that everybody except the coaches saw coming after last year 's abysmal show . The players might not be good , but at some point , you ca n't really fault them for being who they are , particularly if almost all of them have failed to live up to the potential they showed as recruits . <p> That 's not a discipline problem . That 's a coaching problem . <p> There are clear examples of every offensive coach underperforming . How in the hell is every offensive lineman in this program " players who had offers from the likes of Nebraska , Missouri , Michigan , etc. " so weak that they 're unable to hold their own against Illinois State ? That 's not " leadership " or " execution " " that 's the inability of the strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBS level .

How can quarterback coach and offensive coordinator Mick McCall squander TWO four-star prospects , not produce an offense that ranks better than 110th nationally ( out of 128 ) and still have full support of his head coach ? <p> How can Fitzgerald justify abandoning the spread for a pro-style offense when recruiting against three pro-style teams in his division that have had significantly more success with that style ? How can he justify failing to use the entirety of the field , using space as a neutralizer just as past NU teams have , when he has at least a little less overall talent than his division foes ? <p> This is n't an issue of cherry-picked stats , a small sample size or a few bad eggs . This is a staff that has consistently failed to develop players across every position on offense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been given proper training ? <p> Northwestern can not get meaningfully better in its current state . Maybe the offense can get up to the 80s in the national ratings ( whoopee ! ) , but this staff has shown that it 's not going to get better than that , especially with the abandonment of a true spread offense " the only offense McCall has ever had success with . <p> If Northwestern wants to average six wins per year and occasionally luck into 10 wins , with losses to the only good teams it plays ( save Stanford laying an egg In Week 1 ) , then the current staff will work just fine . But if the Wildcats actually want to compete in the awful Big Ten West , or even have a team that could challenge the Big Ten East winner once in a blue moon , then they simply need to make changes to their staff .

@@97968161 @2168161/ <p> Well , first off , that 's not really a question , and second of all , yeah , you sort of stopped being relevant once nobody wanted to read Northwestern basketball previews . <p> Okay . My point is it 's nice to talk to you . When 's the spring game ? <p> April 13 . Mark your calendar . <p> Why 's it so damn early ? It 's snowing outside ? <p> Pat Fitzgerald gave a few reasons . For starters , he feels the quarter system gives him an opportunity to extend practice over a longer period of time than they normally do , which helps them not screw up the team 's predetermined lifting and do more quality control . And secondly , it helps guys who potentially get injured get back quicker . Not a bad line of reasoning . They 're not the earliest - Army has been going for two full weeks - or the earliest BCS school - Texas got in action the 21st , Cal the 25th - but they are the first in the Big Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't playing ? <p> Obviously , all next year 's true freshmen , since NU does n't take early enrollees . <p> Secondly , some injured guys . Let 's mark ' em off in tiers of importance : <p> 1 . Likely starters : Jack Konopka - started all last year at right tackle , could possibly start at left tackle with Patrick Ward gone . <p> Nick VanHoose - NU 's best corner last year , easily . At least it 's good to know he 's getting his nagging issue dealt with now rather than later . <p> Damien Proby - a senior , we 've seen this dude play well at linebacker for some time . With him and Chi ChiAriguzo back , that should be a strong unit . <p> 2 . Possible starters : Kyle Prater - yeah , this debate again . He was the star of last year 's spring ball , at least from a " how many stories were written about him " perspective , so maybe this is good . <p> Paul Jorgensen - NU used him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Illinois , but he could fight for whichever tackle spot Konopka does n't play . Huge guy . <p> Deonte Gibson - was a nice defensive end recruit when NU got him , played a little as a redshirt frosh last year . <p> Quite frankly ? Not much . Having covered Northwestern spring football four years out of my four years in college , it 's rare that the things you see in spring are huge indicators of what you see in fall . Sometimes you can find a guy you did n't expect to do much who you can tell will be a big factor - off the top of my head , it became clear very early last year that Nick VanHoose would be the starter at corner - more often you ca n't . <p> Why not ? <p> I speak from experience : I once made the mistake of writing stories in back to back years about how Jeravin Matthes and Alex Daniel would sufficiently fill in for Tyrell Sutton at running back and how Evan Watkins could push Dan Persa for a starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was n't crazy wrong . It 's what people were talking about on the sidelines and in the press box at the spring game . So here 's why not to judge on spring ball : <p> First of all , its crazy early . This team practices through the spring , then in the fall , and as you saw last year , changes gameplans and personnel week-to-week throughout the year . There 's a lot a lot a lot of time for things to change , and you generally do n't find out the identity of a team until the season is more than halfway done - even if you did watch every open practice from start to finish . <p> Secondly , since there are no early enrollees . That means that a ) the personnel are the same as last year , and you 'd be much wiser to base your opinions on what you actually saw in the 12 three-hour games than a few semi-competitive snippets of practice you see . And b ) there 's nobody new , and if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know it until fall ball . <p> And thirdly , a whole heck of a lot of guys are injured , a lot of whom will be big factors . It 's really good that all those guys are getting healthy instead of playing , especially guys like VanHoose and Prater . <p> If you must look for storylines , I suggest Inside NU 's breakdown . Have I mentioned I read that site every day ? I read that site every day . <p> Northwestern continued to tinker with its gameplan for Colter and Siemian from week-to-week through the year last year , with Colter going from full-time-QB to wide receiver to sometimes QB to QB who never throws to eventually a guy who threw sometimes but ran more often and sometimes subbed out for Siemian . I think we 'll probably the same thing happen week-to-week next year . Regardless , both guys will be contributors , and its very unlikely something happens in March that changes that . <p> Would you say your continued insistence on writing posts where a make-believe character asks you questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from home , and the subsequent lack of human interaction that goes along with it ? <p> Dude , shut up . <p> So why should we be excited about this ? Why should we go to Northwestern 's spring game ? <p> Because this is a 10-win team returning 15 starters , including a bunch at important positions . There 's 125 teams kicking off spring ball in the next few weeks . Less than 20 can say they 're better than Northwestern . Seriously . Look at the rankings . This will be a very good football team in the fall , and we 're going to see some nice things written about them between now in August , and then we 'll see them ranked in the preseason . If people from around the country think Northwestern is going to be good next year , maybe get up on them .

" Fitzgerald wondered . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus , then great . Then let the Group of Five leave . " <p> While Northwestern would probably not have started a satellite camp in the South , this does show that SEC , Big 12 and ACC teams are worried about other conferences taking recruits from their home turfs . Northwestern has already made serious recruiting inroads into Texas and this decision blocks any chance that Northwestern could start a satellite camp elsewhere in the future . Fitzgerald was dismayed that the NCAA made such a sweeping , hasty decision without trying to develop a compromise . <p> Recruits who already received less exposure due to financial or personal constraints will now have a more difficult time getting recognition on a national level . <p> " Part of what our job is as college coaches is providing an opportunity , even to those who do n't have the financial means , " Fitzgerald said .

While Northwestern has not elected to run a satellite camp , it is one of the schools that could reap the benefits of an out-of-region camp . The decision may not mean much to a big name school like Michigan , but for Northwestern and other FBS programs , this does cut off a potential avenue for expansion . <p> As Northwestern has realized , going to football-rich southern states and adding talented players is a very useful strategy . The decision to ban satellite camps may not mean very much practically , but symbolically it shows that schools like Alabama , Florida and LSU are worried about the encroachment of the Big Ten into their turf , no matter what Nick Saban says about the camps being a " pretty ridiculous circumstance " . But the main problem with the decision , as Fitzgerald opined , is that it seriously hurts opportunities for student-athletes in the future .

@@97968176 @2168176/ <h> The Wildcats desperately need at least one more win . Will it come in Bloomington ? <p> After a lackluster performance in its second loss to Illinois this season , Northwestern ( 20-8 , 9-6 Big Ten ) needs a win on Saturday against Indiana ( 15-13 , 5-10 Big Ten ) more than ever . <p> Nearly a month ago , Northwestern took advantage of a James Blackmon Jr. -less Indiana offense , holding the Hoosiers to a season-low 55 points . Blackmon Jr . is back , but Indiana 's NCAA Tournament hopes are long gone . On senior night for the Hoosiers , Northwestern is the team looking to bolster its resume for the postseason . <p> With Northwestern searching for a couple elusive wins to close out the regular season , here 's everything you need to know about the Indiana Hoosiers . <h> Players to Watch <p> The former five-star recruit and McDonald 's All American has seen his numbers rise every year at Indiana . After his sophomore season was cut short by surgery on a torn meniscus , Blackmon Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoosiers ' offensive leader , taking nearly 13 shots per game , including 7.5 from beyond the arc . Blackmon Jr . is not much of a distributor , however , and is averaging more turnovers per game ( 2.0 ) than assists ( 1.8 ) . Tom Crean 's offense will be much different than the one we saw in Evanston in late January ; Blackmon Jr . has put up double digits in all but two Big Ten games this season . It would n't be a surprise to see Vic Law tasked to defend Blackmon Jr . <p> Johnson has seen a significant uptick in production from his previous two seasons . The junior is a high-volume scorer with the ability to go off for 27 points like he did earlier this month against Penn State , or go scoreless , which he did against Minnesota two weeks ago . Johnson scored 12 points last time these teams met , all from beyond the arc . He went 0-7 elsewhere . Johnson is almost a lock to hit a three ; he 's made at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to limit his looks from the perimeter . Johnson really struggled defending Bryant McIntosh , so it will be interesting to see how Crean adjusts . <p> Bryant put on a show at Welsh-Ryan earlier this season . The sophomore poured in 23 points , grabbed 12 rebounds , and added two blocks for good measure . For a 6-foot-10 sophomore , Bryant is incredibly polished on both ends of the floor . He 's fast and has the ability to stretch the floor - he 's shooting over 40-percent from three . Bryant is a really tough matchup for Northwestern 's frontcourt , and just like last game , we could see a mix of Dererk Pardon , Sanjay Lumpkin , and even Barret Benson on Bryant . Indiana has wilted in Big Ten play , but not at the fault of Bryant whatsoever . <p> Tom Crean loves riding his junior point guard - Newkirk has played at least 29 minutes in six of his last seven games . He 's Indiana 's best distributor and assists leader , which he showed in a seven assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does turn the ball over 2.3 times per game . Tom Crean opted to put the 6-foot-1 Newkirk on Scottie Lindsey , and Lindsey put up 12 points despite going 0-for-4 from three . Newkirk is an aggressive defender , but if he matches up against Lindsey again , Northwestern should be able to take advantage ( assuming Lindsey can start to return to form ) . <p> Aside from Bryant , Morgan is probably Indiana 's best presence down low . He holds an impressive offensive rebounding percentage of 11% , but he 's not much of a scoring threat . The 6-foot-8 sophomore struggles to stretch the floor offensively and usually only settles for high percentage looks . <h> Game Analysis <p> Having watched Indiana in Big Ten play , it 's hard to imagine this is the same team that beat two AP Top 10 teams and won the Big Ten title last season . That said , they really are n't . The Hoosiers have been without senior Collin Hartman all season , and they have n't been the same since losing electric sophomore OG Anunoby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently mired in a five-game losing skid . That said , Northwestern has not recently looked like the team that beat Indiana in January . On top of that , the Hoosiers will have their leading scorer back . For all he does as the undeniable leader of the team , Blackmon Jr . ' s return has not helped Indiana get in the win column , but the Hoosiers have been competitive . Indiana has lost the four games since Blackmon Jr . ' s return by an average of 7 points , 3 of which came against probable NCAA Tournament teams and the most recent of which was a tough OT loss at Iowa . Northwestern was able to win the first matchup behind the stellar play of Bryant McIntosh and Sanjay Lumpkin . Vic Law was inefficient to the tune of 2-of-12 from the field , Lindsey was 0-for-4 from three , and Dererk Pardon did n't score . Northwestern badly needs a win on Saturday , and even though Indiana is healthier than they were in the first meeting , I think Northwestern can and will find a way to get it done .

Adding an outside linebacker to complement Mann would be wise , and the two targets there are Cameron McGrone and Jacob Mangum-Farrar . On the inside , Khalid Jones II is the only player with an offer . None of those three are projected to choose Northwestern , though , which creates some cause for concern . There is some young depth here after Fitzgerald landed three linebackers in the 2017 class , so getting another linebacker is n't paramount , but it would be smart .

Moten looked the part in limited action this season , but it 's no sure thing that he 'll be as durable as Jackson has been the last three seasons . By the time a running back in the 2018 class sees the field , Northwestern will be looking for Clayton Thorson 's replacement , so the running game will be of the utmost importance . Jesse Brown and Kyric McGowan provide depth , but Fitzgerald will want to pick up at least one running back in this class .

After a lifeless loss at home against Ohio State on February 4 , the Wolverines have looked like a completely different team over the past few weeks . <p> Michigan also has Moe " as in Moritz Wagner " an endlessly talented 6-foot-11 , 240-pound sophomore forward out of Germany who has averaged over 16 points per game during the Wolverines ' impressive run . He has scored over 20 points twice and has failed to reach double digits just once . In his last outing , Wagner scored 24 points against the Boilermakers , 20 of which came in a first half in which his team outscored the Big Ten leaders 45-30 . <p> What makes Wagner so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pick-and-pop , and with the range to shoot from behind the arc " he 's shooting over 42 percent from deep this year " he 's nearly impossible to defend in those situations because Michigan has so many talented guards who can score or find the open man if the opposing defense respects Wagner too much . But Wagner is no one-trick pony ; he 's willing to put the ball on the floor no matter where he catches it to attack to basket . <p> The aforementioned Purdue game showed all of those strengths . Here 's what Wagner brings to the floor . <p> ( NOTE : All video courtesy of BTN2Go ) <h> The pick-and-pop <p> When executed correctly and with the right personnel , the pick-and-pop is the hardest two-man game to defend . If the guard can shoot well enough , he can score off the immediate ball screen . If the guard is quick enough , he can get to the hole against a bigger , slower defender . And if the opponents have to respect that , they have no chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . <p> In the example below , you see the quandary the Boilermaker defense is in . Xavier Simpson , a quick point guard and former Northwestern target , does a fantastic job keeping his dribble alive as Caleb Swanigan extends his switch far away from Wagner . A couple of possessions earlier , Simpson had beaten Swanigan to the hole off a hesitation move , so Purdue 's star big man was wary of the Wolverine backup point guard 's speed . As Ryan Cline ( No. 14 ) desperately tries to get back to Simpson , there 's no one near Wagner , who sinks an open triple after Simpson 's dribble draws two defenders with him . It 's simple basketball , and with the obvious respect Swanigan has to give Simpson , it 's an easy bucket for the big German , who already has his feet set and is ready to fire by the time the ball hits his hands . <p> A similar situation unfolds again just a minute later . Derrick Walton Jr. , the team 's leading scorer and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ball in his hands . If you leave him , he 'll get to the basket or stick a jumper . If you leave Wagner , he 'll do this : <p> Wagner has hit at least two triples in four of his last five games , and he had four against the Boilermakers . <h> Off the bounce <p> After scoring the opening basket of the game on a beautiful play design , Wagner shows his ability to score off the bounce . He has the ball-handling skill and the craftiness to get by opponents by putting it on the hardwood . There are n't a lot of 6-foot-11 human beings who can do this . <p> A few possessions later , Wagner shows how he can simply torture opponents with a fantastic array of jab steps and hesitation moves before once again scoring on Swanigan . He makes the Big Ten Player of the Year favorite look foolish and puts him a half-step behind before finishing over him as if he were n't even there . It 's not necessarily bad defense . It 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much a face-up big man , his abilities in the post are considerable , especially given the fact that when he catches it on the block and faces the basket , defenders must be wary that he 'll simply shoot over them . But he can also go into his bag of tricks , as he does here . Wagner faces up and rips the ball through , puts a couple of powerful dribbles on the floor , gets into Swanigan 's chest , spins , uses a step through and then finishes with his left hand . And no , it 's not even close to a travel " you 'll notice no one on the Purdue bench even motions for one " because Wagner does such a great job of keeping his pivot foot and using it as an extension of his body to create space . <p> So if you 're sitting there with your jaw agape , wondering how Northwestern will limit the versatile big man , you 're not alone . Wagner is incredibly skilled and fits in well with the recent emergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walton recently said that Wagner thinks he 's Kevin Durant . The German 's size , relative quickness , shooting and ball-handling bring fellow Europeans like Dirk Nowitzki and Kristaps Porzingis to mind when looking for upside comparisons . <p> The bigger issue for Northwestern , though , is n't how good he is , but how Chris Collins and the Wildcats will limit him on offense , because he 'll be a tough matchup for anyone . Dererk Pardon is a good individual defender and rim protector , but he 's suited to defend traditional big men , and Wagner is anything but . Pardon may be better suited for D.J . Wilson , a 6-foot-10 big who can also shoot the three but does it less often " 78 attempts compared with 90 " and at not quite the same success rate : 38.5 to 42.2 percent . Sanjay Lumpkin is an outstanding defender at the four position , but Wagner has a half-foot on Northwestern 's fifth-year senior . We 've seen Lumpkin defend bigger players before , though , so it 's certainly not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanky Vic Law getting some time on him because of Wagner 's guard-like skill set . But that takes away the team 's best individual perimeter defender from matching up against Walton or another of Michigan 's talented guards . Whatever the Wildcats go with , it will be a very difficult task . <p> But there 's also reason for hope . Wagner scores 15.9 points per game at home in conference play and just 10.3 on the road in conference play . Additionally , the Wildcats almost certainly have an advantage against Wagner 's defense . The Wolverines ' big man yanks down just 4.1 rebounds per game , and his defensive rebounding percentage of 15.1 is very poor . Pardon , on the other hand , has an offensive rebounding percentage of 12.6 , good for 76th in all of Division I , so expect to see him active on the boards early and often . Wagner is also prone to fouling . He has fouled out three times in his past seven games , including two occasions in which he fouled out in under 30 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's certainly not the strongest guy , and his overzealousness can cost him . It might be wise to feed Pardon early and often . It will never be possible to stop a guy like Wagner on the offensive end completely , but limiting his role by getting him in foul trouble and reducing his minutes could be a good place to start if Northwestern plans to pull off the win .

Or just not very good ? <p> A familiar feeling was setting in as Ohio State 's Kelsey Mitchell stepped up to the line with less than a minute to go . Despite a combined 41 points from Nia Coffey and Christen Inman , Northwestern women 's basketball was staring at a fourth consecutive loss in the Big Ten and yet another major setback to its NCAA Tournament hopes . <p> Mitchell calmly hit both free throws to put Ohio State up 6 . For the fourth time in Big Ten play , Northwestern had blown a fourth quarter lead . In short , Northwestern 's fall from being a secure tournament-bound team at the end of December to an NIT team has been absolutely stunning . What on earth has happened ? <p> After Northwestern 's loss to Indiana last Sunday , a reporter asked head coach Joe McKeown about his thoughts on the losing streak . McKeown paused . An awkward silence radiated from the podium and filled the room . The silence went on for a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players was palpable . Northwestern had lost back-to-back close games in which , from a talent standpoint , it was the better team on the floor . <p> Northwestern has four of the best offensive players in the Big Ten with Nia Coffey , Ashley Deary , Maggie Lyon and Christen Inman . All four rank in the top 25 in the conference in scoring . You can not doubt the talent in Northwestern 's starting lineup . The upset against Ohio State showed that Northwestern can play with the very best teams in the country when everything is going well . <p> The defense down the stretch has been as effective as a plastic bag floating in the wind . <p> But things just are n't going well . The team has been hugely disappointing . After these two losses , Northwestern now needs a semi-miraculous run to make the NCAA Tournament . The loss against Ohio State was a huge missed opportunity to get Northwestern back into relevancy . Having started conference play with a 2-7 record , Northwestern essentially can not lose a game for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bad luck . If Maggie Lyon had not fouled out against Penn State , Northwestern could have closed that game out . If Minnesota 's Rachel Banham had not turned into Steph Curry , the Wildcats probably would have won that game as well . If Ashley Deary had n't turned the ball over at the end of the Ohio State game , perhaps Northwestern could have pulled off another upset . <p> But Northwestern 's late-game execution has been lacking in its close defeats , and the team has looked overmatched when playing elite teams like Michigan State and Maryland . Northwestern is also last in the Big Ten in free throw percentage , shooting at a 67 percent clip . Lastly , while the team has been somewhat unlucky in close games , the defense down the stretch has been as effective as a plastic bag floating in the wind . <p> " If we aspire to make a run in the second half of the Big Ten , we 've got to defend , " McKeown said . No kidding . <p> That Ashley Deary pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game , but it was immediately erased by a terrible defensive play . Not only does Maggie Lyon get stuck in no man 's land and lose track of the Indiana player , she does it on one of the most important possessions of the entire game . That has been happening all too often for Northwestern this season . <p> Perhaps Northwestern 's reliance on four players to carry the team has been its downfall . Northwestern 's four starters may be tiring down the stretch . They have routinely been poor in the fourth quarter . Against Indiana , Northwestern gave up 33 points in the fourth alone . Ohio State scored 26 on Northwestern despite trailing for much of the game . <p> Northwestern 's defense has been bad throughout games , but during the fourth quarter the problem becomes pronounced . Northwestern 's lack of depth has contributed to this problem , even as Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah starts to earn more minutes as the fifth starter . Maya Jonas , Jordan Hankins and Lydia Rohde are just not capable of playing significant minutes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team . <p> But all these points have been repeatedly made throughout the season . Unless something changes dramatically , there does not seem to be a solution in sight . Northwestern 's current lineup is not a good defensive unit without Lauren Douglas and Alex Cohen . Thus , Northwestern must score enough points to survive its defensive lapses and poor rebounding numbers . <p> The issue is that Northwestern has also gone completely cold from the field . The Wildcats are 11th in the Big Ten in field goal percentage and 12th in three-point percentage . They 're shooting 29 percent from three in Big Ten play , and are also last in the conference in free throw percentage . While Northwestern 's offensive output has been good from a total points perspective , that is aided by Northwestern 's up-tempo pace . Although overall per-possession stats for women 's basketball are n't recorded , Northwestern 's offense would probably look poorer than expected . <p> Unfortunately , McKeown 's best option is to just run the starters out there for the entire game . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a sense that McKeown and Northwestern will be able to turn the season around . In last week 's USA Today Coaches ' poll , the Wildcats received 19 votes while the two teams that just defeated them both received none . McKeown is a legend in college basketball circles , and the reputation that he has quickly built at Northwestern has kept NU in the conversation despite the product on the court . <p> But McKeown and the coaching staff deserve some blame for how the team has underperformed this season . While the defensive problems seem unsolvable , it should not be this bad . The defense has been shaky since the Purdue game , yet nothing has really changed on the court . Northwestern still ca n't execute its zone effectively , and has barely adjusted . <p> Unfortunately , McKeown 's best option is to just run the starters out there for the entire game . Northwestern can not hope to outscore opponents with its bench . The reserves and underclassmen , other than Kunaiyi-Akpanah , have n't developed . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the standards from last season .

Next year , with two highly-rated centers entering the program along with Coffey , Deary and Inman returning , Northwestern could return to its 2014-15 success . But right now , this team has too many structural problems to make the NCAA Tournament or finish in the top six of the Big Ten . Northwestern has been slightly unlucky , but the overall quality of the team has more to do with its recent slide . 
@@97968193 @2168193/ <h> Why Northwestern will/wo n't beat Minnesota <h> The Wildcats can become bowl eligible with a victory <p> Every week during football season , we 'll be presenting reasons why Northwestern will or wo n't come away from its Saturday game victorious . It 's not so much an argument for or against either result as it is envisioning the scenarios in which the Wildcats come away from the game with a win or a loss . <p> The Wildcats ( 5-5 ) are on the road again this week , traveling to Minneapolis to square off with Minnesota ( 7-3 ) . The Wildcats have the opportunity to clinch a bowl game for the second-straight season and keep the team 's chances for finishing the regular season with a winning record alive . The Golden Gophers have beaten some of the lower teams in the conference , but lost to Iowa , Penn State and Nebraska so far this season . On paper , the teams appear relatively even , making this week that much more important . Here are the reasons Northwestern will or wo n't win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Northwestern 's offensive maintains the balance it had last week <p> After Northwestern lost to Wisconsin , it was clear that Justin Jackson had to be more involved in the offense . And that 's exactly what happened against Purdue . Jackson carried the ball 22 times for 127 yards and two scores , and John Moten IV entered the fold with 16 carries for 119 yards . The balance on offense allowed Clayton Thorson to operate with more manageable third-downs , which then allowed the sophomore quarterback to throw for a career-high 352 yards . Being able to stay out of obvious passing downs and keep the defense guessing is paramount for the success of the Northwestern offense . Mick McCall will keep the play-calling balanced this week , and the offense will control the game as a result . <h> 2 . Northwestern will continue to force turnovers <p> The Wildcats failed to force a turnover against Ohio State or Wisconsin , but exploded take the ball away four times a week ago . The trend will continue this week against Gopher quarterback Mitch Leidner . Leidner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four starts , but he has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns this season ( seven interceptions to five TDs ) . Montre Hartage looked like a shutdown cornerback against Purdue and could be another key this week . The Gophers like to run the ball a lot though , so the turnovers may have to come from fumbles rather than interceptions . If the Wildcats can force Minnesota to throw the ball , they 'll be in good shape : The Wildcat defense is 10th in the country in S&amp;P+ on passing downs , but just 55th overall . <h> 3 . The Wildcats will get off to fast start <p> Northwestern has had trouble getting off to good starts so far this season ; the Wildcats trailed by double-digits to the Michigan State , Ohio State Wisconsin and Purdue before scoring any points . Against a stout Minnesota defense ( 22nd in rushing S&amp;P+ and 35th overall ) , Northwestern ca n't get behind again early . Making a concerted effort the get the ball into the hands of his playmakers , Clayton Thorson will lead multiple early scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up . <h> Why Minnesota will beat Northwestern <h> 1 . Minnesota will control the lines of scrimmage <p> The Minnesota offense ranks 118th in rushing S&amp;P+ , but sophomore running back Rodney Smith has rushed for over 1,000 yards on over five yards per attempt this season . And as mentioned above , the Minnesota defense does n't give up a whole lot on the ground . Defensively , Northwestern has been prone to missing tackles , which could allow Smith to have a field day . Minnesota will want to run the ball and control clock , so if the defense is n't prepared to tackle Smith , it will be a long day for Mike Hankwitz 's defense . On the other side of the ball , Northwestern 's offensive line has struggled in many games this season , sometimes forcing McCall to completely abandon the running game . Minnesota has a strong defensive line , so the flaws the line has been prone to will return this week , making it difficult for the offense to get into any sort of rhythm . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was probably the best performance out of the Northwestern secondary all season , but that by no means signals that the group is fixed . For one thing , Purdue was one-dimensional from basically the beginning of the game , so the defensive backs knew what to expect . This week , Minnesota will be much more deceptive with its looks and play calling . Leidner struggles with his accuracy at times , but he has a big arm , which will prove troublesome for Trae Williams , Marcus McShepard and Hartage on the back end . The Purdue game likely did n't solve the problems the secondary had earlier in the season , and this week " against what is not considered an explosive offense " could be a trap game of sorts for the group . <h> 3 . The Gophers will shut down Austin Carr <p> This ca n't really happen , can it ? It 's not likely Minnesota can completely neutralize Carr , but if it can , then Northwestern is in major trouble . Other receivers have had some success , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to have an off day at some point , but it just has n't happened . On third downs , in the red zone and on key plays , Carr is usually the guy ; Clayton Thorson is looking for him when the offense needs a completion . In the cold , the Gophers will blanket Carr and force other receivers to be them , and the Northwestern offense will struggle as a result .

The senior played a big role last time these teams met , logging 36 minutes and notching 11 points . For his size , Morgan is a rather ineffective rebounder and carries a tough 12.4 defensive rebounding percentage , but his offensive game is versatile and he can hit the mid-range jumper . He 's Illinois ' best offensive presence down low . <p> Coleman-Lands is a streaky scorer . He 's finished in double digits ten times this season , but he also disappears at times .

The sophomore is a high volume shooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consecutive games . <p> Finke was n't its leading scorer , but he 's probably the biggest reason why Illinois was able to beat Northwestern . When the Wildcats seemed to get any momentum going , Finke would bury a three . He had 11 points in the game , all in the second half , and added three steals . Finke is n't much of a rebounder " he and Morgan trail forward Leron Black ( 6 rpg ) in that department " but the sophomore has the ability to impact the game with his outside shot . <p> After paying sporadically at the beginning of the season , Lucas has firmly established himself in the rotation , most recently as a starter . The freshman had one of his best games of the year against Northwestern , scoring 11 points with 6 assists and 5 rebounds .

Offensively , the Illini lack the depth to score with most teams in the Big Ten , and defensively , they do n't force turnovers or block shots . Lindsey is back and has one game under his belt , so look for Northwestern 's offense to improve greatly upon the 0.88 points per possession it scored in the previous matchup . McIntosh wo n't feel the need to press as much , he simply is n't going to turn the ball over six times again .

Then , Joel Stave found tight end Troy Fumagalli down the middle for an apparent game-tying 23-yard touchdown . <p> Once again , the officials went to the video , conferred and ruled , correctly , that Fumagalli 's knee was down before the ball reached the goal line . There was no real controversy here . It was the correct decision to overturn the call on the field . <p> The Badgers , after the Fumagalli catch , had the ball on the Northwestern goal line on first down with no timeouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the very next play , this happened : <p> Stave appeared to find receiver Jazz Peavy in the end zone for the game-evening touchdown and , with a successful PAT , the Badgers would have had a 14-13 advantage with under 30 seconds to play . On first look , it appears as if Peavy has undeniable possession of the ball as he gets his feet in bounds and then falls out of bounds . <p> But , even though Peavy makes a few steps in the end zone , he does bobble the ball through his fall as he hits the ground . <p> This is where things get complicated . Here 's what the rudimentary section of the official NCAA rule book has to say : <p> The key parts here are b. and c. , but they leave plenty of room for interpretation and ambiguity . For example , how does one define whether or not a player " goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass " ? That 's the question that pertains to Peavy 's catch , because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of being pushed by VanHoose . If he had n't been , he likely would 've stayed upright . <p> So at what point does he go from " in the act of catching a pass " to a second phase where he is forced to the ground by a defensive player after already completing the catch ? For example , if Peavy had taken six steps and then been leveled by , say , Godwin Igwebuike , and lost control of the ball , the catch would surely still stand . <p> Towards the end of the NCAA rule book though , under " Official NCAA Football Rules Interpretations , " the rules get more specific : <p> Technically , Peavy goes airborne for the catch , so this interpretation applies . The question then becomes what constitutes " completing all the requirements of a catch , " and whether or not VanHoose first touches Peavy before he does that . <p> For the answer , we turn back to the initial requirements of a catch , regardless of whether or not a player is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those things before he is initially contacted by VanHoose , it 's a touchdown . But if he has n't , it 's not . He certainly has fulfilled the first requirement . It appears on replay that he satisfies the second requirement by keeping his left foot in contact with the turf as the ball hits his hands . <p> The ruling essentially comes down to which of the following two things comes first : VanHoose 's contact with Peavy ( his right arm appears to make the initial contact ) or Peavy maintaining control of the ball " long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game . " The problem is that there is no specific definition of an " act common to the game . " <p> If it is deemed that VanHoose contacts Peavy before he has time to " perform an act common to the game , " then Peavy must maintain control going to the ground . He does n't , so if that is the case , the score should 've been overturned , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long enough to enable him to perform an act common to the game " before VanHoose touches him , then it should be a touchdown , as it was originally called . <p> One could argue that on such a close call , the call on the field should have stood . But at the very least , this decision is n't flat out wrong by any means . <p> After the ruling was overturned , Deonte Gibson sacked Stave before leaving the game ( presumably due to injury ) for backup Bart Houston , who threw an incompletion in the end zone on fourth down following a Wisconsin spike to stop the clock . Northwestern took over and kneeled the ball to seal the victory .

After class , he heads to The Dungeon to watch film before practice . He stays after practice is over to work on anything he feels he can improve , before trying to take his mind off wrestling before bed . But Coach Drew Pariano doubts that wrestling ever fully leaves Tsirtsis ' thoughts . <p> " He 's a student of the game , " Pariano said .

But he came to Evanston as what is known in wrestling as a " tweener , " a guy who is probably a few pounds too heavy for one weight class but not quite big enough for the next .

And I 'm thankful for that , because you 've got to be tough at this level . <p> Q : Did you enjoy it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , there were glimpses of fun I suppose , like individually when I would play well . But as a team , it was never like , we 're having a great time . ' We never were . <p> Q : So when Carmody was fired , what was your reaction ? <p> KA : Well I was trying to figure out what to do with my life . I was trying to see who 's coming in , am I leaving -- if coach is leaving , everyone was trying to see who came in and seeing if we wanted to play for the new guy . It was a very strange period . It was like two weeks . <p> Athletic Director Jim Phillips called us in and gave us the news , and we told him what we wanted in our next coach . And then we went on spring break , and Collins was here when we got back . <p> Q : What was that meeting with Phillips like ? What did you tell him ? <p> KA : It was intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense . We pretty much outlined the characteristics that Chris Collins fulfilled " a player 's coach , a history of getting players to the next level , developing players , stuff like that . I even wrote Phillips a letter . I said , Let 's bring Chris Collins here . ' I had met him , and I thought it was going to be the best fit for the team . And I still think they 're going to be really successful . <p> Q : So what was your reaction when Collins did get hired ? <p> KA : Oh , I was happy . I was totally ecstatic . I told Phillips I wanted him , so I was pumped up and ready to go . <p> Q : So when you first got to know Collins personally as the head coach here , what were your first impressions of him ? <p> KA : I thought he was just a cool dude . But I knew he was a killer deep down . There 's two different phases . If you 're that successful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public face , and there 's a behind the scenes , I'm-a-killer nasty face . You 've got to be a beast to be that successful and that strong and that tough . So I knew that initially . It kind of reminded me of my dad actually , because that 's how my dad is . So I liked it . It was a good initial impression . <p> Q : Did you see playing under Collins as a big opportunity for you ? <p> KA : Yeah . I mean , he 's coached the best players in the world , and his dad has coached the best players in the world , and he 's at every practice , so I felt privileged to have those guys . <p> Q : So when you first got out on the court , what were your first impressions of Chris Collins the coach ? <p> KA : Initially , he took it easy on us . He was cheering for us , he was like , Yeah , make that shot ! Yeah , let 's go ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool . I was like , Dang , this is different than Carmody . ' Because he 's way more vocal and charismatic . But that was just spring workouts . Once the season started , the tough guy came out . <p> Q : Can you tell me one story of him being that killer , being that tough guy ? <p> KA : We had some sort of scrimmage . We thought we had played fine , it was like a 15 minute scrimmage . Afterwards , the coaches were like yeah , yeah , good job , good job . ' And we get back home , take the weekend off , and then Monday comes , and team co-captain Dave Sobolewski texts us , guys , get here early . Film room . I 've never seen a coaching staff this mad in my whole entire life . ' And we did n't know what we did . We thought someone failed out of school or something . <p> We walk in there , and they played the film of that scrimmage , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was a lot of bad words said in that meeting . It was super-intense . That woke us up quick . <p> Q : Were there ever times like that with Carmody ? <p> KA : No . Never . <p> Q : In your first season under Collins , did you think your playing time was going to increase ? <p> KA : Yeah . <p> Q : And when it did n't , was it a surprise to you ? <p> KA : Yeah . <p> Q : In preseason , were there hints from Collins that it was n't going to increase ? <p> KA : Oh , I could tell right away . Once we started team workout , I knew I was on the second team immediately . It was already set , from probably the second workout . I did n't know how it happened , but I was like , Dang . ' So I was fighting every day in practice trying to earn it back , trying to win it back , and it was a struggle . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the games . There 's no refs . It is a war , especially when people are competing for playing time . I probably could have handled it better , I probably could 've played better , but yeah , I was just trying to do the best I could to get that time back . <p> Q : Do you feel that you were n't given a fair shot to earn your place on the team ? <p> KA : I mean , like I said , I could have done stuff differently , but I think , if I was put in a different position initially I do n't know , it 's tough to tell . It 's probably 50/50 I would say . I could 've maybe done it myself but maybe not . It 's one of those things I still think about . <p> Q : Do you know if other guys on the team felt like that as well ? <p> KA : Um I mean , obviously some people never got a chance . Like Aaron Lieberman never got a chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taphorn were pretty much the same . Yeah , it 's not fair . This is n't like YMCA ball , so no one is expecting it to be fair . <p> Q : Early in the year , you met with Collins , or you went into his office and pretty much told him that you wanted to play more . What went on in that meeting ? <p> KA : I was just confused , to be honest . I knew I was n't going to start , that was clear from day one , but after all the workouts , I played like two minutes in a scrimmage out in Saint Louis . And I was like , Holy crap . What is going on ? ' And so I had to talk to him . I do n't see myself sitting on the bench " ever . Maybe that 's cockiness , maybe that 's confidence , whatever , but I 'm not doing it . So I had to go in there and say it , and I think he respected that , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be more mad if I did n't care . <p> Q : Before the season , did Collins ever sit down with you and convey to you what your role was going to be on the team ? <p> KA : Before the season , he said , You should try to start on this team . I think you can start on this team . ' And I was like , Yeah , I agree . ' So I tried , and obviously it did n't work out . <p> Q : Do you think he was sincere in saying that ? <p> KA : Long pause I do n't know , I guess . Maybe . But I 'm guessing he told everybody the best case scenario , which is what you should do as a coach . You should say , Hey , this is your highest potential . This is what you should strive for . ' But no , nothing was guaranteed . <p> Q : Throughout the season , you had your moments , you had some good games , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you able to find that consistency ? <p> KA : I do n't know . It was a tough year . Playing time was up and down . I would make shots some games , I would not make shots some games , I would not get shots some games , I would get shots other games . That was frustrating for me , because I 'm not used to getting one shot a game , and if I miss it , the whole game was ruined . I could 've been more aggressive , and done other things , but it 's in the past , so I 've stopped thinking about it . <p> Q : In terms of Xs and Os , was there a reason that you did n't fit into the system or fit in with the team 's personnel ? <p> KA : I think we himself and Collins have a different vision for who I am as a player . And that 's fine . Obviously we 're allowed to disagree on that . But my role this year was to space the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct role for me this year " and I accepted it ; I even told him , I 'll do whatever you want ' " but after the year was over , I was like , I did n't work this hard to stand in the corner and shoot 3s . <p> Q : This is a completely open-ended question : What is your opinion of Chris Collins ? <p> KA : He is a son of a gun . I think he 's going to get this team wherever I mean , he will die before Northwestern is not successful . It 's only a matter of time . He 'll do whatever it takes . If he has to get players from SPAC Northwestern 's on-campus gym to win , he 'll do it " he said that many times to us . And he 's not kidding . <p> He and pretty much every successful coach has this persona of , I 'm really charismatic , I 'm really cool . ' And they are cool , but behind those doors , it 's a killer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . I think he 's going to take this place to the next level . <p> Q : So why did you decide to transfer ? <p> KA : Like I said , I see myself playing a much different role than what I had the opportunity to play here . And it 's not like I made the decision flippantly . It was very difficult . I weighed every option . I marked out what playing time would be available where , who was in my spot , what I would have to do to play , and then what I would have to do to play the minutes I wanted to play . And it was n't here . <p> Q : When did you start thinking about transferring ? <p> KA : Like , immediately when I did n't play the first game . I was like , this has to change . ' You get four years to play this game in college , and it 's kind of personal , but it 's really not . It 's a business . And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in my life , and I ca n't risk sitting on the bench . <p> Q : Was the decision made in your mind before the season was over ? <p> KA : Yeah . I never told anyone , not a soul besides my dad and my mom , but oh yeah . At some point , it was done . It 's not like I took anything away from the team , I still gave this team everything I had , and I 'm pretty proud of that . <p> Q : If you had n't transferred , what would your role have been on this team next year ? <p> KA : I think I would 've had to fight like a freakin ' nutcase every day just to get the minutes I got this year . And I hated this year . So I was like , Good lord . I ca n't do that again . ' <p> Q : So what do you want to accomplish at Drake ? <p> KA : I just want to get back to who I am as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe people do n't see that , but those people are n't around me every day , and those people do n't see what I see , what my family sees , what I think my coaches at Drake will see . <p> Obviously it 's not about me when I go to Drake , I want to get Drake back to prominence , I want to do something cool for Des Moines , which is my home town , but obviously I want to go to play and be successful as an individual as well . <p> Q : You definitely want to play basketball after school ? <p> KA : Yes . Most definitely . I 'll play wherever . I 'll play until my knees fall off . A very wise man told me that one time . You need to shoot that ball in the hoop until your knees break off . ' So that 's what I 'm going to do . <p> Q : Was there ever anything in your mind that tempted you to stay just for Northwestern and the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alex Olah , with whom he 's very good friends , and that beach points , and that lakefill points , and those classrooms points , and those teachers I have , that was big . I did n't know if I could do it . I did n't know if I could leave that . But that was big with Drake , because it 's a very good academic school , so I knew I was n't dropping down to the crust school of America . So I guess I 've just got to come back and see the beach every once in a while . <p> And me and Olah are going to be brothers for life . I ended up not worrying about that as much . It 's going to suck leaving him , but I expect him to go to the NBA soon , so he can fly me out to see him whenever he wants . So it 's just one of those things .

@@97968211 @2168211/ <p> For a quick reminder on how the term " student-athlete " was created , here 's Taylor Branch : <p> Today , much of the NCAA 's moral authority " indeed much of the justification for its existence " is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the " student-athlete . " The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism , and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor . But the origins of the " student-athlete " lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed , as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written , to help the NCAA in its " fight against workmen 's compensation insurance claims for injured football players . " <p> " We crafted the term student-athlete , " NCAA president Walter Byers himself wrote , " and soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations . " The term came into play in the 1950s , when the widow of Ray Dennison , who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&amp;M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football scholarship make the fatal collision a " work-related " accident ? Was he a school employee , like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers ? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits ? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year , the answers to these questions had enormous consequences . The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school 's contention that he was not eligible for benefits , since the college was " not in the football business . " <p> The term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous . College players were not students at play ( which might understate their athletic obligations ) , nor were they just athletes in college ( which might imply they were professionals ) . That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers ; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated , ever , for anything more than the cost of their studies . Student-athlete became the NCAA 's signature term , repeated constantly in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases . On the afternoon of October 26 , 1974 , the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham , Alabama . Kent Waldrep , a TCU running back , carried the ball on a " Red Right 28 " sweep toward the Crimson Tide 's sideline , where he was met by a swarm of tacklers . When Waldrep regained consciousness , Bear Bryant , the storied Crimson Tide coach , was standing over his hospital bed . " It was like talking to God , if you 're a young football player , " Waldrep recalled . <p> Waldrep was paralyzed : he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck . After nine months of paying his medical bills , Texas Christian refused to pay any more , so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity . <p> Through the 1990s , from his wheelchair , Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers ' compensation ... His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equipment for the job , as a typical employer would " but did the university pay wages , withhold income taxes on his financial aid , or control work conditions and performance ? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep 's claim in June of 2000 , ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football . ( Waldrep told me school officials " said they recruited me as a student , not an athlete , " which he says was absurd . ) <p> The long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA 's " student-athlete " formulation as a shield , and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal . <p> That final sentence fragment , written in 2011 , looks remarkably prescient today , as the NCAA had this to say in response to Kain Colter leading an attempt for players to unionize : <p> The NCAA responded with a statement from Chief Legal Officer Donald Remy , who said " student-athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Act " and that there is no existing employment relationships between the " NCAA , its affiliated institutions or student-athletes . " <p> " This union-backed attempt to turn student-athletes into employees undermines the purpose of college : an education , " Remy said in the statement . " Student-athletes are not employees , and their participation in college sports is voluntary . We stand for all student-athletes , not just those the unions want to professionalize . " <p> Legalistic defense ? Check . <p> Noble ideal ? Check . <p> So far , the strategy of the fledgling union is to start with modest proposals that have strong public support before moving on major proposals like pay-for-play . In a piece on the main SBNation page today , Patrick Vint makes the astute point that the MLB Player 's Assocation used a similar strategy to become the most powerful union in America . It 's a great idea , and a great start . Unfortunately , the NCAA is going to fight this every inch of the way , precisely because history tells them that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on transfers , it 's only a matter of time before the floodgates open . As we 've seen above , the NCAA has no qualms with the bad PR that comes with going into court and attempting to get out of paying the medical bills of a paralyzed former player ; they 're clearly willing to take massive PR hits in order to maintain the status quo . <p> The NCAA does not require schools to cover sports-related injuries - it 's optional . College athletes injured during sports-related workouts should not have to pay for medical expenses out of their own pockets . <p> Good luck with that one , Kain . Here 's to hoping you succeed where Mrs. Ray Dennison and Kent Waldrep failed . 
@@97968212 @2168212/ <h> The Franchise enters a five-man competition for Indy 's two starting middle linebacker spots . <p> Selected in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft , Anthony Walker Jr . " the first Northwestern player to declare early for the Draft under head coach Pat Fitzgerald " is an Indianapolis Colt . But with the draft process now out of the way , Walker 's focus will now shift to the Colts ' minicamp May 12-14 , where he 'll look to begin his quest to earn playing time next season . <p> Overview of the Colts ' defense <p> When new General Manager Chris Ballard took over this offseason , his first big task was to rebuild a Colts defense that ranked 30th in yards allowed per game last season . Considering Indianapolis ' complete failure to defend the run over the past four years or so , something had to be done . <p> After the retirement of pass-rusher Robert Mathis , the Colts signed Jabaal Sheard , Barkevious Mingo and John Simon to solidify the outside linebacker position . Along with that trio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid a defense that ranked 25th in the league in rushing yards allowed last season . <p> At inside linebacker ( our main focus ) , the Colts retain Edwin Jackson and Antonio Morrison , a duo that started together at the back end of the 2016 season . To add depth at the position , the team also added Jon Bostic and Sean Spence in the offseason . <p> Indy 's offseason focus on revamping its defense continued in the draft ; the Colts spent six of their eight picks on defensive players , including their first three selections . <p> System-wise , the Colts run a 3-4 system under head coach Chuck Pagano . So , three down lineman are meant to occupy space and blockers , which allows the middle linebackers to attack the line of scrimmage . The outside linebackers are expected to provide width in the box and rush the passer . <p> With Pro Bowl cornerback Vontae Davis and second-round corner Quincy Wilson on the outside , the Colts will likely play a lot of man-to-man coverage in the secondary . The middle linebackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running backs in the passing game , in addition to their duties filling gaps against the run . <p> Where Walker stands <p> Including Walker , there are five players competing for the two starting middle linebacker spots . Having started four games together for the Colts last season , Jackson and Morrison should have the inside tracks to land those two spots . In the four games they started together last season , the Colts allowed 20.3 points per game , better than their season average of 24.5 points per game , for what that 's worth . <p> Bostic and Spence are also worthy candidates for the starting spots , but it 's tough to project either as a starter given their relative lack of experience in defensive coordinator Ted Monachino 's defense . <p> Of those four players , Spence is the oldest at 26 . For Walker , being thrown into such a young group of inside backers is a double-edged sword . On one hand , Walker wo n't have a truly accomplished veteran to learn from and emulate . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an impact early in his career . <p> It 's tough to project how a rookie will adapt to life in the NFL , but it 's also probably a stretch to say Walker will win one of the two starting spots right away . Regardless , he should at least see some snaps this season as a backup . For a defense that struggled so mightily last season , Monachino may be inclined to give his new additions a chance to play . <p> The bottom line <p> Like most fifth-round picks , Walker 's path to immediately seeing the field is lengthy . It will take time to adjust to the speed and physicality of the professional game , but Walker is in a prime position to make an impression at some point . As the youngest inside linebacker in an already-young group , he will need to improve his fluidity in coverage and his ability to get off blocks in the box to stick at the next level . But with the work ethic and mental makeup Walker has , that 's entirely possible .

The two play relatively similarly , although Jackson has the better stats and Huerter has the redder hair .

Maryland is young , but its freshmen have played like upperclassmen for the majority of the season . What worries me most about the Terrapins is their depth and their penchant for winning close games and winning on the road . With three solid big men in Damonte Dodd , Michael Cekovsky and Ivan Bender , as well as sixth man Jaylen Brantley and role players like Jared Nickens and LG Gill , Turgeon has the ability to go 9 or 10 deep every game , while Chris Collins is realistically limited to eight players with Lindsey out .

It 's a game that begs for Collins to squeeze a few minutes out of his reserves to cut down on his starters ' minutes , and even if he does , mental and physical fatigue could be a problem . I also think Maryland has a greater number of reliable offensive threats . Law will likely guard Trimble and Sanjay Lumpkin will get Jackson , which leaves Huerter with a mismatch against Nathan Taphorn or Isiah Brown . Additionally , I think the Terps have more proven , talented depth in the post compared to Gavin Skelly and Barret Benson . Northwestern will need McIntosh , Law and Pardon to be on their A-games in order to pick up the win .

@@97968222 @2168222/ <h> Fans should n't worry if Northwestern misses out on Mark Smith and Charlie Moore <h> Acquiring either point guard would be a luxury , but is n't a necessity . <p> Excluding the grad transfer market , the two hottest names in Northwestern basketball recruiting right now are a pair of four-star point guards who played their high school ball in the state of Illinois . One , Mark Smith , is a late-rising 2017 recruit , and the other , Charlie Moore , a transfer with three years of eligibility remaining . Frankly , both will be tough gets for Northwestern because of the schools it 'll be competing with . <p> But is the program in trouble without either player ? Short answer : Not necessarily . Long answer : Even without either guy , the Wildcats will be fine next season , and provided Chris Collins can make a splash in the 2018 recruiting class , the team should survive the loss of the backcourt that led it to the NCAA Tournament for the first time . <p> With its roster as it stands today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make another run in the NCAA Tournament in 2017-18 . <p> Rising seniors Bryant McIntosh and Scottie Lindsey will own the lion 's share of minutes in the backcourt next season . Last year , the two averaged 34.2 and 30.6 minutes per game , respectively . Assuming those stay about the same , that leaves just a hair over 15 minutes left at the guard spots . Sophomore Isiah Brown and junior Jordan Ash will be the incumbents competing for those minutes . <p> All this goes without mentioning the fact that the Wildcats are already welcoming a guard into the rotation in Anthony Gaines . Gaines , a 6-foot-4 shooting guard from New Hampton , N.H. , is a top-200 recruit and top-50 at his position who has impressed recently . <p> While the backcourt has plenty to survive ( and thrive ) next season , the Wildcats , who have n't seen much production from Brown and Ash , arguably need an elite prospect to replace either McIntosh or Lindsey , both of whom will be graduating after next season . Smith , a 6-foot-5 floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award-winning senior season , would be a dream fit . The Edwardsville , Ill. native is a top-100 prospect and top-20 at his position . He 's got the talent to play right away and develop into a star . <p> The problem ? Smith has offers from tradition powerhouses like Michigan State and Kentucky , along with Missouri , Ohio State , Indiana and Illinois , and it seems highly unlikely at this point that he 'll choose Northwestern . Without Smith , the Wildcats only have Ash , Brown and Gaines locked in past 2018 . Getting another guard , either via recruiting or transfer , would certainly help the team for the 2018-19 season . <p> Moore could be that guy . Moore is a 5-foot-11 point guard who averaged 12.2 points and 3.5 assists as a freshman at California . On April 13 , he announced his decision to transfer to a program closer to his hometown of Chicago . Northwestern fits that bill and is fresh off its first dance in March . <p> If Moore were to transfer to Evanston , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincide with the departure of McIntosh and Lindsey , opening up a spot in the starting lineup for him , just as a renovated Welsh-Ryan Arena re-opens . It 's unclear where the Wildcats stand in Moore 's pecking order , but his camp has been interested in the program before . Illinois would seem to be the most logical competitor . Yesterday , Moore 's former coach at Cal , Cuonzo Martin , announced he would n't be recruiting Moore to follow him to Missouri . <p> Even if Northwestern swings and misses on both Smith and Moore , the team is n't necessarily in trouble . Chris Collins has proven he can recruit talented players at all five positions . He 's got another year before his starting backcourt leaves to find another guard or two , such as 2018 four-star recruits Jahvon Quinerly , Ayo Dosunmu and Dwayne Cohill . It 's also possible that Ash , Brown or Gaines develops enough to start once McIntosh and Lindsey are gone . <p> Regardless of what happens , the Wildcats are in a good position right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either Smith or Moore .

@@97968233 @2168233/ <h> Chris Collins is Luke Skywalker . <p> On Sunday night in Madison , Northwestern basketball , both in the context of the 2016-2017 season and the program 's history , faced a moment of reckoning . In the midst of a demoralizing two-game losing streak and without its leading scorer , the Wildcats would have to put on an inspired performance on the road against No. 7 Wisconsin for their NCAA tournament aspirations to get the boost of a big-time win they needed . <p> To make a long story short , they did just that . <p> A galvanized Bryant McIntosh and an outstanding team defensive effort drove Northwestern 's success Sunday night , but both of these developments go against trends that have come to fruition since losing Scottie Lindsey . The negative impacts of the junior guard 's absence have echoed through every phase of the game for Northwestern ; a bump in minutes and offensive responsibility for McIntosh and Vic Law and slotting Isiah Brown into the starting lineup have left the Wildcats less efficient offensively and undersized defensively . In Northwestern 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three and out-assisted the Wildcats by an average margin of 8.5 dimes per game . <p> Thus , a trip to Wisconsin assuredly spelled doom for the visitors . The Badgers boast a trio of devastating offensive weapons : Ethan Happ , Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig , each of whom posed unique challenges to Chris Collins from a coaching perspective . Collins , though , chose to hone in primarily on Happ in the team 's defensive game plan . <p> Happ is a dominant low-post scorer and passer in one-on-one scenarios . His team-high usage rate of 27 percent on the season proves his worth as a catalyst of much of what Wisconsin likes to do offensively . Happ 's unique skill set , supplemented by an arsenal of shooters and cutters around him , is a crucial part of what makes the Badgers so dangerous . <p> But against Northwestern , he was nothing more than the faulty reactor to the Death Star that is Wisconsin 's offense . And by removing him from the equation , Collins ensured that Greg Gard 's aforementioned array of weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little help from their friends : <p> From the opening tip , it was clear that Collins was not going to allow his side to be bullied inside by Happ , as many opponents have in his years as a Badger . On virtually every post touch the senior center had throughout the contest , another Wildcat would immediately swarm to meet him , ideally getting there before he could pivot or put the ball on the floor . <p> Here is an example of the double team executed to perfection . As soon as Happ catches the ball , Gavin Skelly scampers from his assignment and , along with Barrett Benson , pins Happ into the corner , cutting him off from the rest of the play . Once Happ puts the ball on the floor , he 's toast . Benson effectively walls off the baseline and with Skelly sandwiching him , kicking it to either Hayes or Brevin Pritzl at the top of the key becomes impossible . Law and McIntosh work in conjunction to clog passing lanes to a cutting Vitto Brown and Koenig , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play ends in Happ calling a timeout , the only conceivable outcome other than a turnover . <p> It 's plays like this that give credence to Collins ' praise of his side 's defensive communication post-game . But there are , of course , cons to using the double team as aggressively as Collins chose to . If the second defender arrives a split-second late or the other three defender 's rotations are half-a-second slow , Happ has the passing ability to pick Northwestern apart . <p> In this clip , Lumpkin attempts to lull Happ into a sense of false security by hesitating before bringing the double , but he over-lurches and , because Happ still has his dribble , the Badger big-man is able to effortlessly step around him and into open space in the middle of the floor . McIntosh makes perhaps the gravest mistake on the play by wrongly anticipating Happ skipping it to Vitto Brown , who instead dives towards the rim , leaving McIntosh flat-footed and out of position as Koenig slides into Brown 's place at the top of the arc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showalter is left wide open in the corner for the easy triple . <p> But you live with these mistakes for the psychological impact that this type of constant pressure can have on a player . Happ , rather uncharacteristically , turned the ball over four times on the night and often appeared jittery when forced into quick decisions . <p> The top clip actually results in an open look for Wisconsin . Despite Skelly immediately hounding Happ , the Wisconsin big man gets off an arrant jump-pass in the direction of Koening , who is , again , open in the corner . However , due to the ferocity of the double team and Happ 's overeagerness to be rid of the ball , the pass veers to the left . Koenig still hauls it in and gets a decent shot off , but the inaccuracy of the pass allows McIntosh to recover and contest the look in addition to Koenig being forced to shoot slightly out of rhythm . <p> The play depicted in the bottom clip actually occurs directly after the timeout Happ was forced to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and immediately dribbles away from Lumpkin , only to be cut off by Dererk Pardon . As Lumpkin approaches , Happ leans and attempts a reckless skip-pass to Brown in the far corner , which is tipped and intercepted by Law . The potential of the double-team , even when not immediately present , can affect a player 's decision making . This fact is apparent here . <p> It is also worth mentioning that the insertion of Nathan Taphorn into the starting lineup was a key part of this strategy being possible . Aside from the sharp-shooting he brings , playing Taphorn at the four allowed Collins to slide Lumpkin and Law up a position , giving Northwestern the necessary length to effectively double team Happ all night and successfully occupy the passing channels Happ might have looked to utilize . <p> The art of the double-team is a nuanced and precise one . When executed correctly , the incessant pressure can burst an opposing offense 's pipes and when executed sloppily , it can leave your defense out of position and helpless . You take the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Collins did Sunday night . <p> And luckily for Northwestern , more often than not , this defensive strategy neutralized perhaps Wisconsin most versatile and dangerous offensive weapon . In spurts , the ineffectiveness ( which in turn often led to the absence ) of Happ , whom the Badgers often rely upon so heavily , crumbled the Badgers offense . <p> Northwestern was putrid defensively against Purdue and almost as bad against Illinois . But the mark of a good team " and a well-coached one at that " is the ability to adapt . In planning for Wisconsin , Collins did what a struggling , underdog team fighting for their lives should do : attacked the opponent 's offense at its source . And thanks to this aggressiveness , Northwestern got itself back on track . <p> Of course , Collins and the rest of Northwestern 's defense will need to continue to adapt , especially with Lindsey 's return not as imminent as was once thought .

Despite Coffey 's best efforts , Minnesota would not relinquish the advantage and was able to close out the game on the free throw stripe . <p> The loss puts Northwestern on the outside looking in heading into the final four games of the season . Northwestern will surely need wins at Iowa and Purdue as well as a win in the Big Ten Tournament to rally for an NCAA Tournament berth .

Happ has great vision and his size allows him to see over the defenses , even when they come with double-teams .

Nebraska did a great job of this . <p> In the below example , Happ catches it closer to the baseline than he would like to . When Jack McVeigh , a lanky 6-foot-8 forward , comes down to double , Happ has no way to pass over him and ca n't go baseline either . Notice how Happ 's first dribble is toward his own bench to try to escape the double , rather than toward the basket .

The Wildcats will be looking for its next core of young players to take the team back to the NCAA Tournament . <p> So far , Joe McKeown 's Class of 2017 is very guard-heavy , which makes sense after Deary and Inman 's departures . According to ESPN 's rankings , Northwestern has two top 100 recruits and another three-star guard . This is good enough for ESPN to rank Northwestern as having the 17th-best class in the country . <p> Lindsey Pulliam , a four-star guard from Maryland , is the best recruit in the class . She 's a deceptively quick , 5-foot-10 combo guard who could definitely see time at small forward depending on the situation . She has a great shooting stroke and can create off the dribble and in the lane , as you can see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good midrange game and could become deadly if she develops a three-point shot . <p> Pulliam will be in the mix as heiress apparent to Coffey in terms of scoring burden . She played against very tough competition in Maryland and impressed there . Northwestern desperately needs Pulliam to pan out as an offensive and defensive force . <p> Northwestern also landed Jordan Hamilton , a 5-foot-7 lead-guard from Frisco , Texas . In high school , she excelled at distributing and scoring . Her stock has been rising since Northwestern recruited her , and she has the ability to both score and run the floor as a point guard . With Northwestern stocked with guards in this class , we shall she if the four-star recruit fits in at point guard or shooting guard , but she should get some playing time regardless . <p> Lauryn Satterwhite is a 5-foot-7 true point guard from Arizona . She is probably just outside the Top 100 in ESPN 's rankings , and can hold her own with Northwestern 's other two recruits if healthy . She scored at will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has n't been quite the same since . Her brother , Cameron Satterwhite , plays at Loyola and also had to recover from a serious knee injury . <p> Lastly , Northwestern added Veronica Burton , another guard from Boston .

Burton averaged 20.5 points and 5.7 assists for Newton South high school . <p> Again , this is going to be Joe McKeown 's most important class since landing Coffey , Deary and Inman . Northwestern will have an almost entirely revamped starting lineup next year , and the Class of 2017 will have a shot to make an impact almost immediately . The only returning point guard on the roster is Byrdy Galernik , who backed up Ashley Deary last year in brief stretches and averaged 6.3 minutes per game . That spot is wide open , presumably .

In their first conference game as a ranked team since in almost 50 years , the Wildcats got beat up badly in West Lafayette . The result was a 80-59 loss , their first double-digit defeat of the season . <p> Not coincidentally , it was also the Wildcats ' first game of the season playing without leading scorer Scottie Lindsey . A starter in all 22 of Northwestern 's previous games and a double-digit scorer in 21 of them , the junior guard was even more sorely missed against the Boilermakers than most expected .

The offense as a whole was impotent at best , and that can not be argued , but with Dererk Pardon and Gavin Skelly neutralized by the bigger and stronger tandem of Isaac Haas and Caleb Swanigan down low , Nate Taphorn injured , and Vic Law struggling with his jumper and finding no luck getting to the rim ( he shot 0-7 from the field and had just one point ) , would the insertion of Lindsey really have had a decisive impact in turning things around on the offensive end ? <p> Perhaps he could have had more isolation success than Brown and could have created more coming off off-ball screens than Law , but it is a stretch to suggest that he could have added enough to reverse the tide of this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different story . <p> Wednesday night revealed something that a lot of consistent observers may not have noticed in the midst of the Wildcats recent dominance defensively ; that Lindsey and Law are the only two true long , strong wing defenders on this team ( Sanjay Lumpkin can play there but mainly bangs with bigger bodies ) . With one of the two sidelined for the first time , the foundation of Northwestern 's defense became shaky , and Purdue was the perfect opponent to ensure that the structure of it as a whole crumbled as a result . <p> The total and complete breakdown of the Wildcats perimeter defense without Lindsey manifested itself in many different ways throughout the night . <h> Law in an unfamiliar assignment : <p> Vic Law is Northwestern 's best individual defender , and likely one of the best defenders in the Big Ten as a whole , but he had a rough night defending Purdue 's Dakota Mathias . <p> The beauty of Law as a defender is how ubiquitously dominant his talent package allows him to be . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto forwards and big men , block and alter countless shots with his length and timing , and be a dominant force on the defensive glass . One of the only assignments that he is not accustomed to undertaking and excelling at is chasing around pure shooters , and it showed Wednesday . <p> In this clip from early in the first half , Mathias runs off of two brush screens and gets a trailing Law to fly by on a pump-fake , before sticking a jumper . From his upright starting position as Mathias begins his cut , it is clear that Law is not accustomed to guarding an off-ball curler on this type of action . We have seen Law be brilliant this year in his ability to fight past and recover from on-ball screens . He rarely has to chase shooters around screens , and here Mathias was able lose him on the curl , anticipate Law 's length and recovery ability , and calmly hit an open jumper . <p> Normally , Lindsey would draw the assignment of a shooter like Mathias . He has specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rotate well , jump passing lanes , and get out to shooters has been one of the most underrated aspects of his game and Northwestern 's defense as a whole . <p> Law would normally have been tasked with a smaller ball-dominant guard like P.J. Thompson and would have been able to completely take them out of the game . Instead , he was left to unsuccessfully chase Mathias around the court as he filled it up from deep , which freed up Thompson to have his way creating off ball screens from Swanigan and Haas with the smaller Brown and slower McIntosh guarding him . <p> Lindsey 's absence did not just move the team 's best individual defender from a dominant role to an unfamiliar one , but also forced their best team defender to do the same thing . <p> At the start of the evening , Sanjay Lumpkin displayed all the best aspects of his incredible defensive talent . With Purdue playing two smaller guards and McIntosh , Brown and Law matching up cleanly on positions 1-3 on the perimeter , Lumpkin was free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4 position . He repeatedly doubled down on Purdue 's go-to option , Swanigan , with expert timing and discipline , forcing the national player of the year candidate into three early turnovers . He was able to do the same when Isaac Haas came into the game , but then everything changed . <p> Purdue decided to start playing three wing players around a point guard and Haas/Swanigan . Without the size to play the 5 defensively , Lumpkin was forced out onto the perimeter for the rest of the game to guard swift-moving sharp-shooters Vince Edwards and Ryan Cline . Recognizing this , Matt Painter began to run a lot of screening action for three point opportunities with devastating results . <p> In the first clip , Cline ( Lumpkin 's man ) sets a baseline screen for Mathias . So concerned about Cline 's shooting ability , and needing to switch onto Mathias with Law again late to recognize the design of the offense , Lumpkin delays for a split second underneath the rim in picking up Mathias ' curl , and has neither the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand up and alter the shot . <p> In the second clip , Purdue runs a perimeter set specifically for Edwards . Lumpkin is placed in a position he may well not have been in before this season , of starting out a defensive possession in the half court guarding a man who is having his number called for a play on the perimeter . Not recognizing the situation , he goes under the Thompson screen and Edwards gets a quick and easy three , his fifth of the game . <p> Lumpkin 's strengths defensively are his physicality , veteran savvy , and quick hands in the post , and his ability to switch on-ball screens and move his feet on the perimeter . Lindsey 's absence and Purdue 's adjustment forced him to guard perimeter scorers , and much like Law , he was taken away from his established role defensively and failed to make an impact in his new one . <p> With two small offensive-minded guards on the floor in Brown and McIntosh , Lumpkin moved into an auxiliary wing defender role to counter Purdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pardon needing to be on the floor at all times to occupy either Swanigan or Haas , and without Lindsey or Taphorn , Chris Collins was stuck between a rock and a hard place in his choosing a wing defender off the bench . <p> The rock was 6-foot-1 point guard Jordan Ash , and the hard place was 6-foot-8 Skelly who has played the 4 and 5 this season . Collins chose the hard place , and unfortunately smashed his head against it one too many times . <p> Skelly was responsible for checking Edwards on the perimeter for two short first half stretches , and that matchup was almost single-handedly responsible for making those two stretches devastating ones for the Wildcats . <p> There is no need to break down each of Edwards ' four threes on this run individually , but as a package they illustrate Skelly 's struggles as a perimeter defender , both physically and mentally , after playing the whole year as a power forward and center . Physically , he is far too slow to move laterally to get out to Edwards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his instincts tell him to double down on rollers in the paint in the half court and sprint back to protect the basket in transition , resulting in three wide open threes for Edwards from the same side of the court , two of which nobody besides Skelly is at fault . <p> This lambasting of Skelly 's perimeter defense is not meant as a slight to his ability as a player overall , nor is it meant as an indictment for blame in the lopsided loss . Skelly is a player whose strengths are his energy around the basket and on the glass , and his ability to produce mismatches with slower big men on the offensive end . He is in no way a player who would ever be in this position coming off the bench if Lindsey had been in the lineup . <p> Nonetheless , that was the dilemma that Collins and this team found themselves in last night , and it goes to great lengths to illustrate the severity of the impact of Lindsey 's loss defensively .

Here 's a video analysis of how Brown helped spur Northwestern to a critical win on Sunday . <h> Offensive Aggression <p> Brown 's greatest skill is his ability to attack the basket and get to the foul line . Against the Buckeyes , he was relentless in his pursuit of the rim . In the first half , his scoring punch helped the Wildcats after their cold start from the field . Watch as he uses a screen to get downhill : <p> NOTE : All video courtesy of BTN2Go . <p> Once Brown has a head full of steam , he can zip to the basket in a flash .

He used Ohio State 's retreat to defense as an opportunity to speed the game up and get to the rim : <p> The Buckeyes ' defense is n't set , allowing Brown to barrel into the lane . Ohio State is forced to send a help defender , resulting in Brown getting fouled . Later in the half , Brown again attacked in transition , but was able to draw in the defense to give Gavin Skelly an open jump shot : <p> As Brown enters the paint , Skelly creeps toward the baseline , out of his defender 's line of sight . Instead of attending to Skelly , he reacts to Brown 's drive , leaving his man wide open . Brown makes the correct read , taking the help and finding the open man . <p> All game , Brown attracted the attention of multiple defenders . Instead of being goaded into putting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gifting his teammates with easy buckets : <p> When he comes off of Dererk Pardon 's screen , Brown is immediately crowded by two defenders . There 's a sliver of space between them though , and Brown is able to slip a bounce pass through to Pardon for the jam . In order for that to work , Brown needed to read the situation promptly and get rid of the ball before Ohio State rotated another defender onto Pardon . He did so , resulting in an open dunk . <p> He also had an excellent hockey assist late in the game , yet again taking advantage of the Buckeyes ' helpers : <p> When Brown drives , he draws the attention of not just his man , but Pardon 's and Sanjay Lumpkin 's , too .

What Brown lacks in height he makes up for with quickness . Watch as he is able to sneak up behind Marc Loving to block his jump shot : <p> Loving has six inches on Brown , making the block even more impressive . Brown looks like toast when Loving receives a handoff , giving him ample space to fire away . Brown accelerates , though , and reaches to block the shot . <p> Here 's another example of how Brown 's speed can make him effective in helping and recovery situations : <p> Brown helps on a drive , recovers to the three-point line to close out on a shooter and then gets in position to force JaQuan Lyle into flubbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players can simply rise above Brown and still have room to shoot , but the fact that Brown is making the correct rotations shows how much he 's improved since the start of the season . <p> Finally , here 's the play that Chris Collins said was crucial to the team 's win : <p> Brown anticipates the pass , poking it away and ahead . He uses his quickness to to zoom up the floor and lay the ball in , forcing a Buckeye timeout . That 's not a pass you can plan for . That kind of play rests on players ' instincts , and Brown read it perfectly . <p> The numbers wo n't show it , but Brown was a key part of Sunday 's historic victory . With 11 games left in conference play , Northwestern needs all hands on deck if it wants to continue to break new ground .

Ben Oxley " a former defensive lineman " figures to take Olson spot . Oxley switched from the defensive line to the offensive line , and he has above-average athleticism for the position . <p> Guard and team captain Connor Mahoney will be gone , but he lost his job to J.B. Butler during the season , and Butler stepped up and played well , especially as just a redshirt freshman . <p> Butler 's guard counterpart Tommy Doles was also pretty good without being great , and should be a solid Big Ten lineman next year . <p> Between the two guards will be Brad North .

In Big Ten games against Iowa , Michigan State and even Ohio State , the line held up , and played well enough for Northwestern to have a chance in all three games ( although the Cats did lose in the Horseshoe ) . <p> And the line delivered a spectacular performance in the Pinstripe Bowl , allowing Justin Jackson to rush for 224 yards . <p> Improvement on the line will do wonders the Wildcats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the run blocking was n't good enough in certain games . <p> Early in the season , offensive coordinator Mick McCall had to all but abandon the running game because the line could n't generate any push against Illinois State .

It 's a matter of being more consistent , and continuing the strong stretches of play for longer periods . <p> The person who may benefit most from better offensive line play is Clayton Thorson . One of his most glaring weaknesses is his presence and awareness in the pocket , and some of that is because he does n't have enough time to throw on a fairly sizable percentage of plays . <p> If the line can take the next step and have success more consistently , Thorson 's development will be facilitated and not stunted , even without his top wideout , giving the junior-to-be a shot to be one of the conference 's best next season .

The 6-foot-2 Tennessee transfer has quietly put together a monster season with 26 touchdown passes and just six interceptions , and is quickly rising up NFL draft boards . Sports Illustrated even called him the top candidate to be this year 's Dak Prescott . <p> Peterman only averages about 24 pass attempts per game , but he has averaged a whopping 15.1 yards per completion this season , which is seventh in the country .

This season , Connor has rushed for 1060 yards and 16 touchdowns on 5.1 yards per carry .

This worked for Michigan State with NFL first-round picks Darqueze Dennard and Trae Waynes at cornerback , but Pitt 's corners are a far cry from MSU 's no fly zone .

I 'm not expecting anything like Northwestern 's 27-0 bludgeoning of the Gophers last season , but there is good reason to believe the Wildcats will win this game . Their offense has been rolling for most of conference play and the defense has put up a few encouraging recent performances as well .

Which brings me to the first of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gophers ' 7-3 record is deceptive because they have n't beaten any good teams <p> It 's been a fairly straightforward year for Minnesota .

Now , this is n't to say the Gophers are a bad football team . They played all three of those teams very close , most notably a 29-26 loss to now-No. 9 ( AP ) Penn State . My point , rather , is that Minnesota is n't nearly as good as its record might indicate . This is n't a team that was ever going to compete for the Big Ten West title .

Justin Jackson and John Moten IV ripped off 6.5 yards per carry against Purdue but they 'll encounter some tougher sledding this week .

Like Law , he 's also important , but there is n't enough of a question mark surrounding his performance for him to be the answer to this question . <p> You could look at wings Scottie Lindsey and Aaron Falzon , who will be asked to develop all-around offensive games and defend better than last season . Improvements from both would go a long way to a Northwestern postseason appearance , but the fact that they play at the Wildcats ' deepest position means the team could survive if one or both has n't improved too much from 2015-16 . <p> The answer to the question lies in the team 's 6-8 center from Cleveland , OH : Dererk Pardon . <p> Pardon , entering his first season as a starting big man , has several flaws that hopefully have been addressed throughout the offseason . <p> The biggest question about Pardon is whether or not he will be able to stay on the floor ; he averaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a player who will see a significant increase in minutes this season , that statistic is troubling . <p> Even if Pardon does stay out of foul trouble , there are other concerns about his game . <p> Defensively , will Pardon be able be an average or plus defender on pick-and-rolls ? Also , will he be able to handle bigger , stronger players in the post ? What we saw last season tells us that both areas are n't strong suits for Pardon , who has below-average foot speed and size . If Pardon can improve in both areas , that would be a major development for the team " having the ability to switch at least some pick-and-rolls and not having to double-team opposing big-men in the post would give Collins some crucial defensive flexibility . <p> On the offensive end , Pardon must show growth and maturity .

Skelly is a good passer , but you ca n't really throw him the ball in the post and let him go to work . You could n't do that last season with Pardon either , but it 's important to remember that Pardon was n't expected to play at all as a freshman . Only after Alex Olah 's foot injury did Collins burn Pardon 's redshirt and thrust him into the fold . It would be unfair to expect a steady and polished post presence from Pardon , but progress and at least some dependability " to go with his ferocity on the boards " would be huge . <p> Against the likes of Thomas Bryant , Caleb Swanigan and Ethan Happ in the Big Ten , Pardon will have to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'll have to compete on both ends .

Rather than rush out the grades on Saturday , we 'll sleep on them , and wake up ready to accurately evaluate NU 's players , coaches and opponents . <p> This week , Northwestern put up a poor offensive showing in a 21-7 loss to Wisconsin . The team report card reflects a tough performance , but there were a few bright spots . <h> Offense <h> Clayton Thorson <h> Grade : C+ <p> Stats : 28/52 , 277 yards , one touchdown ; six carries , negative three yards , one fumble lost <p> Thorson was very much up-and-down on the afternoon .

He missed open receivers downfield , he forced throws late in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the turning point in the game was his fumble with Northwestern trailing 13-7 and driving into Wisconsin territory . Thorson needs to be a better decision maker if Northwestern wants to beat Top 10 teams like the Badgers . Still , given the limited amount of help around him , it 's not a total disaster . <h> Justin Jackson <h> Grade : C <p> Stats : 13 carries , 42 yards ; one receptions , 1 yards <p> It was a game to forget for Jackson , tying his lowest rushing total of the year . In fact , we almost forgot he existed . The Wildcats found themselves in a 10-0 hole and abandoned the run to some extent . Jackson 's numbers are buoyed by a 28-yard scamper in the second half ; he was bottled up for one-to-two yards the entire game . It 's far from his fault , however , but it 's tough to give Jackson a positive grade for today . <h> Austin Carr <h> Grade : A+ <p> Stats : 12 receptions , 138 yards , one touchdown <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten 's leading receiver added to his already impressive numbers , surpassing the 1,000 yard mark on the season . Carr seemed to open at the right time , converting a couple huge third downs , including receptions for 22 and 32 yards . His 13-yard touchdown put Northwestern back in the game , trailing by only three points . Either way , Carr remains a huge bright spot on the team , and a legitimate contender for the Biletnikoff Award . <h> Andrew Scanlan <h> Grade : A- <p> Stats : Five catches , 46 yards <p> It was nice to see Scanlan haul in five receptions , doubling his season total in one game . He held his own on the perimeter with Wisconsin 's physical corners , had a nice run after the catch to pick up a first down in Northwestern territory , and also he hauled in a 19-yard reception while sliding and making an adjustment to a ball slightly behind him .

They also struggled applying pressure on Wisconsin 's quarterbacks , failing to register a single sack all game . To be fair , freshman Alex Hornibrook hung in the pocket phenomenally and delivered a few nice throws in the face of pressure , although Northwestern 's defensive line was simply not active enough . Xavier Washington got an encroachment penalty on a 3rd and 6 that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to throw . The bright spot in this unit was Tyler Lancaster , who registered 8 tackles and had 2 tackles for a loss . <h> Anthony Walker Jr . <h> Grade : B <p> Stats : Nine tackles ( five solo ) , 0.5 tackles for a loss <p> Walker played well ; his nine tackles were second on the team , but he did n't do much to stand out . Northwestern let up seven third-down conversions and really struggled in short-yardage situations , and Walker bears a lot of the responsibility as the middle-linebacker and the unquestioned leader of the defense . He 's getting a lot more attention from teams than he was last year . <h> Brett Walsh and Joseph Jones <h> Grade : B+ <p> Stats : Both had eight tackles ( six solo ) , Jones had one tackle for a loss <p> Walsh played well filling in for the injured Jaylen Prater . He notched eight tackles against a strong Wisconsin offensive line and running game and disrupted some potential big plays on screens .

Both linebackers played well , but there 's room for improvement , especially in short-yardage situations . <h> Trae Williams and Montre Hartage <h> Grade : C <p> Combined stats : Ten tackles , seven solo , one tackle for loss <p> Williams and Hartage did n't yield up lofty passing numbers as the two Wisconsin quarterbacks combined for only 143 yards . But both young corners were beat on corner routes by playing soft coverage , and struggled sticking with shifty receiver Jazz Peavy ( 4 catches , 73 yards ) . They also failed to register a single pass-defensed in the game , something that Northwestern 's defense ca n't afford happen again as they try to reach bowl eligibility these final three games . <h> Godwin Igwebuike <h> Grade : A- <p> Stats : 10 tackles ( nine solo ) <p> Igwebuike had himself another impressive game , leading the team in tackles and helping Northwestern 's front seven with Wisconsin 's run game .

When Nagel fielded punts , it seemed like he was calling for a fair catch too early , leaving no chance for a return . From our perspective , there was at least one chance for him to gain positive yardage on a kick he ended up fair-catching.

Here are three individual matchups that will be key in Saturday 's game in Columbus between Northwestern and Ohio State . <h> Northwestern 's offensive line vs . Ohio State 's front seven <p> If we 've learned anything from this season of Northwestern football , it 's that this team goes as the offensive line goes . Over its last three games ( all wins ) , Northwestern has tallied 116 points , Clayton Thorson has a quarterback rating of 146.3 , and Justin Jackson and Austin Carr have nine touchdowns between them , and it 's majorly due to the improved play of the offensive line .

Isaiah Prince , J.T. Barrett <p> Odenigbo has been on an absolute tear as of late , recording seven sacks and two forced fumbles over his last three games . Ohio State has only allowed eleven sacks as a team in 2016 , but Barrett being buried six times against Penn State was a huge factor in the Buckeyes being upset on the road last weekend .

Ohio State 's secondary <p> This October has easily been the most efficient stretch of Thorson 's career thus far . His completion percentage for the month is 64.3 percent ( up from his career 54.1 percent rate ) and his only turnover was the ugly first quarter pick six against Michigan State two weeks ago .

Jones and Westbrook have combined for 903 yards receiving so far this season , and have averaged 19.4 and 21.4 yards per reception , respectively .

And there should be plays to be had for the cornerbacks : Indiana quarterback Richard Lagow has thrown nine interceptions in six games this season . But if the status quo continues , the Wildcats might need another big game from the offense to keep up with the Hoosiers . <p> We know that Justin Jackson is the focal point of the Wildcats ' newly explosive offense . The Big Ten 's leading rusher has paced Northwestern 's offense to the tune of the nation 's 11th-rated power success rate and the 38th-most explosive rushing attack . But this week 's matchup wo n't be easy : Indiana ranks 27th in overall rushing S&amp;P+ and 37th in limiting explosive rushing plays .

The offensive must continue to open up holes for Jackson to keep the offense on schedule and on the field . <p> The fourth quarter is important in any football game , but it will be especially important this week . This series has had a history of close games in the past ; seven of the previous nine matchups between the two teams have been decided by seven points or less , including seven straight games from 2002 to 2010 ( the teams did n't play every year ) . This season , the Hoosier offense has been a juggernaut in the fourth quarter , ranking third in the country in fourth quarter offensive S&amp;P+ . The Wildcat defense ranks 95th in the fourth quarter . Northwestern 's defense wore down toward the end of last week 's game , though this was partly due to Tyler O'Connor coming in at quarterback for Michigan State . Rotating defensive linemen will be key in keeping pass-rushers fresh to defend Lagow and the Hoosiers late in the game .

The same goes for Wake Forest , to whom the Hoosiers lost in Week 4 . Against Nebraska , it was a ridiculous defensive gaffe . <p> Against Wake Forest , it was quarterback Richard Lagow throwing five interceptions .

We 're talking the spread offense that head coach Kevin Wilson and offensive coordinator Kevin Johns run . Remember those names ? Wilson coached at Northwestern from 1999 to 2001 with Randy Walker ( coming over with him from Miami of Ohio ) and Johns was in Evanston from 2004-2010 . Their spread has n't been quite as good this year , but with the issues Northwestern has had on the back end , it still poses a major threat . The Hoosiers spread the ball around ; three players " Mitchell Paige , Ricky Jones , Nick Westbrook " have at least 20 catches already . Running back Devine Redding is a tough task to stop , too .

Matthew Harris went down in the fourth quarter to a worrisome head injury , though , and his health is incredibly vital to the success of this group . Overall , the Sky Team was opportunistic today , and that 's a quality they 'll need to embrace in order to thrive with such an inexperienced unit .

This is not your typical FCS cakewalk <p> Illinois State is good . By FCS standards , really good . In 2014 , the Redbirds went 13-1 before falling to FCS powerhouse North Dakota State 29-27 in the National Championship game . Last year , they went 10-3 , and played eventual Big Ten West champion Iowa to a respectable 31-14 game ( though both touchdowns came late in the game ) .

Their strength is the running game <p> Last year , Illinois State ran for an unprecedented 3,044 total yards and rushed for 39 touchdowns . The attack was led by now-graduated Marshaun Coprich , who averaged over 150 yards per game . Coprich may be gone " he was in the New York Giants ' training camp before getting cut " but the dominance on the ground is still there . The Redbirds used a convoy of six running backs to pick up 271 yards and four touchdowns on the ground in their Week 1 opener . George Moreira and Jamal Towns will lead the effort once again , while 6-foot-3 redshirt-sophomore quarterback Jake Kolbe is a bruiser in short yardage situations . This is far from a one-dimensional offense , however . Kolbe threw 19 times in the win over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 1290-yard , 15-touchdown season . Illinois State averaged nearly 35 points per game last year . <h> 3 . Rushing defense will be a good test <p> Northwestern ran over its FCS opponent , Eastern Illinois , last year for 344 yards . Do n't expect it to come that easy against Illinois State . The Redbirds defense held opponents to 3.7 yards per carry , and less than 150 yards per game , last year . They also forced an impressive 20 fumbles last year and then forced two more in their Week 1 victory this season . With Warren Long out with an injury , it will be interesting to see how workhorse running back Justin Jackson teams up with redshirt freshman John Moten and perhaps Auston Anderson against a group that will sell out and stack the box to defend the run . The defense is solid all around , allowing just 130 total yards last week .

So far , Northwestern 's defense ranks 84th nationally in yards per attempt ( 4.7 ) , down from 19th a season ago . The defense has allowed nearly five yards per attempt on first down this season , which has made it tough to force third-and-longs and get off the field .

Its offensive line is struggling , too ! <p> Much has been made of the putrid play of Northwestern 's offensive line in 2016 , but Duke 's has n't been much better . The Blue Devils lost two all-ACC linemen to graduation last season and are still trying to adjust to life with a new center and left guard . The chemistry is n't quite there yet , and it showed in a downright awful performance against Wake Forest .

The Blue Devils actually finished in the top 50 nationally in rushing yards allowed per game last year but lost several starters in the front seven , including leading tackler Dwayne Norman , and appear to have taken a step back in 2016 . Wake Forest ran 49 rushing plays to just 16 passes last Saturday , accumulating 239 yards and 3 touchdowns on almost 5 yards per carry . Duke knew what was coming and still could n't stop it .

@@97968403 @2168403/ <h> Five reasons to be pessimistic about Northwestern football <h> Why be optimistic when being negative is just so much fun ? <p> The weeks leading up to football season are always a time of looking forward to the impending season with hope and optimism . However , it also a good time to temper expectations , which is exactly what we 're going to do today . It 's time to embrace our Northwestern fandom and be realistic about the upcoming season . <p> Here are five reasons to be pessimistic about the 2016 campaign . <h> 1 . October <p> You 've heard a lot about Northwestern 's schedule in the month of October during our preparation for the season and that 's no coincidence , it 's really difficult . The Wildcats play the reigning Big Ten West Champions ( Iowa ) , the reigning Big Ten Champions ( Michigan State ) , the 2014 National Champs ( Ohio State ) and Indiana all in a single month . The first three of those listed are on the road . <p> Iowa has reversed the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kinnick Stadium is guaranteed to be a hostile environment , much like East Lansing will be when Northwestern pays a visit to Michigan State . The Spartans have n't played the Wildcats since 2013 ( where they won 30-6 at Ryan Field ) and Mark Dantonio 's group is always an inspired bunch . Indiana should have yet another explosive offense under Kevin Wilson and a shootout would not favor this Northwestern team . Ohio State is Ohio State , a team the Wildcats have n't beaten since 2004 . Northwestern 's last win in The Horseshoe was gulpin 1971 , three years before head coach Pat Fitzgerald was born . There 's a pretty good chance that Northwestern goes 1-3 , or even winless over this stretch . Of those four games , the team will only be favored against Indiana . <h> 2 . Wide Receiver Uncertainty <p> Who is Clayton Thorson going to throw to ? That was one of the team 's biggest problem last season , and until we actually see players physically catching passes in game , it still is . A matchup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't definitively know who the second receiver on the team is . Austin Carr will be number one and Solomon Vault will hold things down inside along with Marcus McShepherd ( who can stretch the field on the outside as well ) , but both guys are still adjusting to their new position . On top of that , there are plenty of questions regarding the second outside receiver . Right now it 's between redshirt freshman Charlie Fessler and sophomore Flynn Nagel . Only the latter saw action last year before a season-ending injury . They might be a big improvement over last year , or we might see growing pains . <p> Honestly , we may see every single scholarship wide receiver on the field at some point against Western Michigan . That 's the level of uncertainty surrounding this position . We know Fitz does n't like to burn his freshmen 's redshirts , but he will if he has to . Riley Lees , Ramaud Chiaokhiao-Bowman , and Ben Skowronek are all intriguing yet unproven options . In 2015 , Northwestern receivers had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trend continues , it 's going to be a rough year for Clayton Thorson and the offense. <h> 3 . Defensive Turnover <p> Northwestern 's 2015 defense was otherworldly . Ranked fifth in the nation in defense S&amp;P+ ratings , the unit was led by Dean Lowry and Deonte Gibson up front , All-American Anthony Walker up the middle and the Sky Team in the back . The only problem is that a lot of the difference makers from last season are gone . Lowry , Gibson , corner Nick VanHoose , safety Traveon Henry and linebacker Drew Smith have left some big shoes to fill for this defense . Five starters is a lot of turnover . Does Northwestern have the depth to replace the 12 sacks and 26 tackles for a loss that Lowry and Gibson contributed ? What about the 5 interceptions and 17 pass breakups from VanHoose and Henry ? <p> Now , with the injury to number two corner Keith Watkins II , the depth issue is only heightened . Unproven sophomore Montre Hartage will have to step in opposite Matt Harris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alonzo Mayo and Trae Williams will be thrown into the fire , and true freshman Roderick Campbell could see the field as a nickel corner . It will be very hard to fill the void left by current NFLers Lowry and Gibson , but Ifeadi Odenigbo and Xavier Washington will need to show improved consistency in the trenches . Redshirt freshmen Joe Gaziano and Trent Goens will have to contribute as well . Replicating the success of the 2015 defense essentially hinges on guys who were role players or non-factors last year stepping up . If that does n't happen or another impact player like Watkins II goes down with an injury , the defense will predictably drop off . <h> 4 . Lack of B1G Home Games <p> In 2015 , Northwestern only had three Big Ten road games ( because Soldier Field does n't count ; sorry Illinois ) and zero consecutive games on the road . This year , the Wildcats have five road games in eight weeks , including trips to Iowa City , East Lansing and Columbus . Ross-Ade Stadium has n't struck fear into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB Nation guru Bill Connelly writes that Purdue has a 39% win probability against Northwestern . To put that into perspective , Northwestern is being given a 38% win probability when they travel to TCF Bank Stadium to take on Minnesota in mid-November . That 's daunting . <p> Sandwiched between all those road games is a bye , homecoming against Indiana , and Wisconsin . To make matters worse , two of Northwestern 's home games ( Nebraska and Wisconsin ) will seem like a neutral environment with the amount of red in the stands . In fairness , the Wildcats walked out of both Lincoln and Madison with huge wins in 2015 , and there was nothing neutral about either of those environments . At the very least , we know Thorson 's going to get a lot of use out of his silent count this year . <h> 5 . The Ghost of 2013 <p> We 've seen this show somewhere before : Northwestern coming off a 10-win season with tons of momentum . The Wildcats play Western Michigan in non-conference , Iowa at Kinnick and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talking about 2016 , I 'm describing the exact situation heading into 2013 . Even the non-conference games line up . <p> Northwestern took care of Western Michigan with ease ( they play Western Michigan again in 2016 ) , cruised past FCS Maine ( Illinois State in 2016 ) , beat fellow academically-strong counterpart in 2013 Cal ( Duke in 2016 ) and handled a solid Syracuse team a year after beating them by one-point at Syracuse ( Northwestern beat Nebraska in Lincoln by just two ) . The 2013 team started the year 4-0 . College Gameday came to Evanston . Undefeated and top-5 Ohio State came to town . You know the rest of the story . <p> It 's unlikely that Northwestern will repeat the spectacular failure that was the 2013 season , but it 's not impossible . History always has a way of repeating itself . Tough schedule , some injuries and suddenly the memories might start flooding back .

The team will be in Evanston for a week and then head up to Kenosha , Wisconsin , for a grueling week of workouts and practices in the summer heat , a time for the team to come together on and off the field . Kenosha will go a long way in determining who wins key position battles , who ends up where on the depth chart and much , much more . It 's the equivalent of NFL training camp , except compressed into about one week . We count down the biggest questions " two per day " facing Pat Fitzgerald 's team heading into camp . <p> The weight of reviving Northwestern 's stagnant receiving corps will fall heavily upon the shoulders of Austin Carr . He will enter Kenosha as one of the most experienced and the top returning wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team in receiving yards to Dan Vitale , who is now a pro . He has risen from walk-on to No. 1 receiver . <p> But for Northwestern 's offense to truly improve next season , it appears that Carr will have to take one step further and become a true top target for Clayton Thorson . Despite his fine season last year , Carr only caught 18 passes , which is not even two per game . Sure , Northwestern did not throw the ball very much , but with Dan Vitale and Christian Jones gone , Carr will simply have to have a bigger role in Northwestern 's offense . Let 's look at the tape and try to find out what he brings . <p> This was Austin Carr 's first catch of the 2015 season . It 's a relatively simple 17-yard completion , but as you know , 17-yard completions were few and far between last season . Yes , the play is against Eastern Illinois , but this play is a perfect example of what Austin Carr will have to do in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " safety blanket " role that Dan Vitale played last year . When Thorson is scrambling and looking downfield , Carr will be the first receiver he looks at . In this example , Thorson does a good job extending the play and keeping his eyes downfield , and Carr finds a soft spot in the coverage . Later on , we 'll see that Carr was exceptional at moving the chains . <h> Clayton Thorson pass complete to Austin Carr for 44 yds and a TD <h> Clayton Thorson pass complete to Austin Carr for 25 yds and a TD <p> These are Austin Carr 's two touchdowns from 2015 . In the first play , he shows good agility and awareness , and he easily evades the admittedly poor Eastern Illinois defense for the touchdown . The 25-yard pass against Ball State was just a great throw from Thorson , and Carr 's ability to get open down the sideline is exactly what Northwestern will need in 2016 . Carr burns Ball State cornerback Darius Conaway and makes an easy catch down the sideline . The line gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully develop his route . By the time Thorson decides to pull the trigger , it 's already far too late for any Ball State defender to recover . <p> Unfortunately , this was Carr 's final touchdown of the 2015 season . Carr " like most of his fellow receivers " just was not a factor in the red zone throughout 2015 . To be fair , Northwestern rarely threw the ball in the red zone and was also awful at converting possessions into touchdowns " three redzone touchdown passes ( and just 16 touchdowns total ) in 40 redzone trips . Of course , it 's a chicken-or-the-egg approach . Was the scheme conservative because of the personnel , or was the personnel unable to execute the scheme ? Regardless , the wide receivers need to improve , especially when it comes to winning one-on-one redzone battles . <p> Carr 's best asset is his ability to create timely , relatively big plays , even though he 's not the type of receiver who will out-muscle or out-run a defensive back to the ball or make highlight reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still Northwestern 's most explosive wide receiver last season ( by IsoPPP ) by a large margin and also its most successful . Carr is 6-foot-1 and relies on his agility and route-running to get open . He has good hands . That 's why I think his ideal role is as a possession receiver who can occasionally make big plays downfield when he needs to . He 's not going to be a great red zone target or become a true deep threat . Someone else will probably have to step up to perform those tasks unless he 's reading this article and becomes hell-bent on proving me wrong . <p> Does that mean he ca n't be Northwestern 's No. 1 receiver ? No , he definitely still can be . <p> This is a play where I think Carr 's potential as a really good short-yardage , high-efficiency receiver shines through . Northwestern runs a successful bubble screen off a play fake and is able to get Carr the ball in the open field . That 's Carr 's wheelhouse , and he runs for a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota was clearly expecting a run on this play ( can you blame them ? ) , with only two defenders guarding the three receivers . Carr is left with acres of space . <p> The problem with this whole idea of Carr 's ideal role as a possession receiver who can work in space is that Northwestern never had the opportunity to play to Carr 's strengths in 2015 . How many times did Northwestern have a second-and-short ? How many times did Northwestern call for a pass on second and short ? I do n't have the exact numbers , but I 'm going to make a reasonably safe assumption and say that did not happen often . The situation that occurred above against Minnesota happened rarely for Northwestern . The Wildcats were 127th ( second to last ) in the nation in yards per pass and 93rd in yards per rush . Yikes . Usually , teams can get yardage on first down and open up the playbook on second and short . Usually , teams can extend drives and sometimes threaten deep using players like Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep defenses on their feet and few second-and-short opportunities , combined with Mick McCall 's already-conservative playcalling , Carr 's opportunities were limited . <p> However , when the Wildcats were ahead of the chains and willing to dial up the deep ball , Carr showed he could take advantage of any slight defensive mistake . Below , the linebackers and safeties tense up for a split second on the play-action , allowing Carr an easy release downfield . He beats now-NFL safety Clayton Fejedelem and shows impressive giddy-up running by him . <p> But where Carr excelled last year was as a third down chain-mover . Of his 18 catches , 16 of them went for first downs ( counting touchdowns as first downs ) . Here are a coupe examples . He knows where the sticks are and gets past them . <p> Of course , if Carr is utilized as more of a specialized receiver than an all-around target , that means he 's going to have to take a beating . He has never had health issues in his career , but he 's also never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwestern also has n't had the best luck at keeping wide receivers on the field ( see Jones , Christian ) , which worries me . Hopefully Carr can make the most of his increased workload and stay healthy in 2016 . <p> Northwestern should use Carr more because he brings dependability and shiftiness on offense that nobody else on the roster has at the moment . I do n't blame him much for Northwestern 's offensive dysfunction last year , and he was probably underutilized and misused during 2015 . While he definitely does not have tremendous upside , Northwestern does n't need tremendous upside right now . Northwestern needs a functional offense that can give some relief to its fantastic defensive unit . Austin Carr can help build a functional offense , whether it 's as a safety blanket , a go-to guy or , on occasion , a guy who can stretch the field . On that basis alone , Carr is ready to become Northwestern 's No. 1 receiver for 2016.

@@97968441 @2168441/ <h> The game in Happy Valley is key for Big Ten Tournament seeding . <p> The last time Northwestern faced Penn State , it was n't pretty . In fact , it might have been the ugliest offensive game of Northwestern 's season . The Wildcats shot just 39 precent overall , including 3-for-26 from three ( and 0-for-12 in the first half ) , and struggled overall in an 71-62 defeat . <p> So what has to change ? <h> Three-point shooting <p> Well , for one thing , the shooting absolutely must improve .

So from behind that line , Tre Demps ca n't go 2-of-8 , Aaron Falzon 1-of-9 , and Bryant McIntosh and Scottie Linsey each 0-of-3 . <p> Luckily , the Wildcats should be feeling confident about their outside stroke after lighting up Rutgers for 17-of-28 shooting from downtown .

Still , when the Wildcats have open looks , they must hit them . If they do n't , it 'll be another struggle . <h> Pick-and-roll <p> Another key will be the pick-and-roll game . McIntosh beat Wisconsin nearly singlehandedly coming off ball screens . He scored 28 points ( on just 19 shots ) and picked up 5 assists . Wisconsin threw different looks at NU 's catalyst , but he could not be stopped . <p> The very next game against Penn State though , the sophomore point guard scored just 12 points on 15 shots .

The senior center also played his best game since December in last week 's loss at Michigan . <p> Olah played just seven minutes in the first meeting between Penn State and Northwestern , his first game back from a stress fracture in his foot .

Once again , the Wildcats had a very poor first quarter , shooting 12 percent from the field and scoring only 8 points .

" Defensively we just broke down at the wrong place , wrong time , " head coach Joe McKeown said in his WNUR postgame interview . " They made us pay , we just had meltdowns on defense . " The 77 points scored by DePaul are the most Northwestern has given up all season . <p> As far as playing time goes , all five starters played 30-plus minutes with the only difference being that Lydia Rohde was one of those five starters .

All of the flaws the Wildcats were able to hide against lesser opponents were exposed by a very good DePaul team .

Not in a menacing way of course , but in a way that commands attention . His mere presence catches the eye . <p> His long strides carry him across campus " to class ; to his dorm ; to the gym ; to social events ; to the beach ; to the shuttle that takes him to the athletic facilities .

He welcomes the popularity . <p> " Being on campus , meeting so many people , " he says casually , " it 's pretty neat . " <p> Alex Olah , Northwestern 's big man on campus in more ways than one , is living the life . <p> *** <p> For Alex Olah , the story begins in Timisoara , a fairly large city in western Romania near the Serbian border . Born into what he describes as a low-middle class family , his upbringing was modest . It was n't a life of romantic European luxury . In fact , he says , many of his meals growing up came from the garden in his backyard . <p> But when discussing his childhood , Olah is quick to turn to sports . Even with basketball yet to enter his life , he was a competitor from a young age . <p> " Soccer was my first sport , " Olah says . " And then I tried a bunch of others like tennis , European handball , judo , volleyball , swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing as a team And then finally , in eighth grade , I started playing basketball . " <p> And from there , his ascension was rapid . Before he knew it , he was being named to all-star teams , receiving awards , and being watched by club coaches . " I said to myself , " Olah recalls , " oh , this might end up somewhere . ' " <p> Soon enough , he was playing for the Romanian national team at his age level . " I won gold medals , and MVPs , " he says . " And I saw a future in this . " <p> But even with the success , 15-year-old Alex Olah , who lived alone in an apartment during his freshman and sophomore years of high school , was still a bit unsure of himself . " I was a shy guy , " he says . " Really soft . Really skinny . I did n't know much about basketball , I had only played for two or three years . " <p> But when Bill Carmody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the jump . " I got the opportunity to come here to the States , " he says , " and I saw this as a big step . " <p> *** <p> " When I came to America , " Olah says , " I did n't know anybody . Literally nobody . I enjoyed spending time with my host family , and just going to school . I just pretty much focused on basketball and school the whole time . " <p> It was n't the first transition of Alex Olah 's life , nor would it be the last . But the move from Romania to the U.S. was probably the biggest . Even just the language barrier by itself might make it so . <p> And according to Kale Abrahamson , one of Olah 's best friends over the past two years , when the big Romanian showed up in Evanston , first for his official visit and then to begin his freshman year , timidity still lingered . " I mean , he could n't speak much English at that point , " Abrahamson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more shy , and was n't as confident with it . He was pretty quiet . " <p> " Even back home in Romania , I was always the guy in the shadow , " Olah says . " I was always doing small work . I was doing it well , but I was never too famous . People in the basketball world knew me , but other guys , they had no idea who I was . Coming here , I did n't expect anybody to know me . I just said , I 'm going to come here , play basketball , go to school , and do the best I can to represent Northwestern . " <p> But , while he says the transition to the college life was smooth , the transition on the basketball court was less so . Early in his freshman season , Olah realized that he was unprepared . <p> " I was afraid , " he says . " It took a little bit to adjust . Playing in Indiana in high school , it was n't very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against as competition . I was almost afraid to be too physical . So that did n't help me . " <p> To say his freshman season did n't go as planned would be a euphemism . With a 7-foot frame and impressive high school statistics come expectations . Whether those expectations were realistic or fair can be debated . But whether they were met in year one can not be . <p> In 2012-13 , Olah only twice scored more than 10 points in a game , and never pulled down double-digit rebounds in a single 40 minutes . His offensive rating dwindled at 88.8 and his effective field goal percentage was an underwhelming 42.3 . His season , as fans and media alike would 've told you , was less than stellar . <p> Throughout the year , frustration was discernable . According to Abrahamson , on multiple occasions , Olah would let his discontent with his performances stick with him long after games . And Olah admits his attitude was n't ideal . <p> After a bad game , Olah 's morale , and thus his confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teammates , " he says . " I let them down , and that kind of brought me down . And then in practice , I was not as competitive . " <p> " He doubted himself , " coach Chris Collins said in early May when he and father Doug spoke at Northwestern . " He was under a lot of criticism , and he 's not an overly confident kid . " <p> Interestingly , Abrahamson attributes some of this to external factors . " I think a lot of the situations that were going on , and a lot of the stuff that was out of his control contributed to his lack of confidence . And a lot of people as well . " When asked to clarify , Abrahamson says , " I do n't even want to get into it . " But he maintains that this was n't just Olah 's problem . <p> But regardless of those situations , Olah carried high expectations for himself , and came away disappointed . " I was not very satisfied with my season , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> *** <p> When Alex Olah walked into his new boss 's office for the first time last offseason , he was n't there to endear himself in whatever way possible . He had n't come to flatter his new coach , a former star at Duke , or to engender a false first impression . He came with a simple message . <p> " I told him , " Olah says , " Hey coach , I know you 're great and I just want to be good . I want to be the best big guy in the Big Ten , and I just want to be coached . I want you to show me the way . ' " <p> According to Olah , Collins , the new boss , responded affirmatively . " He said , Yes , let 's do it . I 'm going to push you every day . If I see you 're not doing well , I 'm going to yell at you " and it 's not personal , it 's just because I want you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light-hearted , even goofy side of Alex Olah . But behind the scenes , he 's serious . He 's a competitor . He 's intense . He 's even fiery . " In practices , " Abrahamson says , " if he 's getting fouled a lot or something , he 'll shove people off of him . No one wants to mess with him if you see that certain look he gets in his eye . It 's that Romanian fury . " <p> At the heart of Olah 's transformation has been a competitive drive , and an urge to succeed . It has manifested itself in many ways , not the least of which was that conversation with Collins . But it 's also much more than that . <p> Behind the scenes , that urge surfaces on a regular basis . It surfaces at team practices at Welsh-Ryan Arena in November . It surfaces at Big Ten arenas throughout the Midwest in February . But perhaps most importantly , it surfaced with consistency last offseason , and continues to do so this offseason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Collins said . " On a daily basis , he was in there watching film , just working hard . " Abrahamson also says he bore witness to just how dedicated Olah was to bettering himself as a player . <p> Olah 's offseason work is multifarious , strenuous , and time-consuming . A big theme is physical fitness " losing weight , gaining muscle . " I knew I had to gain a lot of muscle to compete , " he says . He 's even been doing morning workouts with the football team to improve his conditioning . <p> On the court , he works extensively with coach Brian James on his skill set in the post . He also takes the floor alone to work on his shooting " including , as fans will love to hear , his 3-point shooting . And he 'll even play pickup with students on campus , where he 's been known to call the occasional isolation for himself , or get a rebound , go coast to coast , and finish with a euro step at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumes up to five or six hours of his day . " So yeah , I have a busy schedule , " he says . But he clearly understands that the busier the schedule now , the better the results next winter and beyond . <p> *** <p> Soon after Olah expressed his desire to Collins , he once again stepped into his head coach 's office after a workout . This time , it was Collins who had a message for his starting center . It went something like this : <p> " Olah , every time you wake up in the morning , I want you to look in the mirror and tell yourself , I 'm a beast . ' " <p> " Just from that , " Olah says , " first I laughed . But then I saw he was serious , and I was like , Okay , well ' So every time I see him , I always say , Hey , I 'm a beast . ' " <p> " That was huge for him , " Abrahamson says . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . Because he is a beast , and he needs a coach that has confidence in him and wants him to be that . " <p> It 's no coincidence that Olah 's improvement overlapped with the appointment of Collins as head coach . Collins understands Olah " he understands who he naturally is as a person , and he understand what he needs to be successful . <p> " When I first got here , " Collins said , " I could sense he was insecure about his game . Especially for bigger guys , the power of confidence and belief in yourself is crucial . " <p> Throughout his life , and during his freshman year , it was n't necessarily that Olah 's confidence was perpetually low . But it was excessively prone to prolonged recessions . He would let an off-game gnaw away at him mentally , hindering his performance for days thereafter . But now , both Olah and his peers recognize that everything has changed . <p> " I 'm just going to walk in and be the best big guy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And of course my confidence goes up when I have a good game . But if I have a bad game , it still stays the same . I just learn from it , and move forward . <p> " I just know I can compete against anybody . I know I can be a big part of this team . And just by being cocky and confident , I make my teammates even more confident and make them trust me even more . And that helps a lot . Before , I was not doing this , and that was bad . But now , it gives me confidence in everything , and makes me play better . " <p> Abrahamson says that Olah 's new mentality and his newfound confidence have been easily discernible since last season . " Everybody has seen how much better he 's played , " he says , " and how much more confident he 's been as a result of that . And the confidence led to even more success , so it 's a snowball effect . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive effect that the new coaching staff has had . Their commitment to him from a basketball perspective has been exemplary too . And as anybody around the program will point out , much of the credit goes to assistant coach Brian James . <p> When asked what James has done for him , Olah says , " I mean , what did n't he do for me ? He did everything . He 's been great . He 's always willing to help me , make me a better player . He 's always there for me . He 's coached a bunch of pro guys , so just having so much patience with me , and guiding me through everything , it 's really helped . He 's a really good mentor . " <p> James has had a distinguished coaching career . After coaching Chris Collins in high school at Glenbrook North , he went on to become a top NBA assistant during a tenure that spanned 17 years and 5 teams , including , most recently , the Philadelphia 76ers , where he was Doug Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NBA scout for Seattle . <p> When he signed on to join his former high school pupil at Northwestern , he had one principal task : transform Alex Olah . And he 's done everything he can to do so . <p> This past year , Abrahamson says he noticed a distinct difference in Olah 's on-court work . " And I do n't think it was anything with Olah 's work ethic changing , " he says . " It was that the coaching staff 's work ethic changed . Coach James had a plan : I 'm going to work you hard . ' And that was huge for Olah , having someone that always wanted to push him . " <p> Olah is quick to shoot down any suggestions that Bill Carmody and his staff hindered his development , or did n't do enough for him as a player . But he 's enthusiastic about everything that has transpired this past year . And he hails his relationship with Collins . <p> Whereas Carmody maybe kept everything to a traditional coach-player relationship " " it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Collins ' outstanding attributes is his ability to seemingly connect to his players , both as individuals and as a group . And that 's been vital for Olah . <p> " But now , " he says , " every time I eat at a dining hall , there 's somebody saying , Oh , you 're Alex Olah , it 's so cool to see you . ' Or if I go to some event on campus and people see me , they recognize me . It 's cool kind of being a celebrity . " <p> Yes , Alex Olah self-identifies as a celebrity . And what 's more , he acts like it . Abrahamson , who spends more time with him than anybody , says his friend is not mistaken . " I 'm like his bouncer , " Abrahamson says . " And we 're not trying to be cocky about it , but we 'll show up at a gathering , and girls will be like Oh my god , can I take a picture with you ! ? ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been unimaginable . But Olah 's transformation on the court has gone hand in hand with a transformation away from it as well . <p> " As the season went on , " Collins said , " I just saw the way he started walking around . He had his chest up a little more , and he was a little cockier . <p> " On the court , he started hitting threes , and making three signals , and it was like , He 's getting it . He 's getting there . ' " <p> Asked if he 's cocky now , Olah laughs , and says , " Yeah , I guess . You know , I think I had a pretty good season this past season , and that really boosted my confidence even more . " <p> Unlike at big state schools , at Northwestern , not many athletes are able to achieve celebrity status . Sports do n't hold the same lofty status in the minds of students , and therefore big-time athletes are n't as revered " especially quiet ones from Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally , his height , but also the way he carries himself , and his newfound swagger and self-belief " that have given him a certain charm in the eyes of the student body . And after living a pedestrian life for so long , Olah is relishing his time in the spotlight . <p> *** <p> Success . <p> It 's a relative word , and one that is loosely defined . But in many cases , you know it when you see it . <p> In 2013-14 , Alex Olah had success . <p> Stats back up the claim . His offensive rating jumped by more than 12 points to 101.2 , his effective field goal percentage by nearly 11 points to 53.2 , and his block rate of 6.4 ranked in the top 130 nationally . <p> He especially made great strides on the defensive end .

Stagnancy wo n't be acceptable . More progression is expected . <p> And Olah is fully aware of that . In fact , he 's thinking even bigger . He does n't stop at wanting to be the best big man in the Big Ten . Olah aspires to play in the NBA .

I just do n't have that with 90% of the ACC yet . <p> Come to think of it : <p> 2008 : A strong NU team plays a down Cuse team in a season-opener and wins handily . <h> GREG PAULUS . <p> Mike Williams , who gets kicked off the team a few weeks later , has 209 yards receiving , and spoils a day where Mike Kafka had 390 yards passing , plus a receiving touchdown . NU loses on a last-second field goal , and finishes with eight wins instead of nine . <p> 2012 : Northwestern goes up 35-13 thanks to a fluky scoop-and-score and a fluky long fumble return and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards to lead the Orange to a 41-35 lead . Which gets erased by Trevor Siemian , playing for a hurt Kain Colter , hitting Demetrius Fields for a game-winning touchdown with a minute to go . There is a late hit call thanks to Siemian 's out-of-bounds embellishment skills probably costs the Orange the game by turning a third-and-long into a first-and-goal . <p> So , yeah , kind of reasons for football hate . <h> Swagger jackers <p> The movie The Express told the story of Ernie Davis , the legendary running back who became the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy before tragically passing away months after graduating from Syracuse . Here 's a clip from that movie ! <p> Wait , something about that stadium looks familiar ... The way the entrances to the stadium appear ... the lightbulb-heavy scoreboard jutting up from atop a section of stands ... wait a minute , THAT 'S RYAN FIELD YOU JERKS . As you can see more clearly here , Northwestern 's stadium was used for filming in the football scenes of The Express . Since Syracuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmers had to look for a stadium that looked reasonably crappy and outdated enough that even in 2008 , it looked like it could have been used during an era when black people had to use different water fountains . One of them saw Ryan Field and thought " THAT 'S IT ! " and CGI made it into the Cotton Bowl and Archbold as well as other stadiums . In other clips , it 's easier to see the distinctive curvature of the west stands . <p> Also , what 's up with the Northwestern striping on your jerseys , bros ? <h> NOBODY TALKS BAD ABOUT THE WOMEN 'S LACROSSE TEAM <p> Take a step back and think about another area in which Northwestern University revealed itself to be a cowardly , cheap institution full of athletes and coaches who play sports in the most unfulfilling , unentertaining and unfair way possible .

It happened in two games . The first , a two-point win over North Florida and the second , a one-point overtime win over Elon . The Wildcats struggled in both games . They often looked lost on defense and scattered and disorganized on offense . The spacing was n't there . The pick-and-rolls were n't working as effectively as they had .

Eventually , Chris Collins countered and went small with either Gavin Skelly or Sanjay Lumpkin at the five . With those lineups , the Wildcats were able to eek out a victory . <p> Against Elon , though , the Wildcats were up against a schematic difference that they had n't faced . And for most of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept the Wildcats from using their bread-and-butter set effectively . <p> Elon countered Northwestern 's pick-and-rolls by trapping the ball-handler after the coming around the screen . And it led to a bunch of turnovers and frustration that took Northwestern out of any offensive rhythm . <p> After JerShon Cobb uses Alex Olah 's screen , Elon 's defenders immediately blitz Cobb and trapping him out near mid-court . The biggest fault here is Olah just turning and sprinting toward the rim . He leaves Cobb all alone and unable to do anything . Luckily , Cobb is able to lob a dangerous pass to Vic Law in the corner to escape the trap . <p> Whether it was Cobb , McIntosh , Tre Demps or another ball-handler , Northwestern often seemed confused and disgruntled when facing this blitzing scheme . <p> When that happens , the screener needs to become available as an outlet for the ball-handler . <p> Concerning how little McIntosh can do after being trapped off PRs .

That was an encouraging sign for the Wildcats early in the contest . <p> Later in the game , Northwestern was able to work the high post to use the four-on-three advantage inside . <p> Olah , again , pops instead of rolls , allowing an avenue for Johnnie Vassar to escape the trap . Once Olah gets the ball , Vic Law ducks to the rim and Olah makes a decisive pass to find him . <p> Those last two plays are how you beat a trapping scheme like Elon 's . <p> In previous games , it was better for McIntosh and other ball-handlers to keep their dribble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . But when facing a defense like Elon 's , being able to retreat , see the floor and attack when the offense has the advantage is imperative .

Which is kinda awesome . <p> It 's awesome on several fronts . First off , I hate Adidas . Always have , most likely always will . It stems from the fact that in high school I paid more attention than I really should to basketball sneakers , and Adidas ' are always miles uglier than NIke 's , and while Nike programs have players rocking Jordans in games , Northwestern was stuck with those ugly white-on-purple-striped Adidas things that I would honestly protest wearing if I was on the team . I genuinely dislike the concept that every damn item of Adidas clothing has to have three stripes hidden on it somewhere - look at the side of Northwestern 's basketball uniforms , guh - and am glad to be rid of it . <p> Under Armour , on the other hand , is awesome . People like wearing it . They have kickass ad campaigns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without the inherent sarcasm .

Maybe , just maybe , Northwestern will do that as well . Until then , we 'll follow , with daily updates.The majority of these schools - in fact , probably all of them - do n't have bloggers . For a couple weeks , I 'm taking them under my wing . <p> This post features the list of the 52 schools , as well as which ones are in action today . <p> Three tourney-less bros kick off their tourney runs today . Things look ... well , bleak . None of the three earned above a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourney rules , all three will be on the road . Which is bad . <p> Something High Point has going for them : The name is pretty optimistic . You could say this is the high point of their season , eh ? ( i wish i was dead ) <p> Some things High Point distinctly does not have going for them : They have no signature wins , lost to Liberty twice , and the last game of their regular season was a loss to Gardner-Webb ( wait for more about them ) , the No. 8 team in the conference , by a score of 64-40 in a 65 possession game . That 's not a good offense . <p> Reasons to irrationally hate Liberty : The school was founded by Jerry Falwell , who by all indications is a racist jerk , was so bad that Seth Curry went " man , going here is probably worse than going to Duke " , and convinced Drew Crawfordonce upon a time that shooting a lot was a good idea . They also named their school after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Jerks . <p> Something Gardner-Webb has going for them : First off , hyphens . Second off there 's one team G-Dub has a chance of knocking off , it 's Coastal Carolina : Coastal Carolina has had a phenomenal year , after early losses to an equally good College of Charleston team and Georgetown , they ran off 22 straight wins . However , when the Bulldogs went to ... wherever Coastal Carolina is on February 15 , they left with one of the less likely victories in all college hoops this year : a 59-57 win over the Chants , ruining their hopes of a perfect conference slate . In their other matchup , Lil Webbie also pushed CC to the limit , losing by a slim margin of 58-55 . They have to hope lightning strikes for a third time , enabling them to place close with a significantly better team . <p> Something they do n't have going for them : They probably should n't be in the conference tournament to begin with : top eight teams from the Big South make the tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member Presbyterian - go Blue Hose ! - was ineligible to make the tournament . <p> Reason to irrationally hate Coastal Carolina : Even the dude who was like " hey , we should name our teams ' the Chanticleers ' " was clearly doing so for no good reason . Chanticleer comes from the French for " sing clear " and is apparently a rooster . Also , " North " and " South " are the only two acceptable Carolinas . Jerks . <p> Something Youngstown State has going for them : The film " March of the Penguins " won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . They also had a very improbable win against Butler and took Valpo to OT . <p> Some things Youngstown State does not have going for them : This game is on the road , at Valpo . Youngstown State 's road record : 0-13 . ( In their defense , they were 9-8 at home . Not bad ! They will not have any more home games this year . ) <p> Reasons to irrationally hate Valparaiso : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge game-winner yes , then parlayed that into a brief ( and completely undeserved ) NBA career and now a gig as an assistant coach for Valpo . <p> So that 's that for today . Now on to the list . I 'll divide it every day into three groups : In the tournament , still alive , and done for the season.Obviously , no teams are in the tournament yet . So we just have two categories - for today , and today only , I 'll give a brief explanation for the teams that are done . As far as I can tell , this is the only list on the internet of the teams never to make the NCAA tournament , so , enjoy it . <p> Remember , last year , this post was called " the 55 " : Wofford and Arkansas-Pine Bluff made the tourney , meaning they left the club . And Winston-Salem dropped down to D-II , so they 're also out , because this only refers to current D-I schools . I do n't believe any additional schools became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional schools . <p> And yes , any of these teams could hypothetically get at-large bids . But it 's unbloody likely . <p> Centenary Gentlemen , Summit . Double whammy for the Gents : the first reason they do n't qualify for this year 's tourney is that they were last in the Summit , where only the top eight teams make the tourney . The second is that this is Centenary 's final year at the Division I level , meaning they wo n't take place in any postseason play , including the conference or NCAA Tourney . Sadly , that also means that even if no team makes the NCAA Tournament from this list , NU will lose a member from its club : Centenary is waving the white flag and receding to Division III without ever going dancing . Somewhere , Robert Parish weeps . Somewhere , Robert Parish weeps hard . <p> Western Illinois Leathernecks , Summit . Yeah , they placed better than Centenary , but they were still ninth in a conference that needed you to finish top eight to make the tourney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centenary 's only win in a 1-17 conference season was against Western Illinois . You guessed it . <p> Stetson Hatters , Atlantic Sun : Eight teams make the A-Sun tourney . The Hatters have a lot to be mad about , as they were in a three-way tie for eighth , of which two teams - Campbell and no-tourney bro Kennesaw State - made the conference tourney . Reason : Campbell was 8-22 , Stetson , 8-23 . That 'll teach you to schedule that extra game ( when you are n't very good . ) <p> Florida Gulf Coast Eagles , Atlantic Sun : They 're a provisional member of the conference , so even though they finished seventh , therefore better than Stetson could muster and therefore worthy of a conference tournament bid provided to the top eight teams , they were n't allowed to participate in the tourney . <p> USC-Upstate Spartans , Atlantic Sun : Actually the exact same scenario , except USC-Upstate finished last in the A-Sun . Yes , worse than Stetson . <p> Sacramento State Hornets , Big Sky : It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams , the top six make the conference tourney , instead of just having an 8-9 play-in game . It seems especially silly to Sacramento State , who is currently in a tie for eighth with no hopes of getting to sixth in their final regular season game . <p> Sacred Heart Pioneers , NEC : For the second consecutive year , the Pioneers pioneered their way to tenth place - they needed it to be top eight to make a conference tourney . <p> Jacksonville State Gamecocks , OVC : The Gamecocks are not as good as the no-tourney bros on the UT-Martin Skyhawks , who booked an 8-seed to the OVC . Out of eight . Jacksonville State finished the year a pitiful 5-25 , good for last in the conference . <p> Central Arkansas Bears , Southland : The fact that my first ever college basketball game featured Scottie Pippen 's alma mater was n't enough to keep them from being deadlast in the Southland for a second straight year , which is weird , because I 'm pretty certain Southland sounds like a cop TV show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it 's impressive they went 1-13 and did n't get into the conference tourney . <p> Great West schools : The Great West is probably the second-worst conference in the nation . Thank goodness for the SWAC . Anyway , since it 's a contrived hodgepodge of formerly independent schools ranging from New Jersey ( note : not in the west ) to North Dakota , the NCAA considers it a provisional conference in basketball . That means no bid to the NCAA tournament . The CIT , the uber-crappy fourth-best postseason tournament that does n't allow bids to major conference schools , said that the Great West 's winner gets an auto bid as an attempt at legitimacy . But that 's dumb . And since North and South Dakota have both promised to move on to , you know , conferences that get you into the NCAA 's , I 'd doubt this conference ever earns an auto bid . ( And none of them have an RPI higher than 255 , so , at-large , yeah , not happening . ) <p> Texas Pan-American Broncos Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighting Sioux , Great West <p> South Dakota Coyotes , Great West <p> Utah Valley State Wolverines , Great West <p> Chicago State Cougars , Great West <p> Independents : Tough to get into the NCAA when there 's literally no possibility of you getting an autobid and when your schedule is a hodgepodge of other independent schools , and no independent school has an RPI over 264 . Also , when nobody good plays for your school because it 's independent .

No. 1 Maryland vs No. 4 Northwestern from Lakeside Field in Evanston . This will be the conference opener for not just these teams , but for the entire conference . The Big Ten has reached into lacrosse , and they could n't have picked a much better game to kick it off . <p> Maryland enters the game as the unanimous top ranked team in women 's lacrosse . The Terps are 9-0 this year , they 're riding a 19-game winning streak dating back to last season , and , oh yeah , they 're the defending national champs . Maryland brings back last year 's Tewaaraton Award winner in Taylor Cummings , who leads the team in goals , assists , points , shots , ground balls , draw controls , and caused turnovers . So yeah , she 's a decent player . And goalie Alex Fitzpatrick is giving up less than 6.5 goals per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's serviceable too , I guess . <p> This game is chock-full of storylines . First you have the uniforms . Seriously , how how awesome are these ? Then you have the coaching matchup . NU 's Kelly Amonte Hiller graduated from Maryland and actually played alongside Maryland 's head coach Cathy Reese . You have probably the two best freshmen in the country with Northwestern 's Selena Lasota and Maryland 's Megan Whittle . AND BOTH OF THE TEAMS ARE IN THE TOP 5 . ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED ? <p> This is going to be maybe the biggest game of the lacrosse regular season . Strap in , it should be a tight one . Here 's how to watch : 
@@97968494 @2168494/ <h> As training camps begin to open up , there are lots of former Wildcats vying for a roster spot . <p> It 's late July and football is almost back . ( Thank goodness . ) While there are still a few weeks until Northwestern opens camp , NFL training camps will be starting up this week . By August 2 , every team will have opened camp and start the grueling few weeks that is training camp . <p> For several former Northwestern players , the next few weeks could determine how they will spend the next few years of their lives . There are established players in the league that have come out of Northwestern -- a Super Bowl champion among them -- but this year , the theme is fringe players . Lots of former Wildcats will be vying for a roster spot or a practice squad position or , at the very least , a chance to impress and play elsewhere if the NFL does n't work out . One example was Tyrell Sutton , who was picked up as an undrafted free agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panthers and Seahawks , and ultimately ended up in the Canadian Football League , where he has had a very productive career so far . Without further ado , here 's where Northwestern 's NFL contingency stands : <h> Established Veterans <p> Zach Strief , T , New Orleans - Strief , a former seventh-round pick , will enter his tenth season -- all with the Saints -- this year . That 's impressive longevity for any player , and even more so for a guy who almost went undrafted . After providing depth at both tackle positions for the first portion of his career ( and earning a Super Bowl ring in 2010 ) , Strief has had the starting gig at right tackle since 2011 . He started all 16 games there last year and 15 the year before that . He signed a five-year extension in 2014 , so it 's looking like New Orleans will be home for the dependable lineman for quite some time . <p> Corey Wootton , DT , Detroit - Wootton showed the most promise in the 2012 season -- his third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he posted seven sacks in 16 games played , seven of which were starts . But the fourth-rounder in the 2010 NFL Draft struggled the next year despite getting 15 starts . Last year , he appeared in 15 games with the Vikings and , this offseason he signed with the Lions , who are looking to replace Ndamukong Suh . Wootton 's versatility-- he can play both tackle and end-- combined with the fact that he 's still in his prime at just 28 years old will likely help him earn some playing time . <p> NOTE : Barry Cofield and Nick Roach , two NFL veterans , are currently free agents who could get a call from teams in the near future . Cofield was released by the Washington Redskins after they signed three defensive linemen in free agency , and Roach , a linebacker , has been dealing with lasting after-effects of a concussion he suffered last preseason . At this point , it 's certainly not unreasonable to expect Cofield to find a home as a run-stopping nose tackle . <h> Somewhat Established <p> Corbin Bryant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bills defensive line unit , Bryant saw time in all 16 games last year as a backup and special teamer . With new head coach Rex Ryan in town , the Buffalo defense will have a 4-3 under formation , opening an extra spot along the defensive line in the middle next to stud tackle Marcell Dareus . Bryant will , in all likelihood , make this roster , but he will have a fair amount of competition for playing time . <p> Sherrick McManis , CB , Chicago - McManis does n't see much time at all on the defensive side of the ball , but where he makes his impact felt is on special teams . McManis is one of the top gunners in the league and has been very good in that role for the Bears . He has certainly found his niche in the pros . The former fifth-round pick by Houston has had a good offseason too , according to ESPN 's Jeff Dickerson , and might see some more time in nickel and dime packages . <h> Still Fighting <p> Mike Kafka , QB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after spending last year with the Buccaneers . He has also spent time with Philadelphia , which drafted him in the fourth round , and the Patriots ' and Jaguars ' practice squads . Teddy Bridgewater is definitely penciled in as the long-term starter in Minnesota , and the Vikings brought in 14-year veteran Shaun Hill to help tutor Bridgewater , but if the Vikings decide to keep three quarterbacks , or if Hill or Bridgewater were to get hurt , Kafka 's only other competition is undrafted free agent Taylor Heinicke . Kafka will have to have an impressive preseason to stick , though . <p> Rashad Lawrence , WR , Chicago - After a stint in the Redskins ' training camp , Lawrence was signed to the Bears ' practice squad in November in a move that corresponded to the release of Santonio Holmes . Lawrence impressed at his pro day workout , running a 4.49 40 and , at 6-foot-2 , he has good size for the position . The Bears have Alshon Jeffery , added Kevin White in the draft and Eddie Royal in free agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth receiver or a body on the practice squad . <p> Brian Peters , LB , Minnesota - What a great story this would be . Peters played safety at Northwestern before going undrafted in the 2012 draft , mainly due to his 4.60 40 time , likely too slow for an NFL safety . Since , he has played in the Arena Football League with the Iowa Barnstormers for a year and the Canadian Football League with theSaskatchewan Roughriders for two . In 2013 , the Roughriders won the Grey Cup ( the CFL 's Super Bowl ) and last year he registered 78 tackles , three sacks , two interceptions ( one returned for a touchdown ) , displaying the play-making ability he showed at Northwestern . He has bulked up from 218 pounds to 235 after signing with the Vikings in February , something that will surely help . Minnesota has some depth at the position , but if Peters can contribute on special teams he could find a way onto the active roster , <h> The Rookies <p> Ibraheim Campbell , S , Cleveland - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but should see time as a backup and special teamer . Campbell will likely have to learn to play both safety positions , but he 's a smart guy ( 4x Academic All-Big Ten selection ) and the Browns believe he could be the heir apparent to double-digit-year veteran Donte Whitner . He signed a four-year deal with the team on May 20 . <p> Trevor Siemian , QB , Denver - Lots of people were surprised when the Broncos took Siemian with one of the final picks of the draft considering his mediocre numbers senior year and his balky knee , which prevented him from taking part in lots of pre-draft workouts . Peyton Manning is entering what may be his last year and behind him is the unproven but athletically-impressive Brock Osweiler , Zac Dysert and Siemian ( likely in that order at this point ) . The thing that is helping Siemian out , however , is he is the only quarterback on the team drafted under new head coach Gary Kubiak . Siemian , who signed a 4-year deal with only the $52,000 signing bonus guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot and even then , Denver might go with just two quarterbacks on their roster . <p> Kyle Prater , WR , New Orleans - After being picked up as an undrafted free agent by the Saints , Prater signed a three-year deal , but like almost every other free-agent signing , very little money is guaranteed . Prater has obvious size , and he is being reunited with his receivers coach from Southern California , John Morton , who fills the same role in The Big Easy . The Saints love to spread the defense out with five-receiver sets , and they throw it a lot , so that might also help the oft-injured wideout 's chances . There 's a lot of competition at the wide receiver slot , but the Saints could also try to beef Prater up and see if he can compete as a tight end . The Saints traded away All-Pro tight end Jimmy Graham this offseason and do not have any particular standouts at the position on the current roster . <p> Brandon Vitabile , C , Indianapolis - The chance to snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken lightly . Yet the Colts , just a few days before training camp , do n't have an established veteran at the center position . Right now , the battle is between Jonotthan Harrison and Khaled Holmes . Vitabile is a longshot to start at this point , and perhaps even a longshot to make the team , but given the Colts ' lack of proven depth at the position , he could wind up on the practice squad or , with an injury to the guys in front of him or strong preseason performance , the former Wildcat could end up as a backup to whoever wins the job . <p> Jimmy Hall , S , Oakland - Silver and Black Pride has Hall listed at safety , the position he played for Northwestern his first three years , mainly because of his speed/strength/size combination . Hall is 6-foot-1 , 228 pounds , runs a 4.44-second 40-yard dash , and put up 24 bench press reps . In the NFL , those are the measurables of a safety . Hall 's instincts at the position are lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and considering there is much more depth at linebacker than there is at safety for the team , Hall 's best shot to make the roster is , in fact , as a safety . Additionally , if Hall can translate those impressive physical attributes into special teams ability , he could nab a spot on the roster , but he will certainly have to stand out in camp . <p> Chi Chi Ariguzo , LB , San Diego - The ultra-productive linebacker will face an uphill battle to make the San Diego roster . The Chargers are just loaded at the position : Donald Butler and Manti Te'o are both young , productive players , Kavell Conner -- a reliable veteran -- and rookie Denzel Perryman , who they drafted in the second round . It 'll be tough for Ariguzo to stick in San Diego . <p> Tony Jones , WR , Washington - Jones provides speed and return ability , but not much else . Plus , the Redskins already have speedy returners in DeSean Jackson , Andre Roberts and Jamison Crowder , a fourth-round pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route running have improved immensely , it 's likely that he wo n't stick around long with the Redskins .

Go to the games early <p> Here 's an inside tip , if you arrive at a football game about 30-45 minutes before kickoff , you can sit where ever you want .

But the architecture of the stadium , where the east stands are less vertical than the west stands , means that the student section will fill more horizontal yardage , if that makes any sense . <p> The other effect of moving the student section there is that it breaks up visiting fans ' dominance of the south endzone .

It 's been a busy week for me , mainly due to trying to find an apartment but also due to work , which explains the lack of stuff . Also we 're trying to reconcile " Northwestern just getting the crap beaten out of them " with " Northwestern being 10-point favorites " in our head . <p> We do n't really hate Minnesota , in part because the last few years have been rather one-sided . The series history still favors Minnesota by a lot because of Bronko Nagurski and whatnot , but the Wildcats have won five of 6 and 10 out of 15 . I think my main sporting gripe with the Gophers stems from a 2012 overtime Big Ten Tournament loss , which sucked prohibitively . <p> But it 's hard to hate gophers , you know ? I would make a Caddyshack joke but I 'm pretty sure these people are tired of that .

This is a gopher : <p> Gophers comprise the Geomidae family , although some ground squirrels are erroneously called gophers as well . Gophers are squat creatures whose lifestyle consists of burrowing and storing food in their cheek pouches to bring back to their burrows and hoard . They have become known as pests because they have a tendency to screw up humans ' lawns in their burrowing process .

" <p> I 'm sure that rugby player was super-accurate in his anecdotal , virtually contextless diagnosis of a language he did n't understand . <p> Dakota-Lakota specialists state that the word " Ski-U " or " Ski-yoo " or " Ski-oo " are not Sioux victory cries or the Sioux word for winning and that what the boys heard that day " Ski-yoo " may have just been a nonverbal exclamation , the way we now yell " Whoo-hoo !

It 's fun when , at the end of the year , Northwestern gets to take Illinois ' hat from them , even if it 's a new hat meant to replace a tomahawk . <p> However , Minnesota goes kind of overkill on this . Several teams have three rivalry trophies , but only Minnesota has four : The Floyd of Rosedale with Iowa , the Little Brown Jug with Michigan , the Paul Bunyan 's Axe with Wisconsin , and the Governor 's Victory Bell with Penn State . <p> These are of varying levels of awesomeness .

The Gophers have only gotten to take home the jug three times since 1968 <p> Having a rivalry with Penn State is just the silliest . When the Lions entered the conference in 1993 , it was invented to make Penn State seem at home , or something , a feat which could somehow be accomplished via a trophy game with a school damn near halfway across the country .

@@97968503 @2168503/ <h> Hail To Purple 's Larry LaTourette gives new and old NU fans the most essential pieces of history they need to know . <p> Ed Note : Thanks to Larry for helping Northwestern fans learn more about the program 's history . Make sure to visit Hail To Purple for more and follow him on Twitter at @HailToPurple . <p> For new Northwestern students and fans , a view of the program might not extend much further than cheering on the team during Pat Fitzgerald 's tenure as coach . Older fans might even remember before Coaches Barnett and Walker 's teams earned Big Ten championships , back to the program 's low point in the late 1970s and ' 80s . The history of the program , however , is far richer-- and crazier-- than its recent past might indicate . Here are four aspects of NU football history that many fans do n't , but should , know . <h> 1 . Northwestern football is among the oldest programs in the nation <p> Which school was the first in the Midwest to play in a verifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to our friends in Ann Arbor , and said fans would be wrong . The Wolverines first learned the game in 1879 . But Northwestern played a game in Evanston in February 1876 , against an amateur team from Chicago . <p> The Chicago Football Club began playing football in the style of Harvard in 1875 , and issued a challenge to NU to play during the 1876 Washington 's Birthday holiday . NU accepted , and lost the game , three goals to none . Until that point , only five other major colleges in the country had played football against a team from outside their school : Princeton , Rutgers , Columbia , Harvard , and Yale . NU became major school #6 and the first in the Midwest . <h> 2 . The ' Cats have been a part of a lot of college football " firsts " <p> NU has broken new ground a surprising number of times during its history . Here is just a sample of firsts that have involved NU football : <p> First indoor football game in the Midwest ( vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player at a Big Ten school ( George Jewett , who played for Michigan 1890-1892 . Jewett also played for NU 1893-1894 ) , and the first African-American Big Ten player ( Alton Washington played for NU 1898-1901 , after the conference 's 1895 founding ) <p> First off-campus preseason training in the Big Ten ( not Camp Kenosha . This was training in southern Wisconsin in 1903 ) <p> First major football game at Soldier Field ( vs . Notre Dame , 1924 ) <p> First experimental televising of football games ( 1931 , station W9XAO , using mechanical television at Dyche Stadium ) <p> First Big Ten night game ( vs . Purdue at Dyche Stadium , 1935 ) <p> First plastic football helmets ( vs . Syracuse , 1940 ) <p> First African-American head coach of a Division I-A program ( Dennis Green , 1981 - 1985 ) <p> ... And we ca n't forget the bizarre " first major college football game to be played in only one direction " ( vs . Illinois at Wrigley Field , 2010 ) ! <h> 3 . The history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highs-- and lows <p> The history of this team has been far from boring . <p> When the team earned its first Big Ten title in 1903 , the crowds of NU fans were so large that the school 's football venue at the time ( Sheppard Field ) could not accommodate the fans , and the team played the second half of its home schedule at the White Sox 's home park . The team 's success during the 1920s and ' 30s was occasionally accompanied by riots in Chicago and Evanston , including wild students and fans setting fires in downtown Evanston . Even Chicago mobster Al Capone jumped on Northwestern 's bandwagon , coming to watch the ' Cats play Nebraska at Dyche Stadium in 1931 ( he was eventually booed out of the stadium by other fans ) . By 1936 NU had won four Big Ten titles . That year , the inaugural year of the Associated Press college football poll , NU ranked No. 1 in the nation for three weeks . <p> During World War II , Northwestern star halfback Otto Graham electrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading NU to a top-ten finish in 1943 . The ' Cats ' victory over Cal in the 1949 Rose Bowl remains one of the greatest games in Rose Bowl history . Ara Parseghian 's term as head coach ( 1956 - 1963 ) featured regular crowds of over 50,000 at Dyche Stadium-- a phenomenal feat for a school with less than 8,000 undergraduates . Parseghian 's Wildcat teams took on rival Notre Dame four times during his tenure , and beat the Irish every time . Unfortunately , Parseghian would continue to notch victories in the Northwestern - Notre Dame series after 1963 , but as Notre Dame 's coach . <p> The school administration 's support for its football program had dried up by the early 1970s , and Northwestern entered a two-decade period that was marked by mediocrity at best and downright terrifyingly bad football at its worst . The program , which had enjoyed national fame through the ' 30s and ' 40s , sadly regained the spotlight in 1981 when it set the major college losing streak , losing its 29th straight game in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , students chanted " We are the worst ! " pulled down one of the goal posts , and tossed it into Lake Michigan . <p> By the early 1990s the program was an afterthought , having suffered 23 straight losing seasons . However , a new Northwestern administration began to reinvigorate the program , and head coach Gary Barnett 's now-legendary turnaround took a moribund team and made them back-to-back Big Ten champions . Coach Walker 's efforts continued the team 's success , adding another Big Ten title . But the highs of the " Expect Victory " era of the 1990s and early 2000s were marred by a string of untimely deaths connected with NU athletics , beginning with former NU star Matt Hartl in 1999 and culminating in the unexpected death of Coach Walker in 2006 . With the passing of Walker , Northwestern took former Wildcat star and assistant coach Pat Fitzgerald and made him the youngest head coach in the FBS . It took Fitz just seven years to become the winningest coach in Northwestern history . <h> 4 . There might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Win or lose , defending champs or heralded underdog , Northwestern has always tried to play the game the right way . This was exemplified in 1920 when Northwestern hosted Notre Dame and its superstar , George Gipp . The game marked Gipp 's final appearance on the field . Gipp had been injured the week before and was becoming seriously i 'll ; he was not on the roster for the game . Late in the game both Notre Dame and NU fans began chanting for Gipp . Though very i 'll and unable to run , Gipp managed one play : a 55-yard completed pass . As Gipp threw the ball , the Northwestern defenders , refusing to tackle the clearly-ailing star , instead carried him slowly to the turf , then off the field . <p> The team has come under scrutiny this year for being labeled " university employees " first and-- arguably-- students second . But the truth is that only a handful of other major college programs come as close to having players who are " students first .
