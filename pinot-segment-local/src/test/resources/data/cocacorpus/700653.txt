@@49968232 @3468232/ <h> The Anatomy of a Perfect Twitter Post to Increase Click-Through-Rate <p> Twitter is a powerful channel for selling , with 60% of survey respondents saying they 've made a purchase based on something they saw on Twitter and 86% saying they plan to make a future purchase based on information gleaned from the site . One of the core responsibilities of a digital marketer is to make sure the tweets being churned out are reaching the maximum audience and making an impact . In this weeks post , Mod Girl Marketing breaks down the anatomy of the most effective Twitter posts , based on the latest click-through rate ( CTR ) statistics . <h> Does Size of Audience Matter ? <p> The average click-through rate for a post is 1.64% . Many companies get caught up on expanding the size of their audience to get more clicks . However , as counter-intuitive as it may seem , SignUpTo tells us that Twitter accounts with the most followers actually see the least click-throughs . For instance , sites with 50-1,000 users saw a click-through rate of 6.16% , compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.45% . <h> What Makes A Great Tweet ? <p> Why do people come to Twitter ? Essentially , Twitter users are looking for three things : Inspiration . Humor . News . <p> Twitter has made it easier to break down the anatomy of the perfect tweet by publishing a marketing guide with tweet templates to help your business maximize success on their platform . That could be a good place to start once you 're done reading this blog , of course ! <h> Headlines <p> If you 're looking for a lot of blog post shares , then invest time in creating a headline that intrigues . While you do n't  want every- tweet to be a headline and a link necessarily , these posts do tend to get a great deal of click-through traffic. - Crafting better headlines can improve your CTR by 18% overnight , according to one researcher . In fact , changing just one word in your headline can nearly double the clicks you receive ! <p> Tip : Tweet about.TWITTER . Tweets about Twitter and social media receive 22.5% more clicks than the average- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best tweets contain action-oriented words and clear , direct language . The worst words to use are those that focus on the mundane banality of life or that sound too casual . ( Avoid the " LoLs " at all costs ! ) <h> Actions <p> Clearly state your offer. - HubSpot found that posts with clear copy received 18% more clicks and 29.8% more re-tweets than more ambiguous copy . An ambiguous tweet may read : " Get a sneak peek backstage on how @HubSpot does inbound marketing : http : //hubs.ly/q0Rc70 , " whereas a clear tweet would say : " Free Kit : The Marketers Crash Course in Visual Content Creation http : //hubs.ly/y01sGg0- . " <p> Ask for a retweet. - Salesforce found they received 12x more retweets when they simply asked readers to retweet . <p> Tell readers to " download . " - Tweets with the word " download " received 13% more clicks , says- Kissmetrics. - <h> Links <p> Embed it : - It seems most intuitive to put your link at the end of the post , but Dan Zarrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post actually had the best click-through rate . <p> Test it : - Make sure you have spaces before and after your links so they are clickable . This may sound obvious , but its the most common link error . Also , be sure to test your link before you publish to ensure its going to the right destination . <p> Shorten it : - Use a site like bit.ly to shorten your links for better presentation . <p> Highlight it : - When you 're posting a link , avoid @-mentions and hashtags that will detract from the link itself . <h> Timing <p> Post on weekends : - Salesforce found that engagement increases 17% on the weekends . Were not suggesting that you work on the weekends . Using a tool like Hootsuite or Sprout Social , you can advance schedule posts for the weekends while you 're off having fun . <p> Post early : - For a 30% greater engagement rate , post between 7 and 8 am . Other good times include the noon lunch break and popular get-out-of-work times of 5pm or 6pm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of clicks each Bit.ly link receives .

We must make sure that all copywriting complies with HIPAA and FDA rules . We have to ask questions like : Are we avoiding the use of patient names in all writing , unless expressly permitted ? Are we letting people know our advice is not meant to substitute a trip to the doctors for professional medical counsel ? Are we including enough information ? Are all claims completely accurate ? <p> We have a whole other set of concerns when we look at B2B healthcare companies and healthcare technology firms . Are we explaining the features and benefits in a digestible way ? In a competitive market , how can we present these particular products or services as unique and desirable ? How do we make it easier for healthcare organizations to adopt new technology and give it a try ? <p> Despite these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research- found 72% of patients used the internet to- search for information on hospitals , doctors and medical treatments . Furthermore , Googles " Digital Journal to Wellness " report found that 44% of patients who research hospitals on their mobile devices go on to schedule an appointment . Given the demand and usefulness of digital marketing for healthcare markets , is n't it time you investigated the latest trends and companies capable of executing a comprehensive strategy that meets your needs ? <h> Here are three components your healthcare marketing strategy must have to be competitive : <h> 1 . A Responsive Website <p> Since a third of your customers will be using their mobile devices to research medical information and facilities , as well as book appointments , you 'll need a website that is designed with small mobile screens in mind . Rather than build a separate mobile site , you can have responsiveness for different devices built into your main website to eliminate any confusion . Visitors should be able to find the most essential information quickly and easily , access special mobile features ( like click-to-call ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly reformatted to fit their screens . Without a responsive website that functions quickly and seamlessly , all other marketing endeavors are pointless . You only have one chance to make a first impression before these easily-distracted internet users are moving onto the next healthcare website . Surely you recall what happened with the flawed roll-out of the new Obamacare website ! - - Check out these- examples of responsive healthcare websites. <h> 2 . Content Marketing <p> New content is the best way to help your website reach patient eyes and develop real leads . Well-crafted content improves search engine positioning , informs consumers , builds trust , and invites readers to visit your practice . The best content includes Search Engine Optimization techniques and keywords that help connect searchers with your website . <p> To have an effective content marketing strategy , healthcare companies must have a comprehensive , written plan for success which is where our consulting work begins .

Then , we promote that content through various channels including social media promotion and blogger outreach to enhance our SEO efforts and overall brand awareness . From there , we monitor the effectiveness of your content through analytics tracking and reporting . Our marketing company uses a full suite of advanced online marketing tools to improve the efficiency of your campaigns to give you more for your money . <h> 3 . Social Media Presence <p> You do n't  have to be on every social media site , but having some regularly maintained presence is considered a prerequisite for doing business by most consumer standards . Many businesses also feel most comfortable networking with modern companies who have an online presence as well . <p> As The Huffington Post- explains , - when done well , social media can help your institution be prepared for a crisis situation , inform patients , connect with local journalists for positive publicity , improve prevention and empower patients . <p> If you 're a B2B healthcare company , social media can help you get in touch with prospects , inform decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and- monitor relevant conversations where people have problems that you can solve . <h> Is your healthcare company- embracing these digital marketing trends ? <p> Mod Girl Marketing helps healthcare companies develop a consistent posting schedule with a diverse range of social media messages that appeal to your core target markets .

They found that 79% of big brands were on Twitter , 80% on Facebook , and 45% on YouTube . Over a third of corporations added a Google+ account and corporate blog , and 7% adopted pages on Pinterest , Instagram and Foursquare . Yet , as any successful brand knows , its not enough to simply create a presence . One has to regularly update and maintain these accounts and have a strategic focus moving forward . Mod Girl Marketing helps large corporations discover an effective online marketing strategy that aligns all social networks , blogs and online ads with one cohesive strategy . <h> Here are three tips to get you thinking about re-tooling your corporate social media plan : <h> 1 . Target your markets . <p> Corporations used to create one company Twitter account or one dedicated Facebook page to talk to all their customers . Yet , that strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything to everyone . Instead , you want to focus on several specific niches within your business and build follower lists for them . Burger King launched their 2008 " Whopper Virgins " campaign with dedicated social network pages . Wal-Mart uses different Twitter handles , such as- @WalmartHealthy , @WalmartGiving and @WalmartAction to reach out to specific audiences . Dell has 44 separate accounts to cover different departments . According to- Brand Watch , - the number of corporations running multiple Twitter accounts has increased from 7% to 63% in the last few years alone . <h> 2 . Put your dollars where they count . <p> As- Forbes- so astutely put it : " Audiences are simply not paying attention to banner social media advertising . And these ads are not having direct impact on sales . " Viewers are de-sensitized and turned off by ads , the magazine states , and click-through rates are a pitiful 0.01% . Furthermore , 4 out of 5 Facebook users say they have never made a purchase based on a Facebook ad . Instead , corporations must focus on investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Videos should be cinematic in nature because that 's what audiences expect . Make use of analytical social media tools like Raven Toolsto determine what is or is n't working in your current social media strategy . <h> 3 . Tap agency expertise . <p> How does a major corporation create a gut-busting , memorable , and often viral Superbowl ad ? According to- Mashable , - these strokes of genius do not occur by chance , nor do they happen overnight . Fiat , Ford , and Coke Zero all relied on outside experts to pitch a pool of creative ideas and then picked the best one . Not only can an agency help you come up with fresh ideas that captivate audiences , but agencies can also offer additional services you may not have time for such as real-time data monitoring , so you can tweak your campaigns at the last minute to make them more profitable .

@@49968256 @3468256/ <h> Why CMOs &amp; Marketing Agencies Are A Perfect Match <p> here 's the trouble with many marketing agencies , according to Chief Marketing Officers . They talk a fine game , list prestigious brands theyve worked for and emphasize their creative endeavors but they miss what really matters to their prospective partners . <p> At its core , the CMO/marketing agency partnership is really about relationship building and connecting as business-minded people . Its about how an agency can add value to a business by providing hard numbers , facts , customer insights and marketing growth opportunities . Its about intelligent discussions about tackling the challenges ahead with new solutions and technology . There are many agencies out there that completely miss the mark for their clients , but nothing beats finding that sweet spot of collaboration with the right- partnership . <p> What follows is a discussion of the strengths of a CMO/marketing agency pairing , the trouble of working with the wrong partner , and how to outsource some of your marketing tasks to a firm that truly understands your business model . <p> here 's the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thin . It often takes a lot of work for CMOs to justify marketing expenditures to Corporate , let alone convince them that the hassle and expense of adding necessary personnel to an existing team is worthwhile . An agency partnership can not only save a ridiculous amount of money ( we once estimated we save our clients a good $337,000 a year or more ) , but also circumvents issues like retention , learning curve , training , managing additional staff and benefits packages . <p> Kissmetrics- wisely speculates that major brands will seek to capitalize on the advantages of partnerships , going one step further and buying media companies to fulfill their marketing needs . Content houses and technology providers may find offers on the table from clients with money who want to make a high-profile acquisition of their companies . Furthermore , brands will be looking for YouTube celebrities and high-profile influencers to partner with so they can tap established networks of prospective buyers . <p> CMOs excel at managing campaigns , but agencies offer " big picture " perspective . - Tunnel-vision happens to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at spreading consistent messages across all platforms , identifying areas of strength and weakness by looking at the data and finding ways to help CMOs justify the budget with ROI numbers . As- CMO.com- put it : " Marketers are more reliant on their agencies and other outsourced partners to help them succeed in a business landscape that has become far more complicated , as well as highly technology- and data-driven . " Successful digital marketing requires cohesive storytelling ( including corporate-shared narratives and customer experiences shared socially ) and cross-platform communication that builds and sustains relationships between businesses and the people they serve . The big picture can be complex and easy to lose sight of without many minds mulling over the data and making intelligent decisions on how to tweak campaigns , messages or imagery to better connect the dots between opportunity and sales . Agencies with decades of experience working with different clients can identify common themes that breed exceptionalism in marketing and bring business savvy to the table that internal personnel limited to one brand experience does n't  always possess . <p> The best agencies specialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe the freshest industry news. - Within a company , you 're likely focused on the daily grind , corporate news and overseeing existing campaigns . You 're likely receiving data and updating your strategy as you go to some extent . What CMO- honestly- has time to scour the headlines for every relevant news story related to dozens of niche marketing topics ? Googles got a new algorithm ; there 's a new knock-out tool that makes content curation more effective ; Twitter is offering new features to their paid advertising platform ; this new technology is converting more sales than anything you 've seen before . CMOs rely on agency partners to sort through the clutter and bring the most relevant news to the table . They bring the spice to the soup that will turn a bland , stale strategy into a growth engine for the future . <p> ( Note : Unlike mega agencies that present themselves as creative jacks-of-all-trades , a boutique marketing agency like Mod Girl Marketing is in a great position to do just that , since were comprised of various freelance experts specializing in different industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one roof . ) <h> Its All About Finding The RIGHT Partnership <p> So a lot of what we 've been talking about thus so far is the ideal case scenario . You found an agency you love and they love you back . Communication is excellent and all parties are thriving together . Unfortunately , this type of CMO/agency relationship is more the exception than the rule . One survey found that- only 5% of respondents ( who spend more than $10 million on media per year ) said they were confident in their agency partner 's performance . <p> The problems cited are many , especially since the role of agencies has been largely shifting from providing creative functions to providing more data-driven solutions within the last five years . Last years Client/Agency Relationship survey conducted by Forbes found that issues included : <p> Poorly trained personnel <p> Inability to come up with genuine consumer insights <p> Insufficient knowledge of the issues that impact client business <p> Lack of integration between online and offline marketing solutions <p> Under-staffing , turnover and inexperienced junior associates working on accounts <p> Struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not surprisingly , a whopping 81% of companies favor working with more than one agency ( whom they consider " vendors " more than partners ) . You may be hesitant to put all your eggs in one basket , but asking a few questions before partnering up can go a long way in finding the right agency . <h> Ask The Tough Questions Before Making Your Decision <p> A few questions can help you gauge an agencys fit early on : <p> Who will we be working with and what do you need from us ? - Ideally , the CMO ( or another designated point person ) will work directly with the company founder or agency CEO on the account . One source of frustration for many CMOs comes in seeing the people who landed their account leave the agency , putting inexperienced people in charge . High turnover for your account spells disaster for the consistency of your marketing strategy and messages . Find out how long staff has been working for the agency to gauge the firms stability . <p> What scope of work can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multinational agencies . Medium and smaller budget firms may need a boutique agency that can deliver the precise services needed , without having to pay for extra fluff and filler that may be included with the bigger agency packages . <p> Is it possible to do a trial run ? - Before committing long-term , seeing how an agency runs a particular campaign or project can help you see precisely how they work . Assess their quality and level of communication to ensure its to your liking. - Ask which benchmarks and KPIs are measured . Look at reports they furnish to you and consider how these documents might function at your next meeting with Corporate . <h> Find Your Perfect Match <p> We still believe CMOs can find everything they need with one agency , but it requires honest communication and feeling each other out before any work begins . Over time , we 've identified common threads of our most fruitful partnerships and determined which industries are truly our forte . We do n't  take every client that comes our way . There is a lot more to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . We want to enjoy coming to work each day and work for brands that we are passionate about and brands we know we can help .

@@49968264 @3468264/ <p> 26% more visitors return to a site and complete the checkout process after viewing retargeted ads . <p> Retargeting can lead to a 147% higher conversion rate when combined with prospecting . <p> The tech industry , in particular , relies on a fair amount of retargeting . ChiefMarTec found that tech customers have 1,876 vendors and 43 categories to choose from . The idea is that an effective remarketing campaign that follows prospects around the web for days , dropping subtle " pick me , pick me ! " reminders , will help tech brands remain at the forefront of this dense pack of competitors and capitalize off previous interest . <p> Not only that , but the tech industry has much more complex products and a slower sales process . Good retargeting helps you stand out , yes , but also serves to inform your prospects , promoting your content and guiding individuals to a better overall experience with your brand . <p> There are many ways to formulate a retargeting campaign . We recommend retargeting based on : key landing page visits , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales funnel , downloaded resources or trial signups , and/or blog visits . Here are a few other tips to ensure you get great results from your campaigns <h> Retargeting Tips For Tech Companies <h> 1 . - Make your retargeting more specific . <p> As tech marketing consultants , the most common problem we see with new clients is that their retargeting campaigns direct everyone to the same hard sell landing page . You can count on better results when you create segments based on behavior , directed to different pages that will take individuals further along " the buyers journey . " <p> Some people may need more information before signing up for a trial or making an investment . Others may have already downloaded the trial , but are n't  quite sure how to use it or havent made the time to investigate . ( In fact , one study found 70% of people who downloaded a free SaaS trial did n't  use it ! ) <p> So , it makes sense to deliver new visitors to the most informative internal web pages , send your middle-funnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testimonials , product pages , case studies , or promotional offers to clinch the sale . <h> 2 . Do n't  overdo it . <p> The dominant fear with using remarketing is that you 'll drive prospects crazy with a constant , annoying bombardment of ads . After all , is n't it a little creepy to find that a brand is lurking following tracking ? You can overcome this worry and turn-off by capping the frequency of your ads . <p> So what is this magic number ? It all depends on what objectives you 're trying to achieve and the stage of the visitors buying cycle , of course , but- Retargeter- recommends 17 to 20 ad exposures per month as a good general guideline . Another approach would be to test frequency for conversion efficiency , as Marin Software explains here . <p> - <h> 3 . Use burn pixels to keep buyers happy . <p> What if you made a purchase at a store and the salespeople pounced on you as you were leaving , asking if you needed help or trying to show you additional products ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of code that ensures you do n't  keep pushing the same ads on people who have already purchased . <p> Instead , buyers can be enrolled in new retargeting campaigns , such as discounts on future orders , ads for complementary products/services , or information campaigns to help them get the most from their recent purchases . <h> 4 . Test content for performance with A/B testing . <p> How effective is your ad at inspiring clicks ? Does your landing page copy spur prospects to click on multiple pages once they reach your site ? Are your calls-to-action compelling enough to convert ? Try a couple different versions and see what performs well and what should be discarded . You can use a tool like OptiMonk to run your retargeting split tests .

Search Engine Optimization is not just some technical work an SEO Consultant does on your website . Modern- SEO is so much more blogging , press releases , videos , social media , documents , bookmarking sites , blog commenting , images . You can read more about these strategies in our Off-Page SEO Checklist from two years ago . While much of what we said back then is still relevant , there are new areas of focus for 2017 . <h> Off-Page SEO Strategies : What 's New for 2017 ? <h> 1 . Social Media and- SEO go hand-in-hand . <p> The head honchos over at Google like to downplay the impact of social media on search results , but anyone working in this industry knows better ! The Google search bots may not crawl social media pages in the same way they crawl regular webpages , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving with shares and engagement , tend to do better . The more shares you get , the more people you have enjoying your articles . People stay on your site longer and time on site IS a known factor for SEO . <p> For 2017 , we recommend maintaining a strong presence on multiple social channels by creating and sharing quality blog content regularly . You can use a tool like Sprout Social- to advance schedule your posts . We post links to relevant news stories also , making sure to share our own homegrown content at least once per week . <p> Most of us are running multi-channel marketing strategies . Its much easier to focus on a promotion run solely through Facebook , but these days , marketers are running the same campaign across email , PPC , social media and mobile . They 're pulling in crazy amounts of data , but they are working hard to provide the same customer experience , whether a person is browsing on mobile or PC , looking up information on their website or their Twitter page . Savvy marketers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions based on campaign analytics. <h> 2 . The time for speed optimization of mobile sites is NOW . <p> You may know your mobile site is a little sluggish , but it has n't  been a top priority . Google first introduced the AMP project at the end of 2015 , which has shifted more attention to speed particularly on mobile devices . Kissmetrics- research found that even a one second delay in loading time results in a 7% reduction in conversions . <p> Google claims that the Accelerated Mobile Pages project can help you improve loading speeds by 15 to 85% . There are plenty of resources to help you get started or you can work with digital marketing consultants to help your mobile site meet the standards . <h> 3 . Mobile app development pays off . <p> Historically , mobile-friendly sites and mobile apps have been very valuable tools , but they are not mutually exclusive . They serve different purposes . Mobile sites are aimed at bringing in fresh prospects , whereas mobile apps are about retention and rewarding patrons with a steady stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . More people are finding out about businesses through app searches. - CEO of mobile app creator Shoutem , Viktor Marohnic , says small businesses are seeing 70% of their total traffic coming from mobile up from just 10% three years ago . Apple is actively working on ways to make apps more " discoverable " within their interface with plans to roll out Search Ads and expand Subscription services in the coming year . With Googles App Streaming service , people can now see relevant content from apps without downloading anything . <p> The latest numbers suggest individuals spend about 65% of their time consuming media via smartphones and 85% of their time on smartphones within apps these days . So , not surprisingly , a- recent survey by Clutch found that nearly 50% of small businesses plan to have a mobile app by 2017 . <p> Savvy businesses will be using apps as yet another avenue for promoting high-quality , SEO-driven content to the masses . <p> " We are starting to notice apps in SERPs ; however , I am honestly astonished about the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , " - says Tom Bourlet , a travel blogger with SpaghettiTraveller. - He adds : " Tricks such as deep linking are really not being utilized to their full potential ; however , this should change during 2017 . " <p> " At the end of the day , SaaS helps automate aspects of your local SEO campaign , but automation can only take you so far , " - Search Engine Land- explains . " Simply checking a box by deploying SaaS tools is no longer going to pass as having a strong SEO strategy , " they add . <p> You still need an actual human being responsible for SEO elements that impact ranking like : <p> Combing through reports and assessing ROI <p> Analyzing paid search performance <p> Improving site structure <p> Content discovery <h> 5 . Audits make their way into SEO strategy on a regular basis . <p> - <p> Our clients are always shocked by how insightful an SEO audit can be . We require very little information to get started and they are provided with a treasure trove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 State of Marketing Report , 77 percent of marketers believe businesses should perform full SEO audits every six months . However , more than half of businesses admitted they do not do this . We find the- best performing companies perform audits at least every six months , if not quarterly . We look at what 's working and what 's not to shift focus . Why throw good money after bad ? <h> The Bottom Line on SEO in 2017 : <p> Investing in SEO ensures that you are getting your brand before as many eyes as possible . From there , the leads are yours to convert or to lose through User Experience , Content , and Marketing Automation . Allotting a bit of strategic SEO consulting into your budget can help you get off to a faster with a dynamic start in the first three months of 2017.

Compared to other industries , healthcare has been inundated with legal challenges and bureaucracy , dated in its strategic planning , and slow even resistant to change . Patients have long sought greater control over access to health-related information . The sands are shifting to bridge the gap between providers and patients . We keep waiting for " the next big invention , " but industry consultants say : " Its all right there for the taking right now . You just have to know how . " <h> You 'll gain a better understanding of human behavior . <p> Why are people coming to your website ? Why are people leaving your website ? What do prospects who become patients expect from you ? How can you serve these people better ? We 've never had a better capacity to draw in and analyze reliable information not just from your website analytics , but from mobile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data coming in can help us build better predictive models for health conditions that take into account lifestyle , household and socio-economic factors , clinical results , purchasing decisions , and compliance issues . <h> You 'll move from quantity to quality . <p> Great healthcare companies have always been frustrated by the dated industry model of " getting more bodies into hospital beds " and scheduling existing employees " more hours to fulfill patient needs . " The newer system demands that healthcare providers be- measured against outcome , rather than the volume of treatments provided . Our line of thinking will move away from " how can we get more from insurers by ordering more tests , writing more prescriptions , and keeping patients in the hospitals longer " to " how can we incentivize patients to take steps toward wellness and encourage the herd to build up better immunity to illness within their communities ?

All landing pages , ads , copy , images and components of your marketing can and will be tested . If a particular image and message resonates , you can shift more resources to promoting this branding across all channels .

@@49968293 @3468293/ <h> Google Launches Google+ Social Layer to Compete with Facebook ? <p> Awhile back I wrote a post about the feud between Google and Facebook well Google has answered with its limited launch of Google+ . Its not quite ready yet for the public but its already creating some buzz . Personally , I think its kinda cool and definitely think people will enjoy using it . Be sure to watch the short videos below to get a feel for what Google is about to bring to the social world as we know it . Check out this article about Google+ from ThisisMyNext.com : <p> Google 's just taken the wraps off of Google+ , its brand new social networking layer which is apparently being positioned as the company 's answer to Facebook . Google+ will make use of a black bar at the top of every Google page for accessing new Google+ options for sharing content and accessing notifications . The service contains a lot of features Facebook users may feel comfortable with right from the start , including similarly-styled notifications , and a news stream for sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But it 's not just about Facebook . Rather than have one mass sharing system , Google is making use of targeted groups of friends called Circles which will make use of drag-and-drop lists , presumably simplifying the often arduous task of grouping or making lists of friends , thus encouraging users to actually employ them . Additionally , Google+ will bring a new group chat feature called Hangouts , which allows users to opt-in to a chat room their friend(s) are in ( with a maximum room size of 10 users ) , rather than being bombarded with unsolicited messages . This feature in particular strikes us as an early standout , and a Google representative told- Mashables Ben Parr that the feature tested well internally with friends joining the Hangouts quickly . Much of this was very accurately predicted by- ReadWriteWeb way back in March ( and indeed , it was- rumored even before then ) , and the cordoning off of friends into smaller , more private groups seems to be the services most compelling aspect . <p> Additional features include Google+ Sparks , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithm , and unsurprisingly , there will be full mobile apps ( beginning with Android ) launched to support Google+ . We have n't had a chance to see or play around with Google+ , which has apparently begun to roll out to users very slowly , but hit the links below for fuller details . <p> Watch these short videos outlining Googles new social layer , Google+ . To me , its a combo of Facebook , FourSquare , Twitter , my T-mobile My Faves , plus some other cool features . Google is definitely on to something by combining the most popular social platforms into one giant social experience .

Wise marketers want as much money as they can possibly muster to make their advertising dreams a reality . Understood ! So the question becomes : " How does a marketer justify marketing spend to the CEO ? " The answer lies in marketing automation . <p> Seasoned marketers know that our industry is 50% creative and 50% math . On one hand , marketing is about branding through images , storytelling and emotion-evoking design work . That 's the fun part ! On the other hand , marketing is about data , statistics and sales dollars . <p> Many a multi-million-dollar budget is spent using website impressions as a measure of effectiveness . If sales remain steady or slightly increase and- people are visiting the site , reading the blog and clicking over to the companys social media pages , then the marketing team is operating " efficiently enough " to justify the expense . <p> Going one step further , companies trouble themselves with another measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just how many eyes are landing on a brands message , but how many people are liking , linking and sharing , as well as how much time is spent on a site or how many people end up with products in their shopping carts . <p> In 2015 , we can do better a WHOLE LOT better . Last year , the marketing automation industry grew by 50% to $1.2 billion . Its forecasted the industry will reach $1.8 billion by the end of the year . There are four reasons why marketing automation becomes the answer to justifying marketing expenditures and why companies cant afford to put off this investment any longer . <h> 1 . Marketing Automation Makes The Meeting . <p> Boardroom meetings are greatly enriched by the presentation of graphs , charts , statistics and insights based on the numbers . Marketing automation is often painted as a way to store leads and send out emails , but its so much more than that . Marketing automation captures actionable data like : <p> Email opens , bounces and clicks <p> Where visitors went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went next <p> Which mediums ( be it ad , email , blog ) and messages led to increases in buyer interest <p> Which mediums and messages did not <p> What actions are made within the emails ( link clicks , number of opens ) <p> When prospects are taking steps toward a purchase <p> Ultimately , you want to answer the questions : " Which assets provide the most returns and deserve our focus ? Which areas could we improve upon or eliminate ? " Presenting the reports generated from marketing automation programs steers the conversation to help sales and marketing teams direct their efforts . <p> A major challenge for sizable organizations lies in aligning sales and marketing goals . Often , the two departments work as separate entities with a liaison or two running communication between the groups . In one survey , 90% of marketers said that lack of sales alignment caused problems in reaching goals . Furthermore , it was discovered that B2B organizations with tightly aligned sales and marketing goals achieved 27% increased profit growth in a three-year period than their peers who struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common point of reference for decision making across departments . Its easy to disagree with one persons opinion , but harder to refute measurable evidence . <h> 3 . Marketing Automation Saves Time &amp;- Keeps A Pulse On The Consumer . <p> CMOs are struggling with increased demands on their time and resources . Seventy-four percent of marketers say that " saving time " is the biggest benefit of their automation platform . Conservatively , - Marketo- estimates that a marketing teams productivity increases from 1.5 to 6.9% with the use of a marketing automation platform . Why spend more time on personalizing emails , entering buyer data into the database , or monitoring social media conversations than you need to ? <p> Aberdeen Group- says that best-in-class companies reduce close cycle time by 49% on average with marketing automation. - Automating certain processes not only saves time by cutting out tasks that computers can do as well as human beings and freeing up more time for marketers , but it also alerts marketers to critical moments where real-time intervention has the power to convert a sale . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marketing organization allow them to get super close to the consumer , and keep their thumbs on the pulse of the market . They can measure the smallest of changes in sentiment , and assess when consumer behavior indicates a need for new products or features . The earlier these signals are detected , the quicker the product roadmap can be updated to meet customer demand . " <p> Salesforce VP of Product Marketing Gordon Evans told Ad Age- that marketing automation is- about " engaging customers on any channel or device with an orchestrated approach based on data . " Improving efficiency in communications between prospects , customers and companies is part of the allure , but the magazine also cites the following reasons why companies need to invest in marketing automation software now : <p> Better capability to personalize content : - Enables you the ability to send out automated emails when customers take certain actions on your website , like visiting a particular product page , abandoning a shopping cart or downloading a free report . These timely communications keeps your brand fresh on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters most . In a nutshell : sales and upsells increase . <p> Improved B2B relationship management : - Its estimated that more than half of a B2B buyers decision making process is done before they reach out to sales . Buyers are learning as much as they can before contacting companies . With marketing automation , you can indirectly guide the flow of information and make prospects more comfortable buying from you . <p> Insight on how far along a prospect is in the sales cycle : - Get insight into where a prospect has been on your website and how closely aligned a prospect is with your core demographic . Does this person meet all the demographics of people who typically buy from you ? Has this person been to your pricing page ? Should you send a special offer ? Or does this prospect need more information before receiving a sales offer ? <p> Base analysis on cross-channel trends : - Make predictive analysis based on sound data regarding which channels give you best bang for your buck . See which actions are most predictive of sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Learning Curve . <p> Even though 65% of marketers admitted they could be doing a better job staying in touch with consumers , only 13% said marketing automation was a priority . According to- CIO Magazine , - the problem is that " marketers are undergoing a crash course in emerging marketing technology that is upending their profession , and their education is lagging . " Autopilot CEO Mike Sharkey said that " 44% of the people who werent using marketing automation did n't  even know what it was ! " It can be a costly endeavor to get started with marketing automation when your marketers do n't  understand the dashboard , the capabilities and how to adjust their work habits . Rather than getting to know a program inside-and-out , marketers are more likely to abandon platforms to defer accountability .

Do you have products that compete with similar products from other brands ? Give your audience side-by-side comparisons , in-depth reporting on new offerings , and teaser videos that help explain product benefits and features .

" Furthermore , having the right technology helps businesses scale up their data collection , organization , leads and sales .

" - When you boil it all down , the choice to invest in technology makes sense . Who would n't want business to be easier more automated and guided by research ? <h> Factors In Choosing The Right Marketing Tech Vendor <p> As you well know , one major obstacle is the number of tech providers out there . Were not talking hundreds but THOUSANDS . Its like browsing your iPhones app store ENDLESS . Some of the options are all-in-one software , whereas others are focused on a particular niche like SEO or social media management . <p> Ultimately , what we tell people , is that there is no " one right answer " . Your choice of technology stack is a very personal matter . For nearly all- businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start . From there , you may choose to round out your marketing tech based on need . In choosing " the big guy , " you 'll need to consider factors like : <p> How big do you need to go ? - Smaller businesses can find all they need with affordable , easy-to-use- marketing automation software like Hatchbuck , Infusionsoft or Act-On , whereas bigger enterprises may want the advanced functionality of platforms HubSpot , - Marketo , Eloqua , or Pardot . <p> How much does it cost ? - You can pay as little as nothing or upwards of $10,000/month for a single program . ( You do n't  even want to know what we pay all our vendors to power our clients campaigns and deliver strong ROI for them ! ) Different companies price their packages based on different variables . For instance , the number of contacts in your database governs how much you pay for Pardot , Salesfusion , Marketo and Eloqua , whereas Act-On prices based on the number of active contacts you manage per month and companies like Hubspot or Infusionsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent per month . <p> Can you scale ? - You may not need much now , but realities can change in a hurry . Most marketing tech offers low-cost , entry-level packages to win clients . As seductive as that may be , you want to make sure you can size up to another level or additional features in the future . VBOUT recommends assessing tech providers by : the number of contacts , outbound emails , users , domains and pages tracked , and marketing impressions allowed each month . Can you add more users or contacts to your database later ? This matters A LOT unless you do n't  mind returning to square one as your company evolves . <p> What features do you- need ? - If you just need to track ad performance , maybe all youd want is to tap the power of- Google Analytics . Likewise , if its just email marketing you 're after , you may want Constant Contact , MailChimp , or aWeber. - Or try Leadpages if you just need to slap up a quick , high-converting landing page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@49968305 @3468305/ <h> The 3 Pillars of SEO in 2015 <p> Weve seen a lot of changes to the SEO landscape over the past year . Perhaps one of the biggest is the shift from keyword prominence to the importance of social sharing . Although targeted keywords are still extremely important and will always be the core of any SEO strategy , quality matters big time ! Weve heard quality over quantity a million times before and that phrase definitely rings true for SEO in 2015 .

@@49968325 @3468325/ <h> 3 Ways To Improve Digital Marketing For Financial Services <p> Digital marketing for financial services represents the most affordable and effective way to reach out to new and existing clients . Naturally , you want to reach people where they like to hang out . These days , email , social networks and video sharing platforms are capturing more and more of your prospects free time . <p> The banking industrys presence on social media networks increased 31 percent last year , according to- a recent- Marketo blog post . Even so , the- NY Timesreported- that banks have been slow to embrace social technologies and that the 50 largest banks had strategies that were " amateurish " at best . These " social media wallflowers " often create profiles , but let them sit idly . They miss friend requests , fail to post regularly to engage users , and fail to communicate directly with users who contact them via social media . Research conducted by Scorpio Partnership found that 40% of high-net-worth clients under age 50 viewed social media as " an important channel for communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Financial service providers must improve their social media strategies or suffer countless missed opportunities . <p> A 170-page report from the McKinsey Global Institute titled- The Social Economy : Unlocking and Productivity Through Social Technologies- found that social media technology boosts marketing productivity , boosts a financial companys perceived value , and adds 5.2% to the companies revenues . Based on this report , we can glean three salient points on how a company can improve its digital marketing for financial services . <h> 1 . Use big data to customize your marketing approach . <p> Social - media can be a gold mine for consumer data . Who is getting married or having a child ? Who is buying a new car or starting a new job ? Who is interested in starting a retirement savings or refinancing a mortgage ? Clues are embedded in status posts . If you have a good analytics program associated with your social media pages , you can send out the right message at the right time to entice consumers with your financial services . <h> 2 . Interact with social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers who interact with companies via social media buy up to 40% more products and services from these companies . An infographic by Investment News- revealed that 66% of financial advisers over age 55 DO NOT use social media to connect with clients . By contrast , 47% of financial advisers under age 45 are engaging customers this way . A 2012 survey of 400 Facebook users found that 24% were willing to connect with their banks on a social site double the number of users willing to befriend their banks in 2008 . <p> So what we can glean from this data is that older financial advisers in particular are missing a huge opportunity and have much room to grow their businesses using platforms like Facebook and Twitter . Integrating social features into a bank website not only improves value for consumers , but also increases the amount of time spent on your site and improves loyalty over time. - Even if you do n't  know the first thing about these sites , a good digital marketing consulting firm can build and manage a presence for your business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire new customers . <p> Customer acquisition is a big investment for financial firms . The McKinsey report found that financial companies spend $70 to $300 to acquire each new customer . However , this cost can be reduced by up to 30% by using social technologies , they say . An illuminating- HubSpot- report found that the **27;86;TOOLONG services industry has the highest cost per customer at $303 . Not surprisingly , they are also the industry that struggles the most with acquiring customers through Facebook , with only 33% actively pursuing new clients that way . By contrast , 73% of companies in the retail/consumer goods sector acquire clients through Facebook , with the lowest cost-per-customer at just $22 . This is no accident ! Social media is truly the way to gain more prospects , while reducing your overall marketing expenditures.

@@49968333 @3468333/ <h> Off-Page SEO Checklist : Are you using these 10 strategies ? <p> There are two ways to improve your positioning on the Internet : on-page SEO ( which involves tweaking your website data and content ) and off-page SEO ( which involves using other websites to validate yours ) . As you may recall , we covered 10 on-page SEO tips to help you gain better search engine presence . Today well discuss what you can do to improve your search engine positioning through channels other than your own website . This is where you can really get into trouble if you 're not careful . Many spammy tactics are still widely used , but can get your site banished into obscurity . Here at Mod Girl Marketing , we ONLY use Google-approved , white-hat SEO- tactics that have proven to be effective . <h> - 1 . Social Media <p> Social media has become the centerpiece of an effective off-page SEO strategy . On Twitter , when another user retweets your post , the signal is sent back to search engines that you are a credible source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content via social media , your website receives a " credibility boost " which also helps your rankings . Expand your reach by creating a presence on Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , and LinkedIn . Each site has its own merits and fuels content in much the same way . If your brand is image heavy also utilize sites such as Instagram , Tumblr and Vine . <p> Hint : Use the actual URL of your blog post or page not a shortened link like bit.ly or goo.gl . While those links are great for testing and tracking purposes , they are not the best for SEO and building domain trust . It has been noted that some URL shorteners do pass " link juice " but to play it safe try using your actual website URL. <h> 2 . Blog- Promotion <p> Creating new blogs for clients is one of the main efforts we undertake here at Mod Girl Marketing . If your websites is currently not on the WordPress platform , we can sync a blog powered by WordPress with your main website for a seamless transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your main site except that it is technically a different website , so there is a continual link exchange between the two that helps tremendously with your SEO . If your website is already on the WordPress platform then you already have a built-in blog ! The blog itself would be considered an on-page SEO element , however blog promotion is considered off-page SEO . Blog promotion comes in many different forms including : - social bookmarking , social shares , and when other blogs mention your blog post in a link . <h> 3 . Videos <p> Sites like YouTube and Vimeo are helpful ways to promote a business , as they allow you to include keywords as " tags " and meta descriptions as well . If you do n't  have a professional videographer on staff , we can still create a compelling video for you from afar . Were also more than happy to promote any videos you 've had made in-house if they are just sitting on these sites , collecting dust . <h> 4 . Press Releases <p> Press releases are not just for major company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your industry to lend your professional viewpoint to late-breaking news stories and trends . You can conduct your own research or surveys to put your unique findings out into the ether and attract the eye of journalists who are searching the wires for an interesting story . <p> Hint : Include two links back to your website , optimize key areas like **27;175;TOOLONG , and blast your PR out all over your social media sites for maximum punch . Include photos and spend the time creating a fun information box that people will enjoy reading . Be careful though Google has cracked down on businesses who include " exact match " anchor text links in press releases . To be safe stick to the naked URL or common anchor text links like " here " and other generic keywords. - <h> 5. - Web 2.0 Properties <p> Web 2.0 properties are a great way to own more digital real estate while also improving your main websites search engine presence . Web 2.0 properties mainly consist of 3rd party blogs such as WordPress.com , Tumblr.com and Weebly.com , just to list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites out there . Here is a great list of the top 90 Web 2.0 websites <p> Hint : - Include 100% unique articles on your Web 2.0 websites . It is also recommended to include images and photos make sure they are all optimized too ! - <p> Another Hint : - Promote your Web 2.0 websites like you would your main website . Send social bookmarks and social signals to your new properties . This passes some serious " link juice " to your main website which helps boost your rankings ! <h> 6 . Documents <p> Rand Fishkin , CEO of Moz , recommends uploading helpful documents ( like PDF files and images ) to websites like Scribd , DocStoc , and Slideshare . Rand says , by linking to other websites in a slideshow , " I know I 'm making friends with everyone who is linked in my slideshow . They express thanks on Twitter and often reciprocate . In addition , there are 20 to 30% who will point back to articles I 've written or tools on my site , sending traffic back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hint : If you have image-heavy slideshow presentations , Slideshare automatically transcribes what you say into text , so its easier for search engines to find you . <h> 7 . Blog Commenting <p> You have to be careful with your blog commenting endeavors , as this is an area Google has really cracked down upon . Anything viewed as inherently spammy will penalize the site they are associated with . Comments are best written by savvy marketers who know how to write conversationally not robot software ! - <h> 8 . Social Bookmarking Sites <p> Social bookmarking sites like Digg , StumbleUpon , and Reddit helps your posts with fast Google indexing , improves Page Rank , delivers targeted traffic , and provide valuable DO-FOLLOW links . Be sure to check out the top social bookmarking sites listed here and take a few minutes to visit these sites regularly . <p> Hint : Do not promote every single post this way every time . Most of these sites have very strict rules about how often you can use the site as a promotional platform for your own content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to violate the terms &amp; conditions or you could be banned ! <h> 9 . Business Directories <p> With Googles Pigeon update this summer , business directory listings ( citations ) have never been more important . Local companies and national businesses alike can use sites like Yelp , Urban Spoon , Manta- and Google Plus- as high value backlinks that not only get you onto 1st page results with Google , but also improve brand recognition and build trust with consumers. - <p> Hint : Make sure all your information is listed , updated and accurate on these sites including address information , hours , etc . Also , add high quality photos to your listing and respond to reviewers on the site to add personalization . <p> Making sure all of your business citations are cohesive and updated takes a lot of work and requires a lot of time .

Now these sites are punished , so avoid association with them ! Guest blogging is still effective , but only if the website is high quality and respected by the digital community . Focus on cultivating real relationships with writers within your industry . Send your pitches for creative and interesting stories , and you 'll be surprised how easy it is to get quoted . <h> What SEO Tactics To Avoid In 2015 : <p> Googles Penguin algorithm change from April 2012 was aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of websites that violate Googles Webmaster Guidelines by using " now-declared black hat SEO techniques " that artificially increase a webpages rankings through link manipulation . Therefore , you 'll want to make sure you avoid the following : <p> Exact Match Anchor Text : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use " Kansas City Painting " multiple times as the anchor- text link . <p> - Optimized Anchor Text : - Do not use the same- anchor over and over . Try to use different anchor texts for every link and include naked URLs as anchor text links as well . It is also smart to use generic anchor text like " here " and " website " in order to avoid over-optimization . <p> - Paid Links : - Overly sponsored links that are on Googles radar are now punished . <p> Irrelevant Links : - A KC painting company would not want a link on a pet food site linking back to them , as this makes no sense and triggers a red flag . <h> Want More Help ? <p> Mod Girl Marketing offers full service search engine optimization , both on-page and off-page SEO , to businesses in various industries .

With all these dang animal updates how does one keep up ! ? ! Very good question its called we do n't  sleep ! = Just kidding , but seriously it is not an easy job keeping up with Google <p> So first it was the cute little- Panda : <p> From Entrepreneur.com <p> and now its the cute little Penguin : <p> From Entrepreneur.com <p> So what do all these Google zoo updates really mean ? Is SEO dead ? <p> SEO is definitely not dead but it is for sure changing before our very eyes. - Entrepreneur.com did a great job at explaining some of the Penguin changes : <p> 1 . Overly-optimized sites will continue to be targets.Based on Googles stated interest in stopping sites that intentionally manipulate the natural search engine results pages ( SERPs ) from ranking well , its my expectation that well continue to see future algorithm changes designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  over-optimize your site , " is n't realistic , as there 's no way to know which specific optimization metrics Google is able to measure and track . Its also not possible to determine where the line between effective on-page SEO and over-optimization will be drawn . <p> For now , the best approach appears to be focusing on the quality of your site in terms of visitor interactions , content value and other on-site elements not over employing complex SEO techniques designed to boost rankings . <p> 2 . Visitor engagement matters more than ever.Another factor that I expect to be important in future ranking algorithm updates is the level of visitor engagement occurring on a site . Since Google promotes the sites that its users will find valuable , one might assume that sites that demonstrate high engagement will be rewarded in future updates . <p> Again , the specific metrics that the Google can detect and track in order to measure visitor engagement are n't  immediately apparent . As a general rule , a few of the specific items webmasters should focus on are the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 . Content quality will grow in importance.Although Google has made no secret of its desire to reward high-value content with top SERPs rankings , too many webmasters still rely on keyword-optimized or copied-and-pasted content to fill their pages . <p> Even if your site wasnt affected by the Panda or Penguin updates , you should n't assume that you 're safe . Google has made every indication that it intends to weed out low value results from the search results . Getting your content quality up now offers one of the best opportunities to protect your site from future changes . <p> If you have backlinks ( links to your site from others ) , and those backlinks are on websites that are poorly optimized , the Penguin will start a fight with you ! True story , and trust us the Penguin NEVER LOSES ! So if you have a link on XYZ.com and XYZ.com has a bunch of spammy links and it totally over-optimized that can- SEVERELY- hurt your website rankings .

The pop star proves that rebranding can be a valuable tool for artists and businesses alike . <h> The New " Britney Jean " <p> This year , Britney will soon release her 8th studio album , titled- Britney Jean. - The songs caught the attention of Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas who booked her for a 100-show residency through 2015 . With this album , Spears told fans , " I want to show you a different side of myself .

Despite her celebrity media blowout , the- UK Guardian- reports that the " Britney brand has been re-built , media access carefully controlled ; her hair has grown back , her latest album has sold millions , she is back on the Forbes list of the most powerful celebrities , and has won shared custody of her children .

After shaving her head , she checked into a rehab facility and let her dad manage the estate for a while . She stopped driving around with her baby on her lap , she stopped partying with Paris and Lindsey , she stopped vomiting in front of paparazzi , she stopped flashing her genitalia , and she stopped attacking photographers . If a business is suffering from an image problem , its best not to continue fighting petty arguments with competitors or angry trolls on social media . You may need to erase the old websites entirely and start rebuilding from scratch . <p> 2 . She laid low for a little while. - Fans waited a long four years for the release of- Blackout- in 2007 . Even though it boasted a commendable modern and innovative sound , Spears did not heavily promote the album with magazine interviews , talk show appearances or tours . It was a quiet release that piqued peoples interest and managed to sell over 3 million copies worldwide .

Its possible to build a brand that stands on its own two feet by offering stellar products , expert customer service , helpful content , and a handsome website . <p> 3 .

In recent years , she has worked with Miley Cyrus , Katy Perry , Will.I.Am , Naughty Boy , William Orbit , The Black-Eyed Peas , Sebastian Ingrosso , Sia Furler , and Madonna to name a few . These collaborations have helped her push her sound to new levels and keep an edgy sound that audiences cant get enough of . Businesses can stay fresh by consulting with outside agencies about their image and assembling ideas from their workers about how to best move forward .

She knew she could n't emerge with a watered-down product . She needed to spend time on polishing the perfect product . By the same token , businesses should consult experts and do their image right . It may have been fine to work with a college intern on the old website or have one person trying to do all the social media marketing on top of other duties . This time around , you need a team of dedicated professionals vested fully in the re-branding efforts . <p> 5 . She expanded her empire. - In addition to music , Britney offers fans fragrances , dolls , apps , video games and clothing . These calculated moves have brought more money to her empire and ensured that she will leave a lasting legacy behind .

The value of social media in terms of product choice , brand loyalty , targeted lead generation , customer service and reputation is indisputable .

Its a suggestion backed by evidence , really. - A- Kissmetrics- study revealed that questions receive 100% more comments than regular posts . People on social media like to give their opinions and share their interests with friends and family , so asking the right question at the right time appeals to that sentiment . However , you may find that you 've been asking questions to no avail . Still you 're confronted with dead silence . What gives ? <p> As- Constant Contact- points out , these common mistakes can derail the most well-intentioned queries : <p> You 're not willing to put in the time and effort to build community over time . <p> Remember , first and foremost , love is a two-way street .

Developing a strategy for these sites can be daunting , since it will require emphasis on visual storytelling . Yet , professional images can take you far . Consider that fashion/retail brands on Pinterest average 46 repins for every post .

@@49968343 @3468343/ <h> HitTail Review : How to Use Long Tail Keywords for SEO Success <p> Although I have been helping clients tackle their search engine optimization needs for over a decade , I am still constantly on the lookout for new ways to ramp up rankings and maximize my organic search traffic . Long-tail keywords are not a new phenomenon , but sadly , they are not utilized to their full potential . Since SEO has the biggest impact on lead generation , jumping on the long-tail bandwagon is the smart thing to do . This is where HitTail comes into play . <p> Most comparable tools on the market ( like Google Keyword Planner , WordTracker , Keyword Discovery , etc. ) ask you to type some of your search term ideas into a search box to receive suggestions on similar terms . HitTail differs in that it actually analyzes your existing site to gauge performance and helps you identify " low-hanging fruit " the long-tail keywords with the lowest competition that you can easily rank for . <h> Benefits of Using HitTail <p> If you 've ever been frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , then this is the stripped-down , bare-bones tool for you ! HitTail gives you two statistics : - the top 10 keywords- and suggested- long-tail keywords. - Thats all you need to know what you should be writing about and , in turn , start seeing your web traffic increase considerably . There are no segmented demographics to ponder just answers to your most basic questions : How many people are visiting my site this month ? How many people have visited my site to date ? How many people will visit my site this month ? What keyword path are they taking to get here ? <p> As- NotAGrouch.com- points out , you can also check the stats to see which phrases to avoid in your writing , as you 'll probably find that some of your traffic arrives from a very strange pathway ( and subsequently bounces off the page rather quick because your site was not at all what they were looking for ) . <p> According to WeRockYourWeb.com , one benefit that makes HitTail worth paying for ( as opposed to your free Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the " Not Provided " keyword reporting limitation . No one involved in SEO will forget the trouble that the " Do Not Track " protocol first caused .

HitTail , on the other hand , does capture all these hidden keywords , although you still wont be able to see referral sources or conversion tracking data . <h> Why Long-Tail Keywords ? <p> Long-tail keywords are one of the best , proven- ways to quickly gain top search engine rankings via blogging and other forms of content marketing . I know when I write my blogs , I want people to read them !

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without analyzing what your audience is looking for . <h> How To Get Started Using HitTail <p> Using HitTail is pretty simple . By connecting my Google Webmaster Tools ( GWT ) , I gave HitTail the insiders view of the search traffic my website is already receiving daily from Google . In turn , HitTail used this real-time data to suggest the most favorable keywords that I should be targeting for future blog articles or working on to improve rank . <p> HitTail breaks down this information into an easy-to-understand format , giving me new long-tail keywords that are extensions of the existing search terms already used to find my website . Many times I do n't  even realize people are indeed searching for these obscure longer-tail keywords . <h> The Best Part ? <p> Results are ultimately what determines such a products worth and , for us , the results have been fantastic .

Recently , Matt Cutts spoke about tweaks to the Google algorithm and how they 're evolving online search capabilities . All of this is VERY relevant and important for your business as you look to maintain relevance and position in the search engine results . <h> Content <p> Once upon a time , brands were using programs called " article spinners " to change out a few words and republish almost identical pieces of content online . Another method was to use outsourced writers in developing countries or low-level copywriters to alter the structure of the article and make the wording more " unique . " <p> According to Cutts , Google is hunting for truly unique content that adds value . They often stumble across sites with content that mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they bring nothing new to the table , " he explains . On one hand , these publishers are n't  doing anything wrong but they also should n't expect to rank well for simply copying another sites content and business model. - He says that the best sites will feature content from ones own experience and first-hand knowledge to deliver content that is one-of-a-kind . <h> Branding <p> Small Businesses : - Its a popular misconception that Google rewards their advertisers with improved rankings . Large brands do have an advantage in that they possess the manpower and the capital to churn out large amounts of fresh , unique content . However , Cutts explains that smaller brands can build a reputation online by establishing authorship , creating valuable content , social networking , promoting review sites and link-building . <p> Large Businesses : What about a chain that owns many different locations ? How should a business owner handle content creation ? One problem big brands run into is that they use the same product / service description on every location website which ranks as Duplicate Content ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 sentences about what is unique to that location and they should be fine , " advises Cutts . Any articles or blogs on the site should be completely original . <h> Infographics <p> While the concept of an infographic is great , Cutts says he s concerned about people who do not fact-check and mislead people . Wheres the value in that ? Cutts advises , " Any infographics you create will do better if they 're closely related to your business , and it needs to be fully disclosed what you are doing . "

@@49968389 @3468389/ <h> New Domain Structures Could Eliminate the Need for Google in 2012 ? <p> I came across this very interesting article recently on the new plan for domain name structure and how it could change the SEO industry forever . Not only that , but it could decrease our need for Google .. yes that 's right , you may not need Google 5 years from now ! I still find it hard to believe , but nevertheless this info is very , very interesting and could definitely change the search engine marketing game foreverespecially in the local markets . This new process is said to start in January 2012 . <p> It may be unlikely that well ever see a search engine-less world again , but by January 2012 , Google and other search engines may begin to become less and less necessary . According to PCMag.com , The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) has approved a plan for new domain name structures , including domain extensions-and it could impact the way people find sites on the web . <p> Sponsor text : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Datastar with powerful new tools for maximizing your research and results . Click Here to for more information . <p> Rather than URLs ending in the usual . com , companies will have the choice to end domain names with a specific region , classification , company , etc . Kenneth C. Wisnefski , founder and CEO of WebiMax , a search engine optimization ( SEO ) company , says this means " niche " searching will be possible . The purpose of this switch , according to a WebiMax press release is to " add personalization " and to " help classify genres of websites into consolidated groups . " <p> But how do search engines figure into ( or out of ) this ? With the new structure in place , searching would be possible directly in the browser and therefore remove the middleman , which in this case is the search engine . " So now you may go to Google and you might type in restaurants in New York City and in a few years you may go directly to your browser and put in restaurants.nyc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the potential to be much more relevant and clearly organized . " Google may not be utilized as much because people will go directly to that domain to find something in situations like that , " Wisnefski says . He also stressed the importance of being able to search by location and region , connecting people to needed information about their surroundings more easily and efficiently . <p> " You can really target your localized traffic and target your search to something like restaurants.nyc , ' " says Wisnefski . While domain extensions will benefit the users , the SEO and search engine industry may have some difficulties ahead of them . <p> " This can work well for organizations that embrace this idea and want to characterize their organization by domain name , however , search engine optimization firms will be challenged with how a deviation from the norm will factor in on ranking webpages , " says Wisnefski . " I suspect search engines , including Google , will address the new structure and discuss what this means for their search algorithms . " <p> Whatever benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain names , they do n't  come cheap . Applicants must pay a $185,000 evaluation fee , with $5,000 upfront and for that pricey reason , issues such as domain squatting could be all but eliminated . " There 's a lot of regulation that goes into it , " says Wisnefski . People , places , and corporations must meet the right criteria and provide certain documentation to prove that they are in fact the one who should own the domain . " For example , New York City would be a great one to own but if I went in and said I want to own . nyc , I probably would n't be able to get it because there would be specific requirements that I would n't be able to meet , " he adds . <p> Acquiring one of these domains is not just a costly endeavor , but also a lengthy process , taking between 8 and 18 months . Of course , this all relies on companies actually adopting the new structure , and with the hefty price tag associated with these personalized domain names , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Starting on January 12 , 2012-and running until April 12-companies will be able to start the application process . <p> So , although this new concept could change the SEO game forever , I doubt it will change anything soon . With a hefty $185,000 evaluation fee I highly doubt local and small businesses will be jumping at this opportunity in 2012 . I think Google as we know it will be here for at least a few more years , although it will still continue changing the algorithms and features . Another point to make is that we are so accustomed to " Google-ing " that it is going to take a major shift in thinking to change our Google habit . Even when the . kc and . nyc and . nike domain extensions are available , are you really going to remember to type in " restaurants.kc " instead of " Google-ing " " restaurants kc " or " womens nike shoes " ? ? Google has become as much of our routine as brushing our teeth can we really change our routine overnight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these changes to have a huge impact on SEO , if they ever will .. at least that is my 2 cents . = What do you think ?
