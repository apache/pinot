@@78539016 @39016/ <h> A review of Dollar Shave Clubs $140m online marketing strategy <p> The Dollar Shave Club has been the focus of many- case studies since it launched in 2012 with a- revolutionary viral video- that generated 12,000 new customers in the first 48 hours , growing to 330,000 customers by 2013 , and on track to generate $140 million this year . <h> A pure sales funnel <p> The entire Dollar Shave Club is one big sales funnel , with every page of the website driving people to the 3-step order process . <p> The website is simple only 6 pages in total ( excluding pages like Blog , Privacy , Terms etc ) with a singular focus get the visitor into the 3-step order process wherever they are on the site . <p> Dollar Shave Club 's website is a shining example of how to convert visitors into buyers . Let 's take a look at the website in detail to see why <h> Home page <p> What 's interesting about the Dollar Shave Clubs- home page is that every section of the home page links to the same page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great way to promote different sales points without distracting the customer from buying . <p> The only frustrating part of this site is that the Free Blades For Life banner in the header area links to Step 1 of the Order Process , even though the information on- how to get free blades for life is in the banner- at the bottom of the home page. - I recommend fixing this to reduce the friction that is caused when visitors- do n't  receive- the information theyre- looking for after- clicking this element . <p> Let 's take a look at a predictive eye-tracking analysis of the home page <p> As you can see from the heatmap , attention is focused on the video and the 2 sections below the video , with the main call-to-action Do It barely visible on first glance . <p> But that does n't  really matter , because every section on the page ( except the video ) directs the visitor to Step 1 of the Order- Process . <p> Let 's take a look at a- perception map to see- which sections are instantly visible when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first things a visitor sees when they land on the site is a testimonial of how much a customer has saved with Dollar Shave Club . What 's great about this is that its a customer who is saying how much they saved , not Dollar Shave Club . <p> After- seeing- the testimonial , the visitors- eyes are drawn to the Our Blades section that quickly shows the visitor how much the blades cost , which is excellent . <p> When a visitor has seen the video and the 2- main sales points , they are likely engaged with the site and will continue to engage with the rest of the home page and either click the main call-to-action Do It or one of the 3 sections . <p> Either way , it does n't  matter because the visitor is taken to Step 1 of the Order Process regardless of what they click . <p> Love it . <h> Order Process <p> This is a classic online sales funnel where a visitor is already in the checkout before they even know it . <p> Let 's take a look at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of the site links to this page . <p> The headline Be Bold talks to an emotion rather than to a feature , which connects with visitors on a deeper level than a feature would . Its also a fun- play on words ( ie bold vs bald ) . <p> The sub-headline then personifies the razors and continues the emotional connection with the visitor . <p> The layout is excellent , with all 3 options visible above the fold , and pricing clearly visible on the product image . <p> Details of each subscription are listed below the Select button for each product , with an option to show more details. - I 'm not sure why they made this clickable , as there is n't a lot of information there and it would make sense to show all the features without clicking . It might be because fewer features are easier to scan , to make it easy for someone to browse and then expand upon if they 're interested . <p> Let 's take a look at a predictive eye-tracking analysis of Step 1 of the Order Process <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is great . I also really like that the sub-headline gets some attention as well , as the word mighty suggests that the razors are sturdy . <p> Let 's take a look at a- perception map to see- what sections are visible when a visitor lands on the page <h> Step 2 <p> Once a visitor selects the razor subscription they want to purchase , they are taken to this page <p> I love this page . Its clear , simple , and you can either sign up with Facebook ( which is awesome ) or with an email + password . <p> I would always give users the option of signing up with Facebook and ensure they do n't  need to enter a password once they have ( I cant tell you how many sites I try to sign up with Facebook , only to have me select a password once Ive connected very frustrating ) . <p> We already know this is a well laid-out page , but let 's take a look at a predictive eye-tracking analysis anyway <p> Nothing more to say on this page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Step 3 <p> Once a visitor has signed up , they 're taken to the payment page ( the last step in the process ) <p> This is a really well-designed page , for a number of reasons : <p> The product being purchased ( and its price ) is clearly visible <p> The 100% Satisfaction Guarantee is right next to the price <p> They connect with their customers on an emotional level with the 3 inspirational quotes <p> The Credit Card section includes a lock symbol to show the buyer that the checkout is secure <p> They ask for the minimum amount of information to complete the purchase <p> The call-to-action Check Out is clearly visible <p> They include the Norton Secured badge near the Check Out button to give the buyer extra comfort with entering their credit card information <p> All links are removed from the page ( ie header navigation , footer navigation etc ) so the buyer can do nothing else but complete their purchase . <p> here 's a predictive eye-tracking analysis of the payment page <p> And here 's a perception map of the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page is designed and laid out well , making it easy for the buyer to complete their purchase . <h> Viral Loop <p> A viral loop is a marketing mechanism where customers are used to bring in more customers by sharing Dollar Shave Club- with their friends in exchange for something of value . <p> Dollar Shave Club offers their customer a free month of razors for every referral that signs up for their service , and they include this offer in a number of points after purchase to encourage sharing . <h> Thank You page <p> On the page after the order is completed , customers are presented with the option to share on Facebook , Twitter and by email to get free razors <h> Email receipt <p> The message is repeated in the receipt that is emailed after the purchase is completed <h> Account page <p> And its a big focus of the Account page , where customers can manage their subscription . <p> Theyve even gamified their referral program with their Free Shave Meter <p> This is growth hacking at its best . <h> The viral messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you click on the share icons <h> Email share message <h> Facebook share message <h> Twitter share message <p> All of the messages are in line with their brand , and they leverage their most successful viral video for customers who want to share on Facebook ( to maximise engagement ) . <h> Cancellations <p> Another really important part of Dollar Shave Clubs success is their Cancellation process . <p> Why ? <p> Because every customer you prevent from cancelling is additional revenue in your pocket without the cost of acquiring that customer again . <p> here 's the Membership Options- page ( notice how they do n't  call it Cancel Membership ? ) <p> Instead of just taking a customer to the cancellation page , Dollar Shave Club gives the customer the option to reduce their subscription to once every 2 months , rather than monthly . Great thinking . <p> And if the customer still wants to cancel , they click on Other Options and are taken to this page <p> I really like how they have continued the emotional wording in the headline ( ie Go . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the customer is- cancelling . <p> One point of improvement ( there are n't  many in this review ) is that when someone selects one of the options ( eg unsatisfied with your service ) , Dollar Shave Club should try to answer their objection and give them another offer - say for example Why not give us a call at xxx-xxx-xxxx ? We 'd love to talk this through with you . Or giving them a bigger discount to stay . Definitely something to test . <p> I also like that its not really easy to find where to cancel . You can definitely find it with a couple of clicks , but they make it a little hard to find out how to cancel , which is good for reducing the cancellation rate . <h> How It Works page <p> I really like how the how it works page uses imagery to explain how the service works , rather than text . Its a lot more engaging and keeps the visitor clicking . <h> Our Blades page <p> I wanted to include this page as its essentially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vertical layout rather than horizontal . <p> I wonder why they chose to include this page when its so similar to Step 1 of the Order Process . Maybe its to test a different layout . Maybe they want to show all the information about each product on a page that is n't directly part of the sales funnel . <h> Not mobile-friendly ! <p> I was- really surprised to see that the website was not mobile-friendly . <p> here 's how it looks on an iPhone 6 <p> I had to triple check that I was n't missing something here , especially because of the phenomenal- success ( and traffic ) that they receive from social media and the fact that most people access social media via their smartphone ! <p> I 'm not sure how they missed this , but its definitely something to fix urgently . <p> Note : if you 're from Dollar Shave Club , get in touch with me via LinkedIn and I 'd be happy to design you a mobile / responsive website in exchange for a lifetime supply of razors- : ) <h> The marketing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies on how to leverage video and social media to drive massive growth for a business . <p> When they first launched , their viral videos were the reason they grew so quickly .

@@78539022 @39022/ <h> Online Marketing Review #1 : Granite Consulting <p> Granite Consulting is an IT Recruitment firm based in Melbourne . I came across them in the BRW 2013 Fast Starters list article , where they ranked in the #3 spot with $15,663,932 in revenue , up 22% from the previous year ! These guys clearly have a great business model and are going places . <p> So what are they like online ? Well , I checked them out and was surprised at what I did ( and did n't find ) . After reviewing their online presence in detail it became obvious to me that their growth was not based on their online marketing strategy which means significant lost opportunity . <p> Sidenote : this is one of a series of reviews of websites in a range of different industries online . We normally charge for these types of strategic reviews but I 'm giving them away for free . Why ? Because at Web Profits we want to change the way business is done online and the first step is showing you ( in detail ) how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business or in this case Granite Consulting . <p> Here 's a full breakdown of my review <h> How I would improve their website <h> Home page banner <p> This is a common mistake I see all the time . Their banner has no headline and no call-to-action ( plus you ca n't actually click it ! ) , which means a poor user experience for new visitors to the site . <p> The first thing I would do is add a headline that clearly explains what they do in less than 3 seconds , with a button that directs them to the most important page on their website ( ie the page that converts their most important prospect into a sales lead ) . <p> To further illustrate my point , here 's a predictive eye tracking analysis we ran using EyeQuant ( to learn more about the accuracy of this analysis , click here to download the EyeQuant Accuracy Evaluation PDF ) . <p> As you can see , in the first 3 seconds the visitor will see the logo , the images in the main banner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button , but is n't ) and the headline Welcome to Granite Consulting ' . As a new visitor to the site , you do n't really know what they do unless you really look around . <h> Home- page headline <p> This is another common mistake I see all the time using a headline that says Welcome to ( company name ) ' . <p> Visitors that land on your website will know what the company name is by looking at the logo ( which is the first thing users see when they land there ) . <p> With that in mind , the headline should clearly explain what Granite Consulting does , so that first time users know what the company does within 3 seconds . <h> Change the layout of the home page <p> The home page is the window to the rest of the website . The aim of a home page should be to quickly explain what the company does , and make it as easy as possible for visitors to find the page they 're looking for ( the exception is where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get away with a landing-page style home page instead ) . <p> With that in mind , I would use a different layout altogether for this home page . Here 's what I suggest <h> What I 've changed <p> Banner As you can see from this wireframe , there is a clear headline that instantly let 's visitors know what the site is about , a sub-headline that expands on the main headline , and a main call-to-action to drive enquiries , with a second call-to-action to learn more about the company . <p> Below the banner Underneath the main banner are the main sections of the site , laid out in an easy to scan format so visitors can quickly find what they 're looking for . <p> Testimonial I 've also added a testimonial to the bottom of the page to add credibility ( this is optional as the selling ' happens on the internal pages ) . <p> Navigation I have simplified the navigation to follow a logical order of the most to least important pages , with About Us and Contact Us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I have put less important pages in a secondary navigation above the phone number . <p> Phone number I 've added a phone number to the top right of the page to make it as easy as possible for visitors to call , as well as using up wasted space above-the-fold . <p> Call-to-action- there is another call-to-action at the bottom of the page to ensure that the visitor has somewhere to go if they 've scrolled all the way down . <h> Change the layout of internal pages <p> I mentioned earlier that the home page is the window to the rest of the website , to allow visitors to quickly find what they are looking for so they click through . <p> There is n't much selling ' happening on the home page because that 's not the place for it the internal pages are where the selling happens . <p> If you think about the user experience a visitor lands on the home page , finds the page they 're most interested in and then clicks on it . From there , you should give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , directly on that page , with a clear call-to-action driving them to take action . <p> Currently , the information is fragmented throughout the site , as follows <h> Services page <h> About Us page <h> Testimonials page <h> Sidebar <p> The sidebar of the internal pages is also quite distracting , especially because of the bright orange colour scheme <h> The new wireframe <p> So rather than having the Service information on one page , the About Us information on another , and the Testimonials on another , I 'd put it all on one page , like this <h> What I 've changed <p> Layout I 've changed the layout to a landing-page format , where the page is dedicated to selling one thing only in this case the Permanent Recruitment service . <p> Content I 've added the core messaging from around the rest of the website into the one page to give the visitor all the information they need to make the decision to take action ( Note : I would also get a sales copywriter to redo all of the copy to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no duplicate content between pages , which can negatively affect SEO ) . <p> Testimonials I 've added testimonials just before the call-to-action to enhance credibility before the call-to-action is presented . <p> Nothing else there are no other distractions at the bottom of the page ( eg Sidebar , Twitter or Blog feed ) to ensure the prospect is not distracted at the critical time of conversion . <h> Responsive Design <p> With the growth of mobile usage in Australia on the rise , having a mobile-friendly website is critical in providing a positive user experience to visitors no matter how they access your website . <p> Currently the website does not adjust to mobile devices , so converting it to a responsive design will instantly improve performance from mobile visitors . <h> How I would improve their online marketing <p> I 'm assuming that their online marketing would be focused on attracting clients rather than candidates , as most candidates will be attracted via LinkedIn or Seek . <p> With that in mind , here 's how I would target clients <h> Search Engine Marketing <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best place to start because prospects searching are in the middle of the buying cycle , which means the time to sale is a lot shorter than other marketing channels . <p> Here 's a quick breakdown of the search volumes for keywords- related to the Granite Consulting offering , identified using the Google Keyword Tool , limited to Victoria : <h> Google Adwords <p> There 's enough search volume to start- running ads on Google Adwords ( note : at the time of writing this article , I could not find Granite Consulting advertising on any of these keywords ) . <p> But as the cost-per-click for these types of keywords are quite high , I would only start advertising once the website has been updated as per my suggestions above to ensure the conversion rate is as high as possible . <p> Let 's take a quick look at the numbers to see why : <p> Keyword : recruitment agencies melbourne <p> Cost-per-click $3.14 <p> Why the conversion rate ( CR ) is important : <p> 100 visitors costs $314 ( ie 100 x $3.14 ) <p> @1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead ) <p> @2% CR , cost per lead = $157 ( ie 2 leads ) <p> @3% CR , cost per lead = $104.67 ( ie 3 leads ) <p> @5% CR , cost per lead = $62.80 ( ie 5 leads ) <p> The conversion rate not only reduces the amount you pay per lead , but it multiples the number of leads you receive within the same advertising spend . <p> I would also setup remarketing ads on the Google Display Network to advertise to prospects that visited specific pages on the Granite Consulting website but did n't convert , with the aim of convincing them to come back to the website to submit an enquiry . <h> SEO <p> Once the Google Adwords campaign is up and running , and the traffic and conversions are coming through , I would look at starting an SEO campaign to build upon the Google Adwords traffic . <p> The campaign would target both the transactional keywords targeted on Google Adwords , as well as informational keywords used by candidates during their job search process . <p> Here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares to the top ranked competitors on the keyword recruitment agencies melbourne ' ( which has the highest search volume ) : <p> adecco.com.au , 783 referring

As at todays date , there are 29,606 LinkedIn members that fit this targeting . <p> Ideally , a responsive landing page would be created to promote a free offer because , in our experience , free offers work best with LinkedIn Ads ( eg industry report , free consultation etc ) . <h> That 's just the beginning <p> The marketing tactics I 've outlined are the very first areas I would advertise the Granite Consulting website to generate new business , but that 's just the beginning . <p> The full power of online will only be harnessed by a multi-channel online marketing strategy that integrates search engine marketing , social advertising , email marketing , and remarketing . <h> Disclaimer <p> I have not been in touch with anybody from Granite Consulting ( yet ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are trying to achieve online .

@@78539023 @39023/ <p> Domestic flights in Australia are big business , - with Jetstar generating $3.46B in revenue and Virgin Australia Domestic generating $3.31B in revenue in the 2015 financial year . <p> With 58 million passengers carried- domestically in the last 12 months , the low-price airlines need to be super efficient with everything they do to ensure they stay profitable while offering the lowest fares in the market . <p> That- means every little thing they can do to reduce friction and make it easy for a customer to book and check-in to their flight will make a difference to their bottom line . <p> Making the online booking process as easy and frictionless as possible is one of those ways . <p> Not only does an increase in online bookings reduce the number of calls received by a call centre ( which reduces the staff costs required to staff- the call centre ) , it can also increase the number of people who book with the airline because of its ease of booking . Not to mention the revenue maximisation of strategically placed upsells in the booking process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two biggest players in the low-price airline war Virgin Australia and Jetstar to see which airline- has the better online booking system . <p> For the purposes of this review , I am going to book a flight from Sydney to Melbourne , and- I 'll be reviewing the following phases in the online booking process : <p> Which airline- makes it easiest to find flight details ? <p> Which airline- has the best flight details page ? <p> Which airline- has the best online checkout ? <p> Ill also be breaking it up into desktop and mobile , to see how each airline- adjusts to the fast growing mobile consumer market . <p> So , let 's get into it <h> Which airline- makes it easiest to find- flight details ? <p> The first step in the process is finding flight times and prices . Let 's take a look at which airline- makes this process the easiest . <h> Virgin Australia ( desktop ) <p> When you land on the Virgin Australia website the booking widget is the main element visible on the site <p> The main call-to-action Find Flights is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the page . <p> Your location is usually automatically selected from your computers location. - And when you click on the Origin field you can choose one of the Popular Routes <p> In this case , because- I am travelling from Sydney to Melbourne , I can just choose that route and- save a few clicks ( which is great ) . <p> It then automatically opens up the date selection field , where you can choose the date you 're leaving and the date you 're returning <p> When you 've chosen your destination and travel- dates , you choose the rest of your options and then- click Find Flights <p> When you click Find Flights a loading screen is displayed and then the flight details are presented on the next page . <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar ( desktop ) <p> When you land on the Jetstar home page , your location is automatically selected <p> I really like how they use the text from Sydney instead of just Sydney so its obvious that this is the origin . <p> I also like how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say it if you were speaking with someone . <p> When you click the to where ? field , you see the following options <p> I like how its all in alphabetical order , which means its easy to find what you 're looking for . But its not as good as Virgin Australias booking widget that displays popular routes in the menu options . <p> After you select your destination , you 're taken to a full screen calendar where you can select your departure date <p> And then the return date <p> I especially- like this format of date selection as its super easy to use , its really clear what you need to do next , and it moves seamlessly between the different fields . <p> From there you choose who 's going ? , and you have the plus and minus options to adjust the numbers- without having to use a dropdown menu , which can add extra friction to the process . <p> From there , a summary of your flight details is shown and you can click on Find Flights to get flight details <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to find flights . They used much friendlier wording , used full page fields , and made the entire process far more intuitive for a traveller to- choose their destination and travel dates . <p> The only thing that Virgin Australia did better was offer the Popular Routes option in their location menu . Aside from that , Jetstar did everything else better . <h> Takeaways <p> Choose wording you would use if you were speaking with them ( eg Whos going ? ) <p> If you 're using a multi-step form , try to make it as easy as possible for visitors to know what they have to do next by removing all distractions from the page , making it really clear what you want them to do next , and making it large enough so that its really easy to make a selection . <p> And if there is a common selection of options that most people use ( eg Sydney to Melbourne flight route ) , include them as a shortcut so they can move through your form faster . <p> Now let 's take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( mobile ) <p> When you first land on the Virgin Australia mobile site you 're presented with this popup <p> Virgin Australia uses a lot of email marketing around flight specials , so I 'm assuming this is adding value to their overall metrics . They also make it easy to close out with an x in the top right and red , underlined text that says No thanks , close this window . <p> here 's the actual home page <p> Its not as easy to see where to start the process of finding- flight details on the mobile home page . The Book menu item is there , but its not obvious on- the page , and it has the same weight on the page as Manage and Check-In . <p> If revenue generation is the main focus of this site , the Book option should be a lot more obvious , either by using a different colour , featuring it in the banner , or making it a major feature on the home page . <p> When you click Book , you 're taken to this page <p> Its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its also not as easy as their desktop site . <p> For example , they do n't  automatically show your location , even though its a lot easier to get that information from a smartphone user . <p> When you click the Origin field to select where you 're flying from , it just shows you everything in alphabetical order , with a search field <p> What happened to the Popular Routes option ? That was really helpful and now theyve removed it . And they 're not using my location to suggest the location to me . <p> Not very smooth . <p> The same thing happens for the Destination field <p> When you 've chosen your Origin and Destination , the field closes and you need to choose the flight dates <p> When you click on the date field , a calendar is presented to select your Departure Date <p> Where you can click on dates to select your travel dates <p> When the dates have been selected , the calendar closes and you need to select how many people are travelling <p> And then scroll down and click Find Flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have preferred the Find Flights button being- red so that its really- obvious what you needed to click . <p> When you click Find Flights you 're presented with flight details . <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar ( mobile ) <p> Heres Jetstars mobile home page <p> I really like this home page for a couple of reasons <p> Firstly , they suggest you- install / open their mobile app , for a faster and more streamlined experience , which is great . <p> And secondly , the menu is really clear with the Book Flights menu item front and centre so you can clearly see it when you land there . Jetstar could make it even more obvious by making the Book Flights option standout even more . <p> When you click on Book Flights you 're taken to this page <p> This page is a lot more user friendly that the Virgin Australia one- because the fields are much more obvious , the wording is a lot easier to understand , the menu items are much larger making it easier to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super obvious . <p> When you click on Choose Origin ( again , I 'm not sure why they just have n't automatically chosen Sydney because of my location ) you are presented with this page <p> This page has the same issue as the Virgin Australia one it does n't  include the most popular locations at the top , I need to scroll or search to find my location , and it does n't  suggest anything based on my location . <p> The date selector is similar to the Virgin Australia one <p> And when you click Done , you can review your flight details and then click Search to find flights . <h> The verdict ( mobile ) <p> Jetstars mobile site provided a better experience because it was a lot clearer what you needed to do to get flight details , the fields were a lot easier to select , and the wording was much friendlier . I also liked that they suggested you install / open their mobile app for an improved user experience . <p> Saying that , when you clicked on any of the fields ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same between Jetstar and Virgin Australia , so there is a lot that Jetstar can do to improve this part of the experience . <h> Takeaways <p> Make sure you focus your mobile home page on the most important thing you want your customers to do . <p> If you have a smartphone app , include the option to download the app when they land on your mobile site . <p> Make form fields as large as possible to make it easy for users to select the field . <p> And use contrasting colours and clear wording to make it easy for your visitors to understand what they need to do next . <p> Now let 's take a look at how easy it is to find a flight that suits <h> Which airline has the better flight details page ? <p> So weve just reviewed which airline- makes it easiest to find flight details , and Jetstar won that challenge . <p> Now let 's see which airline- has the best flight details page . <h> Virgin Australia ( desktop ) <p> here 's the page you see after you 've chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see the lowest price for days before and after- the day you 're flying , at the top of the page its a great way to quickly judge whether you should change your travel dates to save some money on flights . <p> Flights are ordered by departure time , which is likely the most common way travellers look for flights <p> But you can also sort by additional options , including price <p> There are callouts for flights that are Reduced , which really talks to the bargain hunters of the world ( and I do n't  know too many people who do n't  want to save money on flights ) <p> When you scroll your mouse over the flight you want to book , the tile changes to a call-to-action that says Choose Fare <p> And then when you click it you 're given the option to upgrade to a Flexi fare <p> All really intuitive so far . <p> From there you can click on the price to select the fare <p> A summary of your selection is displayed <p> And then you follow the same process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented with a summary of your flight details , with the option to book now and pay later , which will be offered on the following page <p> A summary of the booking is also on the right hand side of the page <p> When you 're done you click continue and your flight selection is done <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar ( desktop ) <p> here 's the page you see after selecting your destination and travel dates <p> I love how Jetstar uses- scarcity to drive action on their site . Its quite intimidating thinking that there are another 150 people looking at this same route . And even though there are a lot of flights on this day , and its not clear whether they are looking at that route for today or in general , it works . <p> Booking.com uses a similar scarcity tactic for hotels and destinations you 're looking at and I know it makes me want to secure my spot before somebody else does . <p> Jetstar has the same type of functionality as Virgin Australia , where they show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day you 've selected <p> Jetstars flights are also sorted by departure time but they also include the number of seats left on a flight if there are not many left , which adds even more scarcity to your decision <p> When you choose a flight , you 're presented with the following upgrade options <p> Jetstar uses a classic- selection comparison design to make you upgrade to the second option ( note : how this usually works is that you have 3 options , with the third option being really expensive and the second option looking like a bargain plus the design pushes the second option to be selected by the user its good stuff ) . <p> You follow the same process to book your return flight <p> And you 're presented with a Booking Summary at the end <p> When you 're done you click Continue and your flight selection is done . <h> The verdict ( desktop ) <p> So who has the better flight details page ? <p> Well , both- airlines use pretty much the same layout and design . The big difference is the scarcity elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more bookings than if they did n't  have it . <p> For that reason , my verdict is that the Jetstar flight details page is a better page . <h> Takeaways <p> If you have products that run out often , integrate scarcity widgets like the Jetstar one letting people know how many other people are looking at the same product they are looking at . <p> Also include number of items left in stock if there are less than 5 or 10 ( you probably want to test this out ) . <p> And if items are reduced , make sure to include callouts so customers can see which products are on special , because consumers always love a bargain . <h> Virgin Australia ( mobile ) <p> Now let 's take a look at how easy it is to find flights on the Virgin Australia mobile site . <p> here 's the page you 're taken to after you 've chosen your destination and travel dates <p> Its sorted by departure time but there is n't an option to change how its sorted . <p> When you click on a flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They use the reduced callout- on the page but only after you 've selected a flight . It would be a lot better if they had this as a callout before you clicked on the flight details . <p> When you select the flight you want , a red checkmark is displayed <p> You then need to scroll down the page and click Next Flight <p> And then follow the same process again to choose the returning flight <p> When you 're done you click continue and your flight selection process is done . <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar ( mobile ) <p> here 's the page you 're taken to after you select your destination and travel dates <p> Notice how they show you how many steps are in the process , at the top of the page ? <p> I also like how they use the wording Hot fare directly on this page , although they could make this standout more by using a different text colour . <p> When you select a flight , the text changes to orange and a green check mark is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but its not- the same type of design as on desktop ) <p> When you decide which flight you want you make your selection and then get a summary of the first flight <p> You then click Continue and do the same thing again for your return flight <p> When you 're done you review your full flight details and then click continue to finish with the flight selection process <h> The verdict ( mobile ) <p> Both airlines are pretty much the same here . The only difference between their process was that Jetstar used the word Hot fare on the first page , however its not enough to win this category . <p> The- flight details challenge on mobile is a draw . <h> Who has the better checkout process ? <p> So now we 've selected our flights and we want to checkout let 's see which airline- has the better checkout process . <h> Virgin Australia ( desktop ) <p> The first step in the process is to enter your details and then click continue <p> From there you have your seat selection <p> Once you choose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrades page <p> You can choose any of the options you want or you can just scroll to the bottom of the page and click continue . Of note , the order summary is always on the right hand side of the page . <p> On the next page you have the option of buying travel insurance ( another upsell ) <p> before you scroll down and enter your details to make payment and book your flight . <p> Virgin Australia has a pretty standard checkout process . Maybe a few too many upsells in the process however I 'm sure they 're tracking this and optimising offers , placement / inclusion of offers and flow . <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar ( desktop ) <p> here 's the page you 're taken to after you 've selected the flights you want to book <p> As you can see from this page , Jetstar asks you for all of your personal details AND tries to upsell you at the same time . I 'm not a fan of this I would rather break this up to- capture the details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- follow up . <p> What I do like about Jetstars checkout process is that you can Add or Remove options directly on the page <p> And this part is a little cheeky , but I 'm sure they 're driving additional revenue by charging people to receive a text message of their flight details <p> Again , here 's what it looks like when you add something to your order <p> And if you do n't  choose- checked baggage , a popup is displayed that sells you on why you should upgrade to checked baggage nice ! <p> When you 're done you click Continue and you 're taken to the seat selection page <p> where you can either choose your seats or skip seat selection . <p> When you click Continue you 're taken to another upsell page <p> where they try to sell you travel insurance , car hire and hotel bookings . <p> When you 're done you click Continue and you 're taken to the last page of the process <p> where they try to upgrade you to carbon offset and support a charity . <p> And if you leave the browser open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to speak with someone from customer service . <h> The verdict ( desktop ) <p> While Virgin did have a shorter number of steps in their checkout process , and just asked for the travellers information before trying to upsell them anything , the Jetstar checkout process was a lot more intuitive and easier to use . <p> Yes , Jetstar had more steps in the process and tried to upsell you more but it was a lot easier to see what was being offered , a lot easier to add and remove options , and I really liked how they used popups for support and to upsell checked baggage . <p> With that in mind , the winner of this challenge was Jetstar . <h> Takeaways <p> Capture customers contact details before asking them to upsell or make payment , so you can follow up with them if they abandon the checkout . <p> Use popups in the checkout to upsell products that align with what your- customer has selected . <p> Use a timed live chat widget to offer assistance in the checkout if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ( you can test out different timings to find the best one ) . <p> If you are going to use upsells , make it really easy to add and remove them from the cart . <p> And do n't  be afraid to test adding- multiple upsells to the checkout process . <p> Now let 's take a look at the mobile checkout <h> Virgin Australia ( mobile ) <p> here 's the page you see after you choose your flight <p> You enter your details and then scroll down and click continue <p> Again , I would have preferred the button was red so it was a lot more obvious but its not a big thing . <p> From there , you 're taken to the Travel Extras &amp; Payment page where you can review your order and make payment , on the one page <p> Its great that theyve condensed the checkout to just the most important parts of the checkout , as well as offering PayPal as a payment option , which is best practice for mobile commerce . <p> Now let 's take a look at Jetstar <h> Jetstar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you select your flights <p> You enter your contact details and click Continue to move to the next step , where they pre-select checked baggage for you for an additional price ( note : Virgin Australia includes it within the booking price ) <p> You click Continue to move on to the next step . <p> And if you do n't  choose checked baggage , they have a popup trying to upsell you on it <p> When you 're done you click Continue and you 're taken to the Meals upsell page <p> You 're then taken to the seat selection page , where seats are pre-selected <p> And if you want to choose your seats , the functionality is really easy to use <p> When you 're done you click Continue and you 're taken to the payment page <p> You can pay using PayPal , the order summary is easy to read , and when you 're done you click continue to secure your booking . <h> The verdict ( mobile ) <p> Virgin Australias checkout process is certain much shorter than Jetstars , which is good . But Jetstars checkout process has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fact that Virgin Australia does n't  offer seat selection on a mobile device ( and if they do I couldnt find it ) means that Jetstar definitely wins this challenge as well . <p> But its not just the seat selection that makes Jetstar the winner they use popups to upsell checked in baggage , they include upsell steps in the process that are easy to use , and they use contrast and font sizing well to make it easy to understand what you need to do next . 92713 @qwx712713 92714 @qwx712714 
@@78539035 @39035/ <h> A review of THE ICONICs online marketing strategy <p> I 'll give you a quick heads up that The Iconic is doing things pretty well when it comes to online marketing . <p> For those of you who do n't  know The Iconic , - its one of the biggest online retailers in Australia . Launched in 2011 , it has received more than $78 million in funding . <p> So what kind of online marketing does $78 million buy ? That 's what I- break down in this review . <p> Note : for the purpose of this review , I have reviewed the site as myself , looking to buy a hoodie and shoes plus I do n't  know that much about womens clothes ( aside from marketing them : ) ) <h> The Website <h> Home Page <p> The home page does well at keeping things simple . When you land on the site , there are essentially- two options above the fold Shop Women and Shop Men which means that the home page is all about directing the visitor to the section of the website that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heatmap of the home page : <p> And here 's an predictive eye tracking attention map : <p> As you can see from both of these analyses , the focus is on women ( as it should be with a online fashion retailer ) but its easy for men to find what they 're looking for as well . They have prioritised their visual hierarchy well . <h> Gender-Specific Home Page <p> The home page is almost like a splash page , directing visitors to select their gender so they can be redirected to the gender-specific home page . The real shopping experience starts once you 've selected your gender . here 's the gender-specific home page : <p> What 's interesting here is that- the main banner focuses the visitor on the different shoe categories , rather that promoting specific products . The Iconic likely knows ( via analytics and sales metrics ) that- shoes are the most popular category for men , so they feature the category in the first banner that appears . here 's a predictive eye tracking heatmap to show you how effective this is : <p> And here 's a predictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rest of the gender-specific home page promotes special offers , new arrivals , and latest trends , rather than showing any products ( eg Best Sellers ) . <h> The Category Page <p> The best part of the shopping experience is the Shopping Filter , which is consistent across the gender-specific home page , category pages and product pages , allowing you- to quickly filter through all of their products to find exactly what you 're looking for : <p> All category pages also include a line of best sellers within that category , with the ability to scroll sideways through them . <p> Best sellers are best sellers for a reason , and promoting them at the right time ( ie when a visitor has landed on the category of clothing they 're after ) is a great way to drive more sales . The other key features to The Iconics- seamless shopping experience is the ability to sort ( by popularity , price , alphabetical order etc ) , the ability to show 2-4 items per line , and displaying nearly 100 products on a single page before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagination ) . RECOMMENDATION : Give the user the ability to show all products on a single page , and using infinite scrolling- to pre-load additional- pages if required . <h> The Product Page <p> The Iconics product page is one of the best Ive seen for a long time , but- it can still be improved ( like anything online ) . <p> The biggest issue I found with this page was the 3 promotional banners at the top of the page . So I ran a predictive eye tracking analysis on this page . Here are the results : <p> As I suspected , the promotional banners take away the attention from the Add To Bag button . So I tested removing those 3 banners and running it again . <p> Here are the results : <p> Its better , but the issue still remains the Add To Bag button is n't instantly visible to visitors when they land on the page , likely because the colour of the button does n't  have enough of a contrast to the rest of the colours on the page . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results : <p> Boom ! This is what I want to see from a predictive eye tracking analysis of a product page the product image and the call-to-action instantly visible . Note : the colour of the button does n't  need to be red . It just needs to have enough of a contrast to the rest of the page to draw the eye to it . The rest of the page has everything a visitor needs to make the decision to buy the product , including : <p> The other great feature they have is within the Size selection drop down : <p> By showing you how many items are in stock , they use scarcity tactics to help make the sale . And when you click the Add To Bag button , a huge popup appears making it completely obvious that the product has been added , with clear options on what you can do next : <p> This point is huge , because you 'd be surprised at how many websites add a product to the cart without clearly letting the visitor know about it which causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Everything up to this point has been about helping the customer find what they 're looking for , presenting the product in the best possible light , and making- it as easy as possible to add the product to their cart . Now its all about converting the sale , and the shopping cart is the first step of that- process . Let 's take a look at The Iconics shopping cart . <p> The Iconic is doing a number of things well- in their checkout : <p> Its easy to- update the quantity and size directly in the checkout <p> You can move the product to a Wishlist instead of buying it <p> There 's a message at the top of the page letting you know you could get Free Shipping if you spend over $50 <p> The main benefits are restated below the Buy Now buttons <p> All payment options are visible <p> Live Chat automatically pops up asking if you need help ( this is a great strategy to help close sales online ) <p> But there are a few big improvements they should make ( or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the page <p> Remove the newsletter subscription that offers a $10 voucher for subscribing ( the biggest issue here is that buyers are likely to leave the cart to get the discount coupon , and might get distracted and not come back ) <p> Change the location of the Free Shipping upgrade offer to somewhere more obvious , or add a one-click upsell on a product that matches what they already have in their cart <p> here 's a predictive eye tracking attention map of this page : <p> See the issue ? <h> The Checkout <p> here 's The Iconics checkout page : <p> Heres what they 're doing right : <p> You can checkout as a guest you 'd be surprised at how many sites require you to create an account to be able to checkout ( which loses a lot of potential sales ) <p> The entire process is on one page <p> Its simple <p> But there are a number of things I would change ( or at least test ) on this page : <p> Remove the 3 promotional banners at the top of the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the logo ) <p> Remove the Newsletter Subscription box and footer links <p> Add a floating summary of the order ( and main benefits ) so the customer remembers what they 're entering their details for <p> RECOMMENDATION : I entered my email address and clicked continue ( but did n't  purchase ) and did n't  receive a follow up email about- my order at any stage within 24 hours of entering my email . A cart abandonment email- strategy has been proven to recover lost sales from cart abandonments , and should be implemented ASAP on The Iconics website . <h> The Responsive ( Mobile ) - Website <p> It seems that The Iconics website was a MobileFirst design . How can I tell ? Because the user experience on the mobile- version is far more intuitive and much easier that the desktop version . Maybe I 'm wrong you tell me . I wont go into all the details again as its essentially the same website I reviewed above , but you can see the difference in usability between the desktop and mobile versions . <h> Home Page <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add To Cart Button <h> Add To Cart Success <h> Shopping Cart <h> Checkout <h> The Mobile- App <p> The Iconic has a smartphone app for both iPhone and Android . As I have an iPhone , this article has been limited to the iPhone app . The iPhone app is a better version of the mobile site ( much better ) . Its more intuitive , there 's less clutter , and overall the experience is superior . Again , I wont go into detail on all the steps again , but you can see for yourself how its different compared to the mobile site . <h> Home Page <h> Gender-Specific Home Page <h> Category Page <h> Product Page <h> Shopping Cart Page <h> Checkout Page <h> App Instructions <p> RECOMMENDATION : The biggest downside to the mobile app is that when you click on Add To Bag , there 's no message ( like on the mobile or desktop site ) and you are n't  redirected to the Shopping Cart . This should be updated as a matter of priority . <h> The Marketing <p> The Iconic are marketing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and what every online retailer should be doing as well ) <h> Dynamic Remarketing <p> Dynamic remarketing is when an online retailer advertises the product a visitor has viewed on their website , around the web . In Australia , that essentially means advertising that product to your prospective buyer on Facebook and Googles Display Network ( there are others , but Facebook and Google are the biggest by far ) . here 's an example of dynamic remarketing in play I viewed this product on The Iconics website : <p> Then when I visited Facebook I saw this ad in my feed : <p> And then when I visited Search Engine Journal ( a website about online marketing ) , I saw this ad : <p> here 's one of the- banners I saw , in more detail : <p> Dynamic remarketing is powerful because you 're advertising the product that a prospective buyer has shown interest in , whereever they go on the web . And when you combine dynamic remarketing with a cart abandonment strategy , you maximise the number of sales you generate from your marketing efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the purchase . Or they need to think about their purchase a bit more . By keeping the product front-of-mind , you give your store every possible chance of making the sale . <h> SEO <p> here 's a quick review of The Iconics SEO strategy ( a full review will take an in-depth article of its own ) . They rank well for a number of very competitive keywords , including mens fashion where they rank #1 : <p> They have a good number of incoming links to their site , although the quality of those links ( ie TrustFlow ) isnt- as high as their top competitors . <p> Note : A full review of their backlink profile will be required to fully understand- how they have acquired links to their site . What 's interesting is that while they rank for top level category keywords ( like mens fashion and womens fashion ) they are n't  ranking as well for- their individual product pages . If we take the Striper CVO Sneaker- for example . The product name is Striper CVO , and an auto-suggest from Google comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keyword in Google , I do n't  see the product at all ( even through I do see The Iconics Product Listing Ad on that product ) : <p> I know the search volume is n't high for this keyword , but when you add all of the potential traffic they could be driving by ranking for product searches across all their products ( not to mention the higher conversion rate of these types of searches ) then this is definitely something to improve . RECOMMENDATION : Improve the websites internal linking structure to ensure that all pages are getting enough SEO juice to rank highly . <h> Google Adwords <p> There 's not much to say here except that they 're doing it well . The Iconic has a robust Google Adwords strategy incorporating : <p> Search Ads <p> Remarketing Ads <p> Product Listing Ads <p> They 're not in the top spot every time , which means they 're focusing on the cost-per-sale ( which is a good thing ) . And they 're appearing for a broad range- of keywords . <h> Social Media <p> The Iconic has a huge social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into detail about- their social media strategy at this stage , but on the face of it , it looks good . here 's a list of their social media profiles ( notice the consistency in the message across all platforms ) <h> Facebook <h> Twitter <h> Pinterest <h> Google Plus <h> Collecto <h> YouTube <h> A good benchmark for online retailers <p> The Iconic is essentially the benchmark for how an online retailer should setup their website and market it online . Are there areas for improvement ? Of course . But that 's how online works . The Iconic is a leader in the online retail space and you can see why . If you currently run an online retail store , then use The Iconic as a guide to what you should be doing online . <h> Disclaimer <p> I have not been in touch with anybody from The Iconic , so I do n't have the full picture of what they are doing online , what they have already tested , and what their current challenges are .

@@78539036 @39036/ <p> I often talk about the importance that a headline plays in the performance of a website , but it can be hard to understand what kind of impact it can really have without seeing it in action . <p> So in this article I 'll share a case study on how a simple headline change improved conversions by 52.8% . <h> What we tested ? <p> Wilson HTM is an investment group listed on the ASX . They came to Web Profits to help them promote one of their investment funds . <p> We launched a Google Adwords campaign and designed them a high-converting landing page to drive traffic to . The landing page was converting well but we wanted to increase the conversion rate further to offset the expensive click costs . <p> So the CRO ( Conversion Rate Optimisation ) team- sat down and brainstormed different headlines we could test against the Control , and came up with the following : <h> Control <p> Reasoning : We assumed that just stating the name of the fund , and showing the annualised rate of return would be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Variation 1 <p> Pre-headline : We know how hard it is to find a top performing fund <p> Headline : Thats why were proud to say our fund has returned an annualised return of XX% p.a. since inception <p> Assumption : We wanted to test whether focusing on- the challenge investors face when looking for an investment fund would increase conversions . The pre-headline made the statement- of how hard it is to find a top performing fund . The headline then resolved the statement by showing the annualised rate of return , using the emotive word proud to reflect the effort that went in to achieving this result . <h> Variation 2 <p> Call-out : Attention Investors <p> Headline : Are you looking for a fund where the managers are founding investors who are driven to consistently outperform the wider market ? <p> Sub-headline : Our Award Winning Fund has returned an annualised return of XX% p.a. since inception <p> Assumption : - We wanted to test how important it was for investors to know that the fund managers were also invested in the fund , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also used a call-out to let investors know that theyve come to the right place , and that there is- something unique here . <h> The result ? <p> Variation 2 ( the version where we tested- how important it was for investors to know that the fund managers are investors in the fund themselves ) outperformed the Control by 52.8% at a 97% confidence rate . <h> The lesson <p> The- headline should talk to the most important feature and/or benefit of your offer . And you really wo n't know what- your prospects find most important ( and respond to ) until you test it . So even if your website or landing page is converting well , do n't  just settle with where its at . Always try to find a new and better angle that talks to- your prospects fears and desires . <h> Can we do the same for you ? <p> If you 'd like us to improve the performance of your website , landing page , or online advertising campaign , then- click here to get in touch .

@@78539069 @39069/ <h> How augmented reality will affect the future of ecommerce <p> 2016 was the year the world started paying attention to Augmented Reality ( or AR ) <p> Why ? <p> Because of Pokemon Go . <p> Pokemon Go was a phenomenon that took the world by storm but it 's nothing compared to where we 're heading in the future . <p> Find out how AR is going to impact ecommerce in our latest video <h> Transcription <p> Where are the Pokemon ? Where are they all ? <p> Well , thanks to Pokemon Go 2016 was the year the world started paying attention to augmented reality . <p> So what is augmented reality ? <p> Augmented reality or AR enhances the physical world around you by overlaying virtual elements such as text , image , or video and seen through displays such as the HoloLens , through Google Glass , and more commonly through the camera view on your smartphone . <p> The best way to explain information overlay is to provide the example of the British Museum that partnered up with Samsung to create an AR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects around them . <p> A good example of virtual objects is IKEAs AR app , which allowed its users to see how specific furniture looked inside of their home and also allowed them to resize that furniture to see exactly how it would look in real life . <p> For digital packaging , Starbucks had a campaign a few years ago where their customers could download the Starbucks AR app , point it at a coffee cup , and see a cool animation . <p> So how is AR going to affect the marketing world ? <p> Well , the biggest impact is going to be seen in eCommerce because people are going to be able to try things out in the comfort of their own home and that 's going to remove a lot of the barriers and friction to purchasing online . <p> That 's powerful . <p> On top of that , eCommerce retailers are going to be able to get a lot more insight into their customers shopping habits . <p> For example , an online fashion store is going to be able to see what products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for , and whether they 're being shared across social media or not . That information can then be used to improve the performance of the entire online store . <p> So where is it all going in the future ? <p> AR is going to be the future of eCommerce and if you 're not using it , you 'll be left behind . <p> Plus , combining AR with AI based advertising optimisation is going to take eCommerce advertising to the next level . <p> So what can you do now ? <p> Well , be curious about AR . Download and test new apps so you can really start to understand how companies are engaging with their audience through AR . <p> If your business supports it , leverage and bounce off the back of already successful AR apps such as Pokemon Go . <p> And if you 're really feeling up for it , invest in your own AR app because that will really set you apart from the competition . <h> About the show <p> Web Profits is a full service online marketing agency with over 80 data-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intuitive thinking , Web Profits focuses on achieving successful , performance-based results online . <p> Web Profits TV is our way of helping business owners , C-level executives and marketing professionals grow a business using online marketing , with a particular focus on social media , online advertising , content marketing and conversion rate optimisation .

@@78539072 @39072/ <h> 10 Lessons From Barack Obamas Online Marketing Strategy <p> Online Marketing - 17 May 2011by Alex Cleanthous - Get more articles like this sent to your email here <p> In 2008 Barack Obama won the presidency of the United States on the back of one of the most successful online marketing campaigns in history . <p> The time has now come again with the upcoming U.S. elections in November , Barack Obama has re-launched his online marketing campaign with the hope of achieving similar , if not better , results than in 2008 ( of course this time he has the benefit of already being the President ) . <p> In this article I 'll cover 10 areas of his 2011 strategy , as well as explaining how you might apply them in your business . <h> 1 . A High Performance Website Is Used To Drive Action <p> When you go to www.barackobama.com the first page you see is a landing page that is focused on one thing to get your email address and zip code . The main call to action is red so it stands out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also use the words " I 'm In ! " in the button to encourage people to follow through . <p> Barack Obamas people know that the key to gaining maximum leverage from those who visit his site is to capture their details and stay in touch with them on a regular basis through email marketing the entire website is geared to drive email subscriptions and donations . <p> Action : What is the main action that you want your visitors to take ? Are you capturing the email addresses of people who visit your website ? Think about the best free offer you can make and integrate that offer into your website to drive action . <h> 2 . Split-Testing Is Used To Achieve Maximum Performance <p> Even though the website will be performing well , the Obama team know that the ultimate judge of what makes a good landing page is how people react to it . With that in mind , the Obama team is split-testing various designs of the landing page and measuring which one produces the best results . <p> And when you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in the conversion rate of just 1% can mean hundreds of thousands of additional voters subscribing to their database . <p> Action : Use Google Analytics to identify the highest visited and highest performing pages on your website . Then use Google Website Optimizer to split-test various elements on the page to improve performance . <h> 3 . An Offer Is Made On The Thank You Page <p> As soon as you join the mailing list you are taken to a thank you page that encourages you to make a donation . The thank you page is one of the most valuable pieces of real estate on the website because it is the page that is displayed immediately after an action has been taken ( in this case the submission of the form ) . <p> Notice how Barack Obama is looking at the form ? Naturally , your eyes are taken to the top of the form as well this is n't a coincidence . The caption below an image is nearly always read by the visitor , and they have used that to sell the benefit of donating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options of how much you can donate , which means that people can donate as little as $10 or as much as $1,000 or more it takes away any issue that people might face with how much they should donate . <p> Action : Review the thank you page that visitors see after they take an action on your website . What else could you offer on that page to drive additional action ? <h> 4 . Email Marketing Is Used To Build The Relationship <p> Once you subscribe , Barack Obama uses email marketing to build a relationship with you over time . He shares updates on what he has been up to , opinions on various issues and he educates you over time . His emails are written from the first person , from him to you , further building his credibility and trust . <p> At the end of every email is a call to action to donate now , although this is n't pushed heavily . The main focus of every email is to communicate a clear message , which is done masterfully . <p> Action : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then implement an email marketing strategy that develops the relationship , builds trust , and establishes your business as the leader in the market . <h> 5 . Blogging Is Used To Connect With The Market <p> Barack Obama uses blogging to communicate with his visitors and supporters . He shares articles , commentary , YouTube videos and Twitter updates . <p> You 'll also notice that there 's a Donate Now button on every page , to drive action ( at the date of writing this article the button is blue , but in 2008 it was red and stood out a lot more , indicating that the donations component in 2011 may not be as important as it was in 2008 or maybe they 're just split-testing it ) . <p> Blogging aligns perfectly with social media , which I 'll cover shortly . <p> Action : Setup a blog on your website and use it to connect with your visitors . Sharing educational or informative articles works best when combined with email marketing and social media marketing . <h> 6 . Social Media Is Fully Integrated Into The Website <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media platforms , and promoted all of them on his website . In 2011 that number has been reduced to two Facebook and Twitter , which reflects the growth and market share that these two websites have achieved in the last 3 years . Of course he still uses YouTube to stream his videos and Flickr to host his images , but he has limited his social networking to Facebook and Twitter . <p> Every post on his website let 's you share that post on Facebook and Twitter , and you can invite your Facebook friends to the Barack Obama site right from the widget in the sidebar . This is where blogging aligns perfectly with social media , because people are much more likely to share a piece of information rather than an entire website . <p> The biggest point to take away from this is that if Barack Obama , with all the resources at his disposal , is only focusing on Facebook and Twitter then why would you spend any of your precious time on anything else . <p> Action : Integrate Facebook and Twitter with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better the information you share , the more people who will also share it . <h> 7 . Campaigns Are Segmented By Market <p> The website is segmented by state so that supporters can stay up to date with what is happening in their state . This allows Barack Obama to use the main website for his national messages and the state pages for state-based messages . <p> Segmentation drives engagement with his supporters because they only hear about what is related to them ( and are n't  receiving updates about states they might not care about ) this is critical to the performance of his website and social media campaign . <p> Obama has also setup Facebook and Twitter pages for each state , to further drive engagement . <p> Action : How can you segment your market to drive engagement ? Take a look at your website , database and email marketing and think about how you can refine your message for each segment . <h> 8 . Facebook Is Used To Communicate With Facebook Users <p> Barack Obamas main Facebook page has more than 20 million Fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his state-based Facebook pages . He uses Facebook to share updates on his campaign , ask his fans questions , share YouTube videos and drive engagement . <p> Importantly , he does n't  try to sell anything through his status updates ( ie he does n't  ask for donations ) . He uses Facebook to drive engagement and with feedback on his status updates regularly exceeding the 5,000 comments mark , he is doing it well . <p> Action : Setup a Facebook page for your business and start communicating with your market with the aim of driving engagement . <h> 9 . Twitter Is Used To Communicate With Twitter Users <p> Barack Obamas main Twitter profile has more than 8 million Followers . He uses Twitter to share opinions , thoughts and updates on his campaign . Obama also uses hashtags to participate in conversations . <p> Its a great way for Twitter users to stay up to date with the Obama campaign . <h> 10 . A Mobile-Friendly Website Connects With Users On The Go <p> Barack Obama has a mobile-friendly website for smart phones . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is critical for delivering a great experience to mobile phone users . <p> When you visit the main website on your phone , it automatically redirects you to the mobile-friendly version of the site . <p> Mobile users can stay connected by sharing their phone number and receiving text alerts from the Obama campaign . They can also make a donation directly from their phone . <p> Action : Review Google Analytics and find out how many people are accessing your website via a mobile phone . If it is higher than 5% then consider building a mobile-friendly website for your business . <h> The Strategy <p> Barack Obamas strategy has n't  changed much since 2008 build up a database , grow social media followers , encourage donations , and build credibility and trust through ongoing and sincere communication . The main difference in his campaign this time around is that he is focusing only on Facebook and Twitter to connect with people through social media . <p> The most important thing to take away from this article is that the process of achieving success online is the same in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy : <p> Develop an effective website that drives action <p> Drive visitors to your website using marketing and advertising <p> Build a relationship with your prospects through email marketing &amp; social media <p> Expand your reach through mobile <p> Implementing all of these steps together is the key to success <p> We know this to be true because this is the exact strategy we use for ourselves and our clients to achieve success online . 92713 @qwx712713 92714 @qwx712714 <h> 2 comments <p> A review of Donald Trumps website says : <p> online marketing campaign back in 2008 when he raised over $500m- online and then again in 2012 when he won his re-election as the President of the United <p> August 20th , 2015 at 11:39 am <p> these out says : <p> This is very intriguing , You are a extremely skilled blogger .

Who , what , how , when , and where . <p> Those questions are going to indicate intent . A how question is going to be worth less than a where question . <p> For example , How do I make Thai food ? versus Where can I buy Thai food ? <p> Voice search is 3x more likely to be local . <p> So , people are going to be looking for something in their local area .

You cant pretend to be a big brand in SEO anymore and in the rare cases that pretending does work , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not such a bad thing for users if they 're searching for a service or product , they should see- the companies that have the highest capacity and industry trust for delivering that service or product , like a bank or lender in the case of home loans . <p> So if you 're not one of the strongest brands , you have only 3- options : <p> Pick a different keyword group <p> Target longer tail , more specific keywords and traffic <p> Become one of those brands <p> If none of those can be accomplished , pick a different service or invest in non-white-hat SEO at your own risk . <h> How to become a strong brand that Google favours <p> If you want to become a strong brand that Google favours , there are three key areas to focus on ( depending on what is available and applicable for your situation ) : <p> Leveraging existing relationships , marketing &amp; resources <p> Getting involved in the industry &amp; community <p> Directly promoting your content , brand &amp; products/services <p> Here are 10 examples of each <h> 1 . Leveraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers- - Many product suppliers have lists of their stockists or distributors on their websites , and service providers often list clients or client logos as examples of previous work completed . Either way , ask your suppliers or providers to include you on their website within their lists , with a branded link to your website . <p> References from your clients ( B2B ) Similarly , many distributors , stockists and clients list their suppliers on their website , sometimes with a profile of- the suppliers brands . Ask your clients to include you on their website within these lists or as a preferred supplier . <p> Testimonial contributions If there is no list on a suppliers website , they may still include testimonials on their website . If you 're happy with them , offer a testimonial for them to include on their website with a link to your company . <p> Leverage radio/TV advertising Some media outlets have a list of their advertisers on their website. - If you are advertising with any radio or TV stations , check if they have this feature and ensure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most companies that accept sponsorships- display the sponsors on their website , - generally with a logo and sometimes with a link . If your company has or will have any sponsorships whether charities , organisations , clubs , events etc - be sure to request or confirm the addition of your brand or logo on their website with a link back to your site . <p> Non-linked brand citations As your- brand awareness grows and you earn a media presence , your brand name- will begin to be mentioned in blog- posts and news articles. - If your company has been mentioned by a writer or journalist , they know who you are and have already promoted your brand name to their readership , so why not ask them to change the existing brand mention to a hyperlink ? You can even use this to establish a relationship for future collaborations . <p> Leverage press releases While the old bulk **25;162;TOOLONG SEO strategy ( where your press release is published to a tonne of PR directories haphazardly ) should be avoided , there are some high-quality press release websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , if you have company news that is worthy of a press release , you can reach out to local or industry journalists- who might find it interesting , and maybe even offer an exclusive interview . <p> Leverage existing content resources Find out what content on your website has been successful in the past . If the content- has already generated interest and traction , there is a reason so find any way possible to promote it further . <p> Reverse image/Content lookup- If you do have successful content , often key statistics , phrases , charts , tables or images may be re-used or quoted by other writers . Sometimes they may forget to cite you as a source or if they do site you , they may not link to you ( as with non-linked brand citations ) . Reach out to the authors , thank them for the compliment of using your information and ask them nicely if they would mind including a citation to your original piece of content . <p> Lost link outreach - Most third party link analysis tools offer a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the page or link has been removed . These websites have already linked to you in the past so the relationship is established . Reach out to them , find out why they removed the link , what would be involved in re-establishing the link or how you can work together in the future . <h> 2 . Getting involved in the industry and community <p> Scholarships Education institutions- often list any scholarships relevant to their students , that can help them financially . Figure out which courses , diplomas and degrees are relevant for- careers in or associated with your industry and develop a nominal scholarship program for students in those fields . Ensure you have a description and application page on your website , then reach out to the institutions offering those courses to include the scholarship in their listings . <p> Internships Similarly , - many educational institutions- love to have partnerships with companies where they can place their students for Work Experience or Internships . Some will list these companies on their website as a sales pitch to bring more students in . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an intern and you will often find some great future staff members through internship programs ( as we ourselves have discovered repeatedly over the years ) . <p> Guest speakerships - Many of you will remember at some point or another that a guest speaker came to your school , college , university or TAFE to give a talk relevant to the course you were studying . If you 're an expert in your field and are comfortable in front of groups of students , offer your services as a guest speaker to provide insights into the industry or educate them on a specific sub-topic . Many institutions will include guest speakers and their companies in the course outlines , which are often available online . <p> Event sponsorships/suppliers If there are any upcoming events in your industry , in particular for your target market , contact the event organisers to offer either a sponsorship or , if your products or services are suitable , to become a supplier of the event . Most events have an online presence and will list their event sponsors and suppliers somewhere on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially with smaller events , is finding funding to pay for venues. - If you can not offer financial support or supplies , or if the event is smaller in nature , you can offer your facilities to host the event . You will find that venues are always listed on event details pages , and they may link to your Contact Us page if it has details on how to get there . <p> Charity sponsorships There are many charities that are in urgent need of funding . Leaving aside that every company should be giving back to the community , some charities will also list sponsors on their website . Find a charity that is in line with your company ethos and get involved . <p> Join industry associations Most industries have an association of some kind that requires membership from companies , and many of these associations have a directory of their members . These websites can be super relevant and , as they have an application process , only have- legitimate businesses listed . You should be one of those businesses . They may even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Competition prize contributions On sites like- HARO- and- SourceBottle , people working in media sometimes list requests for competition prizes to be donated in exchange for referencing the brand in the competition marketing materials and channels . If the competition is relevant and will have an online presence , you could offer services or products as a prize to take advantage of that branding . <p> Industry forum engagement - Forums get a bad rap , but many industries have great forums where the community and experts are really engaged . Create a real profile for a real person and start getting involved in the conversations ; offer your industry expertise , advice for resolving issues , feedback on comments or questions . If you publish content , you can even share a summary with a link to the original in a new thread and ask people for their feedback . Though I think it obvious , its worth mentioning that you should never spam a forum with links and avoid using your website in your forum signature while this may have worked in the past , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely give you issues with Google penalties . <p> Offer interviews Bloggers and journalists are often looking for- experts to interview on difficult or controversial topics . Keep a lookout on HARO and SourceBottle for requests , or even reach out to journalists or bloggers that you know to be interested in your area of expertise and offer yourself as a source . Some media outlets even have a standing request for interviews . <p> Note that this area of brand promotion is what most closely resembles SEO of the past , but it must be evolved for the present and future . <p> Linkable content creation &amp; promotion Quite simply , create content that people in your field will want to link to . As with technical onsite SEO , there are plenty of resources available online that discuss creating content that- will attract links and ways to promote that content to acquire links . Brian Dean offers a detailed explanation of what he calls the Skyscraper Technique- for creating linkable assets- and Noah Kagan goes through a similar strategy- but elaborates more on content promotion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curate a list of the " Top/Best XX Anything " , and include links to each blog , website , or company in the list , potentially with a snippet or description , you can then reach out to them and let them know . The smaller to medium sized websites especially will want to brag about it , especially if its an award , and may include a link on their website back to the list . <p> Egobait citations/references content Similarly , you could quote or cite a targeted author in your high-quality content with a link back to their site , then reach out to them and let them know . They may or may not link to it in time , but more often they will share it with their followers and one of them may end up linking to it . <p> Host webinars An underrated and underused medium in most industries is video content . If its within your capacity , host webinars to train up the industry on difficult topics , or offer beginner sessions . Record and publish these as videos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the video as you would any other linkable asset . <p> Offer sample products for review Bloggers love free samples and many will review products in their field anyway . Offer- a sample in exchange for an independent ( unbiased ) review of your product published on their website . Obviously here , you need to have a good product to get maximum benefit from the review . <p> Blogger relationship building Identify the- top blogs and information resources in your industry . Start engaging with their content ; add valuable comments on their site ; share their content and link to it where possible ; promote them on your social media profiles . Establish a positive relationship before you ask for anything and then , once you have a dialogue , you can share your content and ask for their feedback , or you can brainstorm other ways to collaborate . <p> Social influencer relationship building Identify the- top social profiles and influencers in your industry . Start engaging with them- across their social platforms ; favourite and retweet their tweets ; share and like their Facebook posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , once you have a dialogue , you can share your content and ask for their feedback , or you can brainstorm other ways to collaborate . <p> Industry resource lists- In many industries , you will find lists of providers , suppliers , tools , etc for example on Useful Resources pages . If you find a list of your competitors all on one page , you need to be on that list . Contact the website owners and ask them if they- would include you among the list of providers . If they only have a shortlist of the biggest brands , they may not include you , but many want to have a comprehensive list of all available providers and will be happy to keep the list fresh . <p> Off-site aggregator lists Similar to industry resource lists , there are websites or web pages in some industries that are dedicated to aggregating specific types of companies or websites . If there is a list- relevant to your products , services or company type , contact the aggregator and ask them what would be involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation ) are a great example of aggregator lists , but often its as simple as a blog article listing everyone in your field . <p> Viral competitions/offers Create a competition or a special offer that is so outrageous people will want to share it with their social followers . Or , taking it to the next level , create a competition or a discount specifically for target bloggers if the incentive is high enough , it will entice them to share it with their social profiles and link to it from their website . <p> Get creative and figure out what will work for you . Audit your resources and make sure you are making the most of all of your marketing channels . Find unique ways to get involved in your specific niche or industry . <p> Here are additional resources for advanced tactics to get your brand name out there : <h> George Cleanthous <p> Formerly of EY and Alcatel , George has extensive experience in many facets of online marketing and has developed an expert analytics skill set .

Unfortunately , there is no way to directly impact SEO by using AdWords . AdWords should be about ROI so you should use your advertising budgets on lead or sale generating strategies .

So let 's get into it . <p> In the last few months I 've spoken with a few different companies who all have the same challenge make online advertising profitable for a low-margin product . <p> Some of them were traditional retail businesses that wanted to move online . Others were startups with big goals for their first year . <p> They engaged with us to create an online marketing strategy that would not only be profitable , but help them grow fast . <p> The challenge with low-margin products is that you ca n't use most forms of online advertising because the cost of making the sale is usually a lot higher than the margin you make from the sale . <p> You can invest in SEO , which is one of the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , but you 're putting all of your eggs in one basket and if Google changes the landscape , you do n't have any other way to drive sales and that 's risky . <p> To have the peace of mind that you can handle any changes that happen in the online world ( and there are a lot ) you need to be able to spend money on advertising and generate a profit from that spend . <p> So what can you do ? <p> You can focus on building up your email database , and then converting them over time using email marketing and remarketing . <p> Let me explain <p> In the last episode I spoke about the offer-conversion funnel , where the conversion rate is higher at the top of the funnel . <p> With a low-margin product this is more important than ever because it is extremely difficult to make the sale the first time . <p> So instead of advertising your product directly , you focus all of your advertising driving prospects to a free offer where they enter their email address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special report , a whitepaper , a free video , a free interview , a PDF download basically anything that your prospects have a desire to learn about ( and that aligns with what you sell ) . <p> You can then use email marketing to convert them into customers over time . <p> And the best part about email marketing , is that aside from the low monthly cost of the email marketing service , you do n't have any other costs sending the email . <p> I 'd suggest you email them at least once a week , and mix up your emails between helpful / informative emails , and product-focused emails . <p> They say that the money is in the database ' for any business marketing online that statement is more relevant than ever for companies selling low-margin products . <p> At Web Profits we want to change the way business is done online .

So let 's get into it . <p> The performance of a lead-gen website is measured by the conversion rate , which is the number of sales leads you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are a number of ways to improve the performance of your website , from improving the design and usability , to the imagery and layout . But there 's one part of the website that most people do n't even consider when thinking about how to improve website performance . <p> Can you guess what it is ? <p> If you guessed the words on the page ' then you 're right . The words you use on your website , referred to as the sales copy , is both the fastest and easiest way to improve website performance . <p> It 's the fastest way because all you need to do is change the text on your page , rather than updating the design or layout . And it 's the easiest way because it has the biggest impact on your results . Let me explain . <p> Let 's take two websites that look exactly the same . And let 's say that they 're in the legal field . One website has a headline that says Welcome to ABC company ' , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take your case on free of charge . ' Which do you think will get the most people contacting the company ? <p> The only difference between these two sites is the headline , but one of those websites will far outperform the other one . And that 's just with the headline . When you change the rest of the words on the page as well , making them so compelling that visitors ca n't help but contact you , you 'll increase your website performance even more . <p> The sales copy used on a lead-gen website is by far the most important factor in its success . It differentiates your company from the competition , it qualifies prospects before they contact you , and it establishes the positioning of your company in the mind of your prospects . <p> The problem is that most people do n't even consider the sales copy when building a new website , and most website designers do n't include sales copy as part of their service . <p> In my opinion , if you 're getting a lead-gen website built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy for you , then you 're setting yourself up for failure . <p> We 've seen it time and time again a new website is launched , it looks amazing , but it does n't perform . And when you get down to the reason why , it 's because the sales copy is n't doing its job which is to effectively sell your visitors on doing business with you ( or at the very least to qualify them and get them to contact you ) . <p> We include sales copy with every lead-gen website we build for our clients because we know how important it is to the success of the advertising and marketing we send to it . It would be far easier for us to build a website without thinking about the copy , but it just does n't work , because then it 's up to the client to write the copy , and they do n't have the years of copywriting experience it takes to write copy that sells . <p> At Web Profits we want to change the way business is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , simply visit webprofits.com.au <p> I hope you enjoyed this episode of Web Profits TV and I look forward to speaking with you in the next video . <h> Author information 92714 @qwx712714 92714 @qwx712714 <p> &gt; <p> In this episode Alex talks about responsive design : the benefits , the downsides , and whether you should use it or not . <h> Transcript <p> Hi , my name 's Alex Cleanthous , chief strategist at Web Profits . For those of you who do n't know me , I have a stutter and it comes out when I get excited and this stuff is exciting . This is my first video for a few months now and there 've been a lot of updates in the online marketing world this year so I 'll have a lot of great new information to share with you so stay tuned . <p> Today , I 'm going to be talking about responsive design : the benefits , the downsides , and whether or not it should be used . So let 's get into it . <p> Responsive design is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're viewing it on . So , if you 're looking at it on a laptop , it will look different compared to if you 're looking at it on a mobile phone or on a tablet . The website automatically rearranges the information on the page to fit ' ( or to respond ) to the size of the screen . <p> The benefits of responsive design are that 1 . the website looks good on all screen sizes , 2 . You only need to update the content once and it will update across all devices , and 3. it gives a better user experience across all devices compared to just a desktop site . <p> The major downside of responsive design revolves around the performance of lead generation websites on different platforms . Let me explain . A user visiting your website on a desktop computer will require different information compared to a user visiting your website on their smartphone . With responsive design the same information is used for both the desktop and mobile sites . There are ways to show less information on the mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same as what is on the desktop site , and that may not be the ideal information to maximise conversions . <p> Which leads me to my next point . The most important part of maximising the performance of your website is ongoing split-testing of your main landing pages , which includes testing headlines , it includes testing offers , calls-to-action and so on . With responsive design the biggest issue is that you ca n't split-test the desktop landing pages separately to mobile landing pages and you really need to , to maximise performance . And for that reason , and that reason alone , I would personally never use responsive design for lead generation sites . Instead , I would make a website that displays the same on both desktops and iPads ( although they can be different ) , and a different site designed for smartphones . <p> Now ecommerce and information sites ( like blogs ) are different . Because of the nature of their content , the width of the website and the layout of the content can be adjusted without negatively affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different landing pages between devices , but with ecommerce and information sites , you can get away with it . <p> So , should you use responsive design ?

@@78539104 @39104/ <h> 6 immediate benefits using an SSL-Certificate has on your website <p> Perhaps one of the most underrated simple improvements you can do to your website is to make it HTTPS . And while it 's certainly more valuable for an eCommerce website where financial information is accepted , even the most basic of websites and blogs can benefit from implementing an SSL certificate . <p> Why ? <p> Certainly there is the fact that Google and other web browser providers have already announced that there will be ongoing increases regarding the level of highlighting secure websites , and alerts for unsecure websites , to their users in the near future . <p> But there are both search performance and user experience implications that can impact your bottom line even today . <h> Visible security signals for your visitors <p> Security is one of the biggest concerns your visitors have , preventing many of them from converting online . One of the key benefits of having an SSL certificate is the sign that you can display on your website indicating that it 's secure . <p> Over 60% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something because one of these trust logos was not visible on the page . In addition to this , over 75% claimed not to have purchased something because they did not recognize any of the trust logos displayed . <p> It 's certainly clear that for purchases at least security has always been a key factor on checkouts and for most eCommerce websites this is already a must . <p> But even before the forms , security starts on the front end . <p> Many eCommerce websites have secure checkouts but the main interface of the website , where the products and categories and content are listed , remain on the non-secure HTTP URLs with no visible signs of security . <p> Do n't fall into this category . <p> 48% of online shoppers do not trust a website without a valid trust seal . Security is massive , and users are becoming more and more aware of security signals in their browsers do n't give them the opportunity to doubt the security of your website at any stage of the interaction . And for a lead generation website asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise users are increasingly conscious of the dangers of providing any personal details online . <p> Avoid abandonment by ensuring that your SSL certificates are valid and your trust logos are visible across the entire website . <h> Increase your website 's conversion rate <p> One case study showed that having an SSL certificate can increase a conversion rate of 11 42% for an eCommerce website , while another study by Symantec showed anywhere from 18-87% across both eCommerce and lead generation websites . <h> Increase your website 's average transaction value <p> In addition to the increase in conversion rate , for an eCommerce website there is often the additional KPI of the average value of each sale . With online purchases , much of the concern users have with security can impact the amount being paid . The higher the transaction amount , the greater the fear of being scammed . <p> An SSL certificate installed on a beauty product website was shown to increase the average value per transaction by 23% . This makes sense , since a customer that trusts you is more willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no fear of losing that value . <h> HTTPS is a Google algorithm ranking signal <p> Google has already stated publicly that a strong HTTPS encryption by default for a website is a factor within their search algorithm . While initially a lower correlation according to their announcement and earlier studies , more recent studies and notable ranking updates have demonstrated the increasing value of SSL certificates within Google 's algorithm . <p> I wo n't do a complete analysis of the SEO benefits of using an SSL certificate , because there are many- otherresources online that do this in greater detail specific to SEO . The consensus , however , is that while it is still minimal in significance towards top rankings , there is a definitive correlation between having a HTTPS website and rankings in the top 10 of Google . <p> For anyone that does SEO on a regular basis , we know that any edge at all can be huge in the search game .

Anything reported in Search Console should be considered important in the eyes of Google and their algorithms while it may not have an immediate impact , it is a sign of a quality website if you do not have issues in Search Console and this can impact your rankings ( if not now , then in the near future ) . <h> Browsers increasing their alerts for non-secure sites <p> As of January 2017 , Google is now providing security warnings in Chrome for users if no valid SSL certificate is found on pages with sensitive information requested . Firefox and other browsers are following suit , and Google has already sent out a proposal for all web browsers ( user agents ) to begin marking websites on HTTP only as non-secure ' . <h> There is no reason not to have one <p> The only issues experienced with SSL certificates occur when they expire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active and be sure to update the primary domain for your website to force the https version .

@@78539106 @39106/ <h> How to generate phone leads from Google AdWords <p> Usually , a lead from a phone call is worth much more than a lead from someone filling out a form . When a business prospect calls you directly , they are more eager to purchase your product or service and the sales process is faster . <p> A phone call involves a human element , which is a powerful opportunity to build trust , create relationships and close sales . <p> I 'm not suggesting you should start cold calling potential customers . That can work , but before you even consider it , you need to make sure you give your prospects every opportunity to contact you . <p> Strangely , many businesses do n't implement a strategy for increasing their incoming phone leads . There 's plenty you can do beyond sticking your phone number on your website and waiting for the phone to ring . <p> It 's time to get proactive with your approach to generating phone calls . <h> A new method for driving high quality phone leads <p> Google AdWords is- an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are actively seeking your products and services . The secret to enticing these customers to call is understanding their behaviour and setting up your online marketing to give them the opportunity to call you throughout your sales funnel . <p> A customer on a mobile device taps the click-to-call ' section of your ad in Google and calls your business directly , without visiting your website or landing page . <p> Both of these methods are powerful and they can each attract a different type of customer , so your online marketing strategy should be optimised for both of these situations . <h> Get customers who visit your website to call <p> First , let 's take a look at customers who call you after visiting your website . <p> In this case , the initial AdWords- campaign will be the same as any other type of lead generation . It 's all about on-page optimisation for phone calls and tracking . <p> Once the prospect has clicked your ad and visited your landing page , you need to make sure your phone number is visible on each page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it displays well on all devices . Make sure your number is coded as a click-to-call ' link and consider using a call tracking system on your website ( such as Delacon or Google 's own call forwarding numbers ) , which will track which ads and keywords are triggering the calls that occur on your website . <p> At Web Profits , if a client is receiving a substantial portion of business through phone leads or they want to be in the future , we 'll push for a tracking system such as Delacon . By switching the phone number each time that a new customer lands on your site , Delacon pinpoints the source , whether it 's organic , AdWords or Facebook . This is incredibly powerful because : <p> It links back to Google Analytics and AdWords . <p> You can pinpoint which user search query triggered the specific keyword which resulted in the call . <p> You can then optimise your campaigns based on accurate conversion data , instead of just guessing . <p> Now let 's talk about generating calls directly from PPC . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this instance , your customer wo n't even visit your landing page . Click-to-call ' ads on Google mean that they can click your ad on their mobile device and call you directly . The beauty of these ads is that you are only targeting devices that can make phone calls . Any click on the ad will result in a phone call . <p> Screenshot of Google mobile results with click-to-call ad <p> Setting up click-to-call ads is pretty simple . In AdWords you select the Call-only ' ad and fill out the required fields . <p> Screenshot of Call-only ad drop down option <p> Running a successful click-to-call campaign is more complex , as you are dealing with a different type of user and user experience . <h> Running AdWords- campaigns for mobile traffic <p> According to the 2015 Sensis e-Business Report , 72% of Australians now own a smartphone , so it 's very important that you understand the nuances of mobile traffic . <p> Someone on a mobile device acts very differently to someone on a desktop computer or tablet . Think about the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device . If you 're like me , you probably grabbed your phone out of your pocket , punching in your search query while walking down the street or sitting in a cafe . Compared to a desktop computer , searching from a mobile device is often a rushed experience . It 's also likely that you used your mobile device in an effort to solve an immediate problem , rather than research a future problem . <p> This kind of consumer behaviour on mobile devices is very valuable to businesses . If a potential customer sees an ad that will solve their immediate problem , it 's highly likely they 'll click it . This brings up a few problems and opportunities . <p> Ad positioning on mobile devices is very important . Compared to desktop , where Google currently displays up to 11 paid search ads , mobile devices only show up to six paid ads ( three at the top of the SERPs and three at the bottom ) . <p> Screenshot of desktopvs mobile <p> If you want qualified customers to press your click-to-call ad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to three . Although the first position is great for getting high click rates , many users are not paying attention and will blindly click on your ad , wasting your money . Also , remember you are charged for the ad as soon as it is clicked , even if the customer does n't proceed with the phone call . <p> Screenshot of option to take or discard phone call <p> If your ads are showing in positions four , five or six on mobile devices , your customers will have to scroll all the way through the organic results to view your ad . Although this can result in more qualified customers calling , you are missing out on a lot of traffic . <h> Anticipate the unique user behaviour on mobile devices <p> The keywords you target in a click-to-call campaign are also influenced by the customer 's unique mentality when using a mobile device . The tone used when entering searches into a mobile device is often more conversational ( this is even more true if someone uses a voice-to-text function such as Siri ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyword matching to capture long-tail variations . Experiment with using the broad match modified ' keyword type instead of phrase or exact match . <p> Users on mobile devices are often on the move and likely to use location-based keywords in their searches . Setup unique ad groups for each location relevant to your business ( both at the city and suburb level ) and use a unique ad that includes this location in the text . <p> Now that you have your click-to-call campaign up and running , you need to monitor the data and optimise . <h> Optimising AdWords- for mobile traffic <p> As already mentioned , you need to keep an eye on your ad position and look for that sweet spot where you receive both a good click through rate and a good phone conversion rate ( often around position two or three ) . <p> Just like any PPC- campaign , monitor which search queries are leading to phone calls and optimise accordingly . Use your data to consider which locations people are calling from and exclude any locations where you are spending excessive money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , you also have to consider when you are available to take phone calls . If someone calls at 3- am , will they be sent to an answering machine or do you have a service that mans the phones for you ? If you are just starting out , it 's often a good idea to simply limit showing your click-to-call ads to business hours . <h> Optimise your process for receiving calls <p> In a typical PPC campaign where we drive traffic to a landing page , we can increase our conversion rate by split testing aspects of the landing page and making changes based on heat maps and recordings of user experience ( this is known as conversion rate optimisation ) . In a click-to-call campaign , you have to optimise the process of answering your phone calls . This includes the following : <p> Answer promptly no one likes waiting on the phone . <p> Know what you are going to say and have an action plan . <p> Write down common questions asked by your customers and develop a standard response . <p> Develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice responses with your team . <p> If you can perfect the process of taking phone calls , you will see great results in your conversion rates . <h> Get ready for a boost in your incoming phone leads <p> To summarise , these are the most important factors in using Google AdWords- to generate consistently high-quality phone leads : <p> Understanding that your customer 's behaviour is different on a mobile device than on desktop <p> Tracking phone statistics and optimising for calls <p> Optimise your process for talking to customers on the phone <p> Google AdWords- is an ideal way to increase calls to your business . More importantly , you can ensure that the people calling you are highly targeted and likely profitable customers . Just like any form of online marketing , it 's important to consider the entire sales funnel in a PPC campaign . If you allow your customers to call you at all stages along this sales funnel and have a solid strategy for converting the phone leads you receive , you will see some great results . <h> Mitchell McCormick <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analytical skills with a passion for creativity .

@@78539108 @39108/ <h> A review of boat insurance advertisers on Google Adwords <p> After a sunny Sunday- checking out multi-million dollar yachts- on Sydney Harbour , the thought of boat ownership crossed my mind . <p> Forgetting the fact that I lacked- a million dollars , an evening researching boats led me to checking out " boat insurance " and what I found was quite shocking . <p> With an estimated cost-per-click ( CPC ) of around $11 and 3,600 searches per month , there 's no doubt that " boat insurance " - is a valuable keyword . And from what I found of the advertisers vying for the top positions , almost all- of them are leaking- money with Google . <p> Here are the search results I saw for " boat insurance " on Sunday evening : <p> A standard set of search results including- major insurance brands ( as expected ) and niche boat insurers . <p> Immediately I could see there were clear issues with each and every advert and at around $11 a click these issues are quite- costly . <p> Exclusive bonus : If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where you 're leaking money with a Free- Adwords Audit . <p> here 's a review of each " boat insurance " advertiser including what they 're doing well , what they 're doing poorly , and how they can improve- their performance . <h> #1 Club Marine <p> Club Marine are the top ranked ad , indicating they are bidding a huge amount or have a good quality score ( and therefore a high click-through-rate ) , or a combination of both . <p> The advert copy is pretty standard , utilising the main keyword in the headline as well as letting people know they can get a fast quote online . <p> The first line of copy " Up to 5% Discount Boat Insurance " could be improved by adding punctuation after " Insurance " , - giving- Google the option to add the copy to the headline . The 5% discount only applies to " renewals " which may be confusing to some people , and should be changed to a benefit for new customers . <p> Club Marine are one of only two companies taking advantage of Value Track- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great to see. - Essentially this enables you to tag the URL and record what keywords people used , along with other data such as device and keyword position . This data can be then added to lead forms allowing the advertiser to- optimise for lead quality , which is essential if you want to improve your profitability over the long term . <p> The destination URL Club Marine are using is the homepage of their website : <p> Whilst the homepage banner area has a good headline , clear benefits and a clear preferred call-to-action ( Get a quote ) , a landing page would improve the conversion rate significantly by- removing all distractions . <p> If you are paying $11 per click , ensuring you have the highest chance possible to get your visitors- details is very- important - having News , Magazines , Merchandise and other distractions will very likely reduce the conversion rate . <p> The major issue letting down Club Marine however is the Get a quote- process , which goes through a third party ( einsure.com.au ) and is a long convoluted process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The process is likely hard to- change- for- Club Marine given its a third party utilised by many companies , so I 'd suggest they instead modify their website to capture the potential customers Name , Email &amp; Phone Number prior to sending them through the process and if they then do n't  convert a sales person can follow up- and close the deal over the phone . <h> Action Points : <p> Test- advert copy as per my suggestions <p> Add Review , Call &amp;- Callout Extensions <p> Create a landing page with lead capture before quote functionality <p> Add remarketing tags to website for future campaigns <h> #2 Boat Insurance Quotes <p> Out of all the ads in the search results , this is one of two that caught my- eye and the one I 'd likely click . <p> The headline says exactly what they offer , and- they have a- partial- match domain which will help improve their click-through-rate . <p> They have relevant Sitelink Extensions in place that- will ensure their " niche " prospective customers , such as Jet Ski owners , end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split test ( if they are n't  already ) is swapping out the last line " Boat Insurance Quotes , Cover Online " for one that showed their point of difference ( they have access to multiple insurers ) such- as " Compare Quotes &amp; Buy Online Today ! " . <p> The destination URL was their " Buy Insurance Online " page even though the ad copy was more tailored towards people getting a quote . Here is the page : <p> My instant action on this page after reading the copy is to click the blue " Buy Online " button below the image , but unfortunately this is n't a link and is more a confusing design element . <p> Scrolling down , this page appears to be just a gateway to a- booking portal through Nautilus Marine and an internal page on the Club Marine website ( who are in the #1 spot ) . <p> There are a few un-gated PDF downloads available and little information other than that . Navigating around the website there is an option to get a quote as opposed to buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion rate is high . <p> From this setup its clear that- BoatQuotesOnline.com.au are not concerned with tracking at all ; they have no Google Analytics on their site or other tracking programs ( that I can see ) , they are n't  tracking clicks off to their partner websites , and likely have no idea how their campaigns are actually performing and the ROI they are generating . <p> The one major advantage that online marketing has over other forms of marketing is the ability to track , and not taking advantage of that ability and optimising and improving the campaigns based on the data is in my view a waste . <p> Whilst the company did well with their ads , the website and conversion setup are ultimately what let them down . <p> A landing page setup with Analytics and conversion tracking and- one clear call-to-action would quickly improve this campaign and allow consistent ongoing optimisation . <h> Action Points : <h> #3 Steadfast <p> Steadfasts advert showed up third- in my- search results. - It certainly stood out from the others having the title of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is due to them offering insurance for Business vessels only . <p> When bidding on a very general keyword such as boat insurance , its important that users are properly qualified or a lot of money will be spent on wasted clicks . <p> If someone in their target market- is searching for boat insurance they likely do n't  know what Marine Insurance is , so the ad they are currently using does n't  qualify them enough . here 's an ad we would have liked to see instead : <p> Business Boat Insurance <p> Tailored Business Boat Insurance . <p> Expert Brokers . Call us Today ! <p> www.steadfast.com.au- <p> Its good to see Steadfast utilising Sitelinks , but theyve spelt their own brand wrong ! Pretty simple mistake to make , but it does n't  give a great first impression . <p> If Steadfast have a sales team then they should definitely look at enabling Call Tracking extensions to allow their phone number to display to the right of their URL , potentially saving them a click when people call direct . <p> here 's where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine ? A clear mismatch between the what I was searching for , the advert , and the landing page . <p> Further down the page I can see " Steadfast brokers work with industry sectors including , but not limited to : Marine and Boating " , so they do offer boating insurance for businesses , they 're just not doing a great job portraying that . <p> Creating a new internal page on their website for each type of Insurance they offer , - a landing page for each , or utilising dynamic headlines on their pages would quickly solve this issue and improve results . <p> Checking out the Sitelinks on the ad , I was then met with this page for two out of the three : " The- Steadfast Difference " and- " What Our Customers Say " : <p> The dreaded 404 error . <p> It can be easy to forget about Sitelinks when changing a site and just update an ad destination , and that 's what I assume happened here . Its a simple fix in the Adwords campaign but one that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely losing a lot of money . <p> For our clients we developed a script to autocheck all ads daily for 404 errors and alert us to any issues , which could be worth setting up . <p> There are also SEO implications with 404 errors- that should be looked at ASAP . If you launch a website and change URLs you should always 301 redirect them to the right location , or any SEO strength you had previously for pages can be lost more on how to launch a website correctly here . <p> Ending on a good note for a campaign that can be significantly improved , Steadfast was the only company that remarketed to me on the days following clicking through to the website . And whilst the ads could be a bit more targeted towards boat insurance , its good to see they are giving it a go . <p> here 's the remarketing ad they used : <h> Action Points : <p> Improve advert copy to better qualify people clicking the ad <p> Create a lead generation landing page- specifically for boat insurance <p> Improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect is interested in <h> #4 Apia <p> Apia is a company that offers Insurance products for people who- are over 50 years old , so whilst the headline looks a bit odd and looks to be more suited towards life insurance its a great qualifier . <p> Having a qualifier in your advert stops some ( not all ) people who are not your target market clicking your ad , saving click costs that never would have converted into a customer . <p> On the flip side , adding qualifiers lowers your click-through-rate and therefore quality score , which brings your click costs up over time . However I- would still have added the qualifier as they have done . <p> The m.apia.com.au display URL definitely caught my eye as its usually associated with Mobile websites and I 'm searching on a Desktop computer , and sure enough here 's where the ad took me : <p> This is Apias mobile site and is clearly a mistake considering I 'm on a Desktop. - This has- likely happened due to- having just a " mobile only " advert in the- ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad , it will just display the mobile one in its place . Adding a Desktop advert into this ad group will immediately fix the problem . Here is where I- should have landed : <p> Whilst I- would have liked to see a landing page , again this internal page is pretty good . Clear , easy to read copy with an image that aligns with the offering , a call to action ( Talk to an expert ) , and even a video . This page likely converts well , however there are some quick wins that should be split tested which- will improve their conversion rate and results : <p> Add a call to action button into the banner area ( check out this article for why ) <p> Utilising contrasting colours for the main call to actions <p> Fix issues with the Video ( currently not playing properly on Chrome/Firefox ) <p> Remove the PDS &amp; Supplementary Policy and instead add in the Talk to an expert " call to action copy at the bottom of the page <p> Overall with the mobile landing page issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see another company utilising Value Track to optimise for lead quality . <h> Action Points : <p> Fix the mobile advert issue by adding a Desktop/Tablet ad to the ad group <h> #5 NRMA <p> The fifth advert showing was NRMA , and this is by far my- favourite ad. - NRMA have a well written advert with what looks like an attractive price to me and a call-to-action at the end of the ad . <p> They are taking advantage of Call Extensions to get their phone number in the ad at no extra cost , and have even taken advantage of the rarely used- Seller Rating extension . The 4.5 rating and stars definitely stand out on the page , and will be helping the click-through-rate and quality score . <p> Interestingly , the rating is actually for their life insurance product not boat insurance so its crafty getting it into this advert . <p> The advert took me- to this page : <p> Another brand utilising website internal pages as opposed to the higher converting landing page , however the page is well designed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to download a PDF Product Disclosure Statement and Policy Booklet . There is no tracking on this call-to-action ( that I can see ) , and therefore the Adwords campaigns are not being optimised by performance a huge opportunity which is being missed by this big brand . <p> Improvements I- would make to this page include : <p> Changing the- call to action to- a " Get a Free Quote " form which captures the prospective customers details to be called later by a salesperson <p> Adding a- headline , sub-headline , and a call-to-action to- the image ( similar to Apia ) to increase the information seen- above the fold <p> Utilising contrasting colours for the main call-to-action button ( currently a hard to see ghost button ) <p> Ultimately a well set up ad and an okay internal page , but with a conversion of a PDF download the campaigns are likely not being optimised and improved . <h> Action Points : <p> Split-test and improve the internal boat insurance page including the call-to-action <p> Split-test- a lead generation landing page- specifically for boat insurance <p> Exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can show you where you 're leaking money with a Free Adwords Audit . <h> #6 Depth Logistics <p> Companies such as this- are going to find it tough to make keywords like " boat insurance " profitable due to the proportion of consumers vs businesses that will be searching , however with the right strategy it can work . <p> Depth Logistics need to- utilise a better headline which properly qualifies the person , which will- stop some people clicking the advert . <p> The second and third line are totally off topic and are about shipping cargo , which is likely a mistake from copying and pasting campaigns and just updating the headline not ideal . <p> I would n't have clicked this ad at all given its completely off topic , however for this review I did and here 's where I landed : <p> Another brand sending me to a homepage instead of a landing page ( sigh ! ) . <p> This is particularly bad as the website is almost entirely about shipping with no mention of insurance . I immediately would have bounced from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they offer on their website . <p> Interestingly , they do actually have a dedicated- page on Marine Insurance- which they should update their ads to straight away . <p> The internal page has no call-to-action , distracting social sharing icons which should only be used on a blog or content , and a- sidebar with no relevant Insurance information . <p> I would recommend a complete website overhaul in this case , which would improve the performance of all- marketing channels and significantly improve the leads generated from the website . <h> Action Points : <p> Add Review , Call &amp;- Callout Extension <p> Improve the ad copy and use the correct destination URL <p> Split-test- a lead generation landing page- specifically for boat insurance <p> Add remarketing tags to website for future campaigns <p> Completely redesign the website <h> #7 IC Frith <p> IC Frith offer insurance for both Commercial boats as well as pleasure boats , and I found their ad in position seven . <p> The advert copy was stuffed with keywords but is- one I would be unlikely to click . Whilst ad copy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information about- the- company .

Here is where the advert took me : <p> Judging by the design of the website its 8-10- years old and could be due for a refresh ; that said , the copy on this page clearly outlines the product , details who IC Frith is and is easy to read , which is great . <p> There is a call-to-action at the bottom for an obligation free quote which takes you to a form and likely works well . <p> If a landing page is utilised or the design elements of the page are fixed along with improving the Adwords campaign , the leads generated could be substantially improved without too much cost or effort . <h> Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Improve the ad copy to qualify users better <p> Split-test- a lead generation landing page- specifically for boat insurance <p> Add remarketing tags to website for future campaigns <p> Completely redesign the website <h> #8 iSeek Insurance <p> Its clear to see why this ad is buried down at position 8- not one mention of boats , boating , yachts , or marine insurance . <p> There is no real reason for Google to show this ad higher , and they likely have a warning about low quality score on this keyword due to a low click through rate . <p> This company is in the same boat as Steadfast &amp; Depth Logistics in that they offer commercial boating insurance- but they have- more work to do . <p> Rewriting their ad to bring it in line with the search term should be the first priority , - with similar copy to qualify the user as previously suggested . <p> The advert takes us to this page : <p> iSeek are currently using their homepage , which again has no mention of boating or marine insurance . I immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Google Analytics and likely no conversion tracking , so they are essentially running the campaigns blind . <p> I would utilise a landing page and completely rebuild the Adwords campaigns from scratch for this brand , who essentially need to start again and are very unlikely to be getting good results from the ad I found . <h> Action Points : <p> Add Review , Call &amp;- Callout Extension <p> Improve the ad copy to- align with the search term but also qualify the user <h> #9 About.com <p> Click arbitrage is where a company buys an advert at a certain cost then sells an advert at a slightly higher rate , making- the difference between the two figures as profit . Clicking this advert takes you through to : <p> If you click through to here then click an advert , About.com would make the difference between what Google pays them and what they paid Google to get you to this page . <p> Click arbitrage is pretty annoying and is against Googles Terms and Conditions , but- About.com continue to get away with it . <h> #10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whilst the headline is okay it would be better if they aligned it with the landing page you 'll see soon ( " Pleasure Boat Insurance " ) . <p> The second and third line can be improved significantly , because- at the moment they- could almost be used with any insurance brand and any type of insurance . <p> Their insurance has some great features such as 24-hour emergency assistance and- personal injury cover , and this is what they should feature in the copy instead . <p> The landing page we were taken to is : <p> I was hoping to see a landing page off our second last advert but it was not to be another internal web page . There are quite a lot of updates I 'd recommend to this page : <p> Update the headline to what people actually search for , ie. " Pleasure Boat- Insurance " <p> Remove the unclickable and unrelated Car Insurance advert which is showing above the fold in the key content area <p> Move the call-to-action to the right or down the bottom of the page , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will convert the sales copy- should be a lot higher up on the page <p> Hide the Terms and Conditions on- another page they currently take up half the content on the page , and although I 'm not a lawyer Im- guessing these can be sent to a potential customer prior to- the sale <h> Action Points : <h> #11 1and1.com <p> More click arbitrage , here is the landing page : <h> So who- is doing the best ? <p> Whilst all adverts and websites- had- issues , I think that Apia had the best overall strategy . <p> Its- clear to me that there is- a lack of decent- competition on the " boat insurance " keyword and nobody is running well built campaigns , suggesting huge potential ( and probably why there are two companies running click arbitrage on this keyword ) . <p> If one of the brands fixed up the issues outlined above and started optimising their campaigns and landing pages for conversions , then they could easily own the sector in Adwords . <h> Special offer to websites- mentioned in this review <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sales that the nine companies above ( ie not the click arbitrage players ) - are generating from their marketing , and are always happy to put our money where our mouth is . <p> Therefore , the first company ( reviewed in this article ) - that contacts Web Profits- and mentions this review will receive- a free high-converting landing page custom to your brand and requirements . <p> We will then help you improve your Adwords campaigns with a free in-depth review , and setup a- split-test for you to show you how much better the landing page converts. - Click here to get in touch . <h> Disclaimer <p> I have not been in touch with anybody from these brands and havent logged into any of their Adwords accounts , so I do n't have the full picture of what they are doing online , what they have already tested , and what their current challenges are .

That was what we wanted to find out . <h> What we tested ? <p> We were tasked with optimising the conversion rate of a landing page for eHotelier.com that focused on converting prospects to join their email database .

And thanks for the reference to the Tinke site , what an awesome example of effective design ! <p> August 13th , 2014 at 9:37 am <p> Brad Hodson says : <p> Interesting discovery . <p> I think Parallax only works when the tech is there to provide a consistently good user experience . Apple , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience solid for any browser . <p> I was just on another website where I would scroll past things and elements would pop in and out inconsistently .

Parallax design is when background images move at different speeds than foreground images when scrolling .

This is where elements are loaded as required . And usually animated on screen . With the idea that you 'll actually read the content , as it appears as you interact with it .

In this case it was to test whether animation would improve conversions or not . In this case it did n't  , which means that we wont be using it blindy assuming that it will convert higher than a static design . Saying that , we will certainly be testing animation and parallax in different ways to see if we can make it outperform a static design .

It was their- main source for new leads but the cost per lead was quite high and we could n't push volume at that spend . <p> We developed new landing pages for each of their- core services so we could maximise the return from their- current ad spend . <p> We then developed an automated email sequence that supported the sales process , which- predominantly happened by phone . We setup 7 emails that were sent out once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We setup remarketing on the website and landing pages , and we advertised to the remarketing audience- on Facebook , Instagram and the Google Display Network . <p> We developed a content strategy that incorporated videos and articles , and published them on a weekly basis . <p> We then emailed their- database and promoted the content on Facebook and Instagram to their remarketing audience and to lookalike audiences . <p> We ran- video ads on Facebook and Instagram to Interest categories and then use remarketing to convert them into leads . <p> We built out custom landing pages for every single ad group in Google Adwords to really increase- performance so we could get the absolute maximum number- of conversions from every dollar spent . <p> We tested- those landing pages to increase the conversion rate even further . <p> We built out another automated email sequence for another one of their key services , and well look at building out an automated email sequence for every one of their services . <p> We launched campaigns on Bing and while they do n't  drive a lot of volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it worth it . <p> Were currently in the process of redesigning their new website so we can increase both lead quality and conversions . <p> And were growing their organic rankings to capture an even larger share of the market , through content marketing , technical optimisation and link building . <p> We 've also experimented with a few different campaigns to see if we could identify new lead sources in a creative way . They did n't  get the results we wanted so we stopped them and are continually looking for other angles as well , which is the approach you need to take to maximise the online space . <p> Most importantly , were able to launch new campaigns fast , we can test out new channels as they become available , and were constantly moving quickly to drive revenue every single month . <p> And this is just the beginning <p> That 's how we did it . <p> And we 've done the same for many other Fluid Online Marketing clients ( just with different tactics than this one , as every client is different ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement a fluid online marketing strategy for your business , click here to contact us. 92713 @qwx712713 92714 @qwx712714

We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts for men and the coolest gifts for kids as well as on-trend items for the home , garden and office . So whether you 're looking for stylish Mothers Day gifts for mum , gadgets for your tech-savvy brother , gourmet hampers for your foodie sister or Fathers Day gifts for dad , we have thousands of great gift ideas at a price to suit all budgets . From Christmas gifts to birthdays , weddings and baby showers , the perfect gift is at hardtofind . " <p> Note : - the search volumes and estimated cost-per-click prices are calculated as at 20 November 2014 these metrics change throughout the year . The estimated cost-per-click prices are based on Exact Match targeting on Google Adwords . <p> Why did I include the estimated cost-per-click in my keyword research ? <p> Because every keyword has a cost when advertising- on Google Adwords , - based on how many advertisers are bidding on that keyword . The more advertisers that are bidding on a keyword , the higher its cost . <p> Importantly , if a keyword has a high- CPC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still make a profit . And when were conducting keyword research for SEO purposes , we want to find the most profitable keywords in that market . <p> So its not enough to just look at search volumes you also need to look at the estimated cost-per-click and multiply the two to get an estimated value . And that 's how I 've come up with the top 10 keywords listed above . <p> here 's a link to the top 100 keywords Ive researched for hardtofind , sorted in order of estimated value per keyword . And note that the value will change throughout the year as keyword demand changes ( eg mothers day gift ideas does n't  have any value now as its 10 months away , but that will definitely change closer to the date ) . <p> Well now use these keywords to optimise the Title Tags of each page of the website , to monitor their keyword rankings , as well as to develop- a content and link building strategy . <p> here 's where hardtofind currently ranks for- the top 50 keywords in that list : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts for him ) but they do n't  have top rankings for any of their top 10 most valuable keywords , which means there 's a lot of opportunity to increase revenue with SEO . <h> Competitive Landscape <p> Generating sales from SEO is all about ranking in the top 3-5 spots on Google for transactional keywords , which means we need to outrank the websites that already rank in the top spots . <p> You can generate sales- by either ranking for long-tail keywords , which happens as a result of your- content and how you structure your website , and by ranking for popular- keywords ( ie the keywords identified in our keyword research ) . <p> The latter is achieved by implementing a link acquisition strategy- designed to beat the- websites were competing against . So let 's take a look at what were up against <p> For the purposes of this competitive review , I am going to use the keyword that best describes the entire website , not just a category of the website . That means that I wont be looking at the websites ranking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ( which are all categories within the website ) . Instead I 'll be looking at the competitors ranking for gift ideas . <p> When I 'm conducting a competitive landscape analysis , I always look for anomalies in the rankings because it- means there 's an opportunity to beat stronger competitors using a smarter strategy . <p> In this case , Yellow Octopus stands out because its ranking on the first page with just 247 domains , so my focus will be on- how they achieved their ranking . <p> Yellow Octopus is- the only competitor that has its home page ranking for that keyword the rest are ranking one of their category pages . Digging a little deeper into Yellow Octopus and we can see that its a direct competitor to hardtofind . <p> So the first clue is that hardtofind- can outrank the competition because their site is all about the keyword they want to rank for ( ie gift ideas ) rather than it being a category within the site ( plus their home page is the page that is ranking #15 ) . That 's good news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile , to see what tactics they 're using to achieve their top rankings . For this part of the review I- used Cognitive SEO . <h> Number of links acquired per month <p> From this chart we can see that Yellow Octopus started implementing SEO around June 2013 , and they 've been consistent in their activity since then . That 's just over a year to get on the first page ( although they may have started ranking sooner ) . <h> Where the links point to <p> From this chart we can see that the majority of links to the Yellow Octopus site are pointed to the home page ( ie the biggest cluster ) , and there are n't  many links pointed to the internal pages . This might be okay but its also the sign of an SEO strategy in place , so its important to look at what kind of links they 're building to their home page and whether or not they are above board . <h> What the links say in them <p> From this report we can see that 44% of- their links have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them , and 17%- are miscellaneous . This is n't a bad ratio but usually I like to see a much higher ratio of branded links , so I 'll investigate the links that include popular keywords in them ( ie keywords from our keyword research list ) . <h> The quality of the links <p> Woah ! - I went through every single one of their links one by one and found a lot of unnatural links pointing to their site ( almost 50% of their total links ) . <p> Maybe they have already disavowed most of these links , but based on the quality of the rest of their links and where they 're currently ranking its likely that the unnatural links are the reason why they are ranking so well . <p> Most of the unnatural links are within content on various low-quality blogs around the web . I have classified them as unnatural because the link makes little or no sense in context of the article. - Here are some examples of the worst offenders ( I wo n't link to them as I wo n't support low-quality sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article about buying flowers , with a link that says Christmas Gifts by Yellow Octopus <p> LONG ... this article is about clothes for kids , with a link that says 21st birthday gift ideas <p> LONG ... this article is about hairstyles for brides , with a link that says unique gifts for men <p> LONG ... this article is about gift incentives for employees , with a link that says online retailers have a wide selection of corporate gifts <p> LONG ... this article is about child care centres , with a link that says anniversary gifts for men <p> I often see unnatural tactics- working from time to time but , in my experience , its just a matter of time before Google catches on and penalises the site . <p> The good news here is that we know that getting in-content links from blogs really helps you rank well . And we can use this information to create a link building strategy based around content . <p> Aside from the unnatural links listed above , they have a number of websites linking directly to interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can use both of these tactics in our link acquisition- strategy . <p> And , of course , well try to acquire as many of their good links as possible . <h> Size of website <p> The size of the website plays a big role in how well a site ranks . The more pages a website has , the more PageRank it controls , which means it can rank itself higher by improving internal linking . <p> here 's a quick review of the site size of hardtofind vs Yellow Octopus . I 've used the site : search operator to quickly see how many pages are indexed in- Google . <p> Yellow Octopus has 4,680 pages indexed in Google <p> And hardtofind has 173,000 pages indexed in Google <p> hardtofinds website is very large , which bodes well for any improvements we make to its internal linking structure . <p> Note : I usually use Screaming Frog SEO Spider to get a more accurate breakdown of the website , but that 's outside of the scope of this review . <h> Onsite SEO <h> Website speed <p> Google has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a breakdown of the speed of the website on both desktop and mobile , using Google PageSpeed . <h> Desktop <p> here 's a speed analysis of the website on a desktop : <p> 59/100 is not good . I would highly recommend implementing as many of the- suggestions provided by Google as possible . Click here to view the full report . <h> Mobile <p> here 's an analysis of the website on a mobile : <p> 47/100 is even worse . Its likely the score is so low because the website is not responsive , which means it loads slowly on mobile because there are too many things happening on the page. - Click here to view the full report . <p> And with Google recently stating the importance of mobile optimised websites as part of their mobile user-experience focus , its critical to make the website responsive to mobile users so that any mobile rankings are maintained . Currently the user experience score is 67/100 , which can be fixed if the site is made responsive . <h> Internal linking <p> The hardtofind website has a good internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page for many of the top level keywords we identified at the research stage , and it uses those keywords in the navigation links to each page <h> Smart linking <p> The category and product pages link to the brand pages , which is a stroke of genius as brand pages will certainly drive a lot of SEO traffic to the site <h> Breadcrumbs <p> The breadcrumbs link to the category and the sub-category pages using keywords we identified during the research stage <p> The one change I would make is instead of using Home in the breadcrumbs , I would use Gift Ideas because that is the highest value keyword that best describes was the website is about . Although you would need to update the CSS to get around first link priority . <h> URL structure <p> The URL structure is good . hardtofind uses SEO-friendly URLs that include the category and sub-category titles in the URL : <p> The one change I would make to the URL structure would be to remove the /categories/ part of the URL entirely , as it adds no value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to setup 301 redirects so you do n't  lose any rankings . <h> Canonicalisation <p> Many ecommerce websites have canonicalisation issues , where multiple versions of the same page are accessible because of filters that help shoppers . This can cause SEO issues . <p> Its always good practice to add a canonical tag to each page ( via the template ) to ensure all SEO value is focused on the URL you want ranked in the search engines , which is exactly what hardtofind has done . Great work ! <h> Title- Tags <p> Title tags are one of the most important SEO components of a- web page as they tell Google what the page is about , and they often appear as the headline in your search results , like this : <p> here 's where you can see the Title Tag in your browser : <p> Best practice is to put the keywords you want the page to rank for , within the Title Tags . <p> hardtofind uses a rule based Title Tag structure as follows : <p> SUB-CATEGORY NAME- CATEGORY NAME SITE NAME <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , especially because they 've named their pages well . <p> The only issue I see is that the Title Tags of the home page say : <p> " Home hardtofind . " <p> I recommend adding- the keywords they want the home page to rank for ( eg gift ideas or unique gift ideas ) - within the Title Tags of the home page . I 'd expect a jump in rankings as a result . <p> I would also consider updating the title tags of the category and sub-category pages that match the keywords we identified during the research stage , to try to rank those pages higher . That would mean that most of the site uses automated Title Tag creation , but the most valued pages are custom . <h> Category page content <p> One of the challenges with ecommerce sites is that the category and sub-category pages do n't  have any ( or enough ) content on them to differentiate them from the rest of the pages on the site . <p> What ends up happening is that the search engine does n't  have a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headings , Title Tags and URLs are usually not enough ) . <p> One of the best ways of increasing the traffic and rankings for a category page is to add unique content to the page , usually below the product listings . <p> If we look at the pages that are ranking in the top 5 spots on Google , we can see this in action . <p> here 's the page that ranks #3 for gifts : <p> And here 's the page that ranks #4 for gifts for men : <p> As you can see , both of these pages have unique content on them that separate them from the rest of the pages on the site . <p> A quick review of some- other pages within this category , for example : <p> and we can see that none of these pages have unique content on them , and none of them are ranking on the first page of Google . <p> My recommendation here is to go down the keyword list , one by one , and add unique content to every category and sub-category page on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rankings , traffic and sales . <h> Offsite SEO <p> Regardless of what you may hear , SEO is still very much about link building . The major difference between the past and now is that now its all about quality links but its still about links . So in this section , I 'll share how I would build quality links to hardtofind.com.au <p> But first let 's take a quick look at hardtofinds SEO to see if there are any issues we need to fix . <h> Backlink review <h> Number of links acquired per month <p> We can see that hardtofind has been online since about 2009 , with a bigger SEO push ( or more marketing ) starting in January 2013 . The number of links built per month is consistent , which is good . <h> Where the links point to <p> This is what a healthy backlink profile should look like . There are a lot of links to the home page ( as you would expect ) but there is also a lot of links pointing to different pages on their site . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to their site contain their brand name , which is excellent . There are some commercial keywords , which you would expect . And the rest are keywords related to specific content on the site . Overall a very health anchor text ratio . <h> The quality of the links <p> This is also excellent . As you can see , the majority of their links are natural ( ie green ) . The rest of the chart focuses on the Unnatural links ( just 7% of their total links ) and Suspect links links that require further investigation ( just 13% of their total links ) . <p> My recommendation would be to go through all of the Unnatural and Suspect links and disavow any that are of such low quality that they could hurt rankings . <h> Link acquisition strategy <p> hardtofind can significantly increase revenue from SEO rankings by ranking in the top 5 spots for their target keyword list . And the best- way to do that is to increase the number of quality websites linking to them . Here are a few tactics I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best ways to rank highly in this industry is to be featured in articles on blogs , so I would make a list of all of the influential blogs in the industry and send them a really interesting gift something they would be compelled to write about . <p> Coupon sites if hardtofind offers coupons , I would add them to all of the top coupon websites in Australia . I 've seen this work a treat for other ecommerce websites . <p> Non-linked brand citations hardtofind is getting a lot of airplay online , and I 'm sure that not everyone who writes about them links to their site . So one of the things I would do is find all the brand mentions that do n't  have links , and contact them requesting them to link to us . <p> Existing lists there are thousands of ( quality ) lists online about unique gift ideas for different occasions . I would research as many of them as I could , and contact them direct offering a suggestion for their list . I would even go as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would contact every supplier they use ( eg radio station ) and ask them to link back to the hardtofind site to help them increase sales even more . They 're often very happy to do so . <p> This is where I would start , but there are a lot more tactics I would use- as the SEO campaign progresses . <h> Summary <p> hardtofind is doing a lot of things well when it comes to SEO . Their website is structured well , they have a lot of pages on their site , and their link profile is both solid and healthy . <p> And like any website online , there is always room for improvement , starting with the recommendations outlined in this article . <p> I would certainly be very happy to discuss how we can help hardtofind take their SEO to the next level . Eri &amp; Trudi feel free to get in touch direct . <h> Disclaimer <p> I have not been in touch with anybody from hardtofind , so I do n't have the full picture of what they are doing online , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges are . The advice I have provided in this article is based entirely on what I can see online , and how I would optimise their web presence based on what we 've found successful for other clients . <h> Would you like us to review your business as well ? <p> If you 'd like us to review your SEO , please send an email to **25;189;TOOLONG .

@@78539123 @39123/ <h> How to create forms that convert <p> Web forms are a commonly overlooked feature of websites and landing pages that can have a big impact on conversion rates . The copy , layout and design of a form is important , and can be the difference between getting or losing a lead . Despite the impact forms have , they are rarely changed or tested , leaving a big opportunity to improve overall conversion rates . <p> In online marketing , there is unfortunately no perfect form ; there is always room to improve conversion rates through constant split testing . You can , however , get a head start on your quest for the highest converting form by following a few simple and easy to implement best practices and proven techniques . <h> Headline <p> Every form should have a clear , easy to read headline which conveys value and relevance . It should immediately show any visitors the benefit of filling out the form . A lot of forms have the headline Enquire Now , yet this is the action of the form and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To test this best practice advice , BettingExperts.com tested changing the headline and button copy and experienced a 31.54% increase in signups . <h> Sub-Header/Bullet Points <p> In addition to a clear header , it is important to reinforce the key benefits of your offering just before a visitor has to enter their details . This reinforcement helps to reduce anxiety that people have related to forms , whether that is a fear of being called , a fear of receiving spam or any other fear . To test this best practice advice , ContentVerve.com tested a form with and without the key benefits ; the form with the additional copy increased signups by an incredible 83.75% . <h> Buttons <p> The colour of your button is a big factor in form conversion rates . In our experience , a clear and easy to read button that has a colour which contrasts the rest of the webpage ( ie. a red button on a white background ) is most effective . <p> Equally important to the colour and design of your button is the copy of the button . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in every website years ago , buttons with generic copy such as Submit are still extremely common and have been proven to lower conversion rates . <p> To set yourself apart , it is important that you provide relevance to your button and describe exactly what benefit the person will receive by clicking . So instead of having a button with the text Download Now , you could change the button to say Get Your Free Brochure , which describes exactly what the person is going to get when they click the button . This best practice advice was tested by a gym that already had a high converting button copy but wanted to improve . By making the button even more relevant , they managed to increase conversions by 68% . <h> Form Fields <p> Generally speaking , the lower the number of fields that your form includes , the higher the conversion rate will be . So take a close look at your form and eliminate any fields that you do n't  really need . A lot of forms contain fields for information which can easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is almost always better to have more leads with less information than less leads with more information , so be as harsh in culling your form fields as possible . This best practice advice was followed by Norway 's leading online beauty shop and resulted in an increase in registrations of 11% . <h> Privacy Policies <p> Including a privacy policy on your form is another best practice technique that will , when done correctly , help to reduce peoples fear that they will receive a lot of spam after filling out the form . The text of the privacy policy is important , with some tests showing that a privacy policy with the word spam in it will make visitors think about receiving spam just before submitting and actually hurt your conversion rate . BettingExpert.com tested adding the following privacy policy to their forms : We guarantee 100% privacy . Your information will not be shared. Their signups increased by 19.47% as a result . <h> Captcha Codes <p> In our experience , you will have a higher conversion rate if you do not use a Captcha Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may come a point where you need to add this to your form . Make sure any codes used are very clear and easy to fill out for people , as you may end up losing actual leads otherwise . <p> Once you have updated your forms with this best practice and proven advice , you will be well on your way to increasing your conversions . However , the main point we need to stress is that even after you have implemented a form which follows these best practices , you can still test and improve every aspect of the form . This testing should be given as much prominence as testing other aspects of your website or landing page .

Or which tag gets priority ? <p> October 22nd , 2015 at 11:35 am <p> Alex Cleanthous says : <p> Hey Matthew . Facebook works on an auction system , with the ad that generates them the highest effective CPM getting priority ( effective CPM is how much Facebook earns in advertising revenue per impression , regardless if its a CPM , CPC or CPA campaign ) .

You would need to negotiate something with the host site to make it useful for them . Unlike sharing email lists ( with permission ) the sharing of remarketing space seems to squeeze out one of the advertisers so why would you do it ?

@@78539129 @39129/ <h> Googles Penguin Algorithm Update Finally Announced <p> SEO - 26 Sep 2016by George Cleanthous - Get more articles like this sent to your email here <p> There are few things that get- as much widespread buzz in the- digital marketing- industry as- an algorithm from Google , and a Penguin update gets even more . Like a close- AFL grand final , an extra time Rugby match , - a World Cup penalty shootout or Steph Curry heating up , there was a massive influx of- tweets , - emails and- text messages on Saturday , September 24th , spreading word like wildfire as Google announced the long-awaited update to their Penguin algorithm . <p> But what has actually happened ? How strong was the impact ? And what does this mean for the future ? <h> Penguin is now real-time , more granular &amp; part of the core algorithm <p> The short version is that this is great news for everyone . But let 's take- a look at the long explanation <h> " Real-time " really means- every month or so <p> For anyone that 's been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have always indicated- that the next Penguin update would be a " real-time " one . But what does actually that mean ? <p> Historically , Penguin algorithm updates have been built up over a period of time and refreshes released at random , often excruciatingly long , intervals . Originally , they happened once or twice a year but this latest update has been two years in waiting and has been pushed back since late 2015 . <p> This latest announcement confirms that we will no longer- need to endure such long waits . If and when a site is affected , we can act on backlink disavows and spam removals and expect these efforts to take effect- after the next crawl and refresh . <h> Penguin will now affect the specific over-optimised ranking factor <p> An over-optimised- backlink profile- often received a site-wide devaluing penalty with previous Penguin algorithms . According to Googles announcement , this latest update suggests- that only the- affected ranking factors will be impacted . <p> For example , theoretically : <p> if you have an anchor text over-optimisation penalty ( too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your backlink profile is fine , you should only lose rankings for that keyword and related phrases . <p> if your ratio of- non-relevant links is too high , the pages those links are pointing to and the anchor text used would be devalued but the rest of your site and keyword rankings should be fine . <p> if the ratio of " dofollow " vs " nofollow " is too high for specific pages , again theoretically only those pages would be affected . <p> It will be interesting to see the extent to which this granularisation of Penguin will be in place in the near future . <h> No more Penguin announcements as it becomes- part of the core algorithm <p> There are several hundred ranking factors in Googles core- algorithm . Needless to say , its complicated , and they are very tight-lipped about the details of these factors , speaking only generically when they speak at all .

@@78539130 @39130/ <p> Often times , the best way to increase the conversion rate of a page is to re-design it completely . <p> here 's a case study that shows the impact that an entirely new landing page can have on the conversion rate . <h> What we tested ? <p> Mazda Discounts- helps people- save money when buying a- Mazda . They had a landing page that was converting quite well and contracted Web Profits to improve its performance . <p> We followed our proven process of designing a landing page that converts , which is : <p> Understand the target market and key selling points <p> Write direct-response copy that effectively sells the service and drives action <p> Design a landing page around the copy , ensure- the copy is- easy to read , and make it- easy for the user to take action <p> Develop the page and ensure it works well across all browsers <p> Launch the landing page <p> here 's the design we produced <p> And here 's the original <h> The result ? <p> Re-designing the entire landing page from scratch , including rewriting the copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 108% ( more than double ) at a 99.99% confidence rate . <h> The lesson <p> Sometimes its a lot easier to increase the conversion rate of a landing page by re-designing it from scratch . Why ? Because you can take a new- approach to the sales copy , and freshen up the design of the site . Plus- you can achieve a much higher conversion rate faster , rather than split-testing one part of the landing page at a time ( which can take longer ) . <p> The downside is that we do n't  know whether it was the copy that increased the performance , or the design , or both . But when you double the number of leads you get from the same advertising budget , does it really matter ? <p> If we did n't  beat the conversion rate of the original landing page , then we would n't know why .

@@78539134 @39134/ <h> How do you keep up with constant change in online marketing ? <p> Facebook and Google ( the big guys ) seem to roll out changes constantly <p> So it can be a challenge just to keep up and I often get asked for tips on how to stay ahead . <h> Transcript <p> Hey , this is Alex from Web Profits , and today I 'm going to be sharing my thoughts on how to keep up with the constant change in the online world . <p> Just quickly , for those people who do n't know me , I have a stutter that comes out when I get excited , and this stuff is exciting ! So , let 's get into it <p> The online world moves at a pretty fast pace with a number of updates being rolled out by Google and Facebook ( the big ' guys ) on a frequent basis , and new platforms launching seemingly all the time . <p> That 's definitely something you need to be across if you invest in those platforms but I think the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually reach your market online are n't that many . And the ones that work , they work for years . For example , the two biggest channels right now ( at least in western culture ) are Facebook and Google . They 've been around for years and they 'll continue to be around for years . <p> When I think about online marketing , I definitely look at integrating as many channels into my marketing strategy as possible , because I 'm going for maximum growth both now and in the future . But the key to maximising growth in the short term is to find the channel that is delivering you the best results and then tripling down on that . <p> For example , in the last few years we 've spent the majority of our budget on Facebook Ads because it delivered the best results for us . Before that , we were investing the majority of our budget on Google , because that was producing the best results for what we needed at the time . <p> So I 'd recommend you figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend 80% of your marketing budget on that channel . Then invest the other 20% trying to figure out what the next growth channel is for your business . <p> When you know what your most important channel is , that 's what you should focus your time staying across . For example , if Facebook is your biggest channel , subscribe Facebook 's Page for marketing , follow the top bloggers who talk about Facebook , and stay across the top hashtags on Twitter . <p> Then stay across what the new platforms are in your industry and country , look for trends and try to find the next growth channel where you can invest your marketing budget . <p> I 'd suggest you focus your research ' time at the same percentage as your marketing budget , that is , 80% on your top marketing channel , and 20% on the rest . <p> I really hope this episode of Web Profits TV helped you with your online marketing and I look forward to speaking with you soon . <h> About the show <p> Web Profits is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@78539135 @39135/ <h> 5 tactics you can use to optimize a low-traffic website <p> I just came back from the ConversionXL Live conference in Austin , Texas , one of the top conversion optimization conferences in the world . <p> It 's my third time back to the United States , and I keep going back because the scale they work at in the US is more than 14x that of Australia ( based on population size ) , which means they can experiment and learn fast . <p> That 's where Australia is at a disadvantage when it comes to conversion optimization . <h> The biggest difference between Australia and the United States <p> When it comes to conversion optimization , you need traffic . A lot of it . The more you have , the more experiments ( AB tests ) you can run , and the faster you learn about what works , and what does n't . <p> I have to admit that when I talk to speakers and attendees at these conferences , I get traffic envy you 'd be surprised at how many businesses receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit card space generating 60 million visits per month ) . <p> Most websites in Australia do n't have the traffic to run enough AB tests to learn fast enough about what works and what does n't ( the standard metrics for AB tests is 250 conversions per variation , achieved within 4 weeks at the most ) . <p> The good news is that conversion optimization is not only AB testing , and there are a number of things an Australian company can do to improve website performance , even with a small amount of traffic . <p> Here are the top five <h> 1 . Qualitative &amp; Quantitative- Analysis <p> Qualitative analysis is about understanding why your customers buy from you . Quantitative analysis is about understanding how they interact with your website . <p> Qualitative insights are usually acquired by conducting surveys with prospects and clients , online , by phone or in person. - Quantitative insights are acquired through analytics , heatmaps and screen recordings . <p> By using qualitative and quantitative research methods , you can identify what needs to be updated on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unless you have 250 conversions per variation within a 4 week period , you should not be AB testing you should be sequential testing instead . AB testing is often not effective on low traffic sites because there is n't enough data to reach a statistically significant result you 're confident will outperform the current version , in a short period of time . <p> Sequential testing is where you make a major change to a web page or layout , roll it out without AB testing it against the current version , and then measure it against the previous period . While sequential testing is not as accurate as AB testing ( as is does n't take into account seasonality etc ) there is a much higher likelihood of performance improvement because you are focusing the traffic on the version you believe will achieve the best results . <h> 3 . Best Practices <p> Best practices still work . Using tactics like form field reduction , active calls-to-action , using numbers in a headline , using an image of a person etc have been proven to increase conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work for every website , every- time , but it 's a great place to start when you want to increase the performance of your website. <h> 4 . Mobile vs Desktop <p> The mobile user is different to the desktop user ( conversion rates on mobile are usually a third of desktop ) . So rather than trying to get the final conversion ( ie sale or lead ) , it might be better to focus on capturing the email address of the user and then leveraging email marketing , custom audiences and retargeting to convert them on desktop another time . <h> 5 . Accurate Data <p> Make sure you have accurate analytics data . If your data is inaccurate you are not making decisions based on reality . Make sure you 're tracking mediums correctly , fix fractured views , filter out bots , and use custom dimensions to better understand your audience . <p> Australia is different when it comes to conversion optimization because we simply do n't have the traffic volumes of the United States .

@@78539139 @39139/ <p> When iPrimus came to us to manage their SEM campaigns we had a challenge ahead of us . Their landing pages already had a high conversion rate and their SEM campaigns were working well . But when a company asks Web Profits to take over their campaigns , our goal is always to increase ROI through increased conversion rates . So we went about redesigning their landing page to increase their conversion rate ( because that 's one of the fastest ways to improve ROI ) . <h> What we tested <p> The first step in improving the conversion rate of a landing page ( or a website ) is to review the current page , identify what critical information is missing and then add it to the page . The problem was , when we updated the landing page the conversion rate tanked ( it reduced it by half ! ) . Heres what we did , the lessons we learnt , and how we ended up improving the conversion rate by 57% <h> Original <p> here 's the original version of the landing page <h> Variation 1 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redesign . We featured the price front and centre , we included a breakdown of the different plans , and we included multiple ways for the visitor to make an enquiry . The result ? A- reduction in conversion rate by 50%. #fail . here 's the design <h> Variation 2 <p> After our first attempt failed ( and we 'd put a lot of work into it ) we had to go back to the drawing board . So we did a full review of their landing page , their conversion strategy and their goals . We then redesigned their landing page from scratch . The result ? An increase in conversion rate of 57% ! here 's the design <h> What we learnt <p> So why did the first version fail miserably and the second version succeed so much more ? The key was understanding the clients goals better . iPrimus was n't interested in how qualified a lead was they just wanted to get people on the phone so they could convert them with a sales person . So when we added all the pricing and plan information directly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price from calling . And that was a significant number of leads . Our second attempt looked at what their original landing page was already saying , and then improved the design to focus on a single call-to-action . We removed all distractions , we made the form the main call-to-action , and we focused the sales copy on the main offer ( ie $50 credit for new customers ) . The result was an increase in conversion rate of 57% . <h> The takeaways <p> There are always two components to conversion rate optimisation the number of leads and the quality of those leads . The general rule is the higher the quality , the lower the conversion rate . That 's because to improve quality you need to qualify prospects more before they make contact with you . If your goal is to get the maximum number of leads possible , you should reduce any qualifying information from the landing page and get your visitors to contact you for any important information ( eg price ) . But if your goal is to only have qualified leads contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they do n't  need to contact you about it the number of leads will be less but the quality of them will be higher . So when would you want less leads ? Well , if you have a small sales team and they 're already busy , you 'll want to maximise their time by only having them speak with qualified prospects . On the other hand , if your sales team is n't busy then you 'll want more leads for them , in which case a higher volume of less qualified leads may be better . <h> Can we do the same for you ? <p> We helped iPrimus increase their landing page conversion rate by 57% ( which flowed through to their SEM campaigns ) . And even though the first version of the landing page did n't  convert , we redesigned it completely ( at our cost ) until it did . When you get a landing page from Web Profits you 're guaranteed - it will outperform your existing website . If it does n't  well work on it for free until it does because it directly influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us today to discuss your goals . 92713 @qwx712713 92714 @qwx712714

Never pay for impressions <p> The old school method of advertising was paying for your ad to appear in front of your prospects- ( think magazines , newspapers , radio and TV ) . It 's how online advertising started out as well , before search engine advertising came onto the scene . You 'd place a- banner on websites your prospects visited , and you 'd pay a fee every time your ad appeared . You can still- advertise this way . <p> The problem is , only a small percentage of people who see the ad are interested enough in what you 're advertising to actually respond to it , which means that you 're throwing away money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when you waste advertising dollars like that , your return-on-investment is- a fraction of what it could be . <p> One of the reasons that Google is so successful today is because they changed the way advertising was sold . Rather than paying every time somebody saw- your ad , now you only paid when somebody clicked your ad . That- meant that you 'd only pay- for people who were actively interested in what you were selling . And that meant a far better return on investment because your advertising dollars were- only spent on people who- were so interested that they clicked on your ad . <p> Most other advertising networks have since followed suit , as Google captured an increasingly greater share of the advertising market . <p> What most people forget is that- even with- a pay-per-click model , you still have the side benefit of free ' impressions because people see your ad even though they have n't clicked on it . Its just that the primary focus is on conversions , and secondary on impressions . <h> 2 . Your conversion rate defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how few business owners know what a website conversion rate is , and how it relates to your success online . Often times you might hear someone say I 've tried Adwords it does n't work for my business ' , when often times it 's that their website conversion rate was n't high enough to make advertising profitable . <p> Let 's take a quick look at the numbers to see why <p> You 're advertising on Google Adwords . The cost for one of your top keywords is $5 per click . If your website converts 1% of those clicks into sales , your cost per sale is $500 ( ie 100 clicks x $5 per click ) . <p> The problem is that if you do n't earn at least $500 profit from that sale , you wo n't be able to continue advertising . On the other hand , if your website converts 5% of those same clicks into sales , your cost per sale has been brought down to $100 ( ie 20 clicks x $5 per click ) . Or in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the best ways of dominating your competition online is to convert clicks at a higher rate than your competition , because it means you can outspend them on advertising and still make more profit ( allowing you to capture the lion 's share of the market ) . <p> For example , - if you 're converting clicks at 5% and your competition is converting them at 1% , you can spend 5x as much per click and still make the same amount of profit . <p> See the power ? <h> 3 . CPA is more important than conversion rate <p> Even though I 've just spoken about the importance of your conversion rate , it 's not the most important metric you should be measuring . Far more important is your CPA ( Cost-Per--Acquisition ) of a new lead or sale . <p> Your CPA is the amount you pay for a lead or a sale , and it 's dependent on the amount you pay for traffic . <p> For example , let 's say you 're advertising on Adwords and you 're paying $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your CPA is $50 ( ie $5 x 10 visits ) . Facebook advertising costs less than Google but also usually converts at a lower rate than Google . If Facebook Ads cost $1 per click , you only need a 2% conversion rate to achieve the same CPA as Google Adwords ( ie 50 visits x $1 per click ) . So even though the cost-per-click and conversion rate are both lower , the CPA is the same . <p> As you increase- the number of places you advertise your business , the cost and quality of the traffic changes , but you can always compare ad network performance- by comparing- your CPA . <p> As long as you know the maximum amount you can afford to pay for your CPA , and you 're converting traffic at a lower rate than that , you can advertise your business wherever there 's the possibility of quality traffic ( and there are more places than you know ) . <h> 4 . The more you pay per click , the higher the conversion rate <p> This one is counter-intuitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investment ( ie lower CPA ) you need to reduce the amount you pay per click , but the inverse is often true . <p> By paying more per click than your competitors , your ad appears higher up in the ad rotation ( whether its Adwords , Facebook or Display ) and you get the highest quality traffic , which usually- converts higher . <p> If you have the right targeting for your ads but the CPA is too high ( ie they are n't converting high enough for you to make a profit ) , you might be better off increasing how much you 're paying per click so your ad appears higher than your competition . <p> For example , if you 're advertising on Google Adwords and you 're not in the top 3 positions , you might be getting the price shoppers who go through all of the advertisers to find the best price . Whereas if you were in the top 3 , you are more likely to get those serious about making a decision now , and have a bigger budget to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cost-per-click advertising where the advertiser that pays the most gets positioned in the highest value locations , and displayed to the highest quality traffic . <h> - 5 . Generating a volume of conversions is hard and it 's ALL about volume <p> It 's easy to have a good CPA when all you need is one conversion per month . It 's a lot harder to do when you want 100 or 1000 conversions per month . <p> Why ? <p> Because when you only need a small volume of leads , you can focus your budget on the most targeted advertising you can " advertising that is so specific that only an actual buyer would fit into the targeting . <p> The problem is that there is n't a lot of traffic at this level of targeting , which means that if you want to increase the volume of conversions you need to start widening the net ' and broadening how you target your advertising . <p> And the broader you go , the harder it is to convert traffic because people are all at different stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have a multi-step conversion strategy with different funnels for prospects at different stages of the buying cycle . Which leads me to my next lesson <h> 6 . Advertising on Google Adwords does n't make you a good marketer <p> It 's easy to think you 're marketing your business well online because you 're generating new business through Google Adwords . But it 's actually a false reality . <p> Why ? <p> Because people who find your business from a Google search are already very far down the conversion funnel ( ie close to a sale ) , and the search is usually one of the final steps in the process . <p> They do n't need to be sold on your service ( as they 're already searching for it ) , they 're ready to talk price , and they actually want to hear about your company . This is one of the main reasons why Google is as successful as it is today . <p> With Google Adwords ( and any search engine advertising for that matter ) , most of your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is have your business appear when prospects are- searching for what you sell , have a landing page that effectively communicates your offering , and you 'll get a steady stream of new business coming your way . <p> So why is this a false reality ? <p> Because you 're quickly limited by the traffic available on Google , and you 're only able to convert people who are actively looking for what you sell . You ca n't make any other source of traffic profitable because you ca n't convert people that are n't  actively searching for what you sell . You 're stuck with Google Adwords , you 're at their mercy , and you 'll be quickly limited in the amount you can grow . <p> The other problem is that most of your competition also relies on Google 's high-converting traffic to grow their business , which means the click-costs are steadily being pushed higher until it will soon become very difficult to advertise on Google and make a profit . <p> When you rollout an effective online marketing strategy , you 'll never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow your business faster than you ever thought possible . Plus it ensures that you 're easily able to adapt your advertising to the rapid changing online world . <h> 7 . Do n't rely on just one traffic source <p> In the last lesson I talked about Google Adwords . In this lesson I am talking about any traffic source that you currently rely on for all of your new business . <p> Maybe it 's SEO , maybe it 's Adwords , maybe it 's social . It does n't matter what it is . If you rely on one traffic source for your new business you are putting all of your growth ' eggs in one basket . And if that traffic source happens to dry up one day , then you 'll be left scrambling to figure out a way to replace that traffic source . <p> Do n't think this can happen to you ? <p> Here are a few examples of where this has happened in the past <p> Thousands of business owners relied on top Google rankings as their main source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built their company around the new business coming in from their SEO . Then when Google made a number of massive updates to their ranking formula ( Penguin and Panda ) , many of those same business owners saw their new business dry up overnight . <p> Back in the day , Google Adwords used to cost 5c per click . Then they introduced Quality Score and click costs shot up to more than $1 overnight . You can image what that did to their CPA . <p> Or popups , that used to work really well ( even though they were super frustrating ) until all Internet browsers ( like Firefox , Chrome and Internet Explorer ) blocked popups by default . <p> The one certainty with online marketing is everything that works today will change . <p> The other is that as long as there are free services online ( eg social networks , search engines , media sites etc ) there will be advertising funding it . And if you can pay for traffic and convert it , regardless of the source , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind you should have the aim of having at least 2 different- advertising channels that drive- new business at any one time , 3 would be better . That way , if one dries up ( for whatever reason ) you can increase your spend on the others so your business is n't affected . <p> Need a competitive advantage ? A multi-channel marketing strategy is one of the best competitive advantages you can have . <h> 8 . Email marketing is the ultimate force multiplier <p> A force multiplier is a military term that describes the increased effectiveness of a particular tactic when combined with one or more other tactics . For example , if by using GPS , a force can achieve the same results as a force 5x the size without GPS , then the force multiplier of GPS is 5 . <p> Email marketing is like the GPS force multiplier in the example provided above . When combined with any form of online marketing , email marketing multiplies the results you achieve . <p> For example , if you were getting 10 leads per month from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 leads per month from the same budget if you use email marketing effectively . <p> When you really start to take full advantage of email marketing , the performance improvements you 'll achieve from your online marketing can be significant . <h> 9 . Be the market educator <p> If you really want to differentiate your company from your competition , you need to position yourself as the market educator . <p> By educating your prospects on how to solve problems they 're facing , how to buy better , or how to understand your industry better , you position yourself as their trusted adviser . And that is a position that 's hard to compete against . <p> And you ca n't fake this one . You ca n't share two-bit ideas to just tick a box . You really need to figure out the biggest challenges your prospects are facing and then help them for free . The more value to give them up front ( without asking for anything in return ) , the stronger- your positioning in the market . <p> The biggest piece of advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't let fear stop you from sharing your very best information " share it with your prospects and see what comes back . <h> 10 . Never be satisfied with your results <p> It 's really easy to get complacent with average results , never knowing how much more you could achieve . <p> I remember one campaign I launched where the conversion rate on the first version of the landing page was- 10% . I was happy with the results but wanted more . <p> In a period of about 4 weeks of testing various changes to the landing page , I was able to increase the conversion rate to 50% , or 5x as many conversions from the same advertising budget . <p> If I had stopped at the first landing page ( which was converting okay ) , I would have had one fifth of the leads instead and that made a massive difference to the success of the campaign overall . <p> This is an example of just one part of one campaign . There are literally dozens of areas you can focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ad text , to the landing page , the source of traffic , the offer you make , the emails you send the list goes on . <p> As long as you 're continually looking for new and better ways to convert traffic at a higher and more profitable rate , you 'll achieve results most people would never dream of . <h> Its about methodology <p> Most of the lessons I 've just shared are more about methodology than they are about tactics . The reason being that methodology will stay with you forever while tactics will change all the time ( especially in the online marketing world ) . <p> I 've learnt these lessons over the last 10 years , spending millions of dollars in online marketing and conversion optimisation . They work and they work well . <p> If you can integrate these lessons into how you approach your online marketing , you 'll grow your company faster than you ever thought possible . 92713 @qwx712713 92714 @qwx712714 <h> 5 comments <p> Anthony Spiteri says : <p> Some great advice Alex , this is a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 at 3:42 pm <p> Dave Eddy says : <p> Wise words Alex .
