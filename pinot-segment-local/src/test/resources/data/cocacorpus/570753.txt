@@81306612 @2806612/ <h> 24 , April 2016 <p> Arguments can be either constructive or destructive ; it all depends on how you handle them .

Rather than discuss what 's not working between us , we get into a conflict and argue about whose fault it is . In contrast to discussion that constructively airs the issues , arguments bring charges and appoint blame , which is destructive .

People respect leaders who are certain about where they 're going , and inspire confidence in those who choose to follow them . Tentative leaders do n't motivate others to get on board and stay on board . Uncertainty confuses and disheartens followers . People follow , almost without question , someone who 's wise , strong and faithful to what he or she believes . ( 2 ) Spiritual leadership .

Godly leaders lead when it 's uncomfortable , inconvenient , unrewarding and costly . They 're dedicated to the sheep they 're responsible for , and the Chief Shepherd ' they 're responsible to !

But the first wrote it down and hid it in a monastery wall because he feared the authorities . The second nailed it to the door of Wittenberg All Saints Church and started the Reformation .

If were legalistic we will , but if were Scriptural , well build men and women of God , who shine like lights in a dark world .

" <p> 22 But Felix , having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way , put them off , saying , " When Lysias the tribune comes down , I will decide your case .

So he sent for him often and conversed with him . 27 When two years had elapsed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus . And desiring to do the Jews a favor , Felix left Paul in prison . <p> 25:1 Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province , he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 2 And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul , and they urged him , 3 asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalembecause they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way . 4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of authority among you go down with me , and if there is anything wrong about the man , let them bring charges against him .

And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought . 7 When he had arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove . 8 Paul argued in his defense , " Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar have I committed any offense. " 9 But Festus , wishing to do the Jews a favor , said to Paul , " Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me ?

" 12 Then Festus , when he had conferred with his council , answered , " To Caesar you have appealed ; to Caesar you shall go . " <p> 13 Now when some days had passed , Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. 14 And as they stayed there many days , Festus laid Paul 's case before the king , saying , " There is a man left prisoner by Felix , 15 and when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him , asking for a sentence of condemnation against him . 16 I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge laid against him . 17 So when they came together here , I made no delay , but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought . 18 When the accusers stood up , they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed . 19 Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus , who was dead , but whom Paul asserted to be alive . 20 Being at a loss how to investigate these questions , I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them . 21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor , I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar .

And as he himself appealed to the emperor , I decided to go ahead and send him . 26 But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him . Therefore I have brought him before you all , and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that , after we have examined him , I may have something to write . 27 For it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to indicate the charges against him .

" 25 But Paul said , " I am not out of my mind , most excellent Festus , but I am speaking true and rational words . 26 For the king knows about these things , and to him I speak boldly .

' Well , there 's good news and bad news . The good news is that by God 's grace you can overcome it . The bad news is that when you 've overcome this particular problem , another one is waiting to take its place . You 're always going to be working on something . Spiritual growth is a work-in-progress . And it does n't come through human effort , self-condemnation or the white-knuckling works of the flesh . It comes as a result of spending time in prayer and having your mind renewed daily by His Word . As you agree with God , believing what He says is true , change automatically happens . You start to think differently , talk differently , and act differently . Be patient with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would you think there was something wrong with your child because they could n't walk perfectly on the first few tries ? No , you 're delighted each time they take a step .

He 's not angry because you have n't arrived ' , He 's pleased that you 're pressing on , endeavouring to stay on the path . It 's God 's job to cause you to begoverned by the Holy Spirit ' ( 2 Corinthians 3:8- AMP ) If you could do it by yourself you would n't need Him .

' ( 1 Corinthians 3:1-3 NLT ) As a parent , you expect a higher level of responsibility and maturity from your teenager than you do from your toddler , right ? And your heavenly Father requires the same of you . If you 're still being defeated by the same habits and hang-ups you struggled with as a new believer , seek God 's help .

' But it never happens . <p> Growth always begins with a decision . Follow Me and be My disciple So Matthew got up and followed Him .

In the same year , Vision Christian Media ( then UCB Australia ) took the bold step of introducing Australia 's first nationwide Christian worldview news service " UCB News " which is heard on Vision as well as around 20 other stations . <p> Fast-forward two years , and UCB had opportunity to secure its first high-powered open narrowcast licences , which were soon put on air . <p> The network quickly reached 150 relay stations by the end of 2003 , and in the following year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepparton , Bunbury and Kalgoorlie . Just prior to Christmas 2004 , a further 17 high-powered licences were secured , going on air in 2005 . <p> Over the years , we 've been able to acquire hundreds of high and low-powered open narrowcast licenses to set up a national network of relay stations reaching listeners everywhere from our largest cities through to regional centres to tiny isolated towns in the bush . Many- places have benefited from our cost effective approach of using low-powered FM transmitters . Although typically only one to ten watts , they usually give quite adequate residential coverage in small towns , depending on the antenna height above local terrain . The setup cost is very achievable for most communities and the ongoing cost in minimal due to low maintenance equipment with low power consumption - we even use solar power in remote areas . <p> As our transmitters have grown in number , so has our program content matured and developed . Our team of professional broadcast staff comes from many walks of life and media backgrounds , and are the daily voice of Vision Radio around Australia .
