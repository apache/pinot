@@40576848 @576848/ <h> What Type of Time Tracking Software is Right for Your Business ? <p> Many businesses need to track employee time . However , given all of the options that exist , how do you know which type of time tracking software is right for you ? <p> There are several ways to assess timesheet technology , based on your company 's size , your company 's industry , and your particular business needs . <h> Company Size + Time Tracking <p> Company size is arguably the biggest factor in determining the type of time tracking software your organization needs to be successful . Small businesses , which tend to operate on tighter budgets , are more concerned with finding a low-cost solution that 's easy set up and use . You 'll want a mobile app , secure and immediate access to your data , and solid support , in case any issues arise . Features like time off management , project budgeting , or employee performance reporting may be beneficial , but if your team is smaller than five people , what matters most is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still an important factor , but it is rarely the primary driver . Instead , midsize businesses often require features that empower managers , surface key business metrics , and integrate with their accounting or other technology platforms . Some mid-sized organizations may require custom reporting , but for the most part , as long as there are budgeting tools , flexible employee rate and cost fields , and a simple way to share data with other systems , you 're on the right track ! For a business with 20 , 50 or 100 employees , even a small percentage increase in efficiency can yield huge gains . ( So choose wisely ! ) <p> Larger organizations will have a very different focus in their time tracking software needs . For starters , cost is much less of a factor . Enterprise time tracking is all about customization , security , and integration . By understanding employee costs , availability , utilization , and capacity , large enterprises are able to better manage their business at scale . Enterprises often require API access , project-level approvals and permissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want to find a technology that transforms employee hours into operational insights and offers powerful workforce management tools to improve project staffing , hiring , and employee utilization . <h> Time Tracking for Your Industry <p> Another factor to consider for your time tracking needs is which industry you are in . Different industries have different billing and project management needs , which translates to different requirements in their time tracking software . <p> For example , a PR agency will generally budget a project against a fixed monthly retainer , and then will need to track time and expenses against that budget . That 's why it 's critical for agencies to have real-time budgeting and staffing tools . Increased visibility into employee time , availability , and cost data allows agencies to maximize profits and ensure the right staff is on hand to deliver on current and future work . <p> On the other hand , a nonprofit organization has significantly different needs . Instead of tracking time against a monthly budget , nonprofits need to operate as efficiently as possibly using the funds or grants they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the nonprofit 's job not only to deliver on their mission but share with their funders how they are using the funds they 've been given . This can be expressed by reporting on functional expenses , sharing program costs and activities , or tying hourly work to specific mission-driven outcomes . <h> To Bill or Not to Bill <p> Some organizations bill for their time . This can be hours that are billed to an external client or an invoice that is sent to an internal team . While there are many similarities between time tracking systems , certain platforms are a better fit for professional services , IT , or other industries that bill for their time at fixed or varying rates . <p> There is so much more to time tracking than simply recording the hours your employees work . If you think through the process of how those hours translate to your budgets , processes and profitability , you will be better able to find the best time tracking solution for your company .

@@40576856 @576856/ 66233 @qwx476233 <h> Cost Rates <p> In ClickTime , the- Cost Rate is the approximate hourly cost of paying your employees . This is set on the- Person Details page . <p> When used in tandem with Billing Rates , ClickTime can assist with the estimated profitability of the services/etc. that your team provides to your customers . For more details on Billing Rates , please see the Billing Rate Overview Guide . <p> Please be aware that while ClickTime data can be helpful in creating invoices and payslips , the Cost Rate and Billing Rate reports are provided for estimation purposes only . <p> When a new employee is added to the system , the Cost Rate field will automatically be populated with whatever the Default Cost Rate is . This is set on the- Company --&gt; Preferences page and can be changed at any time : <p> Cost Rates per Person <p> When a new employee is added to the system , you will have the option to change their Cost Rate by simply adding a new rate during the setup process : <p> Whatever is saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of their time entries . <p> If you are not sure how to calculate a Cost Rate , ClickTime offers a function to help you calculate this number : <p> In this example , we have an employee who makes $60,000 a year with an expected work-week of 40 hours a week . This employee will likely earn a 10% bonus throughout the year ( $6,000 ) , and the cost of overhead ( which can include payroll taxes , benefits paid for the employee , office expenses , and more ) is estimated to be about 30% of their salary . Given these factors , ClickTime estimates the hourly cost of staffing this employee to be $40.38 <p> It 's generally- difficult to predict- exactly how much an employee- will- earn- from bonuses , or what their overhead is exactly , and we also understand that some work weeks fluctuate , which is why we provide an approximate Hourly Cost for estimation purposes . <p> Changing Cost Rates <p> Cost Rates are similar to Billing Rates in that each time entry someone makes includes a built-in Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they last save the time entry will be hard-coded to that time entry . We can see this in our reporting tools - here is an example from the Customizable Data Export : <p> It 's assumed that Cost Rates will change periodically , which you can do at any time on the- Person Details page by simply editing the Cost Rate field , entering the new value , and saving . All time entries saved after that change is made will be coded with the new Cost Rate . <p> In some situations , you may need to apply the new Cost Rates to time entries that already exist in the system . ClickTime allows you to do this for time entries that are part of an " open " , " waiting for approval " , or " rejected " timesheet . To do so , go to edit the Cost Rate and then indicate you 'd like to " Apply the cost rate to all new and existing unlocked time as far back as ... " by checking the box and selecting a date . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop-up window asking you to confirm that you 'd like to apply these changes back to the date you specified . <p> Changing Cost Rates for existing time entries can take up to 5 minutes ( but will typically not take more than a minute or two , depending on how many entries are being changed ) . Click " Save and Continue " to confirm you 'd like to change existing Cost Rates for the dates specified . <p> Please note:The change will only be applied to time entries that belong to unlocked/unapproved timesheets . If you wish to change the Cost Rate for time entries for a locked/approved timesheet , please first un-lock or undo approval of the timesheet . You can also reject the timesheet , although that will generate an email to the employee . After the changes have been applied , you can re-lock/re-approve the timesheets . <p> After confirming the changes , you 'll see an icon in the top-right corner next to your name letting you know the system is changing Cost Rates . <p> When it is finished the message will disappear- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that employee . For best results , please allow this process to finish before moving on to change any other Cost Rates . <p> When Cost Rates are changed , you should be able to confirm these changes took place by re-running any reports that include Cost Rate data . <p> Reporting on Cost Rates / Profitability <p> In order to use reports in ClickTime that include " Profitability " , you must have accurate Billing Rates and Cost Rates in the system . Here is the " Profitability Summary " report ( available in the- Project section of the- Company --&gt; Reports page ) : <p> ClickTime calculates Profitability by subtracting Total Cost from the Billable Amount . This is determined using the following formula : <p> Billable Amount = Billing Rate of time entries multipled by the number of hours in the report criteria <p> Total Cost = Cost Rate of employee multiplied by the number of hours worked by the employee <p> As mentioned earlier , Cost Rate is the approximate Hourly Cost , so while ClickTime data can populate invoices / payslips , this information is for estimation purposes only .

@@40576866 @576866/ <h> What Is The New Federal Overtime Rule ? <p> Much like a pair of Birkenstocks or disco music , federal overtime law has hardly been updated since the 1970s . <p> But with the Department of Labor 's recent announcement , it appears that this is about to change . The new ruling affects the fates " - and pocketbooks " - of millions of low- and middle-income Americans who may be eligible for an increase in pay . <p> And of course this announcement has a major impact on management , investors , and owners at businesses of all types and sizes around the country . <h> A Little Background <p> Generally , employers are expected to pay overtime to employees working more than 40 hours a week . However , there are exemptions to that requirement for employers . An exempt employee is not entitled to overtime pay , while a non-exempt employee must receive overtime pay . <p> To be exempt , employees must make a certain salary ( currently at least $23,660 annually ) , receive that salary regardless of work quantity or quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyone earning an average or below-average salary would remain nonexempt . As you 'll see , that is n't necessarily the case . <h> The Overtime Problem <p> Right now , a full-time , salaried , " white collar " ( characterized as **37;119;TOOLONG ) employee with an annual income of $23,660 is not guaranteed overtime pay . <p> So , a retail store manager or entry-level office worker , for example , could work more than 40 hours ( 50 , 60 , 80 ! ) a week and still earn poverty-level wages for a family of four . <p> It 's true that states can have their own overtime laws , and may be more inclusive of and generous to employees . But this does n't mean much to a low-earning exempt employee in , say , Alabama , which adheres to the federal standard . <p> Overtime protections are part of the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) and have n't been touched since 2004 , and the job duty requirements of exempt employees have not been updated since 1940 . <p> Despite the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business community are against the new rules . According to the Chamber of Commerce 's Marc Freedman , " Changing the rules for overtime eligibility will , just like increasing the minimum wage , make employees more expensive and will force employers to look for ways to cover these increased costs . " Given challenging macroeconomic conditions , a competitive global marketplace , and a fickle retail outlook , business challenges to this law are n't going away anytime soon . <h> The New Overtime Rules <p> In an effort to address the issues of income inequality , chronic low wages , and work/life balance , the Obama administration took the initiative on overtime pay in March 2014 . <p> President Obama signed a presidential memorandum directing the Department of Labor ( DOL ) to update the regulations around which white collar workers are entitled to overtime pay . <p> The DOL held several listening sessions , giving stakeholders ( such as employers , employees , unions ) a chance to comment on salary levels , what employees should be affected , and how to simplify the regulations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published the new rules . It suggests the following about full-time , salaried employees and overtime pay : <p> The new salary level to be considered exempt from overtime pay is $47,476 " the 40th percentile of salaried workers in the South . In addition , only 10% of that pay may come from commissions , bonuses , or other incentive payments . <p> Those at the 90th or higher percentile of weekly earnings ( $134,004 annually , up from $100,000 ) count as highly compensated employees and may be exempt from overtime protections . <p> These salary thresholds will be updated every three years . Updates will be made to the 40th percentile of salaried workers in the lowest income region in the country , ensuring that employees are always protected from this type of overwork and underpay <p> Finally , in contrast to what was expected , the new rules will not go into effect until December 1 , 2016 . <h> Why Should You Care about the Federal Ruling ? <p> Obviously , this means big changes for employees and employers . For employees just starting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a windfall . <p> For employers , however , the benefits are less direct . While we wait for the proposals to take effect , many employers are scrambling to find money in the budget to pay for overtime hours , or determine whether or not to raise employee salaries . <p> Additionally , law firms , like wage-and-hour litigation practice Seyfarth Shaw , are arguing that this new regulation will drastically increase the number of overtime law suits . Will this new law place employees under an additional burden of compliance ? Most likely , yes . <h> Whos Opposed to the Overtime Changes ? <p> Lots of people ! The National Retail Federation , the ( aforementioned ) Chamber of Commerce , the National Federation of Independent Businesses , and dozens of other influential trade and employment associations are against this ruling . Many of these organizations are part of the Partnership to Protect Workplace Opportunity ( PPWO ) , who sent a letter to Congress asking it to work with the Obama administration to reconsider the law in December 2015 . <p> The PPWO says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have consequences for employees . <p> Although opposed parties understand the reasons behind the proposal , they are unsatisfied with how it will likely be implemented . <p> The letter from the PPWO suggests that rather than raising the threshold to roughly $50k right away , and expect employers to comply within a few months , the DOL should start with a $35,000 threshold and phase that in over several months or even years . <h> How Companies Can Prepare for the Overtime Law <p> For certain organizations , bringing all employees up to the $47,476 threshold might be the simplest solution . Another option could be shifting overtime work to highly paid exempt employees . <p> At the other end of spectrum is using more contract workers and paying entry-level employees less ( in hopes that any overtime brings them back to where they would have been anyway ) . <p> Of course , this could mean a slew of red tape and employee dissatisfaction . <p> Since the new regulations will probably be finalized later in 2016 , some in the human resources industry assume they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , businesses need to start getting prepared for the new overtime reality . <h> Time to Start Tracking Time ? <p> Ah , yes . Everyone 's favorite thing : time tracking . With the need for increased compliance , tracking employee time has never been more relevant . <p> Some employers might be afraid to track salaried time , thinking it will change the status of exempt employees . This is not the case . <p> You 'll want to pay special attention to those employees who will be newly entitled to overtime , once the law goes into effect . This is where you 'll need to make decisions about your team and budget , and nothing beats solid data .

@@40576879 @576879/ <h> How to Prepare Your Managers for the New Federal Overtime Regulations <p> In the public relations , fashion , media , marketing and advertising industries , a culture of long hours and high expectations for junior employees is the norm . Managers of these employees are in the habit of wanting employees at their fingertips " literally " via email and text , at all hours of the day , including during " off-the-clock " hours . <p> But this habit could have very expensive consequences to employers when the new federal overtime rules go into effect . As of December 1 , 2016 , many junior employees who currently are not eligible to receive overtime pay will automatically become eligible to receive it " regardless of their job duties " unless employers agree to pay them at least $47,476 a year ( equivalent to $913 a week ) . This is more than double the current compensation floor for exempt white collar employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) , the federal law that chiefly governs how U.S. employers must pay most employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $455 a week , which annualizes to $23,660 . <p> If employers do not plan to raise employee salaries to meet the new minimum , a significant portion of the junior employee population will be re-classified as non-exempt under the FLSA , and thus become eligible for overtime pay . This will result in the need for a cultural shift in which managers better track , understand , and manage employee hours . <h> Tracking Employee Hours <p> Currently , many companies may not be carefully tracking hours for employees who are exempt from ( ineligible for ) overtime , because they receive the same rate of pay regardless of how many hours they work in a given workweek . So to date , their managers have been free to ask and expect them to work long hours , at night and on weekends without a second thought as to cost . <p> But as of December 1 , 2016 , if these employees are earning less than $47,476 per year ( $913/week ) , employers will have to pay them overtime if they work more than 40 hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in a day ( or in some cases , double overtime pay , due to specific California laws governing overtime ) . <p> How will the new overtime requirements mesh with the continued need to meet 24/7 client demands , where there are high expectations of responsiveness and the need for immediate , quality results ? How will they fit into a culture where managers are used to emailing employees at 9 p.m. about a task ? How can industry employers properly pay junior employees , who do so much of the legwork to meet client needs , without a significantly detrimental impact on profit ? <h> Preparing for Federal Overtime Regulations <p> The key to managing overtime obligations going forward is to start talking " - as soon as possible " to managers who oversee the employees who are most likely to be reclassified when the new regulations go into effect . These managers will have to become much more vigilant about how and when they are assigning work , and when they expect it to be completed . Now is the time to start training your management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regulations . <p> As your time-keeper advocates , these managers should be able to tell you : <p> Whether they can re-assign or re-staff work to help balance the workload between direct reports <p> Whether it could be more cost-efficient to hire and train an additional junior employee rather than pay overtime to existing employees <p> Whether any of the work can be performed by exempt employees , including the manager ( without exempt employees losing their white collar exempt status under state and federal law ) <p> If employers and their managers do not properly prepare , the risk can be great : Under federal law , employees can bring class action lawsuits claiming compensation for " off-the-clock " work and overtime for all similarly-situated employees . Employees who win such lawsuits can recover not only lost wages but also punitive damages and attorneys ' fees . <p> Here are several tips that companies can use to help managers prepare for managing newly overtime-eligible employees , and to avoid violating the law . <h> Set and Enforce an After-Hours Communications Policy <p> In lawsuits under the FLSA involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer knew or should have known that they were performing off-the-clock work , and therefore , that they are entitled to be paid for the time worked . When there is an email trail showing that a manager asked for the work to be done , it becomes much harder to deny knowledge or liability . <p> It is therefore important to establish clear policies about how and when managers communicate with non-exempt employees . Managers need to understand the potential financial consequences of asking employees to perform work outside of the regular business day , and should potentially limit after-hours communications with non-exempt employees to lessen the temptation for them to work off-the-clock . <p> If managers do call or email non-exempt employees " after hours , " they should make it clear that the employees are not expected to respond or complete the task until they are back on the clock , unless they expressly instruct otherwise . <p> Company policies should also say that non-exempt employees are not permitted to perform work outside of certain established working hours , including working overtime , unless they get clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mobile , and Social Media <p> The ubiquity of smartphones , laptops , virtual desktops and remote access makes it very easy for employees to stay connected to their work 24 hours a day . <p> Therefore , consider implementing policies that limit off-the-clock use of mobile devices and virtual connectivity to approved times only , and make sure managers are trained and empowered to enforce these policies . <p> If practical , you might want to consider giving remote access only to exempt employees . It may also be beneficial to think about directing clients to exempt employees for after-hours communications and needs . <p> If your company has a BYOD ( bring your own device ) policy , many employees may have access to their work emails on their personal phones . Be aware that this increases the risk that non-exempt employees may perform ( and potentially not report ) overtime work . Consider excluding them from BYOD policies . <p> Also do not forget about social media use . It can be especially tempting to assign entry-level staff to monitor company social media accounts around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be brought by employees demanding compensation for off-the-clock monitoring of and/or posting to social media pages for or on behalf of their employer or the employer 's clients . Employers should therefore have policies and trainings governing social media use , monitoring and posting on behalf of the company . <h> Keep Calm and Keep It at a Minimis <p> Companies should not fear the incidental emails or phone calls between a manager and non-exempt direct report off-hours . The law states that employers do not have to pay employees for such infrequent and/or negligible amounts of time spent working outside of working hours , referred to as " de minimis " time , which is hard to track . <p> Take the time now to get ready for December 1st so that you do n't get caught off guard by the pending changes to the overtime laws . Significant risk can be avoided by advance preparation , starting with your managers . <p> Jessica Golden Cortes is a partner in the Labor &amp; Employment Practice Group at the law firm of Davis &amp; Gilbert LLP .

@@40576880 @576880/ <h> Should I Hire an Independent Contractor or an Employee ? <p> At first glance , hiring an independent contractor or an employee may seem similar , but there are enormous disparities between the two . The law has very different specifications for employees and contractors , and organizations bear different short- and long-term costs depending on what type of worker is hired . <p> Let 's take a look at the pros and cons of hiring a full-time employee ( FTE ) or a contractor . <h> Contractor vs . Employee Costs <p> The costs of hiring an independent contractor versus a full-time employee are often grossly misunderstood . That 's because there 's quite a bit to consider . Recruiting , onboarding , training , overhead , equipment , insurance , healthcare , taxes , and other variables factor into the costs of hiring an FTE or a contractor . <p> Because of all the confusion around hiring costs and benefits , we recommend using a hiring calculator to try to estimate the true costs of a contractor or employee . <p> Pros of Hiring a Contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs that are typically associated with full-time employees . According to the U.S. Department of Labor , benefits alone can account for more than 30% of total employee compensation . This year , employers spend an average of $10.70 per hour per employee on benefits ! <p> Benefits <p> Private Industry <p> State and Local Gov <p> Paid leave <p> 6.9 <p> 7.2 <p> Supplemental pay <p> 3.6 <p> 0.8 <p> Insurance <p> 8.1 <p> 12.0 <p> Retirement and savings <p> 3.8 <p> 10.6 <p> Legally required <p> 7.9 <p> 5.8 <p> If you have an underperforming employee , it may be challenging to let that person go . Many businesses hold on to low-performing employees , as they work through the training and legal processes of termination . These poor performers can affect the larger group and reduce productivity by as much as 30% ! If a contractor is performing poorly , it 's often much easier to part ways from a legal , cultural , and team morale perspective . <p> Additionally , hiring a contractor offers budget flexibility throughout the year , allowing you to bring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be especially helpful for agencies or other professional service organizations who have varying client workload by month or even week . <p> Cons of Hiring a Contractor : <p> It may be more difficult to manage , train , and supervise contractors . These independent workers often have greater autonomy than FTEs . An independent contractor also does not have the same obligations to management and may not make decisions that support the long-term best interests or vision of the company . <p> Sometimes the hiring organization sets the pay for an independent contractor position , and other times , the contractor does . Because independent contractors charge different fees , controlling costs can be a challenge , especially if you are passing these costs on to your clients . <p> Unless you spend additional funds , you may not own the copyright of works created by an independent contractor . This is especially true for design or other labor-intensive work that may require future revisions or updates . In contrast , if an employee creates similar work , you typically own the IP and have full control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business need to expand its capacity ? Does it need to do that all year long , or just for the short term ? <p> Contractor Pros : <p> Hiring independent contractors allows your team the flexibility to ramp up when your business is strong , and scale back when things cool down . <p> Hiring contract employees means you can carve out a specific number of hours for a particular project or task , which when correctly managed , can keep costs down . <p> You may need highly specialized skill sets that are n't readily available in your current workforce . Independent contractors can provide expertise and offer strategic counsel to your full-time employees or complement your team during a specific project . <p> Contractor Cons : <p> Sometimes it can be hard to rely on independent contractors to deliver exactly what you need when you need it , due to their availability . <p> If you request work with short turnaround , contractors may charge a rush fee that can significantly add to the cost of your project . <p> Certain employees may not appreciate working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that both FTEs and contractors are in a safe and friendly work environment . <h> The Liability <p> Regardless of what type of employee you ask to join your team , there are risks associated with the process . <p> Contractor Pros : <p> Working with independent contractors exonerates your business from many of the liabilities that can come with hiring FTEs , such as on-the-job injuries . This is why some higher risk industries require that contractors carry their own liability insurance . <p> Cons : <p> Classifying independent contractors is a tricky job and can vary by state . If it 's determined that your independent contractor is actually an employee , you could be hit with some hefty penalties and back payments . ( Not to mention what might happen if the contractor is injured on the job , and they turn out to be an employee . ) If you 're unsure if your employee is truly independent , the IRS has put together a handy guide that should help you better understand employment status . ( We also recommend that you speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are operating your business the right way . ) <p> As an employer , you could be held liable for your employees ' injuries or misconduct while on the job . This can also reflect negatively on your brand and impact future sales , investments , etc . <h> Onboarding Employees vs . Contractors <p> According to our friends at the Society for Human Resource Management , onboarding is " the process by which new hires get adjusted to the social and performance aspects of their jobs quickly and smoothly , and learn the attitudes , knowledge , skills , and behaviors required to function effectively within an organization . " Onboarding is a tremendously important part building employee engagement and ensuring that new team members are as successful as they can be . <p> Contractor Pros : <p> Independent contractors usually require a much less involved onboarding process . They rarely need to same level of education around company history , culture , and vision . This can save the team time and money , as contractors should be be able to get started on their projects relatively quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very limited onboarding , they may unintentionally make decisions or take actions that do not align with the company 's vision , values , or interests . <p> If you 're used to having things done a certain way , it may be difficult to ensure independent contractors are following your process . They may be flexible enough to adopt some of your procedures , but it 's possible you 'll be adopting theirs . So in this case , it 's possible that you 're the one who may need onboarding . ( Which is not ideal ! ) <h> The Culture <p> Is the project offsite or onsite ? This makes a big difference in how company culture factors in . <p> Contractor Pros : <p> While you want your company values to align with your contractor , if for some reason they do n't , it 's much easier to end this relationship than it is with a full-time employee . <p> Contractor Cons : <p> Even if you and your contractor stay in touch on a regular basis , it can sometimes feel like there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps like Slack , offsite contract employees can feel like part of a team " - but it 's not always the same . For example , it can be awkward to host team building or other events and invite your local employees but not your contractors . <h> Want More Information on Contractors vs .

@@40576896 @576896/ <h> Project Cost Estimation : Templates , Tools , and More ! <p> So you 're starting a new project . Great ! Business is booming ! But how do you estimate how long this project will take to complete ? Five hours ? Five days ? How much will it cost your business to perform this work ? Are there any opportunity costs associated with taking on this new project or client ? <p> It can be difficult to answer these types of questions while you are busy running a business . But unrealistic project estimation frustrates employees and clients alike , as it can make deadlines , costs , and results unpredictable at best and impossible at worst . <p> Despite having " estimation " in its name , guessing or estimating is not the best way to predict project costs . If you are going to guess how much a project will cost " - and not rely on data " - you might find yourself over-servicing your clients or even losing money on a project that should have been profitable . <p> So , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <h> Define Your Product or Project <p> First , clearly identify your product ( e.g. , logo design , app update , etc. ) and then isolate the deliverables associated with it . This may seem obvious , but naming the specifics helps to clarify the work and guide your priorities . It can also bring to light any critical components of the final product that might have otherwise been forgotten until later . With project cost estimation , you want no surprises ( excluding this fantastic song . ) <h> Project Cost Management <p> How are you billing for your project ? Hourly ? Is there a retainer ? Is it a fixed fee or a lump sum amount ? Your billing method will dictate how to assess project costs . Hourly projects have less risk than a retainer or fixed fee , provided your team is not working considerably more hours than your client expects . Granted , retainers offer stable and predictable income that makes hiring and planning employee time much simpler . Unfortunately , there 's no easy answer to how your organization should bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once a year , as clients , laws , and the market can change quickly . <h> Project Costs and Overtime <p> Regardless of your billing model , you 'll want to review your local , state , and federal overtime laws to make sure you are properly paying your employees for any overtime hours worked " and including these added costs in your project estimates . When a client says " this is not what I asked for , " you may be confronted with the need to pay your non-exempt employees 1.5x their standard rate . It can be a costly and emotional lesson , especially if you a running a small business . <h> Project Timeline Generator <p> How long do you think your project will take ? Got your number ? Good . Now double it . At least , that 's the method we recommend if you do n't have good historical data . It 's far too easy to underestimate the amount of time a project might take , particularly for creative work . <p> For those of you who track employee time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee hours by task , project , and cost , so you can determine basic guidelines for your team " and generate a quick estimate of how long a new project might take . The data hidden within your time tracking software will help you create benchmarks and build more accurate estimates for your clients . It 's also not a bad way to ensure your team is working at a proper pace . <h> Project Estimation Methods <p> There are a number of strategies that formally trained project managers use to estimate how long a particular project might take . We 'll cover them briefly here : <h> Bottom-Up Estimation <p> For bottom-up estimation , you 'll need to break down your project into every possible small task and group them together . From there , you can estimate the amount of time each task or group of tasks will require . Because of the specificity of this process , it may provide an accurate final estimate . However , it can be extremely time consuming , particularly with a task list broken down to very small incremental steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts by developing an overview of the expected timeline first , using past experience as a guide . For example , if this year you need to write a 100-page annual report , and last year , you wrote a 50-page annual report , you can estimate that this project will take twice as long as last year 's . You 'll then segment the work into smaller tasks and assign projects to your team . This method takes less time than bottom-up estimation but may miss smaller tasks or omit important variables . Also , it 's not ideal for new types of projects . <h> Parametric Estimation <p> Parametric estimation is most useful for projects that require multiple instances of a similar deliverable . It involves estimating the time required to create one element and then multiplying that by the total number needed . For example , website production may be estimated by assessing the time needed to build a webpage , and then multiplying by the total number of pages . The risk with parametric estimation is when a set of tasks are similar in theory but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , each " point " represents a possible outcome . Project time is estimated based on the best case , worst case , and most likely scenarios . You take an average of these three numbers , in which the most likely scenario receives extra weight , as it has a greater chance of being accurate than the best or worse case scenarios . <p> Of course , the accuracy of even this method is subject to how well you and your team are able to estimate the various outcomes . <h> Tracking Project Time <p> Alright , the estimations and calculations are finally over ! You now ( hopefully ) have an accurate understanding of how long your project will take . It 's time to create your project plan and get to work on hitting your deadlines . With fewer unknowns and a clear picture of what to do , managing , budgeting , and scheduling employee time should be much simpler . <p> But how are you planning to track your work ? Can you automatically record the time you spend in meetings or easily capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximize profitability and manage opportunity costs by planning employee resources against a budget or retainer ? Hopefully , the answers to these questions are a resounding " yes , yes , yes ! " ( Or , at least two ardent yeses . That would be good . ) <h> Project Cost Estimation in a Nutshell <p> How to estimate project costs : <p> Define the project <p> Assess your billing structure <p> Estimate how long the project will take <p> Track your hours <p> Learn from the process and improve over time <p> That last part is arguably the most important . Things happen . Issues arise . Keeping a project on track is more than management " - it 's an art . And quite often , it 's an exercise in sheer willpower . No matter how good your estimations might be , no one can predict the future . Not even you . That 's why it is so important to have the right systems in place . To understand the nature of the work itself . To know how long a certain activity should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the most frightful of questions : What happened ?

@@40576899 @576899/ <h> How to Get Employees to Track Time <p> Timesheets . The mere word can strike fear into the heart of even the most-seasoned executive . Time tracking is often misunderstood by employees , misused by management , and implemented only out of necessity . Yet timesheets " - and the performance , budget , and billing data they contain " are some of the most powerful tools a business has to reduce costs , improve operations , and increase profits . <p> The key is to figure out how to get employees to use them . <h> Make It Easy <p> This should be fairly straightforward : The easier it is to complete a timesheet , the more likely employees are to do so . That 's why it 's critical timesheets have mobile apps for iPhone and Android , easy-to-use reporting , and pre-populated fields that make entering time simple . The best timesheets simultaneously benefit employees and managers " they remove all barriers from entering time ( single sign on , mobile access , custom fields , etc. ) and surface key insights that drive improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - even with complex cost structures and role-based restrictions " - should be as simple as possible . When looking for a time tracking platform , make sure it can automatically capture time in your calendar , allow you to automatically fill in data from the previous day or week , and pre-populate your timesheet with only the projects or tasks you should be working on . The more you can automate repetitive tasks , the more likely it is that your team will enter their time . <p> Automation includes the management of employees who track time . No one should have to manually email their team to remind them to complete their timesheets . Automatic email reminders are a simple way to reach out to an employee ( or group of employees ) and make sure they have completed their time sheets . <h> Simplify the Approval Process <p> It 's not just entering time that should be easy .

This data is critical to reducing over servicing , planning for new business , and staffing projects in real time ( easier said than done ) . <p> Another key benefit is improved forecasting and benchmarking . Without tracking time , there 's no way to know how long a project takes . Time tracking data allows digital agencies , consultants , integrated marketing firms , and other businesses to measure the true costs of any project , and use this data to set benchmarks for key tasks . This same data allows organizations to predict how long it will take to complete new projects . Historical time tracking information " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the guesswork out of forecasting , and enables managers and executives to create accurate forecasts for current and future customers . <h> Make It Part of Your Culture <p> Businesses define their culture in various ways .

But nearly all organizations aim to improve , to be transparent , and to use data to better understand their operations . When used properly , timesheets serve as a catalyst for these lofty endeavors . In order for a business to improve , it must first measure where it 's at . ( That 's a quote from business management icon Peter Drucker . OK , that 's not an exact quote , but it 's pretty close . ) There 's no better indicator of business performance than the data available from timesheets : employee cost , project cost , project profitability , employee availability , etc . <h> Link Timesheet Completion with Performance Reviews <p> Employees are often measured by how well they perform against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One way to ensure employees track their time is to include timesheet completion as one of their goals .

@@40576908 @576908/ <h> Are You Eligible for an R&amp;D Tax Credit ? <p> R&amp;D tax credits can be confusing , especially in the United States . With new laws coming into effect every year for the past decade , some businesses may be uncertain about what benefits they can receive from the government . <p> Let 's take a look at what R&amp;D tax credits are available , and try to clear a few things up ! <h> What Counts as R&amp;D ? <p> Nearly any sort of time , money , or resource that is spent with the goal of improving and advancing a company 's products or processes can be considered research and development . With this is in mind , almost any company that creates anything may be eligible for R&amp;D tax credits . From improving existing software to testing ideas to manufacturing something as futuristic as a flying car , virtually any kind of research and development costs can count toward a tax credit . This includes wages for workers , materials purchased , and anything that played a part in the process of creation or improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credits ? <p> In the U.S. or U.K. , virtually any company of any size that spends money on research and development can qualify for tax credits . <h> How Much of a Rebate Can You Get ? <p> The amount of tax credits that you can receive depends on the size of your business and where your operations are based out of . The United States and the United Kingdom have different policies for providing R&amp;D-based tax relief , but the qualifications for receiving tax credits are essentially the same . Generally , the smaller the company ( and the less revenue they are generating ) , the larger percentage of their R&amp;D expenses they can relieve with tax credits . <h> R&amp;D Tax Credits for Startups and Small Businesses ( United States ) <p> For R&amp;D tax credit purposes , a startup is defined as a company with less than $5 million in gross receipts and no more than five years of gross receipts . These companies can earn up to $250,000 in federal R&amp;D tax credits to offset payroll taxes . This allows startups developing new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with labor expenses . <p> With the recent update to this R&amp;D regulation , payroll that is being paid out in 2016 is eligible for tax credits . This means that the accrued credits can be used to offset payroll tax costs in 2017 from the previous year . <h> Small and Medium Businesses ( UK ) <p> In order to be considered a small or medium business in the UK , your business must have less than 500 people and have either a turnover of below -100 million or gross assets of less than -86 million . <p> These businesses can gain a significant benefit from recent tax credit legislation . If an SMB is profitable , up to 26% of its R&amp;D expenses may be subject to a tax credit . <p> Loss-making SMB 's in the UK are able to take advantage of an even larger credit . These companies can receive up to 33.35% of their R&amp;D expenditure as tax credits . For businesses that are looking to improve or create products and processes , this is an immense help " especially for new organizations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . <h> Large Businesses ( United States ) <p> It can be difficult for American-based businesses to properly classify themselves into one of the tax credit categories . For example a company might make shampoo and food coloring . That company could fit under chemical manufacturing and food sciences , depending on how it is viewed . That 's why it 's best to work with a tax specialist to determine your business category and eligibility , and to ensure that you are maximizing your tax benefits . <h> Large Businesses ( UK ) <p> To qualify as a large business in the UK , an organization must have more than 500 people or a turnover above -100 million , and gross assets of more than -86 million . <p> For large businesses , tax relief is given at 11% of qualifying R&amp;D expenditure . Although this is only about one-third of the maximum SMB rate , the total credit that can be claimed does not have a ceiling or maximum . Companies that conduct research and development can reap major rewards when it comes to tax credits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20% taxpayer , this the 11% credit typically results in an 8.8% net benefit after tax . " <p> Subcontractors of large UK businesses may also have a claim to these tax benefits . Depending on the amount of R&amp;D work they perform for a large business , it 's possible that they can receive tax credits for their own income and payments . <h> How to Maximize Your R&amp;D Tax Credit <p> With many opportunities to obtain a tax credit for research and development , it 's critically important to take the right steps to ensure a maximum benefit . <h> Step 2 - Clearly Outline Your Project <p> In addition to documenting the time and expenses spent on research and development , you must also include a clear outline of your project . This will be used to prove that what you are filing for counts as research and development . You will want to explain how your project qualifies as a venture of uncertainty and new development . ( This is an area where potential tax credits are easily lost , due to poor outlining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We strongly recommend working with a tax professional before filing any claims ! ) <h> Step 3 - Accurately Report Financials <p> When preparing to file for a tax credit , your report should outline three main components : <p> Labor - people employed by your company and the hours they spend on R&amp;D . <p> Subcontractors - people not employed by your company but paid to do R&amp;D . <p> Supplies - any materials or consumables purchased in the scope of the project . <h> Step 4 - Consult a Tax Professional Before You File <p> There are thousands of tax specialists who can help you maximize your R&amp;D tax credit . If you are uncertain as to whether or not you qualify for an R&amp;D tax credit , or if you ( wisely ) want to make sure you are doing things the right way , we recommend working with a professional . The parameters for qualifying for a tax credit may be broader than you think , and when properly managed , R&amp;D tax credits can provide a significant benefit to your business .

How important is it to know how often someone enters time or rejects an employee 's timesheet ? What can be learned from analyzing the tasks that are repeated frequently versus those that are rarely performed ? This sort of data allows us to better understand how people enter and report on employee time .

By closely examining their labor allocations , these organizations can improve efficiency , satisfy grant requirements , and overcome their unique accounting challenges . <h> Nonprofits Need A Paper Trail ! <p> In order to comply with these requirements , nonprofits must implement and regularly use a method for tracking and allocating personnel costs . Timesheets are essential for nonprofits : <p> " The organization must maintain reliable time records for each employee for each pay period based on actual detailed time reports or other after the fact determination of the actual activity of each employee . " <p> Req. #1-C ( from 1 ) <p> Non-profit organizations have the same accounting challenges as for-profits , plus a unique set of additional recordkeeping requirements mandated by grantors and the IRS . <p> ClickTime helps non-profit organizations achieve total visibility on the efforts of their paid staff and volunteer staff . <p> The question is -- how do you fund these teams when grant money is coming from different sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each unconcerned with the others ? If the wage cost of one person is , in fact , paid for by numerous separate initiatives , how does a grantor know that their money is being spent effectively ? <h> The Solution <p> ClickTime plays the central role in calculating the wage cost of any project or initiative . And since wages are usually the largest cost of any organization , that means ClickTime is vital to computing the total cost of any project undertaken by a not-for-profit organization . <h> The Results <p> Each day , employees take a few seconds to record their activities in ClickTime . Ideally , they also enter brief narrative comments describing their activities . <p> Frequently throughout the year , a project manager or controller generates reports detailing the total proportion of each person 's time dedicated to a particular project . These can be automatically turned into cost reports that include fully loaded cost of staff divided across projects or funders . Using ClickTime 's Advanced Estimation features , managers can even forecast their labor requirements by allocating funded labor hours to projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those projects progress . <h> Best Practices for Non-Profit Users <p> ClickTime has developed some best practices as a result of serving non-profit organizations for over 10 years : <p> At the end of each funding year , use ClickTime reports to show grantors and funders the specific results of their projects . This is especially useful when individual staffers are working against multiple grants concurrently . <p> Turn on ClickTime 's Audit Trail to create a fraud-proof traceable record of every entry -- to satisfy any auditor who comes looking . <p> Include the cost of ClickTime in grant applications .

The new law can be confusing , especially for business who are not used to tracking employee time . We 've put together a brief overview that should help answer any questions you may have . <p> What Does the Law Require ? AB 1522 , or the Healthy Workplace Healthy family Act of 2014 , guarantees up to three days of paid sick leave for virtually anyone in California who works for 30 or more days within a year of becoming employed . <p> Does This Affect Me If I Already Provide Paid Sick Leave to My Employees ? Yes . The law expands paid sick leave to part-time and temporary workers .

This includes household employees . <p> Are There Any Instances Where the Law Does Not Apply ? Yes . The law does not apply to independent contractors or freelancers . However , temporary employees from a staffing agency are covered by AB 1522 . Employees covered by a union contract are also exempt . <p> How Am I Required to Provide Paid Sick Leave ? You must either allow employees to accrue sick leave , or provide a bulk amount at the beginning of the year . <p> AccrualEmployees will earn or accrue at least one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked , beginning July 1 . This essentially adds up to eight days per year for a full-time employee . Employers can limit the use of paid sick leave to 24 hours per year .

They are to be paid at their regular hourly rate . <p> Do I Need to Pay My Employees for Unused Paid Sick Leave ? No , you are not required to pay your workers for unused sick days . <p> How Many Workers Are Affected by This Law ? Proponents of AB 1522 say that roughly 40 percent of the state 's workforce " roughly 6.5 million workers " will get paid sick leave for the first time . <p> Does This Legislation Affect Other States ? Right now , only California , Connecticut , and Massachusetts have passed laws mandating paid sick leave .

" <p> Normal Working Hours , or regular hours , can be established by legislation . And in the United States , the Department of Labor ( DOL ) mandates that nonexempt employees are eligible for overtime when time worked in a week exceeds 40 hours . <h> How Does Overtime Work ? <h> United States <p> In the US , the federal labor laws regarding overtime provisions are detailed in the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) . <p> Unless exempt , employees covered by the Act must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than time and one-half their regular rates of pay . <h> What Counts as a Workweek ? <p> Workweeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven consecutive 24-hours periods that add up a to cumulative and recurring 168 hours . <h> Penalties for Non-Compliance <p> Failing or refusing to pay overtime to eligible employees can result in lawsuits , fines , or even imprisonment . Penalties for failing to pay overtime vary by severity of offense , frequency of offense , and by state or geography . <h> Which Employees Receive Overtime Pay ? <p> The new overtime law , slated to go into effect December 1 , 2016 , makes millions of Americans eligible for paid overtime for any hours worked over a regular 40-hour workweek . ( Currently , most employee who are paid under $455 per week qualify for overtime . ) <p> After the law is enacted , many employees who are paid under $913 per week will qualify for overtime .

This guide will cover the different settings , the effect they have , and how to find employees who have not been entering enough hours to be considered " complete " . <p> Each employee can be set up with an Incomplete Time Entry rule on their- Person Details page : <p> You can set a default setting for all new employees you add to the system from the- Company --&gt; Preferences page , which can then be changed on a person-by-person basis ( more information on Person Defaults settings can be found here ) : <p> The rule can be set to a certain number of hours " per day " or " per week " . If you choose " per day " , the rules will be applied for weekdays ( Monday - Friday ) . At this time we are not able to allow you to specify that certain weekdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sunday ) should be included. - If your employees are expected to log hours on Saturday or Sunday , we recommend using the " per week " requirement . <p> If you use our Timesheet Approvals Module , you can also choose to prevent an employee from submitting a timesheet if they have not entered the minimum hours required for the time period . Employees who have this option checked must log the minimum number of hours before their timesheet can be submitted . <p> Effects of the Incomplete Time Entry Settings <p> When an incomplete time entry rule is in place , the system will look at the total number of hours entered by the employee and determine if the timesheet is complete or not . <p> As mentioned above , if you use the " per day " setting , ClickTime will evaluate each Monday through Friday and make sure the minimum number of hours have been entered . If you use the " per week " setting and have a weekly or bi-weekly timesheet model , ClickTime will evaluate the total number of hours logged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked hours , as well as time off , when calculating the number of hours for the time period . <p> For those using our Approvals Module , the additional " prevent employees from submitting time " setting can make sure that someone has entered the minimum number of hours required before allowing them to submit their timesheet to their approver . If they have not , they will get an error message when they try to submit . <p> Employees can see their incomplete timesheet rule at the top-left of their Timesheet View page . <p> Incomplete timesheets will also have the hours highlighted in red within the Timesheet - they can scroll their mouse over the hours to see more details . <p> Using the Incomplete Time Entry- Options <p> There are a few different ways the Incomplete Time Entry rules can be used : <p> When viewing the- Company --&gt; Timesheets page , ClickTime will show you if the timesheet is considered complete or not using a red X for incomplete or a green check for complete in the " Complete " column .

@@40577002 @577002/ <h> Why Agencies Should Track Time <p> We 'll be honest . We thought all agencies tracked time . But it turns out some do n't . Some agencies rely on their gut -- rather than data -- to manage operations , budgets , and employee performance . Can it work ? Running an agency without tracking time ? Sure , it 's technically possible , but it 's definitely not ideal . Especially for those agencies looking to exit , looking to grow , or looking to increase profitability . <h> Common Excuses for Not Tracking Time <h> It 's Not Part of Our Culture <p> Certain organizations feel that time tracking is not part of their culture . That 's understandable . No one enjoys filling out timesheets . But the data they surface -- and the revenue they help to create -- enables top-performing agencies to continue to win new business and keep current clients . Besides , the ( often boring ) world of timesheets has changed . Online timesheets are easy to complete , mobile friendly , and integrated with Google and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a Small Team <p> Without a doubt , time tracking becomes more powerful at scale . But even small firms benefit from a better understanding of client-by-client profitability , improved benchmarking , and in-depth reports on individual employee profitability . Even with as few as three or four employees , it can be challenging to know who is working on what , and how many hours or dollars remain for a given project . <h> We Do n't Care <p> This one always comes as a surprise . " We do n't care about tracking time " is tantamount to saying " we do n't care about how much money we make . " Running an agency is no easy task , and time tracking offers budgeting , forecasting , and staffing tools that consistently reduce costs and increase margins . <h> So What ? Why Track Time ? <h> Reduce Over Servicing <p> The average agency billing rate in the U.S. is $183/hour . Even if you have only ten employees who over service just two hours a week ( an unbilled call here , a quick copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in billable hours every year ! Every year ! Yes , there are times when strategic over servicing is required to support a key account or to build a case for future negotiation , but to over service -- and not realize it -- is completely unacceptable . <h> Increase Employee Utilization <p> Working on internal initiatives . Interviewing candidates . Reconciling expenses . These are not typically hours you can bill to a client . That 's just the way things are . Granted , it begs the question : What percentage of your employees ' time is billable ? 70 ? 80 ? Is it enough ? Could it be more ? Best-in-class agencies are obsessed with employee utilization . And time tracking -- when paired with real-time budgeting data -- surfaces key utilization patterns and trends that allow these firms to more effectively allocate employee time . <h> Optimize Staffing <p> Those marquee clients sure look good on your website , but are they actually making your firm money ? How many additional hours does your organization spend servicing high-touch accounts ? Or are there certain industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) where you continually run over budget ? By tracking time , costs , and project budgets -- tied to specific employees and teams -- you 're able to analyze and even predict revenue , and make staffing decisions that support your projections . It should be easy to see which employees are the most profitable . And it should be simple to plan employee time across any number of clients , even if your agency is growing quickly , looking to downsize , or spread across hundreds of locations . <h> Create Accurate Estimates <p> What is the true cost of delivering the services you offer ? Are you confident that your team is accurately estimating project costs ? Employee time and billing data can provide this confidence . More importantly , accurate data allows agencies to optimize the estimation process and increase profitability . It provides an opportunity for management to look back and say , " golly , that $5,000 line item is consistently costing us $7,500 in labor -- let 's adjust the way we price this offering .

@@40577022 @577022/ <h> Employee Performance Reviews and the Halo Effect <p> There 's one thing managers and employees tend to agree on no one likes performance reviews . They are stressful . They are difficult . And both parties are often unhappy with the results ( or lack thereof ) . <h> Managers Lack Training <p> Effective performance reviews do n't just appear out of thin air . It takes time and mindshare for businesses to set up systems that work well and are appreciated by their teams . This type of training , however , falls distinctly in the unbillable hours category that plagues professional services , agencies , consultancies , and other organizations that obsess over employee utilization rates and billability . Also , management training is expensive , and many organizations lack the resources to do so effectively . <h> Managers Lack Data <p> Which employees were the most profitable ? Who billed the most hours ? Were there certain projects that went exceptionally well last quarter ? Who worked on these projects ? How much did these employees cost the business , versus how much revenue they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on the company but otherwise go under the radar ? Far too often these questions are difficult to answer . That 's because managers lack the fundamental information they need to conduct effective performance reviews . <h> The Halo Effect <p> Do charismatic employees receive preferential treatment ? It 's certainly possible , even if it 's something that good managers are actively trying to avoid . Bias and discrimination have been a problem in the workplace since the very beginnings of commerce . While there has been an increased focus on workplace equality over the past 50 years , today 's managers might unknowingly be struggling with the Halo Effect , a confirmation bias in which they treat an employee differently because he or she is attractive , well dressed , or affable . It 's all too easy for managers to perceive and review these employees as higher performers than they actually are . This is not only unfair , it can damage team morale , negatively impact future hiring , and reward behavior that does not contribute to the success of the business . <h> Inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , another may view as mediocre . High-performing organizations will often attempt to level set and go through a process of calibration , but that takes time , effort , and HR infrastructure that smaller businesses may not have . Larger organizations have difficulty scaling the review process , as they are challenged with finding a common ground between their many different employee types who perform distinctly different functions that may not easily map to a broad appraisal methodology . <h> Employee Performance Reviews with Data <p> So , what can organizations do to improve the employee performance review process ? We recommend data . Real , quantifiable data that highlights which projects employees worked on , how many hours they billed , what they cost the company , and how much revenue they generated . Adding data to review systems helps to remove biases ( like the halo effect ) and better positions managers to offer more objective reviews of employee performance . <p> Regardless of how charismatic , how kind , or how fun it may be to spend time with a particular employee , their performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that can only be done with data .

@@40577025 @577025/ <h> Tips for Tracking Time in Google Calendar <p> When the great minds of the 20th century made their predictions about the future , none of them said , " there will be time tracking in Google ! " Were they short sighted ? Perhaps . <p> While we agree that tracking time in GCal ( that 's what the cool kids call it ) is nowhere near as important as some of , say , Arthur C. Clarke 's predictions about the future , that does n't mean timesheet integrations with Google Calendar are n't a big deal . <p> Tracking time in Google Calendar is automatic , accurate , and easy . We 've put together some best practices below to help ensure you are getting the most out of the integration " regardless of what time tracking platform you use . <h> Create Clear and Consistent Meeting Names <p> This is a good practice in general . But it really matters for calendar-based time tracking . The name you choose for the calendar event will be directly imported as a job .

It 's important to be specific . <h> Not Ideal <h> Much Better <h> Make Sure Your Calendar Is Up to Date <p> Forget to cancel a meeting ? Guess what ? That meeting will be recorded in your timekeeping system . While it 's always a good idea to keep your calendar up to date , it becomes critical when you are using it to track time . The purpose of using Google Calendar is to save you time and ensure accurate data " not send you down a terrible ( and unbillable ! ) rabbit hole of updating old events in your calendar . <h> Write Meeting Descriptions <p> When you create an event in GCal , there 's an often underutilized area that allows you to write meeting notes , an agenda , or basically whatever you like . We recommend using this open field to clearly state what specific tasks were worked on . This data can be imported as a comment in many time tracking systems . <h> Exclude All-Day Events <p> We can say with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours . ( Let 's hope so . ) But , if you create all-day events in Google Calendar , your time tracking system may actually record a meeting as 24 hours long ! There is a simple but important fix " just make sure to set your time tracking preferences so that all-day meetings are not entered as 24 hours in your system . <h> Minutes vs . Hours <p> Some time tracking systems may track time in minutes . Other track time in hours or fractions thereof . You 'll want to make sure that Google Calendar is exporting your time data in the format recognized by your time tracking system . <h> Track When a Meeting Starts , Not When It 's Created <p> This should n't be an issue for most Google Calendar and timesheet integrations , but it 's worth mentioning in case .

Set Benchmarks for Key Tasks <p> Agency work has expanded to include digital content and strategy , SEO , and host of services that run the gamut from crisis management to product design .

@@40577057 @577057/ <p> Employee wellness programs have evolved from cookie cutter ( pun intended ) corporate fitness and smoking cessation programs to diverse , engaging , and ROI-focused initiatives that have major impact on employee health and wellbeing . Let 's take a look at how to create , name , and manage a wellness program at your organization ! <h> Wellness Program ROI <p> Wellness programs are proven to not only increase employee health and well being , but to reduce business costs as well . Johnson &amp; Johnson , for example , has stated that their wellness program has saved the organization $250 million over a six-year period , resulting in a wellness program ROI of $2.71 for each dollar invested ! <p> In 2013 , the RAND Corporation conducted a survey of employers that asked questions about the efficacy of their wellness programs . More than 60% of those surveyed said their " program reduced healthcare costs , " and nearly 80% stated that it " decreased absenteeism and increased productivity . " <p> When implemented properly , wellness programs provide a significant return for many businesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee retention to reduced absenteeism to more effective cross-functional teams . <h> Employee Retention <p> There are few things more costly and disruptive than when employees elect to leave a company . According to the Center for American Progress , voluntary employee turnover can cost businesses as much as 220% of an employee 's salary . It 's no wonder that in a 2015 survey , Saba Software found that 49% of HR leaders " named retention and leadership development programs as the top priority among talent management goals . " Wellness programs help foster happy , healthy , and engaged employees , which in turn makes them more likely to stay with your organization and continue to perform work on behalf of the company . <h> Reduced Absenteeism <p> Healthy employees are less likely to miss work . They 're less likely to take sick days , work while under the weather ( and potentially infect their co-workers ) , or work in a state of low productivity due to illness . Research from the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families shows that workers performing at suboptimal productivity due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost employers $160 billion per year ! <p> Office wellness programs help keep employees healthy , fit , and better able to resist and heal from a cold , the flu , or other illnesses . <h> Team Building <p> Many employee wellness programs include ( friendly ) competitions , joint activities ( no pun intended ) , and shared rewards for team goals . Also , walking groups , running teams , smoking cessation partners , healthy cooking classes , and many other group activities help to foster a sense of community and team spirit . <h> Reduced Healthcare Costs <p> Workplace wellness programs are proven to reduce healthcare costs . In 2016 , Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan spoke with CNBC about the positive effects his company 's wellness program was having on the business : " Workplace wellness programs are a worthwhile investment and becoming core to how we create the best workplace for our teammates . They also help us keep annual increases in costs our employees pay for medical coverage lower than the average rates across the country . Employees making less than $50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase since 2012 . " <h> Best Wellness Program Ideas <p> The best wellness programs are those that have been proven to have a significant positive impact on employees throughout your organization . Some of these are simple , such as providing healthy snacks , whereas others , like paid maternity and paternity care , come at greater cost to the business <p> High-performing wellness programs go beyond employees and take the entire family into account . Increasingly , employers are embracing wellness as a family issue : Nearly 40% of companies extend wellness incentives to spouses , up from 34% in 2013 . At these companies , employees and their spouses together can earn nearly $100 per month for completing all the requirements of the wellness program . <h> Flexible Work Hours <p> Cramming eight hours of work into a 9-to-5 schedule can be challenging for employees with families , hobbies , or those who are in school . Flexible work hours not only reduce stress , but helps your employees product better work . <h> Healthy Snacks <p> Oftentimes , your employees may be eating unhealthy foods simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other healthy snacks can help your team satisfy their hunger , while keeping them in good health . <h> Ergonomic Training <p> Are all your employees sitting properly , with their neck , back , and arms properly aligned ? Offering ergonomic education will help reduce workplace injuries and keep your team safe while they are spending long hours in the office . <h> Pets <p> Allowing pets in the office is a great way to give your employees a chance to relax and have fun . Plus , scheduling and paying for pet care can be a source of stress for pet owners , many of whom would be elated have their beloved pets with them at work . <h> Preventative Care <p> Health checks , physicals , flu shots , vaccinations . Anything you can provide to prevent employees from becoming ill will help reduce absenteeism and most importantly , ensure that your team is healthy and able to succeed at home and at work . <h> Add Office Plants <p> It may sound strange , but office plants are proven to promote wellbeing and reduce stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office plants provide a nice environment to host clients , partners , and guests . <h> Paid Maternity Leave <p> Current U.S. law requires that business offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave annual for new mothers . Unpaid leave can cause financial stress to new parents . Businesses with leading wellness programs go far beyond this minimum and offer paid maternity and paternity leave for new parents . <h> Gym Discounts <p> Cardiovascular and strength training help reduce heart-related health risks and can be an excellent outlet to manage stress or other issues . By providing a discounted gym membership , your employees are more likely to take a part in exercise programs and increase their overall health . <h> Smoking Cessation <p> It 's extremely difficult to quit smoking cigarettes , even though they have major negative effects on health . Offering a smoking cessation program is proven to help employees break their smoking habits and improve their health . <h> How to Run a Company Wellness Program <p> Sure , all these ideas sound good on paper . Healthy eating , walking groups , even spending time quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution ? What are the components of a successfully run company wellness program ? <h> checkboxoutlineblank Leadership Buy In <p> Here 's a harsh fact : Your wellness program will not work without buy-in from the leadership team . That 's because it takes time and resources to launch and manage an effective workplace wellness program . Before starting your corporate or local wellness program , it 's recommended to first find an executive champion who can help provide guidance , funds , and oversight to any health and wellness initiatives , large or small . <h> checkboxoutlineblank Communication <p> When does the wellness program start ? How do employees join ? Are there fees associated with the wellness activities ? Do employees need to complete surveys about the program ? Where can employees find out more information about corporate wellness initiatives ? Why are you spending time creating this program ? Will it really help the team ? <p> Well-executed wellness programs require exceptional employee communications . This includes a wellness website or webpage , signage and posters in the office , emails or Slack channels about the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions or concerns your employees may have . <h> checkboxoutlineblank Diversity <p> Wellness programs cover a wide range of activities . For your program to truly succeed , and be embraced by your entire employee population , it 's best to provide a diverse set of wellness activities . Rather than focus solely on physical health or stress reduction , the most successful programs incorporate the full spectrum of health practices , including mental health , diet , cardiovascular exercise , strength training , smoking cessation , etc. <h> checkboxoutlineblank Evaluation <p> Did employee health improve ? Has absenteeism been reduced ? Are your employees more or less happy in the office ? What about health care costs ? Have they changed ? <p> Without evaluating the results of your workplace health program , there 's no way to determine if it 's working and understand what you can do to improve the results . You 'll want to take both quantitative and qualitative measurements of the program 's results , using employee surveys , cost analyses , and long-term employee retention data to assess and optimize your wellness program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Typical employee wellness programs include smoking cessation programs , walking groups , and healthy snacks in the office . But what do the most innovative wellness programs include ? How are they different from other health initiatives ? <h> Puppy delivery <p> Almost everyone loves this one . Organizations like Brave Pup can bring your team a group of adorable puppies to play with at the office . Interacting with loving animals can help relax your team and foster a sense of community among your employees . <h> Meditation room <p> What if there was a quiet place your employees could go to clear their minds , relax , and create a renewed sense of peace and focus ? If you have a small office , conference room , or other area that 's infrequently used , consider transforming it into a place of contemplation for your team . <h> Personal trainers <p> Personal trainers can be expensive , but they offer custom workout and health programs , as as fitness oversight , that can improve employee health and help ensure they are keeping up with their personal exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your employees very excited to come to work , if there is an on-site masseuse available for short messages . Plus , massage can ease tension and help your team stay focused ! <h> Acupuncture <p> Even with good insurance , acupuncture costs can add up quickly . Offering employees gift cards for licensed acupuncturists can provide relief from stress , and aches and pains . <h> Fitbits and Wearables <p> Fitbits and other wearables make it easy for employees to track their health and wellness . Granted , offering wearables should be handled carefully , as a number of privacy and perception issues may arise . <h> Healthy Cooking Lessons <p> Healthy cooking lessons are a way to teach employees healthy habits and skills that go beyond the workplace . Plus , these can be great team building exercises ! <h> Recreation Room <p> If you have extra office space , why not convert it into a recreation room ? This would serve as a place where employees can relax , play games , and just hang out . <h> Low-Cost Employee Wellness Ideas <p> Even though wellness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the funds , bandwidth , or drive to manage a full-fledged wellness program . But that does n't mean you ca n't provide low-cost , one-off wellness opportunities for your team . <h> Running Groups <p> Before work , after work , or during lunch , running groups help employees reduce stress , clear their heads , and foster a sense of community . You might want to make group t-shirts , but besides that , costs are essentially non-existent . <h> Fitness Challenges <p> Whether it 's cardiovascular , strength , or sports-related , fitness challenges offer employees a fun way to stay in shape and work together toward a common goal . <h> Healthy Snacks in the Office <p> Veggies , fruit , and other natural office snacks make it easy for your team to eat right while they are at work . These costs are typically far less than a happy hour or other less healthy events . <h> Healthy Lunches <p> If you provide weekly lunch for your team , why not make it a healthy one ? Salad bars , veggie sandwiches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy . <h> Meditation <p> Work can be stressful . Providing any area to meditate , as well as some guidance on how to do so , can have a positive impact on your team . <h> Walking Meetings <p> How many of your meetings do you actually need to be seated for ? Try hosting walking meetings whenever the weather is nice , and a presentation is not required . <h> Worst Employee Wellness Program Ideas <p> Rather than list workplace wellness program ideas that have gone awry , it 's much more beneficial to understand what characteristics can lead to a problematic employee wellness experience . <h> Dangerous <p> Whether your employee health program includes diet , exercise , or mental health , taking any of these initiatives to the extreme is not a good idea for your employees or your business . Some employees will be better suited to certain activities , and pushing employees too hard in terms of diet or exercise can put them at risk for health issues . Similarly , engaging in overly aggressive contests or putting too much peer pressure on employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and possibly even subject your organization to legal action . <h> Cost Prohibitive <p> Three-day-long detoxes . Flights to five-star spas . High-end chefs . Wellness programs do not need to cost an arm and a leg to be effective . In fact , if spending too many resources and time on your wellness program could be counterproductive . <h> Distracting from Work <p> Wellness programs should fit into your existing office environment , culture , and schedule . That means no jumping jack competitions in the main lobby , no team runs during critical meetings , and a host of other logistical no-nos . This may seem obvious , but once your team gets caught up in health and wellness activities , particularly those that are competitive , it 's possible to lose sight of critical business imperatives and view the wellness program itself as more important than completing one 's daily work . <h> How to Name Your Wellness Program at Work <p> What should you call your wellness program ? Once you 've settled on a name , and got buy in from the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , it 's important to take the time to think of a name that is going to inspire your colleagues to participate and be a part of your company health initiatives . <h> checkboxoutlineblank Memorable <p> You colleagues are busy . They do n't have much time to think about or commit to your wellness program . It 's helpful to come up with a name they wo n't forget . Something that looks good on t-shirts and posters , and is easily remembered by all types of employees . <h> checkboxoutlineblank Catchy <p> Here 's your chance to write a pun , a rhyme , acronym , or alliteration that helps your team think positively about your wellness program . It can be simple , like " Health Heroes " or bit more obtuse , like F.I.R.E . ( Fitness Is Running Everywhere ) . There 's nearly an infinite number of possibilities here , many of which are far better than the examples listed above . <h> checkboxoutlineblank On Brand <p> At its core , what is your brand about ? Speed ? Insight ? Fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing team when creating a wellness program . The program name should align with the brand direction and make sense to your team . <h> checkboxoutlineblank Inclusive <p> The most effective wellness programs provide an opportunity for everyone in the office to participate . It 's important to take into account employee gender , body type , demographics , etc. , when coming up with a name for your program . Avoid loaded words like " guys , " " strong , " " muscle , " and think in terms of inclusivity , using words like " team , " " group , " " health , " and " well being . " <h> Wellness Challenge Ideas <p> What wellness challenge ideas will work for your team ? There 's no one-size-fits-all approach , but typically , successful wellness challenges involve activities that nearly any employee can participate in . That 's not to say that smaller teams ca n't create their own wellness challenges , but at the corporate level , you 'll want to start with wellness challenges that include as many different types of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a traditional office environment , it 's likely your employees spend almost the entire day seated in their chairs . A company walking challenge is a simple and easy way to get your team out of their seats and engaging in light , physical activity . Also , this is a low-cost initiative that requires little oversight , approval , or management . <h> Healthy Eating Challenge <p> This is another relatively straightforward , low-cost wellness challenge . You only need to announce the healthy eating challenge , set some guidelines for your team , and ( hopefully ) provide healthy snacks and drinks for the office . Granted , any workplace initiative , there are a handful of pitfalls to watch out for : <p> Do n't police your employees . Let them self-report or check off whether they are eating healthy . <p> Do n't judge or in any way reprimand employees who eat unhealthy meals in the office . <p> Do n't overthink what is or is not a healthy meal . It 's best to work within in set of simple guidelines , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenge <p> Even though stretching is one of those activities that may be considered an afterthought , it has a number of health benefits . According to the Mayo Clinic , stretching helps improve physical performance , reduces risk of injury , and improves range of motion . And with stretching , no one needs to leave the office ! A quiet space with soft floors or yoga mats should be sufficient . All you need to do , is coordinate a time when your team can come together a stretch for a series of days . You can start with a 30-day flexibility challenge or create something that lasts throughout the year . Either way , what matters is that you are helping employees become less sedentary and more mobile in the workplace .
