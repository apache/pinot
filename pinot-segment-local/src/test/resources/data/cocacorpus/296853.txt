In original Akan tradition , kente ( called nwentom ) was only worn by royalty and for religious and sacred purposes . A tribe in Ghana called the Ewes also had their own Kente designs similar to the one of Akans . In modern days , Kente has evolved to be a symbol of Afrocentric style and heritage for people all over the world and should be worn with great pride . <h> MUD CLOTH <p> Originated by the women of Mali 's Bamana culture centuries ago , mud cloth patterns and varieties are endless . Each piece of hand-dyed mud cloth has a story to tell . The symbols , the arrangement , color and shape , all reveal different social statures , characters and occupations . Even now , African people are very careful about what they wear as each fabric , color and dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known , mud cloth has become tremendously popular in the western world . An extraordinary beautiful fabric , the unique and exotic colors and designs are hand-spun and hand-woven to produce a rich and elegant textile . <h> DASHIKI <p> Perhaps the most colorful affirmation of African American pride is the dashiki . The dashiki found a market in America during the Black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s . The dashiki rebelled against men 's fashions of that time : brightly colored instead of drab , loose instead of tight , worn outside the pants instead of tucked in . It could be worn defiantly on occasions that normally would call for a coat and tie . The dashiki was worn as a symbol of affirmation , it stood for " black is beautiful , " and signaled a return to African roots , and insistence on full rights in American society . The militancy of the 1960s may have faded , but the dashiki has not . It still serves as a symbol of Afrocentric-ness , especially during Kwanzaa and Black History Month . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colorful , comfortable shirt for all occasions . 44034 @qwx904034

@@100589253 @4789253/ <h> Very Pretty <h> An excellent choice ! I am so happy that I chose the item ! <p> My Gena Pant Set was a smashing hit at the school reunion ! I received numerous compliments and special photo requests ! I was also asked where I bought the outfit . If I had to make a choice , I would choose the Gina Pant Suit again ! <h> okay <p> the suit was beautiful it was pretty on me , I just have one issue . when I got ready to put the suit on some of the sewed on rhinestones fell off and I had to take the suit back off and sew rhinestones back on . after I wore the suit I wash the in a mesh bag on delicate cycle and more rhinestones came off , I hung it up to dry.before I can wear the suit again I am going to have to sew the rhinestones back on as well as sew over the rhinestones that 's loose ! ! The price I 'm paying for this suit is too much for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this suit they should have made sure the rhinestones was very tight and secure since they are sewed ! ! ! 
@@100589254 @4789254/ <h> nice shoe <h> A Great Find <p> This sophisticated shoe reminded me of the past , but with modern comfort . It is easy to put on . Once you get the lacing straight ( according to your foot width ) , you step into the shoe and it has a zipper in the back . You will not have to lace up every time you wear the shoe . The heel is also not too high . I am happy with my unique find . 
@@100589259 @4789259/ <h> Shamelle Jacket Dress <h> Beautiful Dress <p> I love this dress and I purchased to wear to my son 's wedding . As other reviews stated the dress was wrinkled ( purchased a hand held steamer for $20 ) , zipper fragile ( just take your time when zipping ) , and some of the beads did come off the dress only . However , they did provide additional replacement beads . But I never could determine where they came off of as there are so many on the dress . The beads are grey not black and so is the dress . It is a mud grey but the beading brings it to life . It is not your typical mother of the groom dress so I will be able to wear it to other dressy events . I purchased a sparkly silver shoe and bag to wear with . You do n't need a lot of jewelry because of all the beading . I really love this dress . <h> Beautiful and Comfortable <p> This dress truly was over my expectations . The jacket was designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't give much details , so I was surprised . I bought it for a specific occasion however I wore it to another because of its elegance . It was a great comfortable fit . Lovely material , nice flowing which brought many compliments
