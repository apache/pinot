A " low threshold " program that accepts adults into permanent housing directly from the streets , shelters , hospitals and long-term care facilities , DAH strives to help tenants stabilize and improve their health outcomes despite co-occurring mental health issues , alcohol and substance abuse problems , and/or complex medical conditions . In addition to being an effective way to end homelessness , this supportive housing model is also fiscally prudent as it leads to cost savings by reducing overutilization of emergency services . <p> Unique in its on-site provision of wrap-around support services , DAH currently houses over 1,700 formerly homeless people across 36 sites . DAH housing takes many forms including : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master leasing allows SFDPH-HUH to engage in long-term leases with building owners who retain responsibility only for large capital improvements after lease-signing ; building owners often renovate residential and common areas prior to lease signing as well . Master leasing has allowed SFDPH-HUH to bring large numbers of housing units online rapidly . <p> Units in new capital developments . An increasing number of DAH units fit this model . Most new capital units take the form of private apartments that afford tenants access to private bathrooms and cooking facilities . Depending on the site , the DAH program refers clients to some or all units in the buildings . <p> Set-aside DAH units in larger residential buildings owned by nonprofit providers . These units may be in renovated single room occupancy ( SRO ) buildings or newly developed sites . <p> Units in a licensed residential care facility . Only one DAH site fits into this category , and tenants share rooms at this facility . <p> Regardless of the setting , most tenants live independently in their own units , though they have access to on-site support services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Replaces memo 3.06-09 of 4/1/91 . ) <p> The Tarasoff decision deals with responsibility of the psychotherapist to warn victims of potential violence by clients . Simply stated , this means that the psychotherapist-patient privilege is overshadowed by the therapist 's responsibility to warn an intended victim . <p> The general legal requirements for DMS staff in regard to Tarasoff warnings follow : <p> The psychotherapist 's duty does not arise only where the psychotherapist has actual knowledge of danger . It arises whenever the therapist determines , or pursuant to standards of the profession should determine , that the patient presents a serious danger to another . If a patient threatens physical violence against someone , the threat must be a serious one and the victim or victims must be reasonable identifiable . Some examples of when a victim is " reasonably identifiable " include : a ) the victim is specifically named by patient ( ex . Bob Smith of 123 Sesame Street ) ; b ) the victim is easily identifiable by their relationship to the patient ( ex : my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ) ; or c ) other easily recognizable trait ( ex. : the Mayor , my congressman , the anchor for the Channel 22 5 p.m. news hour ) . In order to discharge the duty to warn , the psychotherapist must make reasonable efforts to communicate the threat to the victim or victims and must notify a law enforcement agency . <p> Persons to be notified in a Tarasoff situation must include the intended victim , and the police . The therapist must take all necessary steps to warn the victim of the circumstances such as attempting to contact the potential victim by telephone and/or letter . This may include telling other persons who are in a position to warn the victim . It is reasonable to provide the name and address of the client making the threats and the nature of the violence that the client has threatened . It is not permissible to provide the police or the victim access to confidential patient records without a valid court order , however . <p> Serious consideration should be given to initiating a 72-hour involuntary evaluation hold pursuant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once a decision has been made as to how the situation will be handled clinically , this should be carefully charted . The therapist needs to chart what information was disclosed , to whom , when and why . <p> The name and location of the law enforcement agency contacted and the name and badge number of the officer must also be included in the chart . <p> A written incident report must always be completed by clinical staff and distributed through appropriate Quality Improvement channels when a Tarasoff warning has taken place . This report would include the name of the staff member issuing the warning , the name of the supervisor and any other persons involved in the decision , as well as the circumstances surrounding the warning . In addition , the report must indicate : <p> The patient communicated to the psychotherapist a threat of physical violence . <p> That this threat was a serious one . <p> The reasons why the victim or victims were reasonably identifiable .
