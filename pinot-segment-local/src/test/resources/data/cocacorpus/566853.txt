@@107940634 @3340634/ <h> Psychological Pricing Top 10 Strategies To Increase Sales <h> Science behind pricing strategies <p> Pricing is the core element of all businesses . There are numerous techniques to set product prices and each yield different results . At times even the same strategy applied for multiple times gives different results . <p> That 's why deciding product prices always gives tough times to the people involved in making the decision . So to make things simpler , here are two crucial points- that need to be considered : <p> Final selling price should be inclusive of all total costs ( expenses , distribution , development , etc. ) + total profit <p> Track results , revise prices , try alternatives and see what works better <p> Here we have compiled a list of top 10 pricing strategies / techniques- used by ace businesses be it e-commerce , brick and mortar stores or subscriptions business which had and are giving them fruitful results . <h> 1 . Build your brand loyalty <p> When you enter the competitive market , you will have enough players . Your focus must be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offer your product at the minimum price . You can even offer a free trial for a fixed period . Put extra efforts for your content and social media marketing . Once the customer base is built up , you can slowly increase your price without compromising on the quality . Get testimonials , set some offers and see you sales soaring . This will book for yourself a comfortable seat in the market . <h> 2 . Play with economics- The demand rule <p> Many of you might hate economics but this old school technique is a boom . Just recall the demand rule : the higher the price , the lower the quantity demanded . But if the product is popular and more people are willing to purchase it , a slight increase in price wo n't affect demand and people would happily pay to get their desired product . <h> 3 . Experiment with sizes <p> This is a very smart technique employed by retail stores/chains and the same can be applied to online stores . I was at a food outlet and asked for a pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I would prefer a big pack as I had n't asked for a small pack . So if you are n't aware , you end up purchasing the bigger one . This is indeed a smart move . Large things are always appealing . The- more people buy it , more money you make . <h> 4 . Pull money by pushing features <p> Subscriptions businesses seems to be master at this one . One among the best and common pricing strategies you would come across . <p> They set up 3 to 5 plans at various price levels in ascending order with the top plan most costly with all features and rest other plans with less features . What makes this interesting is the list of features . The hot favourite features will be present in the top plans always . <p> This makes people in need of that feature to either buy or upgrade to the top plans . More people switching to the top plans , more the sales in your kitty . <h> 5 . Sell on the name <p> This pricing strategy depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling beers in two variants- regular and premium , you will notice that people are happily purchasing the premium one at a higher price than the regular one at a lower price . That too with a considerable difference . May be a 5:1 ratio of premium to regular . The word premium makes it sounds like an exclusive product . <h> 6 . Battle it out with competitors <p> Once you have a loyal customer base , good reviews and a reputed brand name in the market , it 's time to go one step further while pricing your products . You have two options to set the product price : <p> Equal to the competitor <p> More than the competitor <p> The second- option seems risky but if you guarantee A1 quality products and top notch service to customers , selecting the second option can be an optimal choice . <h> 7 . Set prices ending in 0,5 or 9 <p> Have you ever seen a product price ending in 2 , 4 or 8 ? I have n't seen any . Its always a round figure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though $1000 and $999 has a difference of 1 dollar only , but a smaller number always appeals more . <h> 8 . Pitch at your desired price <p> A very simple and efficient strategy . If you want to sell a product costing $19 at a price say $39 , many people may not purchase it . Just set a bigger price , say $59 , cancel it out and put it up for $39 only . This is the- before-now technique . It surely converts customers as they view it at as a huge discount offer . <h> 9 . Use quantity as bait <p> If people are buying more , offer them more discounts or free/complementary products . Buy 3 and get 2 free or Buy 3 or more and get a whopping 40% discount . Some of the widely used plans in supermarkets to attract audience and clear stock resulting in extra sales . <h> 10 . Make peoples perception your power <p> A small description of product is what you need to sell at a higher price like a reputed source- country , manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfume from Paris . People always have a perception that a big brand or famous source always provides better quality . That 's all you need to mention . <h> So .. What 's your pick ? <p> These pricing techniques are just a piece of a huge pie . There are a lot more pricing techniques applied by businesses all over the world . Some of the innovative and proven ones have been covered above. - If you have more pricing strategies , feel free to post them in the comment section below .

Ok , you can hate me till its released ! <p> Code Signing Certificate is like a seal of trust . We encrypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weve been using a certificate from Thawte for a year , but it expired on June 10th . <p> Truth be told , I did not want to keep spending a ton of money on secure certificates . Adobe AIR code signing certificate from Thawte costs $300 every year . Mac and Windows are another $300 each . Thawte web server SSL certificates are another $250 for each domain . That 's a lot of money only on SSL certificates . <h> Searching for cheaper options <p> Google for cheap SSL certificates and you will get a boat load of results . There are lots of companies offering all kinds of SSL certificates VeriSign , DigiTrust , GoDaddy , Comodo , InstantSSL , RapidSSL , GlobalSign and many more . There are two things common though : <p> They are all too confusing <p> They are all still too expensive <p> So I had to look for more options <h> And the winner is <p> StartSSL . <p> Start SSL website wont create the greatest trust , but technically their certificates work and they are damn cheap free ! Start SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that too is very reasonable . <p> While they even offer free SSL certificates , it cost us $120 in verification fees to get both a SSL certificate and a code singing certificate . And these are valid for 2 years , not just one . Not only that , the SSL cert is valid for multiple sub domains . And if I am thinking right , we can also issue certificates for our other domains . That 's a lot of savings ! <p> Their support is good , and even their Founder/COO/CTO Eddy Nigg answers support questions . <p> Frankly , in more ways than one , StartSSL felt like us . Building great solutions , offering personal / human support , and trying to get big . <h> Technical Challenges <p> The transition was n't completely smooth though . Primarily because of the technical complexities involves with getting and installing certificates . <p> First I tried getting a free web server SSL . I created a Certificate Signing Request ( CSR ) using MediaTemples web interface . Start SSL issued the certificate . But it would n't install on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I already have a certificate for that domain name , and cant issue another one without revoking the first . Revocation costs some $25 though ! Yikes ! ! So end of the road . <p> I then verified personal identity by paying $60 to StartSSL . Went fine and quick ( faster than Thawte actually ) . <p> I thought I must do a Code Signing Certificate before moving forward . <p> Last time , I had created the Code Signing Certificate using Thawtes website . And did not fully know how to go about it . After doing some searching , we found one article that explained creating a CSR using Mac OS X Keychain Access application . <p> So I created a CSR using Keychain Access and submitted that to StartSSL . The cert was issued in no time . <p> Code Signing requires both a private key and a certificate though . This realization , which occurred late , caused some big roadblocks . Why ? Because I could n't figure out how to get the private key that was used to generate the CSR from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Code Signing Certificate right ? Tried that and hit the " cert already issued for this identity " limit . $25 revocation fee . <p> So I went ahead and got the organization identity verified with an extra $60 . Again , this went smooth was completed in just a few hours . <p> By this time , we had researched and fully understood the process of obtaining and applying the code signing certificate . Essentially , generate a private key , generate a cert signing request using it . Send the CSR to certifying authority ( StartSSL ) , get the certificate , create a pkcs12 key combination using the private key , certificate and a password , and use that . p12 file in Adobe AIR to sign the release . And yes , use the migration options to re-sign the release with our old expired certificate , so users do n't  have a problem . here 's a nice and clear explanation of how to do this using command line " openssl " tool . <p> So I felt it should be easy now . Went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on Start SSL ) , but got the same error that I cant create a new cert since one already existed on my account . <p> Time to ask for support once again . After a little back and forth , and discussion with Eddy , Start SSL guys revoked my original Object Signing Cert at no cost , as an exception . <p> I requested a new cert , got it immediately , and applied it . <p> All worked ! Finally ! <h> Good , so that 's taken care of insane SSL costs are now a thing of past <p> It took me a while to get this going , and that caused delays , but now we have the certificate business taken care of .

GaragePay automatically downloads PayPal data , allows for smart searches and let 's you send money . There is CSV export too and everything is packed in a nice user interface . As a matter of fact , I used GaragePay before we built Putler . <p> So how does Putler compare with GaragePay ? <h> Putler was created because GaragePay did not solve all our problems <p> If you review GaragePay and Putler , you will realize that both fundamentally solve similar problems getting PayPal data on your desktop and letting you work with it . While GaragePay is focused on day to day operations of transactions management , Putler goes a few steps beyond and addresses strategic and business intelligence goals of small business owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or for that any other app that does PayPal reporting / analysis ) did not do everything we wanted out of a PayPal client app . We are passionate about helping web entrepreneurs and small business owners . And see Putler can significantly improve business results for millions of PayPal users . <h> Conclusion <p> Frankly , if GaragePay provided detailed business insights in an easy to understand manner , I would n't have built Putler . GaragePay is good for day to day operations , but falls short on useful business analysis . Putler does not provide some of the features GaragePay has specifically saved searches , CSV export and send money but they are on the development roadmap and will come soon . On the other side , the ability to refund individual products , extensive business insights , ability to set sales targets and a ton of other features give a clear upper hand to Putler . We even have customers whove told us they recovered Putlers cost in the first half an hour using it . Business insights they got from Putler were so valuable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about GaragePay / Putler ? Do you have some feedback about our comparison ? Anything to correct ? <p> Is there another PayPal software you would like us to compare with Putler ?

@@107940688 @3340688/ <h> Issuing Refunds Putler let 's you select items to refund <p> Issuing refunds is part of business . As a matter of fact , I have found issuing prompt refunds makes for happy non-customers ! In my businesses , I attend to refund requests before support requests . Making it easier to ask for and provide a refund increases customer trust . <p> Some shopping carts / e-commerce software allow you to issue refunds . But for most , its a manual process . For every refund request , you have to log in to PayPal , find the transaction via Transaction History and issue a refund . We wanted to make this process faster and simpler . So we included a quick " Issue Refund " button on every refundable transaction in Putler both on the Sales dashboard and on the Transactions dashboard . <p> Putler tracks refunds and links them up to items in the transaction . This way , you can find out refund ratio for each of your products . This is key to determine the quality of that product and your marketing material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your target markets patience levels = <p> Its easy to track full refunds , we can simply mark all items in that transaction as refunded . But how do you link partial refunds to products ? PayPal does not provide any mechanism for this . Neither any shopping cart / e-commerce system as far as we know . <p> So we built this in Putlers latest release 0.8.7 . <p> Putler now asks you to select items you want to refund . It selects everything by default , so you can quickly do a full refund . But if you want to do a partial refund , you can select items you want to refund , and even the amount ( or percentage ) of refund you want to provide for each item . <p> If you have already done a partial refund on a transaction , Putler will notify you of that as well . <h> Issuing Refunds using Putler <p> Come to the Sales or Transactions dashboard in Putler <p> Search for the customers name / email address / transaction I 'd / products name anything you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in split second . <p> Locate the transaction in the list and click to see its details ( Putler will automatically select the first match . So if there is only one match , you do n't  have to do this . ) <p> If you did not find the transaction , expand date range if necessary this will automatically perform the original search once again with the new date range . <p> Click on " Issue Refund " button . <p> If you want to give full refund , you can go ahead and issue refund now . <p> If you want to refund only some items from the sale , un-check the other items . Putler will automatically total up the refund amount . <p> If you want to provide a percentage refund , click on the % value for each item and change it as you need . <p> If you want to provide partial refund for an item , click on the amount value and change it as you need . <p> Add Notes if you wish . <p> Click " Issue Refund " to process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , give you a confirmation , update the original transaction , link the refund transaction with the original ( so you can quickly refer to it later ) , and also mark selected products as refunded . All this will work just auto-magically ! <p> This is the fastest and most efficient way of issuing refunds for PayPal sales !

@@107940721 @3340721/ <p> Hashtags started just like any other fad , but were way too hard to be ignored ! With Google+ , Twitter , YouTube having added this functionality Facebook also gave in and joined the hashtag fan club in 2013 = <p> If you are wondering what is the buzz around Hashtags all about , you 'll be surprised to learn that its not rocket science . But hashtags can be very powerful communication and marketing mechanism . And that 's the big deal ! <p> Any word can be made a hashtag . Just add a hash symbol ( # ) before the word . For instance : #flowers , #bikes etc .. <p> here 's how Wikipedia defines is . <p> A hashtag is a word or a phrase prefixed with the symbol # . It is a form of metadata tag . Short messages on microblogging and social networking services such as Twitter , Tout , identi.ca , Tumblr , Instagram , Flickr , Google+ or Facebook may be tagged by putting " # " before important words , as in : #Wikipedia is an #encyclopedia that anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since one can search for the hashtag and get the set of messages that contain it . <p> That last line is what the whole worlds reeling about ? <p> Well partly yes , the magical thing about a hashtag is that it connects the word to various discussions that are using a similar hashtag . <p> Think about it this way it 's like automatically linking your tweet / post / message to million other posts that have thought of a similar hashtag . All you have to do is add # and there you go you are all connected , covered and participating in a conversation . Most services will automatically convert the hashtag into a link and clicking on the hashtag will bring up all other messages with the same hashtag . <p> A marketer could kill to have such herculean connectivity and this is what makes hashtags the talk of the town ! <p> Now how can you as a business owner cum marketer benefit out of this simple yet effective tool ? <p> Here are some ways : <h> Discover Customers <p> Try searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keywords relevant to your business . You may find people who have tagged their posts with some hashtags . Reply to them using the same hashtags , or make a new post with that hashtag . You may just win a new customer ! <h> Get Found <p> The reverse of discovering customers is getting found by customers . Your customers would be searching too , and when you tag your posts / tweets with relevant hashtags , they can find you easily . <p> For example : If I am a bridal wear designer marketing my brand over Facebook , I would n't just post " Elegant Bridal Gowns in store now " Rather I would post " Elegant #Bridalgowns in store now " . <p> Just a simple hashtag can lead me to my niche audience . It can get my post connected to people who have wedding on their cards or those are looking out for bridal gowns for someone else . <h> Start a Movement / Campaign <p> Take GEs #IWantToInvent hashtag , which the company uses on an ongoing basis to get people to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people use it in all conversations not just GEs . The hashtag becomes an identifier of the movement / campaign . Connecting everyone together and sparking interest . <h> Run an Offer <p> Run your special offer with a hashtag . Either invite people to retweet / repost / like it , or ask them to respond to you with a hashtag . <p> For example : I am a florist and Valentines Day is just around the corner . Just put #ValentinesDayOffer in your posts . Invite people to use the same hashtag and even tell you what they want as an offer from you . <p> A side benefit of this is that using a popular hashtag ( or inventing one ) can get you a ton of traffic . Everyone looking for Valentines offers can come to you via that hashtag ! ! <h> Start and Participate in Conversations <p> Search for trending hashtags and participate in the conversation . Invite your customers to respond to a question , tagging responses with a hashtag . Ask customers to post support queries with a hashtag , and respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This not only will get your discussion noticed by relevant people but also get you connected to the different viewpoints . <p> Volvo 's #MyFirstVolvo hashtag captured the joyous discussions around experiences people shared on buying their first Volvo .
