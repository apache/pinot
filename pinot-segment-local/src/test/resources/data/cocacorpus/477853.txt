Phone calls were left unanswered , strange text messages were received , and we were unclear right up to an hour before the scheduled interview if he was even going to show up .

No questions are discussed before hand so the interview is completely organic and spontaneous . While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact outside the building . We had to break protocol as Timothy went outside to meet Matt and Matt began to tell him how Vanguard 1 was flyingaround the building " securing the perimeter " . From there it was just one strange request or comment after another which left the host shakenand uneasy before the interview even started . Once Matt finally sat down Timothy did manage to get him to answer traditional wrestling questionsabout his career and past but all the while weaved in was bizarre behavior . At one point Matt slipped into a zombie like trance and began chompingand grinding his teeth together while the host looked on in horror .

RF VIDEO sat down with Steve Keirn to discuss his entire career in world of professional wrestling and that career was a long one . Steve is one of those guys who has worked in every territory and for every major wrestling company out there . He has traveled the roads and shared the locker room with every major superstar in this business . Steve sits down with us to go into great detail on how he got started in the business down in FL breaking in for Eddie Graham to becoming one of the hottest tag team acts during the 80 's with his partner Stan Lane as the Fabulous Ones . Steve also became known in the WWE as Skinner and of course had a run as Doink when Matt Bourne got fired from the company . When we left the company he ventured off to the land of WCW where he did not want to play politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training facility in Tampa which created the biggest stars in the business today . <p> Steve starts the interview talking about his time working the early circuit like most legends in this business . Steve broke into wrestling down in Florid and ended up working in Atlanta , Memphis , AWA , Japan , and everywhere in between . You will hear tons and tons of locker room stories from around this time period of the 70 's and 80 's . If you are a old school fan this is such a great interview because he has stories on everyone . <p> He was not just Skinner , a gimmick that portrayed him as a tobacco spitting alligator hunter from the Everglades . Steve Keirn really shined in this business when he teamed up with Stan Lane as the Fabulous Ones but they would also encounter problems in this business as well . What happened when they made their AWA debut and the Road Warriors did not want to do business with them . Steve has a great story on how he ended up shooting on Road Warrior Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened backstage after the match . Oh did I forget to mention he had to go back out and work him later that night in a battle royal ! ! ! What problems did the team face in Memphis when Jerry Lawler had the book and was there problems being a top babyface with Lawler on top ? We talk about all of their major feuds all over the country and their runs in Memphis , AWA and down in Florida . <p> Steve goes into great detail of his runs in the WWE and WCW but to me the best part of the interview is talking about the golden days of wrestling during the 80 's . If you are a true long time fan like myself you will love all his stories on all of the companies that dominated our sport during the 80 's . Steve was also known as a big ribber and has so many funny locker room stories to share . <p> When you watch the WWE today on TV you have to know in the back of your mind that Steve Keirn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer for every Monday night on WWE Raw . Steve talks in great detail how he became the owner of FCW and we look into the schools history with the company from what the company looks for in new wrestlers just trying to get their big break into the WWE and so much more . Want to hear what guys go thru when they enter the training facility ? What roles do Dusty Rhodes , Joey Matthews , Billy Kidman , Norman Smiley and Billy Gunn play in the school ? Steve gives us a great look into the WWE machine like never before because not only is he one of the most well respected teachers out there in our business , but Steve has done it all in our industry and is just a sponge of knowledge . <p> This is just one of those interviews that will have you on the edge of your seats because like me it was so fun to listen to and hear stories on the business when I loved it the most the 80 's . Do n't worry if you started watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current event stories as well . The Steve Keirn shoot interview is not only very informative but very funny with his humorous take on the business . When the camera was turned off , Steve told me that nothing he said could get him in trouble because it was all the truth and he would never go back and change a thing that he accomplished .

Are you guys surprised after you took WCW to number one at how negative he has been publicly about the two of you Do you think Eric was in the right place at the right time or he was really that smart When Vince would have Hunter and DX come over to cut the promos at the arenas , did you ever consider going outside and trying to work your own angles out of it Are you two surprised that Goldberg speaks negatively now about the two of you saying you tried to sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , Kevin do you agree Are you surprised that so many people still criticize the one finger pin in the match Kevin had with Hogan Was there anyone that was put into the NWO that you guys just thought should n't be a part of it Do you think WCW would have been successful at all if the two of you never came there Do you guys think Vince Russo gets too much blame or too little for the end of WCW Do you think he is a good booker Do you guys think Scott was made a scapegoat for his bad habits when a lot of others had their own issues What happened at the MTV Spring Break segment A lot of wrestlers say they never knew who was in charge in WCW , is that accurate Do you think you guys used Hogan or he used you or neither Do you think Eric Bischoff at times was in over his head Did it become frustrating when the NWO kept expanding Kevin , when you went on TV and campaigned for Scott 's return was there an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own Were you guys surprised Zbysko got over so huge when he feuded with you guys When Russo came in and Eric was demoted , how did it affect you guys Compare the two of them Kevin , when Scott was n't in WCW an angle was shot where Goldberg tore up a fictitious contract against Scott . Scott said he did n't even know about it . Was there a plan to bring him back . Kevin , was it hard for you to not be able to get Scott back in Do you think a feud between the two of you in WCW would have been big business Do you think Vince would ever have the patience today to build an angle like you guys did against Sting for as long as you did When Bischoff intended on buying WCW , would Scott have been brought in At anytime in WCW when you guys were employed , did your contracts ever come up and allow you to negotiate with Vince How would you guys have booked the WCW invasion angle different than Vince Did Vince try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge do you think a true DX vs original NWO feud would be Do you think that it would ever happen When is enough , enough to where each of you just do n't want to wrestle anymore Have either of you ever talked to backers about doing your own startups Do you think Hogan will ever do his startup he has talked about for years How do you think a congressional investigation will affect the business Do you think Hogan was responsible for getting Sean Waltman fired Thoughts on Kevin Sullivans booking in WCW Do you think your promos would have been as good if they were scripted like today in the WWE Do you think if Vince did a WCW One Night Stand like the ECW show it could work When you came back to the WWE as the NWO , did you guys find anyone wanting to kill the angle off early for whatever reasons If you guys were booking the WWE today , what would you do different How do you think TNA will change when it goes to two hours Do you regret any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your past If the NWO was brought back , would you guys even want any kind of road scheduled at this time in your lives Are you surprised at how much Vince puts himself into the shows What made the NWO work in your mind and why has n't  it been able to be duplicated Do you have any advice for guys now who may be struggling with success and their demons Scott , inn an interview Kevin said that he and yourself were just big dicks in regards to the NWO vs . Wolfpac feud , thoughts Are you guys surprised that Goldberg did n't get over in the WWE and he hated it there How differently do you think Vince would have booked the NWO angle in WCW Were a lot of the promos you guys did when you would rip other guys shoots In WCW , who did you guys enjoy most working with and least and why On jumptheshark.com people voted that WCW jumped the shark when David Arquette won the belt , do you guys agree or disagree Hogan has claimed he came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you guys remember how it came up Bischoff has questioned whether he gave Kevin too much power , thoughts Who from WCW do you think Vince missed the boat on and could have used better or if at all What did you guys think when you saw the fake Diesel and Razor Thoughts on UFC Thoughts on newsletters and the internet Thoughts on John Cena and Batista who are the flagship wrestlers today If you guys were going to book a startup to take on Vince and TNA , what would you do Do you think wrestling needs to go back to characters like Diesels and Razors Konnan has said politics killed WCW , do you agree Is it hard to book and wrestle at the same time without a conflict of interest Do you think the booked finish for Starrcade 97 Hogan-Sting with all of the interference hurt business and Sting should have just went over clean What do you think could spike an era in the business like the late nineties What did you guys think of Jim Cornette 's rants against the you guys and Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were too personal Lance Storm has said in regards to one of WCW 's big problems was booking over stipulated matches and the continued non-honoring of those stipulations Did either of you consider buying WCW with investors Who are some of each of your biggest influences throughout your careers Who was a bigger acquisition do you think for WCW ? Roddy Piper or Randy Savage Was there anyone that became available and came to WCW who really surprised you Do you think Heenan gave too much away when he questioned what side Hogan was on when he came down the aisle at Bash at the Beach Did you realize that when Schivonne gave away the Mick Foley title finish on Nitro that it would backfire and people would watch Raw instead Do you think WWE business would be just as strong if they did seasonal rosters to give guys time off

In the 80s there was one man that was Extreme before ECWs Tod Gordon and Paul Heyman . This man had the vision to offer the blood thirsty wrestling fans a product that they could sink their teeth into called TWA , Tri State Wrestling . T WAS motto was , " They wrestled , they brawled , they did it all " TWA was a company for every smart mark wrestling fan to enjoy . The man behind this company has been in the shadows for the past 25 years until now . RF VIDEO had the pleasure of sitting down with TWA owner/promoter Joel Goodhart as he breaks his silence for the first time anywhere exclusivley with RFVIDEO . <p> Everyone had questions for Joel Goodhart including myself , and the big one was , what the hell happened ? What went wrong and where did Joel go after he promoted his final show with Buddy Rogers vs Buddy Landell . We get all the questions answered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts off where we talk about the origins of the Squared Circle fan club which I was a member myself . Joel talks about working with his two partners at the time to create a brand in the Philadelphia market right here in Langhorne PA at the I95 Marketplace . Joel and his partner also landed a radio show and you will hear all about the trials and tribulations of Rasslin Radio . Joel talks about how they landed on WIP after being on a few stations before . It was n't long after that when TWA was founded and they promoted their first event ever at my Neshaminy High School . You will hear how the company grew from a minor little indy show into something that is still talked about today . <p> Joel talks about his bus trips to Memphis and of course who could forget the lunch Q&amp;As as the Bus Stop and Champs in Northeast Philly . You will hear all about the Philly wars between WWE and NWA . How did Joel build his relationships with the NWA wrestlers ? He has great stories on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire NWA crew during the 80s including Sting , Muta , Abby , Lex Luger , Steiners , LOD and so many other legends . <p> As time went on the TWA got bigger and better and so did the star power . Joel was bringing in the top indy talent from around the country before anyone else . All eyes were on his promotion and he had a rabid fan base made up of all hardcore wrestling fans . We talk in depth about all of his major shows that took place at Temple University . <p> What was it like for Joel to work with Jerry Lawler , and how did he get the Von Erichs to come to Philly when they would never leave Texas ? What was a young Paul Heyman like to work with ? What was Ted Pettys role with the company . Who was his booker ? How did the Sandman get started in the business ? What was Abby like to work with behind the scenes . Was The Original Sheik and Sabu hard to control ? Who came up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to take advantage of him ? All of these questions get answered . <p> We talk about all the historic feuds from the TWA era like DC Drake and Larry Winters . Joel talks in depth about the entire Eddie Gilbert vs Cactus Jack feud including the infamous 2-3 falls match the barbed wire match that is one of the sickest matches to ever take place in Philly . What happened when the rope broke when Owen Hart made a rare apperance ? What was it like dealing with some of the biggest names in the business during his run ? <p> As the company got bigger , so did the expenses . When did Joel realize that he might have been in over his head and how did Tod Gordon get involved in TWA and what exactly was his role ? Joel talks in great detail and all the major matches of the companies history including any road blocks that he had to face . How did the NWA react to Joel running in their market ? <p> Of course the question that everyone wanted to know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take place in 1992 with Buddy Landell vs Buddy Rogers ? What did Joel have planned and why did he leave the business without a trace . For the first time ever , Joel comments on why he left and who did he tell ? He has a message to the fans who always wanted to know where the money went . Did he have any regrets and what was the fall out between Tod Gordon and Joel . Joel even talks about how much money he lost in TWA . <p> Another big question that we talked about was if Joel was the ultimate money mark and you will be shocked to hear what he has to say . Did Joel follow ECW and what were his thoughts on Tod and Paul Heyman taking his baby to the next level . <p> If you 're a fan of the Philadelphia wrestling scene this interview is a must for you to view .

Before billionaires dueled over ratings points and lured talent with million dollar contacts . There was a man who ruled over his territory with values , honesty and a work ethic now long forgotten . Verne Gagne was a man of respect , a man who lived by a code that your word was you bond and expected nothing less of the men and women he dealt with . He built a local empire by teaching his talent that you can never succeed in life unless you earn what you have . Each person who trained under these guidelines would either walk away broken or emerge a better man , a better performer . No one understood more how tough these conditions were than the person who sat at the right hand of a legend for the entire rise and fall of the company he loved . His son Greg Gagne . It was a true honor for RF VIDEO to sit down with Greg Gagne and to hear an insight never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umbrella of a man with arms as wide as his father Verne . The burden now falls on Greg to carry the family name as he waists little time in the interview separating fact from fiction . Hear early tales of the AWA 's rise to power , learn what it took to create and train true talent . From lighthearted stories of the Iron Sheiks first days in the much heralded AWA training camp to the true grit and determination it took to actually complete it . Emotions run high as Greg describes in detail the ruthless business practices of the WWF as they launched attacks to gain national prominence . For a son to want only the approval of his famous father he had to endure all of the hardship as the empire crumbled . He tells of each and every talent leavening to go up north without the common courtesy of a phone call .

The eventual falling out with Bischoff that lead to a double-cross and his firing . Greg plays the name game and reveals his thoughts on all of the top stars of the AWA . Greg has several interesting segments on ideas he pitched to compete with the WWF that never came to fruition that will have you thinking what if including a controversial idea of reviving both the AWA and the NWA in the mid-90 's !

How involved was he in working with WWF during the time period he was also running ECW ? <p> It 's claimed that WWF paid Heyman a regular salary while others say it was a stipend for taking talent from ECW . What 's the truth and fiction there ? <p> The rise of Steve Austin and The Rock helped turn WWF around . What was it about them that made it happen ?

( I think he was backstage ) <p> Discuss the difficulties in turning WCW into its own promotion under the WWE ownership . Why did WCW fail to do so , yet WWE was able to make ECW into something that sold DVDs , had its own PPV , launched a new version of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMahon ended up in power and not Shane McMahon ? <p> The WWE ratings declined after Stephanie took creative control . Do you think there was ever any consideration on Vince McMahon 's part to letting her go from that aspect of the company ? Do you think she was insulated from failing because of who she was ? <p> Explain HHH 's rise in power . What was it about him that allowed him to rise through the ranks to a position where no one else in the history of WWE was ever allowed to go , . <p> There are times people in interviews will say how much you are despised . Why do you think you have that reputation among some in the business ? Do you think it 's fair that you are seen that way ?

So what were the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumors true that you were " disgruntled , " and was the one who leaked a possible Undertaker/Wrestlemania XXV script out ? ( I believe it was the PWTorch that reported that . ) <p> When did you forge a relationship with John Bradshaw Layfield ? Was it in Global ? Any Global stories in general ? <p> What it was like working for Layfield Energy ? <p> Was his Mamajuana Energy shot really " virility in a bottle " as advertised ? <p> How did the gig opening for Mick Foley doing stand-up come to be ? Any thoughts about getting back into doing it ? <p> You had expressed interest in possibly joining TNA before you were hired , but how were you approached to join the company ? <p> Initial Impressions of Dixie Carter <p> Taking over for Terry Taylor , as head of talent relations , and what you inherited . <p> Thoughts on the strongly negative feelings that many have of him . <p> Any thoughts on the situation between Jim Cornette and Taylor , that ended up with legal threats from TNA ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties did you encounter ? How much assistance were you afforded ? <p> There 's always people saying one hand does n't  know what the other ones doing - which often resulted in money being squandered frivolously . What were the biggest frustrations you had as far as trying to get your goals accomplished . <p> How did you feel initially about the companies spending habits ? <p> What were you most proud of accomplishing ? <p> Issues dealing with established talent who were hired , but took the attitude that TNA was nothing more than a " vacation " between trying to get roles with WWE . <p> What are the biggest changes you would make in the organizational structure of the company if you had all of the power ? <p> It seems to be an aberration that TNA gets over a million viewers every week , yet convinces such a tiny percentage of those viewers to buy the pay-per-views . What would could you do to rectify that ? And , in reality , how long would it take to ratchet that number up to satisfactory levels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing . A few days later , Hulk Hogan also claimed his did . In addition , Rob Van Dam , DOC and Devon - while he was still TV champion - also had their deals expire . What happened ? <p> How much support does the person dealing with contracts have , if any at all ? And , what was the biggest misconception people have over your role in contract issues ? <p> Any names that asked for their release that would come as a surprise ? How many guys/girls asked , but were talked back down by you , or someone else ? <p> Thoughts on how your own departure was handled . Thoughts on the press release , and Eric Bischoff , making it seem like it was your decision to leave to spend more time with your family and not a move related to cost/relocating to Nashville . <p> The budget cuts seemed to come down swiftly , and very hard . When did you have an inkling that things were going to get blown up ? Did anyone ? Considering angles seemed to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaburick as the choice to replace him . Any memories of working with him in WWF/E ? <p> Was there any push by anyone to bring back Jeff Jarrett during his exile ? What was your opinion on the whole situation , and how it was handled ? <p> Is it a wise idea for Viacom/SpikeTV to buy the company , much like they did with Bellator ? What do you think the results would be ? <p> Feelings on trying to tie-in Bellator fighters like Mo , Rampage , and Tito Ortiz ( also Joe Warren on commentary ) into the show . <p> Thoughts on releasing Jesse Sorensen , and the backlash that came from it . <p> The pros and cons of working with Eric Bischoff , Jason Hervey and Hulk Hogan . <p> Do you think they are working Dixie Carter and treating her like a money mark <p> Who came up with the idea for Gut Check ? Did it work out at all according to the original plan ? <p> Who were some people who came through that you believed should have been sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made it that you did n't  care for ? Anyone there were vehement arguments about ? <p> What was the reaction backstage to Ric Flair going off-script with Alex Silva ? And was your work improvising the end of that segment appreciated ? <p> Working with Al Snow and Danny Davis . <p> Your brother Tom was approached to possibly join OVW as a trainer , but claims he never got a call back , nor was he given any definitive information on the job . What do you know about that scenario ? <p> It seems the people who work with the women ( Dutch , Lagana , etc. ) all believe they can do some things with them , but they 're treated such an afterthought . Why is that , considering it had sparks of life at times , and was ( by far ) the better working group of the big two companies ? <p> What was your , as well as the overall , opinion on Thea Trinidad ? She seemed to have everything you could ask for today , in a non-work sense - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it purely a financial decision to let her go ? Was there any push by anyone to keep her ? <p> Opinions on producer Keith Mitchell , and the criticisms leveled against him over the years , as far as making the same mistakes that were made ( missing shots , etc. ) with WCW ? Is new blood needed ? <p> Opinions on Dave Sahadi , Dave Lagana , and Matt Conways work . And what were the positives and negatives with working with them ? <p> People seem to have strong thoughts on Lagana . Where do you believe those feelings come from ? <p> Knowing both companies so well , who on the TNA roster could hold a place on the WWE roster ? Who absolutely could not ? Did anyone have delusions of grandeur of what they could accomplish somewhere else ? <p> Whose idea was it to bring in Kenny King from ROH ?

@@106176811 @1576811/ <h> Vickie Guerrero Shoot Interview 111403 @qwx971403 <p> Imagine what it would be like if through an unforeseen tragedy , suddenly and abruptly , everything you have come to know as normal suddenly stopped . The person who you have come to depend on , built a life with , was no more . Your left with the shattered pieces of a life that will never be the same and the responsibility to carry on a legacy and be the foundation when only a day before the thoughts of this burden seemed unfathomable . Vickie Guerrero shouldered this burden , endured the pain , and as you will see with this in depth interview flourished under the most heinous of circumstances . It was with honor that RF Video sat down with Vickie Guerrero for her first ever shoot interview and she came with honesty , candor , and a sense of warmth that will resonate with the viewer long after the interview concludes . <p> Listen as Vickie tells of her first Meeting with the late great Eddie Guerrero and she tells of their first date , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latino Heat . She describes what it was like being introduced to the world of professional wrestling and goes into detail of the pride and passion Eddie had for the business .

Vickie Describes how the death of her husband affected Chris Benoit the most as she describes changes in his behavior after Eddies passing . She goes into detail about the Chris Benoit tragedy with a perspective of someone who was extremely close with all parties involved . She then tells of her rise in the WWE and how a spot appearance turned into a long fruitful on camera run . She talks about jealousy towards the amount of camera time she was receiving from some and how she ultimately decided it was time to walk away . <p> Their are many light hearted moments as she describes what it was like getting " tombstoned " by the undertaker along with several entertaining road stories . It 's interesting to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while perhaps not feeling the same way towards Triple-H ( we will leave that up to the viewer ) . She walks us through a life spent with one of the greatest workers of all time all the while telling of the highs and the lows . You will laugh and times and surely feel the emotions of a wife who truly loved her husband . You will hear her speak of the future , where she sees herself , and living a life without the chaos of professional wrestling . Regardless of where she goes from here her name has been etched in history as not only the woman behind the man , but the woman who stood tall when no one was there to hold her hand . Courage comes in many forms and it 's sometimes missed , but there will be no missing Vickie . She endures as a mother , a loving wife , and carries proudly the last name that will forever stand the test of time . Excuse me ! <p> Let 's start off by discussing Eddie Guerrero .

' Mr. Wrestling ' Kevin Steen has been one of the biggest names on the independent wrestling circuit for more than a decade and is on the verge of major mainstream success so the time was right for Steen to sit down with our cameras for the first time and tell all on his improbable rise to the top of the game . <p> Kevin Steen did n't exactly grow up in a wrestling hotbed . From a small town in Quebec , he developed a dream and overcame several obstacles along the way to reach the heights he has in a business where so many try and fail . In this interview we discuss every step in the journey , from his beginnings where he trained with the controversial Jacques Rougeau ( aka The Mountie ) , to the burgeoning indy wrestling scene in Montreal with the IWS , to his debut at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence as a top star in PWG and his turbulent rise to the top of Ring of Honor where he remains one of the most popular stars in the company 's history . Steen 's talent and charisma is undeniable and that 's what took him to the top , but there many speedbumps along the way and as we mentioned before , Steen is very outspoken and is n't afraid to voice his opinions regarding his experiences ... <p> In this interview , we go in depth on it all . We discuss what it was like training with Jacques Rougeau and why Steen consideres he experiences with The Mountie to be mostly negative , and he includes a story about a WWE tryout setup by Rougeau that ended very dubiously for the former WWE Tag Team Champion . Steen also shares some interesting thoughts on the opinions of Devon Nicholson , a proud student of Jacques Rougeau , and just what he thinks of Devon 's claims . We talk about his first exposure to the American indy world via the IWS in Montreal and what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man well known for many reasons in the Quebec wrestling circuit . We go in depth on his arrival in the States where he and his peers made a huge splash for CZW at the ECW Arena , and Steen reveals his feelings on the treatment he and his friends received from John Zandig and the CZW locker room . We also discuss his debut and ensuing success with Pro Wrestling Guerilla in California and just how unlikely it was that he would catch on with the promotion as a major star for nearly 10 years . <p> Of course , Kevin Steen may be most well known for his meteoric rise to the top of Ring of Honor , where his reign as Champion is celebrated by many as some of the best times in ROH history . Of course , with the best of times , there 's also the worst of times and Steen goes blow by blow with us on the controversy surrounding his heat with both Davey Richards and Jim Cornette , two ROH icons who never saw eye to eye with Steen . Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what was going through his head as it unfolded and exactly what was going on behind the scenes . Steen will take us through the change in bookers , from Gabe Sapolsky , to Adam Pearce to Delirious and the sale of ROH from Cary Silkin to Sinclair Broadcasting . Steen will also tell you a story about how his ROH career almost ended before it got off the ground thanks to a locker room incident with CM Punk that unfolded in full view of the locker room . And of course , Steen will tell you how he got past it all and became the face of the company and a man considered by many as the very best independent wrestler in the world .... <p> We also discuss what the future may hold for Kevin Steen , including several revelations that we ca n't discuss here and now but you will be brought into the loop when you view this interview , and you will be left rooting for the guy who started from nothing at the age of 14 and rose to the top of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has been through it all , and now with RF Video you can re-live the journey with him . <p> What was it like growing up in Quebec ? <p> What are your earliest memories of pro wrestling ? <p> What made you want to get into the business ? <p> You played other sports when you were young - why did you not want to pursue them ? <p> You started training at the age of 12 .

Bret Hart , days before leaving the WWF for rival WCW , refused to lose the WWF Title to Shawn Michaels at the event . As a result , a plan was concocted by Vince McMahon and a select few others to take the title off of Bret by any means necessary , and do what was best for the WWFs business . That meant scripting a double-disqualification ending to the Bret vs . Shawn Title match , only for Vince to go off-script and demand the match be stopped while Shawn had Bret in Brets own submission hold . The claim was Shawn beat Bret by submission , and once he realized what had happened Bret went ballistic , and the rest is history .

These are wrestlers that really do n't  give a flying F**k and will say what ever is on their mind . New Jack , Billy Jack Haynes , HonkyTonk Man , Paul Roma are just a few that come to mind but now there is a new man that has entered the ring and that is Marcus Bagwell . <p> Marcus gave us one of the best shoots of all time when it came to holding nothing back . We first sat down with Marcus almost 15 years ago so it was time to do a updated interview with him . After hearing him on the Steve Austin podcast I knew which topics would be hot for us to discuss and boy was I right . We go into more depth than anyone else has with Marcus and the outcome is explosive ! <p> The highlight of the interview is the entire shutting down of WCW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed a deal to debut with the company . Marcus takes us back to the final night of WCW and how he ended up getting let go by the company after making his debut on Monday night Raw facing off against Booker T. Marcus has never gone into such detail as he does during our interview with him . <p> You will hear so many insider stories on what went down behind closed doors with Marcus , Vince and Jim Ross and why to this day Marcus Bagwell has major hostile feelings toward Jim Ross . Marcus has several direct messages to Jim Ross during our interview with him and let 's say they will not be doing Christmas dinner anytime soon . <p> We really wanted to get more into depth of the entire situation between Marcus and the WWE and we asked him if there was any other issues that might have caused the WWE to part ways with him and you will be shocked to hear his answers . <p> What was it like for Marcus to find his business manager dead and what was the stories surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the RFVIDEO shoot interview with Too Cold Scorpio and his thoughts on what Scorpio had said . I felt that if Scorpio would have walked into the room during this part of the interview we would have needed security as it gets loud and intense . <p> Want to hear about his relationship with Scott Steiner over the years and what issues he might have had him during the NWO run ? How about what he thinks of the heat between Steiner and Hulk Hogan ? We cover it all and then some . <p> Want to hear why he did n't  stick around long in TNA and what happened to his relationship with Jeff Jarrett ? How about the rumors that his mom called the WWE offices . Marcus covers all the hot topics in one of our wildest interviews of all time . <p> We talk all about his drug addictions and alcohol addictions of the past and how that might have played a part on his run in several companies . Marcus talks about the road to recovery and how he suffered a major set back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marcus goes into great detail of what substances he was abusing and how it almost killed him . This part of the interview turns very emotional as Marcus holds nothing back and many people might be able to learn from him . <p> What about Marcus being a male escort , we asked him all about that as well . <p> We talk about his early years in the business and of course his long time friends name Steve Austin comes up as well . There are a variety of wide topics that we cover as this is one of those interviews you will watch over and over again with your friends because it will never get old . <p> I predict right now that this interview will end up in your top 5 shoots of all time when it comes to guys being open and honest . I get calls all the time here at the RFVIDEO headquarters and the big questions is , what shoot can I get that is like HonkyTonk Man or New Jack that is a true shoot , and the answer now would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is pure gold .. here are a list of just some of the topics that we talked about . <p> You 've made some headlines lately while discussing your short tenure with WWE . Let 's go back to that time period in your career to start things off . <p> When you were hired by WWE , what promises were made to you about how you would be used and how the WCW brand was going to be promoted ? <p> What went wrong , in your opinion , with the Raw featuring yourself vs . Booker as the main event ? <p> How should WCW have been presented ? <p> When did you get the idea that the idea of Shane McMahon running WCW as a separate entity was n't going to happen ? <p> You 've said publicly that you blame Jim Ross for your WWE firing ? Break down why you would blame JR and not say Vince McMahon for that ? <p> Jim Ross did respond to this on his own podcasts , saying : " " My former job as head of WWE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never relished in firing people and it only makes sense that if a talent could help a company that I wanted them to make it . I 'm sorry Marc feels like he does . I 'm sure he believes what 's there is true but I never went out of my way to cause him any misery . I just was the guy that had to deliver the bad news . " <p> What do you think Jim could do to mend fences with you personally ? <p> Why do you think we do n't see that huge surge of nostalgia for WCW the way we have seen for ECW ? <p> What do you miss the most about WCW ? <p> Do you think we 'll ever see another promotion step up against WWE the way WCW did ? <p> Who do you blame for WCW falling apart ? <p> What mistakes do you think you might have made during your short WWE run ? <p> You 've made a number of appearances on TNA over the years - thoughts on that promotion and why it has n't taken off over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestler ? <p> Thoughts on Jeff Jarrett personally and professionally ? <p> Memories of your angle where you got into a brawl with Jeff Jarrett ? <p> Why do you think TNA never brought you in full time ? <p> Would you be open to it ? <p> Memories of working for Jimmy Hart 's XWF and why do you think that company never took off ? <p> Memories of working for Andrew McManus ' WWA promotion and touring overseas for that company ? <p> You 've worked for a number of independent promotions over the last decade - what makes a good promotion to work for ? <p> How different is working the indies from breaking into the business in the early 1990s with Global ? <p> What are the differences in the working breaking in today vs. when you were breaking in ? <p> Let 's talk about you health , specifically the seizure in Georgia in April 2012 that led to you crashing your car .

How do you feel about that ? <p> Do you think Vince was hypocritical for complaining about WCW poaching talent and getting aggressive when he himself did it to the AWA , Jim Crockett Promotions and others a decade before ? <p> How much did you enjoy pissing people off at this point ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Network that you yourself would admit you were " a prick " at this point would you agree with that ? Do you regret any of that ? <p> Why did Nitro start going on the air early ? Was that the Networks idea or something you wanted to do ? <p> How often , if ever , were you getting feedback from Ted Turner ? <p> What sort of edicts were you receiving from Turner Broadcasting about programming at the time ? <p> Where did the idea of having Madusa throw the WWE Womens title belt in the garbage come from ? Was it hard to convince her to do it ? Do you feel like her doing it killed her job prospects post-WCW in the wrestling business ? Was it WWEs fault for not getting her to return <p> to the title belt ? Was it a move you regretted at any time ? <p> Vince McMahon said it was a " tawdry " thing to do how do you react to that ? <p> As Nitro evolved , one of the criticisms at times was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air with announcers and others not knowing what was going on in terms of the plans for the night why was that ? Was it actually that unorganized or were plans <p> changing on the fly because you were programming against what was on Raw ? <p> How often were plans for a live broadcast changed over the course of that broadcast based on what was going on during Raw ? <p> Sabu was brought in for the first few months of WCW Nitro but was gone within two months . What happened that Sabu wasnt signed to a long form deal ? <p> Talk about the importance of signing more talent as Nitro began , specifically Chris Benoit , Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko ? <p> When was the first time you heard of ECW ? <p> What are your memories of deals to send Bobby Eaton and Arn Anderson to ECW to help promote the Slamboree PPV in Philly ? Why did n't  a working relationship with ECW continue ? <p> What were your thoughts on the ECW product at the time ? <p> How close were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were building WCW during the Monday Night War , you hired a lot of talent from ECW the point that some felt that you were targeting ECW specifically . How do you react to that ? <p> If you werent familiar with the talents , who was advising you as to what talents were out there ? <p> One story when you hired Dean Malenko , Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in August 1995 was that you used WCWs relationship with New Japan as leverage to get them to sign how true was that ? <p> What was your reaction to ECW fans chanting things like " Bischoff takes it up the ass " at their shows ? <p> WWF built a working relationship with Paul Heyman during that time period why did n't  WCW pursue that as well since Heyman and Kevin Sullivan went back a long way ? Looking back , do you wish you had done that ? <p> Heyman would often tell stories of suing WCW how often did that actually happen ? <p> What was your relationship with Heyman like before you were running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What 's your take on ECWs product at the time ? How much of it influenced what WCW at the time did ? <p> When WWF began working with ECW , you called it the biggest threat to WCW during a Prodigy chat with Bob Ryder why did you feel that way at the time ? <p> When ECW booked their first PPV for March 1997 , WCW booked a Nitro taping the next night in Philly . When ECWs show was postponed under April , WCW then booked the day after their new date for Philly . Would you not consider that to be aggressive behavior against a much smaller promotion ? If not , why was the taping moved ? <p> How was WCW able to hire Mike Awesome when he was signed to a ECW deal ? <p> Were you surprised when Heyman went after WCW legally for hiring Awesome ? <p> Do you think in hindsight , Awesome was worth signing ? <p> When Goldberg was turned heel in Baltimore at the 2000 Great American Bash , that was a " big surprise " that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , there were rumors that WCW was trying to bring in ECW for a working relationship was there anything to that at the time and if so , how close did it get ? <p> What were your dealings with Paul Heyman like during that time period ? <p> What are your thoughts on WWE resurrecting ECW in 2005 ? <p> Memories of the One Night Stand PPV as a show and as a launching point for a new brand ? <p> Did you think the new version of ECW could take off ? <p> How did the signing of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall come about ? There 's a version that they , through DDP , came to you and a version that you had DDP approach them what are your memories of this time period and their signing ? <p> Its been said that you came up with the concept of the outsiders invading after attending a New Japan show and seeing New Japan vs. the UWFi is that correct and if not , where did you come up with the idea ? <p> Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing off the idea that they were WWE talents where did those concepts come from ? How important was it to get away from standard wrestling logic at the time ? <p> In 2014 , is it possible its time to get away from the realism and send the business back towards more of the older logic ? <p> Were you surprised when WWE decided to sue over WCW allegedly infringing on the Razor and Diesel copyrights ? <p> Where did the idea for you to be powerbombed through a table come from ? <p> Did you feel that by taking the bump , you were showing your roster that you were willing to do anything for the cause ? <p> Is it true the plan for the third member of the NWO was going to be Sting if Hulk Hogan balked at turning heel ? How hard was it to get Hogan to make that move ? Is it true he turned it down the first time you brought it up ? <p> Do you think the NWO would have taken off the same way if Sting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned at Bash of the Beach and the crowd reaction with all the fans throwing trash into the ring ? <p> Did you ever get any feedback from Turner Broadcasting about the decision to turn Hogan heel ? <p> Kevin Nash has claimed that when WWE decided to bring in imposter versions of Razor Ramon and Diesel that WCW thought something had happened to nullify their deals with Nash and Scott Hall and signed them to new contracts for larger paydays what are your memories of this and did anything along those lines actually happen ? <p> Talk about the process of creating the NWO as a separate entity , with the music , the commercial advertisements , etc . <p> What led to you adding The Giant as the fourth member ? <p> Was there ever a concern of adding too many members to the group ? <p> What led to you becoming a member of the NWO ? Did you ever feel like it was a mistake to put yourself at the forefront of the top angle ? <p> Eric Bischoff urban legend time is it true you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to where TV was so you did n't  have to carry it with you as you traveled ? <p> Was there ever a concern that the NWO was so hot that it actually hurt WCWs own brand ? <p> Why did the NWO Souled out PPV not work as a separate entity ? <p> How much of the Mr. McMahon character do you think was based on Bischoff in WCW ? <p> As WCW grew , the stories began to circulate that you were extremely arrogant about putting WWE out of business and often giving speeches backstage that the company was out to put Vince McMahon down at the time , is that really what you wanted or did you just want to motivate the crew ? <p> Is it possible that with success , you might have let some of it go to your head at the time ? <p> What led to the legal issues between WCW and Ric Flair ? Why was it such a big deal that Flair missed a date in order to see his son compete in an amateur wrestling meet ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who meant so much to WCW was a mistake ? <p> There was talk then and now about the other members of the rosters being pissed because the NWO laid waste to just about everyone on the roster ? Was that a concern at the time , or did it not matter because it was about the story ? <p> WCW TALENTS <p> What led to Roddy Piper coming in at Halloween Havoc ? <p> As 1997 hit , you had Piper , Hogan , Nash , Hall , Savage , Flair , Sting , Luger and more under one roof how do you keep all of these strong personalities happy and still get what you need out of them as a promoter at the same time ? <p> How important was the rise of DDP important to WCW at the time ? What is your response to those who say he was only pushed because you were friends ? <p> At the same time , there was a belief that undercard performers such as the Luchadors and the Cruiserweights were being disrespected by management while at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that was a fair assessment ? <p> One argument for the alleged lack of respect for the Luchadors was having some of them , including Rey Jr and Juventud Guerra lose their masks . Your response ? <p> Is it true you threw coffee at Eddie Guerrero because he asked for a release ? If not , tell your memories of the incident in question ? <p> Talk about your memories of bringing in Ultimate Warrior to WCW ? Warrior claimed that he was only brought in because Hogan wanted to get his win over Warrior and that if he realized how bad it would have been , he never would have come back . There 's also stories of Warrior doing whatever he wanted on TV and veering far off script . What are your memories of your dealings with Warrior in WCW ? <p> Do you regret having Tony Schiavone reveal Mick Foley was going to win the WWE title since it caused a huge surge in viewers leaving Nitro for Raw ? <p> Talk about the Goldberg phenom when did you realize that he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a larger deal in 1999 after he already had a valid contract ? <p> You booked him win the WCW World belt on a live Nitro instead of putting it on PPV and making fans pay for it or was it more important to try and regain the ratings streak from WWE ? <p> WCW fingerpoke of doom with Hogan and Nash . In hindsight , a mistake ? <p> When did you first reach out to Bret Hart about potentially coming to WCW ? <p> The story that is often repeated is that Hart turned it down and then Vince balked at his contract and told Bret to go back to you about getting a deal again were you surprised when Hart called you about coming in ? <p> Did you feel it was a sign that WWE was on the verge of being defeated ? <p> Vince McMahon has said that the reason he screwed Bret in Montreal was to prevent him from showing up on Nitro as WWE champion . Talk about your memories of that period would you have put Bret on as champion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you have done it if you were in Vinces position ? <p> Did the screwjob hurt Brets work and marketability once he came to WCW ? <p> Did you feel that WCW got what they paid for in Bret the talent ? <p> It seemed like he was never the major attraction or draw that he was once he came to WCW ? <p> Memories of the angle and match you did with Larry Zbyszko at Starrcade 1997 ? <p> Let 's talk the finish of Starrcade 1997 . Why did that entire deal with Sting and Hogan go wrong when you had expertly built up to that moment of Sting winning the title . Who was at fault for the fast count and why was it allowed to happen was anyone ever penalized for it , because it seems like that 's the first moment where things began to start to show signs of going off the rails . <p> As we closed out the 1990s , Scott Hall began having a number of personal issues . Do you think anything could have been done to help Hall during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of celebrities for angles and matches . Talk a little bit about the mindset of each of the following and whether they were worth the investment , in your mind , in hindsight ? <p> Dennis Rodman <p> Karl Malone <p> Jay Leno <p> David Arquette ( this was a Russo move , not a Bischoff one , but get his <p> thoughts ) <p> Kiss <p> The Misfts <p> ICP <p> Master P and the No Limit Soldiers <p> What led to you giving Kevin Nash the WCW book ? Compare Nash as booker to Sullivan and even yourself heading up the creative end of the company . <p> Let 's talk about TBS adding Thunder as a series you 've written that was one time you should have said " No " instead of doing what was asked of you . Explain why that is ? <p> Is it true that you were producing Thunder without getting any revenue stream for it ? If so , explain how that could even happen ? <p> Why was Nitro expanded to three hours ? <p> How much did the Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How much of the problems that you or Vince Russo or anyone else get blamed for were actually caused by the Turner issues ? <p> Is it true Turner Broadcasting once tried to force you to give them scripts a month in advance to be screened by their standards and practices ? What was your reaction to this ? How could they not understand how wrestling , which they owned for over a decade , was produced ? <p> Turners ad execs wanted WCW to focus on children and families and in your book , you wrote that was when you knew it was going to hurt you years later WWE was able to rebrand themselves successfully as a family company . Why do you think WCW couldnt or would n't be successful under their edicts ? Had the company just gone too far down one road to turn around ? <p> Break down how the corporate structure in Turner changing as the AOL merger came closer changed . How was it that Turner and Schiller werent providing more support ? Why was it that Turner broadcasting did n't  see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret not just calling it a day and walking out when you look back ? <p> How bad did it hurt WCW morale when Turner Broadcasting moved the companys HQ out of CNN Center ? <p> Is it true Turner execs cost WCW a deal to have live NBC specials ? <p> Do you think WCW was in a position where they could n't win at this point ? Was there any way to prevent the company from being overexposed ? What sort of pressure does that put on you as a person and a producer to not be able to find an easy fix or way out of the problems ? <p> At the same time , WWE was starting to fire on all cylinders . What was your response when they sent DX to Nitro to " try and invade " with a tank ? <p> When you were challenging Vince McMahon to show up and fight you , did you really think he was going to show up ? What would you have done if he had ? <p> Talk about the days leading up to you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told you were being removed from power ? Did you feel like Turner had forced you out ? How do you go mentally from the gear of trying to run a company back to its former success to suddenly having no responsibility for it and going fishing ? <p> Thoughts on Bill Busch following you as the head of the company ? <p> Your first thoughts when you found out WCW had hired Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara to head up creative ? <p> In your book , you called Russo a " one trick pony and full of shit . " After your time with him in TNA years later , do you still stand by that statement ? <p> Compare the WCW locker room when you were sent home to the one you found when you returned ? <p> Its been said that Russo attempted to put a WWE blueprint on WCW and all the characters and in doing so , destroyed a lot of what was left in the company by stripping the company and the personalities too far from what made them unique would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the titles in hindsight ? <p> Memories of the New Blood vs. the Millionaires Club storyline ? <p> Memories of the night Vince Russo " shot " on Hulk Hogan and Hogan walked out of WCW ?

Talk about the process of putting the investors together and why you believed the deal was done . <p> What was your reaction when you learned Jamie Kellner had canceled all wrestling programming from Turner Broadcasting ? <p> Do you think that ever would have happened if Ted was able to maintain his power ? <p> Once you learned that WCW had been canceled , the story is that you tried to negotiate a TV deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that story and how deep did those negotiations go ? <p> How valuable was WCW without the TV slots ? <p> Would you have still wanted to purchase the company without TV if you could have ? <p> Do you regret that WWE ended up with the assets ? <p> There are rumors of your plans had you taken WCW over so let 's discuss some of those and see what was true and false : <p> 1 You were hiring Joey Styles and Don Callis to become the new Nitro <p> announce team ? <p> 2 Rob Van Dam was coming in <p> 3 Michigan indy booker John Muse was going to come in as the booker <p> of the Cruiserweight division and was going to have say over that <p> division himself . <p> 4 All of the bigger names that had been removed from TV Nash , Hogan , <p> etc. would be returning in a big angle . <p> 5 The company was going to be relocated to Vegas with all TV tapings <p> being held there on a weekly , live basis . <p> 6 House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think there is n't a huge surge of WCW nostalgia like there is for ECW ? <p> What do you think the legacy of World Championship Wrestling should be ? <p> What was your favorite and least favorite day working for WCW ? <p> Once you realized WCW was n't going to be your future , did you feel you were done in the wrestling business forever ? <p> If so , what was going to be your next career move ? <p> You popped up in Canada attached to a promotion called Matrats talk about that concept and how you ended up attached to it and why it never went past that level ? <p> Where did the Celebrity Championship Wrestling concept come from ? <p> Was it hard selling Hulk Hogan on the idea ? <p> Talk about pitching the series to CMT was it hard getting the series sold ? <p> How long was the turnaround from pitching the series to actually being in production ? <p> Of the celebrities , who did you feel had the best and the least aptitude for the business ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously the best in ring performer of all the celebrities ? <p> Why was the series never picked up for a second season ? <p> When you look back on the series , is there anything you would have done differently ? <p> Would you ever want to revisit the concept as a series ? <p> What makes a good reality TV series ? <p> Since reality TV features strong characters is manipulated via editing , how different is it from producing professional wrestling which is manipulated via the booking ? <p> Did you find the background working for WCW for so many years hurt or helped when it came to pitching ideas to TV executives ? <p> Is producing TV as satisfying as producing professional wrestling ? <p> Of all your TV projects , which one do you feel most proudest of ? <p> Youve launched a number of other projects , including Buffalo Bill Cody beer how hard is it to take a concept from the initial ideas and move it from a concept to a physical , produced product ? <p> How surprised were you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer on their show ? <p> Do you regret not taking their initial offer to be part of the Invasion storyline in 2001 ? <p> Were you surprised they called back a year later ? <p> Is it ironic that you were brought in as a surprise the way you brought Lex Luger in for the debut of Nitro ? <p> Memories of the night you were brought in at the IZOD Center to be announced as the new Raw General Manager ? <p> What do you remember about the looks on peoples faces as you were brought backstage ? <p> Did you feel any tension from talents who were formerly in WCW ?

Incredible insight here as he compares how the X division guys are treated versus how WWE treated the cruiserweights , the emphasis both place on tag-teams , who are the people backstage killing TNA , morale under Hogan and Bischoff and thoughts on others in the office . Paul and Brian compared themselves to background players in WWE , find out if Kendrick considered himself a main character in TNA and if not , who he feels is responsible .
