@@42382857 @2382857/ <h> Sore nipples when breastfeeding <p> Sore nipples when breastfeeding can be a problem in the early days and beyond . This article outlines causes of sore nipples and suggests methods to ease the pain . <p> Nipples come in all shapes and sizes ; most stick out , but flat or inverted nipples are also common . Surrounding your nipple is darker skin called the areola ( plural is areolae ) . Your nipples may also have a number of small bumps called tubercules ; these produce an oily substance to protect your nipple . <h> What happens to my breasts during pregnancy ? <p> Once you 're pregnant , the hormone progesterone may make your areolae swell , your nipples may become sensitive and your breasts may tingle or feel tender as your milk-producing cells and ducts start to grow . This is your body preparing your breasts to feed your baby . Breasts contain lobes , which are structured a little like bunches of grapes . Each lobe consists of milk ducts , and several lobules , which produce and store milk ; the milk then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Women have between four and 18 of these ducts , so the milk will come out of several tiny holes , rather like water from a watering can . The rest of the breast is made up of tissue and fat . The size of your breasts depends on the amount of fat , and has no impact on breastfeeding . <p> During pregnancy your body has high levels of the hormone oestrogen and this tends to prevent milk production , unless you are already breastfeeding another baby . <p> Colostrum , the very early fluid produced before milk , starts being made in mid to late pregnancy , though you may be unaware of it . Some women find their nipples leak , or get crusty , as the colostrum dries after leaking . Others feel and see nothing at all . <p> As birth approaches , your nipples and areola may become darker and more obvious . <h> Can I breastfeed with flat or inverted nipples ? <p> Yes , these are quite normal and your baby will often draw them out when they feed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important thing ( see below ) . Your baby 's mouth needs to be wide open so that the nipple is in the top part of their mouth ; their tongue can then lie underneath a long stretch of your breast . <h> Should I limit my baby 's time at the breast to avoid getting sore nipples ? <p> Limiting time at the breast is rarely helpful , as it means your baby may not get all the milk they need . Also , it could reduce your milk supply if your body does n't receive enough stimulation to produce the right amount of milk . If your baby is well attached , they can feed for as long as you both want without you getting sore . <h> Is there anything I can do to prepare my breasts and nipples for feeding ? <p> There is no evidence that preparing your nipples in any way with products like creams and lotions makes any difference .

Try to relax with slow deep breathing at the beginning of the feed , and try to help your baby become attached , before they start to cry . <p> When your baby starts to feed , wait for a short time , and if you still feel uncomfortable , take them off by putting your little finger into the corner of their mouth to break the suction and start again . If pain continues , or if your nipples are damaged or distorted in any way , talk to your midwife , breastfeeding specialist or breastfeeding counsellor . <h> What causes sore nipples ? <p> Enabling your baby to become attached ( or latched on ' ) to the nipple in a way that 's comfortable for both of you reduces the chance of soreness , and helps make feeding more effective . Your baby needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouthful of breast , which means the nipple ends up at the back of their mouth . If you and your baby find this awkward or difficult , ask your midwife for help , and explore different ways to hold and/or position your baby . <p> Another less common cause of sore nipples is thrush , which is a fungal infection that can affect the skin . Both you and your baby will need medical treatment for thrush . <p> Some babies may also have difficulty attaching properly because of a condition called tongue-tie , which prevents a baby 's tongue from moving as it should . If tongue tie needs treating , this can be done quickly and easily by someone trained in snipping the frenulum ( the skin between the tongue and the bottom of the mouth ) .

Pat your breasts dry before applying it . You do n't need to remove it before the next feed . <p> Keep asking for help until you find someone who can show you a more comfortable position in which to feed your baby . A very small change can make all the difference . <p> Try to keep feeding your baby if you can , as this will help to maintain your milk supply . If the pain is worse on one side , then a temporary option might be to start a feed on the other side . You can then swap breasts once your baby is feeding less hungrily .

If feeding does n't feel possible without a shield , then this may be one option . <p> The main problems are that using them does not necessarily lead to better positioning and they may alter your baby 's sucking action . They may also make it harder for your baby to remove milk effectively , and this can reduce your supply . Some women also find it hard to get rid of nipple shields afterwards " their babies seem to prefer the super-stimulation of this artificial nipple . <h> Why might I have sore breasts ? <p> When your baby is feeding , your breasts let down ' milk . A few women find this sensation painful . You may also feel your womb contracting .

To restart , a heart usually needs an electric shock from an automated external defibrillator ( AED ) . <p> Q : What is an automated external defibrillator ( AED ) ? A : An automated external defibrillator ( AED ) is a machine that can be used to shock the heart back into normal rhythm . Defibrillators are found in many public places , such as train stations and shopping centres . Once opened , the machine gives full instructions on what you should do .

Without chest compressions and rescue breaths before the ambulance arrives , their chances of survival are much lower . <p> Q : What if I make a mistake and deliver rescue breaths and chest compressions but the child is actually still breathing ?

Anxiety can have an effect on both your body and mind . It 's worth talking to your GP or health visitor to see whether what you are experiencing is anxiety rather than depression . <p> Additional strain <p> Being under additional strain for any reason , can also increase the likelihood of becoming depressed - more so than biological or hormonal factors .

If the symptoms persist for more than four weeks , you may have developed PTSD . This can be treated with various forms of talking therapy . If left untreated , it can have a negative impact on people 's lives and relationships for many years , so do seek help . <h> Signs and symptoms of postnatal depression <p> Women experiencing PND may go through one or more of the following experiences , although it 's extremely unlikely that they will go through all of them .

Attitudes to mental health have changed in recent years and new parents should always be supported and listened to . Sharing your worries and feelings is an important first step and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are concerned that you are depressed , talk to your GP or health visitor . You may be asked to fill in a multiple choice questionnaire which is a postnatal depression test called the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) ' , about how you are feeling . It can help assess your situation by focusing on certain symptoms and any difficulties you are facing . It 's so important to be honest when you feel in this questionnaire as it can help you get the support and treatment you might need . <h> Postnatal depression treatment <p> There are a range of approaches for treating PND which include : <p> Counselling and therapy <p> Medication <p> Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) <p> Peer support groups <p> Your GP should be able to give you any information you need to help you make a choice that feels right for you .

Talk about it with your GP , or other specialist services and organisations , such as : Mind ( in England and Wales ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Details for contacting these organisations can be found at the end of this page . <p> Counselling and therapy <p> Talking treatments , such as counselling and psychotherapy , offer you the opportunity to look at the underlying factors that have contributed to PND , as well as helping you to change the way you feel . <p> If a friend or someone you know recommends a therapist , this can be a great way to find someone . If you do n't feel that the method of therapy or the therapist is n't working for you , you can always change and try someone else .

You could also contact your Community Mental Health Team . <p> Medication <p> Your GP may prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moderate or severe PND and give you some breathing space to adjust to the changes involved in becoming a parent . <p> Antidepressants are prescribed for at least six months , often longer , as it may take several weeks to reach their full effectiveness . During this time they may initially heighten some of your symptoms , such as insomnia and anxiety . In addition , when you stop taking them , it 's advisable to do so slowly in order to avoid any withdrawal side effects . The risk of insomnia might be reduced by taking medication earlier in the morning " but never stop or change medication without medical advice . <p> Women with symptoms of PND can often be reluctant to take medication , due to the fear of becoming dependant and possible effects if they are breastfeeding . If you are prescribed antidepressants for PND and you are breastfeeding , check with your GP that they are appropriate to take . <p> Peer support in the right environment can be of great benefit to mothers affected by antenatal depression and PND .

@@42382884 @2382884/ <p> Crying is normal behaviour for babies . Research shows that babies tend to cry most between the ages of two weeks and three months , with crying peaking between six to eight weeks . Periods of inconsolable crying are not unusual . <h> Why is my baby crying ? <p> Just like adults , babies have a range of different needs and crying is one of their ways of trying to let their parents know what they need . Here are some of the reasons why babies cry : <p> Nutrition : Your baby may be hungry or thirsty . Crying may not stop immediately when you offer a feed . If you are able to stay relaxed , your child will be able to calm herself more easily and start to feed . Newborns have very small tummies so do n't be surprised if they need to feed frequently . <p> Sleep : Babies often cry when they are tired so finding a way to get your baby to sleep may help you all . You could try soothing your child then putting her down in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she will go off to sleep while you have a break , or you could put her in the buggy and go for a brisk walk . <p> Emotional comfort : Babies need to adjust to the transition from womb to the outside world . They generally love to be held and touched and can also need reassurance that someone is close by . <p> Physical comfort : Check if your baby has a soiled nappy or perhaps she is uncomfortable , or too hot or too cold . <p> Illness : If you 've done everything you can , you may wonder if your baby is i 'll or in pain . A child who is ill often cries in a different tone . It may be more urgent or high-pitched . If your child has difficulty breathing through the crying , or if the crying is accompanied by vomiting , diarrhoea or constipation , call your GP . <h> Colic <p> Some babies keep on crying even when you 've tried everything and there are no obvious signs of illness . If you find that your baby is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive crying or extended and repeated periods of crying or fussing in babies who are otherwise healthy and thriving . Common symptoms in babies usually begin within the first few weeks of life and generally end by around three months . <p> The causes of colic remain unclear , despite much research into the topic . While there are lots of products available , pharmaceutical treatments have not been proven to be effective . The section on soothing your child may give you some other ideas to try . <h> Reflux <p> Excessive crying might also be caused by reflux , which is when the stomach contents " food ( milk ) and acid " come back up into the gullet or into the mouth . Most babies have reflux to a degree because the muscular valve at the end of their food pipe , which acts to keep food in the stomach , has n't developed properly yet . This is painful for only a small proportion of babies but if you suspect that reflux is upsetting your baby , talk to your GP or health visitor . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that re-creating a womb-like ' environment in the early weeks and months , as well as staying close to them , can help your child feel safer and therefore calmer . You could try some of the following to soothe your baby : <p> Gently rock her in your arms , in a sling or her buggy . <p> Stroke or massage her back gently . <p> Try holding her in different positions . <p> Take her outside : babies often like to feel the air on their faces . <p> Try soothing sounds or talk gently , sing or hum . <p> Offer her a clean finger-tip to suck . <p> Ask someone else to take over , sometimes a new pair of hands works wonders . <h> How long can a baby be left to cry ? <p> Self soothing is skill that babies learn over time and some babies learn to do it more quickly than others . In their early months , babies will need help from their parents or other adults to calm down . <p> There may be times when you are unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child starts crying when you are driving or wakes up when you are in the shower . Research suggests that if babies are usually responded to sensitively , the occasional bout of prolonged crying wo n't have a detrimental effect . <p> For parents who are exhausted , sometimes leaving a baby to cry on their own can feel like the only option they have in order to preserve their own emotional wellbeing . This is a decision for each parent to make but always seek help if you think you need it . <h> Coping with a crying baby <p> Dealing with a crying baby can often make parents feel stressed and anxious . Here are some approaches which may help : <p> Remember this is probably a phase and your baby 's crying should ease off at around three months . <p> Talk to other mums and dads . They may have some ideas you 've not thought of or simply provide reassurance that things will get better and you are doing a good job . <p> Talk to your partner , relatives , friends , health visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and get help from them if you need it . <p> Keep a diary of your baby 's crying and sleeping patterns so you can see progress . <p> Take some time out ' from your baby .

Get help immediately by calling your partner , a friend , neighbour or Cry-sis . <h> Getting to know your baby <p> Trying to soothe a crying child can be stressful but thinking about why your baby might be crying and also seeking help when you need it are good coping strategies . Your child will continue to change and what is most important is that they are comfortable and that you feel happy with your parenting decisions . Consider these early months as a getting to know you ' time . 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 13057 @qwx423057

Common types of flexible working include : <p> Flexi time : choosing when to work ( usually there is a core period during which you have to work ) . <p> Annualised hours : your hours are worked out over a year ( often set shifts with you deciding when to work the other hours ) . <p> Compressed hours : working your agreed hours over fewer days . <p> Staggered hours : different starting , break and finishing times for employees in the same workplace . <p> Job sharing : sharing a job designed for one person with someone else . <p> Working from home . <p> Part time : working less than the normal hours , perhaps by working fewer days per week . <p> The type of flexible working you request will obviously depend on your job , commitments and family needs . <h> How do I make a flexible working request ? <p> The old procedures have been replaced by a less prescriptive statutory scheme . Your flexible working application must : <p> Be in writing and dated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory procedure . <p> Specify the change you are seeking and when you wish the change to take effect . <p> Explain what effect , if any , you think the change would have on your employer and how any such effect could be dealt with . <p> State whether you have previously made an application and , if so , when . <p> If you are disabled and your request amounts to a reasonable adjustment ' you should say so in your application . <p> It 's also worth taking a look at your organisation 's flexible working policy , as this may offer further guidance on what to include in your application . <h> What happens next ? <p> After receiving your request , your employer must deal with it in a reasonable manner ' . According to the Advisory , Conciliation and Arbitration Service ( ACAS ) Code this includes discussing your request with you , allowing you to be accompanied to the meeting where your request is discussed ( though there is no legal right to be accompanied ) , consider the request carefully by looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer 's business , and weighing these against any adverse business impact . <p> Within three months of the date your request was made , your employer must give you their decision . This period can be extended by mutual agreement . <p> If your request is refused , your employer must give you their reasons . <p> Your employer may wish to offer a trial period if they are unsure that your request could work . The legislation does n't regulate trial periods and you do n't have a right to request a trial period . However , you may be able to argue that in failing to offer a trial period your employer has not dealt with your request in a reasonable manner ' . <h> What if my flexible working request is granted ? <p> If your request is granted , your employer must give you a written statement of changes to the terms and conditions of your employment within one month of the changes taking effect . <p> This will mean that there is a permanent change to the terms and conditions of your employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement without your employer 's consent . <h> What if my flexible working request is refused ? <p> Your employer can refuse your request if it does n't meet the statutory requirements , i.e. if you are not eligible or have failed to comply with the procedure . Refusal can also be based on one or more of the following eight reasons : <p> The burden of additional costs . <p> Detrimental effect on ability to meet customer demands . <p> Inability to re-organise work among existing staff . <p> Inability to recruit additional staff . <p> Detrimental impact on quality . <p> Detrimental impact on performance . <p> Insufficiency of work during the periods the employee proposes to work . <p> Planned structural changes . <p> Unfortunately , the wide range of reasons that employers now have to reject a request could make it harder for employees to ensure their request is accepted under the new framework . It 's still important though to follow the correct procedure and give your request proper consideration in order to give it the best possible chance of being accepted . <h> Appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory scheme does n't expressly require employers to allow employees a right of appeal . However , the ACAS Code recommends that appeals should be permitted . To find out more about how to appeal , as well as complaints and remedies , take a look at Slater &amp; Gordon 's factsheet Flexible Working ' . <h> Withdrawing a request <p> You can withdraw your request at any time after it is made .

If you have a heat resistant protective pouch for your tongs or straighteners , use that . <h> In the bathroom <p> Many scald accidents happen when a child gets into the bath before the temperature has been tested . To help avoid scalding , run the cold water first in the bath before adding hot water . You might also run cold water again at the end to avoid any contact scalding from the hopt tap . <h> In the garden <p> If you 're having a BBQ , bonfire or fireworks night , keep children at a safe distance from the fire , grill or fireworks . Explain the dangers of getting too close if they 're old enough and keep an eye on crawling babies or toddlers . <p> Never use any accelerants near or on fires . <h> Frequently asked questions about burns and scalds <p> Q : What 's the difference between a burn and a scald ? <p> A : Burns are caused by contact with hot objects , such as flames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are caused by steam or hot liquids , such as tea or oil . Treat both burns and scalds using the cool , call and cover ' steps described above . <p> Q : Why is cooling important ? <p> A : It 's important to cool burns and scalds because it helps ease any pain the baby or child will be feeling , reduces the severity of the burn injury , improves wound healing and reduces the risk of long-term scarring . Remember though that a child should be kept warm while cooling the affected area . <p> The British Burns Association also advises that the cooling of burns is still effective within three hours of initial injury . <p> Q : What should I use to cool a burn if I do n't have any cold running water ? <p> A : You can use a cold liquid like milk or juice to cool the burn until you get to cold running water . <p> Burn specialists also recommend using a towel or cloth soaked with some water , which should be changed every five minutes to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no access to running tap water . <p> Q : If my child or baby is wearing clothing on the area of the body that has been burned , should I remove the clothes ? <p> A : If the clothing is stuck to the burn area you should leave the clothing in place . However , if the clothing is not stuck to the burn , and you can remove it , you should do so . <p> Q : Can I use a shower to cool the affected area ? <p> A : A shower is a good way of flooding the burn with cool water to help the cooling . Cooling should focus on the site of the burn itself rather than the whole limb or body though . Putting the child 's whole body under a cold shower could induce hypothermia and is not advised . <p> Q : Should I place my child or baby in a cold bath ? <p> A : No , this may also cause hypothermia .

Call 999 while you 're cooling the burn and continue to do so until the ambulance arrives . <p> Q : If the burn is still painful after I have cooled it for 10 minutes and covered it , what should I do ? <p> A : The chances are the burn will still be painful . Do n't forget to give painkillers , such as a paracetemol-based syrup , and reassure your child to help them remain calm . Always seek medical advice for a baby or child who has been burned . All burns or scald injured with babies and children need medical attention , even small ones , because their skin is so delicate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 10 minutes , you could continue to cool it with water until help arrives or the painkillers start to work . After cooling , covering the burn wound with loose clingfilm will also offer pain relief . <p> Q : I 've heard I should put a plaster over the burn to make sure it does n't get infected . Is that right ? <p> A : Do n't use any adhesive bandages to cover a burn . They will stick to the skin and may cause further damage . After the burn has been cooled , covering it loosely with cling film or a clean plastic bag will help prevent infection and wo n't stick to the burn . <p> Q : Should I put butter , ointment or a cream on a burn ? <p> A : No , these will not help to cool the area .

@@42382900 @2382900/ <p> Babies need a lot of sleep because they have so much new information to process and they are growing and developing at such a fast pace . <h> Night-time waking <p> If your baby keeps waking up at night it can become very tiring . Night waking in the early weeks and months is normal newborn behaviour . Most babies are unable to sleep through the night " particularly those younger than 12 weeks . Young babies have small stomachs so they need to spread their feeding over a 24-hour period . However , as babies grow they tend to sleep for longer periods at night . <p> While for adults about four-fifths of sleep is deep sleep at night ; babies spend more time in light sleep . This means they can wake up more easily than adults . <h> Understanding day and night <p> At first , babies do n't know that night-time is for sleep and day-time is for being awake .

@@42382920 @2382920/ 13051 @qwx423051 <h> Travelling with your baby <p> When you and your baby travel by car , train or plane , there are things you can do and take with you to make it as comfortable as possible . Here are some tips for travelling with your baby . <p> While getting out and about with your little ones can be fun and exciting , some parents may also feel nervous about the prospect of travelling with their baby - especially the first time . Many parents prefer to stay put while they get used to life with a newborn but when you 're ready to get out and about , here are some tips on what to consider . <h> What to take with you <p> Thinking about all the things you may need , particularly if the journey might take longer than planned , can be really helpful . For instance , have you got enough drinks , snacks and favourite toys , as well as other essentials like nappies , wipes and a change of clothes for any potential accidents ? <p> If you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual formula and nappies at your final destination to save space . The sort of items you might like to consider taking are a lightweight buggy , baby carrier or sling and travel cot . You should also pack an easily accessible bag containing a few of your child 's favourite toys , plus a couple of new ones for novelty value . For easy nappy changing en route pre-prepare several nappy sacks with a single nappy , small packet of wipes and cream . <p> Slings can be especially useful if you 're on foot , or travelling to places where you 're unsure about buggy access . A top tip from most parents is not to rush or put yourself under pressure as this will help make journeys less stressful . We 've all had that moment as we 're just about to leave home and realise there 's a dirty nappy to change , so factor in some extra time . <h> When to travel <p> There are many good reasons for travelling while your baby is young . Unlike older babies and toddlers , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small babies are portable , and usually do n't mind being trundled about in their pram , baby carrier or sling , or sleeping in a baby travel cot . <p> Book outside the school holidays , if you can , as it will be cheaper and less crowded . And if you 're travelling by public transport , avoid rush hour whenever possible . <h> Car travel with a baby <p> If you 're travelling by car , your baby might be entertained by simply looking out of the window , but it may help to think about other ways to keep them occupied . Toys attached to the overhead bar of the car seat can be a good idea , or a book that can be clipped to the seat . A crying babyon a long car journey can be stressful and upsetting , so you could try to time your journey around your baby 's nap times and stop for breaks if you feel the need . <p> Some families find that one parent sitting in the back can provide comfort or distraction . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , so think about drinks for all of you for the journey , as well as window blinds . You may want to talk to your GP or pharmacistabout suggestions for travel sickness , like anti-sickness wrist bands , and think about whether it 's best to avoid setting off when your little one is too full of food or milk . <p> Many retailers will make sure your car seat is properly fitted when you buy it and it is important to follow all the safety instructions with your model . Current guidance is to keep babies rear facing for as long as possible . At a certain weight ( from 22 to 29 pounds depending on the car seat ) babies will need to change up to the next stage car seat . Your child 's straps should be pulled tight so you can only fit one finger 's width between the strap and your child 's body . <p> Plenty of music to help entertain your child ( or be prepared to sing ! ) . <p> Try and resist the temptation to stuff the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it compromises comfort or safety . <h> Train or bus travel with a baby <p> When travelling by train , try to avoid rush hour and think about which stations have lifts for pushchairs ( you can usually find this information online ) . Do n't be afraid to ask for help either . It may be best to avoid sitting in quiet zones as other passengers may not be sympathetic to a chatty toddler or crying baby . <p> Many parents find it 's best to sit near the toilets where there 's often more space and flip-up seats to accommodate pushchairs . Apply the brake and , when exiting , be mindful of gaps and try to get off backwards as it 's often safer than tipping your baby forwards . <p> Train travel can provide a relaxing alternative to flying or driving long distances . It can be even easier if you : <p> Plan the most direct route to your destination and avoid awkward train changes . Book ahead if possible and reserve a seat to avoid a last-minute scramble . <p> Choose a window seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pack a light bag with nappies , snacks and toys so you can stow your cases , buggy and baby travel cot if you have one , in the luggage rack . <p> Plan how you get from the train station to your final destination and whether , for example , you need to book a taxi with a baby seat . <p> Much of the same advice applies when using buses " getting on at the back may be easier and think about travelling light as you may have to fold your buggy up for wheelchair users or if there are already two pushchairs onboard . Alternatively , depending on how frequent your buses are , it might be easier to wait for the next one if you ca n't get on . <h> Plane travel with a baby <p> The thought of flying with a little one " especially long haul " can fill some parents with dread . Luckily , many airports have dedicated areas to entertain children , as well as buggies you can use . Some airlines also let you keep your own pushchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other modes of transport , it can be really helpful to think about everything you might need in your hand luggage , such as books , toys and changes of clothes for both baby and yourself in case of accidents . <p> It makes sense to check the weight limit for your airline before departure too . Children under two do n't usually have their own seat and may have to sit on your lap , so taking a cushion or blanket can help . When travelling long haul with a baby , you can request a bassinet for them to sleep in ( these go up to 23 pounds ) and travelling at night can reduce stress as it allows baby to stick to their usual routines . <p> You 'll be allowed to take as much formula as you need and staff can provide boiling water , as well as warming baby food for you . It can be helpful to make sure you have plenty of milk , as the aeroplane environment may mean your child wants more milk . Cartons are convenient but a made-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to drink a bit of the milk at security . Plan a back up if your baby does n't want a bottle at take-off and landing , such as offering a dummy or clean fingertip to suck . <p> If you 're breastfeeding you do n't have to worry about security regulations for taking fluids in your cabin baggage and , as long as the airline does n't require your baby to be in an air baby travel cot or bassinet , you can breastfeed while you take off and land . In fact , feeding babies on take-off and landing can help alleviate ear popping . <p> On board , a baby carrier or sling can help if you need to walk your child up and down , especially if you 're travelling alone and ca n't share the burden . <p> Ask the airport and your airline about fluids allowed through security and in cabin baggage . <p> Find out whether your baby is required to stay in a bassinet during take-off and landing and whether airline staff will warm up your child 's food . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades . <p> If you are planning any car travel such as transfers from the airport to your final destination , ask your airline or check on the website for rules about taking your baby car seat , or arrange to hire one abroad . <p> Whichever mode of transport you choose , taking your time and thinking ahead will all help . And most of all , remember that travelling with a little one can be great fun as you explore and have new adventures together . <p> Last updated : November 2016 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 <p> For trips by car in the UK or abroad and information about car safety , click here .

@@42382932 @2382932/ 13051 @qwx423051 <h> Foods to avoid during pregnancy <p> You need to be aware of what not to eat when you 're pregnant . This article covers some of the foods to avoid during pregnancy as well as the things you can eat and drink . <p> There are several foods to avoid when you are pregnant . You may find yourself confused about what you can and ca n't eat during pregnancy and why certain foods suddenly become off limits . The main reasoning behind many of the guidelines about what not to eat in pregnancy is to minimise any chance of food poisoning in pregnancy . <p> During pregnancy parts of your immune system are suppressed , which results in both you and your baby being more vulnerable to bacteria , viruses and parasites that can cause foodborne illness . Even if you do n't feel sick , some bacteria , such as listeria and toxoplasma , can still affect your baby and cause health and development problems . <h> Cheese <p> Most cheese is fine in pregnancy including hard cheeses and soft processed cheeses made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ricotta , mascarpone , cream cheese . Processed cheese is also fine . <p> Soft cheeses with white rinds , such as brie , camembert and soft goats ' cheese , should be avoided along with blue veined cheeses such as Danish blue , Gorgonzola , and Roquefort . The manufacturing process of these types of cheese encourages moulds to grow and so provide an ideal environment for harmful bacteria , such as listeria . <p> You can eat any of these cheeses if they are cooked all the way through though , such as cheeses in a fondue , deep fried or baked . <h> Eggs <p> Eggs are nutritious and a cheap source of protein . In July 2016 , the FST updated its guidance about eating runny eggs . It now advises that pregnant women can eat raw , soft-boiled hen eggs or foods containing lightly cooked hen eggs provided that they are produced under the Lion code quality assurance scheme . <p> In recent years , the presence of salmonella in UK hen shell eggs has been reduced greatly and so the guidance has been updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Lion coded quality assurance scheme which has additional control measures . <p> When eating raw or lightly cooked eggs also bear in mind the importance of : <p> storing eggs safely such as in the refrigerator , <p> following good hygiene practices in the kitchen and <p> observing best before dates . <p> Non hen eggs , such as duck and quail eggs , should always be cooked thoroughly . <h> Meat <p> Meat contains protein which is important for growth and it is safe to eat all types of meat including chicken and other poultry during pregnancy . <p> Raw or undercooked meat is not recommended in pregnancy because of the potential risk of toxoplasmosis . Meat should be cooked all the way through until there are no traces of blood or any pink . Cured cold meats , such as Parma ham , chorizo , salami and pepperoni , which have not been cooked , could also contain toxoplasmosis-causing parasites , so are best avoided or , you can freeze them for four days before eating , as freezing will kill most parasites . <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thoroughly cooked , i.e. steaming hot all the way through and no longer pink . Undercooked meat , especially poultry and products made from minced meat , such as sausages and burgers , could transmit toxoplasmosis and bacteria that can cause food poisoning . <h> Pate <p> Fresh pate , including vegetable , can contain listeria so it 's best to avoid it . <h> Fish <p> Fish is generally a healthy food that is good for you and your baby . However , shark , swordfish or marlin can contain high levels of mercury which could affect a baby 's nervous system . Tuna can also contain mercury so the recommendation is to limit the amount you eat to two steaks a week or four medium sized cans . <p> You should also avoid having more than two portions of oily fish a week , such as salmon , trout , mackerel and herring , because they can contain pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) . Note that fresh tuna is counted as an oily fish but tinned tuna is n't . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked fish are also considered OK to eat in pregnancy . <h> Shellfish <p> Avoid raw shellfish , such as oysters , mussels , scallops and clams , as they could be contaminated with harmful bacteria , viruses or toxins " although cooking them thoroughly will make them safer . <h> Sushi <p> Sushi is fine when you 're pregnant , as long as any raw wild fish used to make it has been frozen first . This is because , occasionally , wild fish contains small parasitic worms that could make you i 'll . Freezing kills the worms and makes raw fish safe to eat . Cooking will also kill them . If you 're in any doubt about the origins of your sushi , you might want to avoid eating the kinds that contain raw fish , such as tuna . <h> Alcohol <p> Experts are still unsure exactly how much , if any , alcohol is safe for you to have while you 're pregnant . All recommendations therefore agree that the safest approach is not to drink at all while you 're expecting . Alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and development at all stages . <p> Current guidance to women who choose not to avoid alcohol is to limit it themselves to one or two units once or twice a week . A unit is half a pint of ordinary beer/lager or one pub measure of spirits ; a small 125 ml glass of wine is 1.5 units . See our article Drinking in pregnancy ' for further information . <p> If you feel unable to cut out alcohol , or that your drinking is out of control , it 's important to get help and support " try talking to your midwife or doctor , who should be understanding , not judgemental . <h> Caffeine <p> Too much caffeine can increase the chance of a miscarriage slightly , with recent research suggesting that when trying for a baby , both women and men should limit their caffeine intake . It is recommended that you have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy . The amount of caffeine in food and drink will vary , but as a guide : <p> 1 mug of instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140mg ) <p> 1 mug of tea ( 67mg ) <p> 1 can of cola ( 40mg ) <p> 1 can of energy drink ( up to 80mg ) <p> 50g bar of dark chocolate ( up to 50mg ) <p> 50g bar milk chocolate ( up to 25mg ) <p> The caffeine content of coffee varies in different coffee chains . A recent survey found that the strongest coffee selling on the high street had a caffeine content six-times higher than the lowest . However , the risks of going over the recommended limit on an occasional basis are very small . <h> Medicine <p> A number of medicines such as cold and flu remedies also contain caffeine . Apart from reading the labels , you can check with your pharmacist when buying any medication and ask for their advice . <h> Nuts <p> There is no need to avoid nuts , or peanuts , in pregnancy , unless you yourself have an allergy and are , of course , avoiding them anyway . <p> The majority of foods are safe to eat in pregnancy and , for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the above list are very small indeed ( apart from the possible effects of frequent heavy drinking ) . <p> If you find you have inadvertently eaten something you would have avoided if you had known about it , or eaten something you would have avoided if you 'd known you were pregnant , then it 's highly unlikely you have done yourself or your unborn baby any harm at all . <p> Share your worries with your midwife ; it 's very likely you will find reassurance and understanding . <p> Page last updated : July 2016 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 <p> The Department of health publishes The Pregnancy Book ' online , containing useful information and tips about your pregnancy .

It is shaped a bit like a pancake attached to the inside of your womb ( uterus ) , and your baby 's umbilical cord emerges from the centre . The cord is like a lifeline with blood going in two directions . <h> What is a low-lying placenta ? <p> A placenta is considered to be low-lying when it is lying in the lower part of the uterus near , or over , the opening of the womb ( cervix ) . Most low-lying placentas are near but not covering the cervix . If your placenta is partially or completely blocking the womb opening at the end of pregnancy , this is known as known as placenta praevia ' ( pronounced preev-ee-ah ' ) . In these cases , your baby will need to be born by caesarean section . <p> However , a low-lying placenta in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way by late pregnancy . <h> Why is placenta praevia at the end of pregnancy a problem ? <p> During labour the cervix opens to let the baby move down into the vagina and be born . If the placenta overlaps the cervix , the placenta will begin to separate as the cervix opens , causing bleeding , usually from the mother . Bleeding can be extensive and can occasionally lead to shock if it is not treated promptly . <h> How is a low-lying placenta diagnosed ? <p> At your 18-21-week ultrasound scan your placenta 's position will be recorded . If your placenta is significantly low , you 'll be offered an extra scan to check again , usually at about 32 weeks . <h> If my placenta is low-lying at 20 weeks could this change ? <p> The vast majority of women who have a low-lying placenta in the middle of pregnancy will not be affected in the later weeks . At the end of pregnancy , only a tiny percentage of women have the condition . One study of 6,428 women found that only around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . In most cases the placenta , even if relatively low in the uterus , will not be affected by the cervix opening during labour . <h> Why does the position of the placenta change ? <p> As your pregnancy progresses , the uterus grows , particularly the lower part of the uterus , so the placenta moves with the growing uterus away from the cervix . <h> How accurate are scans to identify a low-lying placenta ? <p> It does seem that screening by ultrasound is often not very accurate and low-lying placenta may be over-diagnosed . <p> First , if the placenta is not actually covering the cervix at 20 weeks of pregnancy , it is unlikely that there will be a problem at a later stage . Second , the report of evidence used to inform the Antenatal Care guideline for the NHS says , Many placentas that appear to cover the cervical os ( the opening in the cervix inside the womb ) in the second trimester will not cover the os at term ' . <p> This is partly because as the weeks go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches , the placenta appears to move away from the cervix . <p> In England and Wales , the Antenatal Care guideline recommends that as most low-lying placentas detected at the anomaly scan will have resolved by the time the baby is born , only a woman whose placenta extends over the internal cervical os should be offered another transabdominal from the abdomen scan at 32 weeks . <p> If the transabdominal scan is unclear ( at 32 weeks ) , you should be offered a scan via the vagina , according to these guidelines . An ultrasound scan through the vagina is more accurate in diagnosing the position than a scan taken from the abdomen . <h> What are the risks of placenta praevia ? <p> Placenta praevia is associated with a higher rate of pregnancy complications , including separation of the placenta , bleeding and reduced growth for the baby , so additional monitoring will be offered to women who do have one that overlaps the opening to the womb . <p> Bleeding during pregnancy is fairly common ; it is more likely to occur in women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your midwife , GP or obstetrician can advise you .

You may also be advised to spend the last few weeks of pregnancy in hospital , particularly if you have had any bleeding , so that you can have a caesarean section straightaway , if necessary . Home-based care is also possible if the hospital can be reached easily .

@@42382948 @2382948/ <p> During pregnancy , increasing pressure is put on your pelvic floor muscles . This is due to pregnancy hormones , and the increasing weight of your baby . Research shows that pelvic floor exercises during pregnancy makes it less likely that you will leak urine ( be incontinent ) after birth . It 's therefore important to exercise your pelvic floor muscles regularly . <p> Continuing these pelvic floor exercises after pregnancy can help to prevent long-term problems , such as prolapse ( when the pelvic organs have lost some support , and can bulge into the vagina ) . <h> Where are my pelvic floor muscles ? <p> Your pelvic floor muscles form the base of your pelvis . The muscles attach to your tailbone ( coccyx ) , and up to your pubic bone at the front - they are also attached at the sides of your pelvis , to the bones that you sit on .

There are also some useful phone apps to record your exercises . <p> Resuming pelvic floor muscle exercises as soon as possible after giving birth will help to reduce any swelling and speed up the healing process .

In this state of tension and alertness , your contractions are less efficient and you focus on the pain and feel worse . Staying calm is therefore the key to coping with pain . <p> To help you feel relaxed , read up on what happens during labour , choose a place to give birth where you feel safe , and have a birth partner you know and trust .

Fortunately , if GBS is passed from mother to baby around the time of birth , the overwhelming majority do n't actually develop an infection . However , there is a small chance that your baby will develop an infection and become i 'll . <p> Around 1 in every 2,000 babies in the UK and Ireland are diagnosed with GBS infection . If a baby develops GBS infection less than seven days after birth , it 's known as early-onset GBS infection , and most often this is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . Late-onset infection is more commonly due to infection from other sources . <p> Most babies who are infected can be treated successfully with antibiotics and make a full recovery . However , some babies develop life-threatening complications , such as pneumonia , septicaemia or meningitis . One in 10 babies infected with GBS will die from the infection . Another 1 in 5 babies will develop longer-term problems with their development . <p> If your baby is at increased risk of GBS infection , they will be monitored for signs of infection . <h> What treatment options are available for babies infected with GBS ? <p> If your newborn baby shows signs of an infection , tests will be done to see whether GBS is the cause . This may involve taking a sample of your baby 's blood , or a sample of fluid from around your baby 's spinal cord ( a lumbar puncture ) . It is recommended that babies with signs of GBS infection should be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible . Treatment is then stopped if there is no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are negative . <h> What can be done to reduce the risk of GBS infection in babies ? <p> Antibiotics given intravenously during labour can help to reduce the risk of a baby developing GBS . The National Institute of Health and Social Care Excellence ( NICE ) has issued guidance on the prevention and treatment of early-onset infections in newborn babies . This guidance recommends the use of antibiotics in the circumstances set out below , based on the balance of risks and benefits to mum and baby . The NICE guidance says that : <p> IV antibiotics during labour should be offered to women when GBS has been identified incidentally ( e.g. when testing for the cause of a urinary infection ) in their vagina , rectum or urine in this pregnancy , and to women who have previously had a baby with a neonatal GBS infection . <p> IV antibiotics should be considered for two groups of women in pre-term labour ( i.e. before 37 weeks ) : those whose waters broke before the labour started and those whose waters have been broken for more than 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is evidence of infection in the women , such as raised temperature . <p> The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has also issued guidance about preventing early-onset neonatal GBS disease , which are consistent with the NICE guidance . <p> The NICE guidance also supports the principle of families being able to make informed choices about aspects of care for mothers and babies . If you need more information or want a particular form of care , do talk to your midwife or doctor . <h> When are antibiotics not necessary ? <p> Oral antibiotics taken before labour do not reduce the chances of carrying GBS at the time of birth . <p> NICE guidance about the care of healthy women and their babies during childbirth also states that antibiotics should not be given to either the woman or the baby if there are no signs of infection in the woman , even if the waters have been broken for over 24 hours . In those circumstances they recommend induction of labour approximately 24 hours after rupture of the membranes . <h> Are there any risks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotics may present risks of their own . There are risks of having an allergic reaction to antibiotics ( a one in 10 risk of a mild reaction to penicillin , and a one in 10,000 risk of a severe reaction ) . Some women may experience temporary side effects such as diarrhoea or nausea . However , for most women antibiotics are safe . <p> It is thought that babies exposed to antibiotics very early in their lives may have a higher than usual risk of asthma and/or other allergies later in life . <h> Will I be screened for GBS ? <p> There is no routine UK national screening programme to find out whether pregnant women carry GBS . Instead , NICE guidelines recommend that antibiotics are offered to women who have particular risk factors or circumstances . <h> Why are all women not tested for GBS during pregnancy in the UK ? <p> The National Institute of Health and Social Care Excellence ( NICE ) recommends that GBS screening is not offered to all women , because evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness remains uncertain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear evidence that screening would be beneficial overall . This is an ongoing area of debate and the national screening recommendations are due to be reviewed in 2015/16 . NICE has set three objectives : <p> Prioritise the treatment of sick babies . <p> Minimise the impact of managing infections on healthy women and babies . ( In other words , try to ensure that the approach used for identifying and treating infections does not jeopardise the health and wellbeing of healthy women and babies . ) <p> Use antibiotics wisely to avoid the development of resistance to antibiotics . <p> The reasons for not offering routine testing include : <p> Most babies born to women who carry the bacterium do not become infected . <p> It is not clear whether screening all women during pregnancy to see if they carry GBS would do more good than harm . Identifying women who are GBS carriers in order to treat them all with antibiotics during labour would result in many thousands of women and babies being treated in order to prevent a very small number of serious infections . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around 150,000 women each year would receive the drugs during labour by an intravenous ( IV ) route , i.e. through a tube into a vein . Concerns include the possible effect on the newborn babies ' normal gut flora ( healthy bacteria ) ; the risk of allergic reaction among the women receiving the drug ; growing resistance to antibiotics in the whole population ; and the potential negative impact on care during labour and outcomes for mother and baby . <p> In countries where a screening programme has been introduced , it is carried out at around 36-37 weeks of pregnancy . Women whose babies are born pre-term , i.e. before this stage , would therefore not normally have been offered the option of screening . <h> What if I want to be tested for GBS ? <p> Contrary to national guidelines , some maternity units do offer GBS testing for women with particular risk factors or who request testing ( RCOG 2016 ) . If you would like to be tested , ask your midwife or doctor about local policies and what options are available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a list of organisations which follow methodology described by Public Health England 's UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations on the Group B Strep Support website . <h> Do I have to have the screening or treatment if it is offered ? <p> The decision as to whether or not to have the screening or to have antibiotics during labour is yours . Some women weigh up the risks and benefits and decide not to . Other women are keen to be tested or to have intravenous antibiotics during labour as a precaution . It can be difficult to make sense of the information and the options . You may need support and a chance to discuss what you feel is right for you and your baby . Do talk to a midwife or doctor if you have questions . <h> Will the treatment affect how and where I give birth ? <p> Often , women are advised to give birth in hospital if they are planning to have IV antibiotics . However , a recent audit showed that many midwifery-led units do accept women in labour who are GBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss your options with your midwife or doctor . For example , it may be useful to know what your options are for where you give birth , which units have GBS-specific antibiotics available and what the transfer arrangements would be , should you need to transfer to hospital from home or a midwifery-led unit . <p> There is a small risk of developing an allergic reaction to antibiotics and it is easier to respond to an adverse reaction in hospital . However , some community maternity services have been able to arrange medical cover for women carrying GBS who wish to give birth at home or in a midwifery-led unit . <p> Connection to an IV line throughout labour tends to reduce mobility , which may slow the progress of your labour . However , women receiving IV antibiotics in labour do not need to be connected to a drip throughout the whole of labour . Usually a cannula is inserted into a vein in the back of the hand and remains there until after the baby is born . The antibiotics can then be given through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( over several minutes ) or by drip ( over half an hour or so ) . When the antibiotics have gone through , the cannula can be detached from the drip and the woman is then free to move around as she wishes . <p> It is more difficult to use water during labour if you have IV antibiotics . However , if you feel strongly that you would like to use a birth pool and you are planning IV antibiotics , talk to your midwife about whether it can be arranged . It has been successfully arranged in some cases . <p> Page last updated : February 2016 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056

This may take up to five days . <p> It takes between one and three weeks for someone to develop chickenpox after they 've become infected . <h> Shingles during pregnancy <p> You can get shingles ( herpes zoster ) if you 've had chickenpox .

Shingles is the reactivation of the chickenpox virus and you will notice a rash of blisters in just one place on your body . <p> Shingles blisters also have the chickenpox virus inside .

The risk of serious complications from chickenpox for pregnant women is low but increases after 20 weeks . If you suspect you have chickenpox or you 've been exposed to it , contact your midwife or doctor as soon as possible so that they can make arrangements for appropriate tests or treatment . <p> If you have chickenpox when you 're due to give birth , you 'll be isolated by the hospital so you do n't infect other women . <h> What effect does chickenpox have on an unborn child ? <p> Any effects are very rare , but unfortunately they can be very serious . There is around a 1% incidence of foetal varicella syndrome if a woman contracts chickenpox in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy , and around a 2% incidence between 13 and 20 weeks . Foetal varicella syndrome can cause problems with limb growth , brain development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cataracts . A large number of babies who develop the syndrome are likely to die .

@@42382978 @2382978/ <p> In your baby 's first few days and weeks , you are his world . You give him all the loving care that makes his new life safe and nurtured . <p> Communication of all sorts is very important so that he can tell you his needs and his emotions . When he seems anxious or unhappy , you can tell him that you are there and that everything is OK . When he is alert and receptive , you can help him enjoy awareness of all the objects and other people around . <h> Baby sounds , signals and cues <p> Babies ' means of communicating become more sophisticated very rapidly , and you 'll need to learn quickly what the baby 's signals mean , as they get more complex . These are often called cues ' as they are meant to prompt you to take action . Common baby cues indicate needs like hunger and sleep , though other things can be suggested even when your baby is very young . <p> For example , even in the early weeks , a baby can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or go off to sleep easily . You may need to find ways to soothe him down before getting back to the normal pattern of feeding and sleeping . Look for signs of frustrated or negative behaviour , like avoiding your gaze or jerky movements of arms and legs . <h> Remember babies have five senses <p> Sight and hearing are the senses that adults use most , and it 's easy to focus mostly on these as your baby grows . But babies are also very sensitive to touch and smell , for example . It 's helpful to remember that , before the baby was born , there was sensory stimulation of all sorts , but sometimes very different from that outside the womb . <p> Touch should all be very gentle to start with , as the baby is only used to contact with the amniotic fluid . Some babies may like light stroking or tickling , others may prefer just a firm hold . A little later , you can learn to do infant massage , which can be a wonderful way of communicating closeness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you afterwards . <p> It 's hard to know exactly what a baby 's experience of smell is , but it is likely the sense is well developed by birth , as babies can identify the physical closeness of their parents this way . Your baby may have different reactions to smells from most adults , though . He wo n't mind his own nappy , but may not like the aroma of cooking or scented cleaning products . It 's useful to be aware of this , in case it is a reason for him to seem uncomfortable . When caring for a very young baby , it is best for parents or other carers to avoid perfumed toiletries . Babies will prefer the familiarity of what is to them the distinct smell of their parents ' skin . <p> Babies will have a hearing check during their first few weeks , as hearing loss can occur in up to two babies in every 1,000 . Most often , this can be treated and the hearing restored . In even more rare cases , babies may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support in these cases , but it makes it more important than ever to keep up communication using all the other senses . <h> Baby body language <p> As well as using the usual five senses , a baby is sensitive to gesture , movement and mood . He wo n't like quick movements near to him that may appear threatening , and will very soon react to hurrying and bustling around him . Up to a point , this can be exciting and stimulating , but stress or anxiety will be communicated to him . He is likely to cry or fuss , just when you may not have time to pay a lot of attention and soothe him back to contentment . <p> It can be hard to do , especially if you have older children to organise too , but keeping a calm atmosphere is the best environment for your new baby .

Tell him that he is cheering you up , and try to give him a smile . Play a quiet little game together , and see if the closeness can help you both feel calmer and more relaxed . <h> Talk to your baby <p> Babies love to listen to the voices of their parents . They are highly receptive to tone and rhythm and may move their bodies in time with the adult 's speech . They also imitate facial expressions , and begin to learn how these are related to the meaning of the words . <p> Many adults speak to young babies in a special way , adopting a higher-toned , sing-song voice , with exaggerated smiling and wide open eyes .

Some babies make a variety of other sounds , usually related to the mouth-action they use for feeding . The next sounds you will notice in the early months are cooing ' , then baby babbling . <p> During this very early speech development , turn-taking continues to be a key element .

The promotion of normal birth includes enabling a woman in labour to focus totally on her own body , feelings and wishes , without distraction . <p> A move from home to hospital , or even a move from one room to another , can reduce the oxytocin level and slow or disrupt the progress of labour . If a woman in labour feels anxiety , tension or fear , the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and stop the release of oxytocin . <h> Hormones and pain in labour <p> Hormones also have an effect on the way pain is experienced in labour . The hormone called beta-endorphin is an opiate or pain-killer that occurs naturally in the body . It is similar in a number of ways to the synthetically produced drugs pethidine and morphine . As with oxytocin , there are high levels of beta-endorphin in the body during pregnancy , birth and breastfeeding . Beta-endorphin is released under conditions of duress and pain , when it acts as a pain-killer and also suppresses the immune system . This effect may be important in preventing a pregnant mother 's immune system from acting against her baby , who has different genetic make-up from her . <p> Very high levels of beta-endorphin , triggered by pain , cause the oxytocin level to reduce and contractions will slow down slightly . In this way , labour that progresses normally is kept at a pace that is bearable for the woman as she benefits from the natural analgesic effect of the hormone . <h> Hormones in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The subtle balance of hormones changes again when the cervix reaches full dilation . This phase is called the transition ' as the labour moves towards the second stage and the birth of the baby . There may be a rise in adrenaline to provide the energy needed for pushing in the second stage . The effect on the woman may be challenging , as she can feel shivery , nauseous , unable to cope and physically and emotionally exhausted . Reassurance and encouragement are the best approaches , as the labour is nearing its end . <p> It is oxytocin that triggers the fetal ejection reflex ' " the final series of muscular contractions that push the baby out " but noradrenaline , one of the catecholamines , also seems to be a factor . <p> At this time , another hormone prolactin ' , which is sometimes called the mothering hormone ' becomes significant . Prolactin is the major hormone of breast milk synthesis and breastfeeding , and it is present throughout pregnancy . Levels rise during labour and peak around birth , though they remain high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during labour , which prepares the mother 's breasts for lactation and also aids in the final stages of lung maturation for the baby . <p> The baby also produces prolactin during pregnancy , and high levels are found in amniotic fluid . <h> Hormones in the third stage of labour and immediately after giving birth <p> Oxytocin 's function in keeping the uterine contractions going continues after the baby is born . The contractions now push the placenta out of the uterus , close off the blood vessels that were attached to it and begin to shrink the uterus back to its original size . If this process does not work successfully , it increases the risk of heavy bleeding , known as postpartum haemorrhage . Often , synthetic oxytocin ( which may be called syntocinon ' ) is injected into the mother , to help the contractions , though many women prefer to wait for a natural delivery of the placenta . <p> Emotionally , the high levels of oxytocin in both mother and baby at this time promote affection , attachment and a desire in the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let-down reflex , too , which enables the breasts to produce milk . Beta-endorphin is also important in breastfeeding . Levels peak in the mother at 20 minutes after birth , and beta-endorphin is also present in breast milk , helping to create a pleasurable mutual dependency for mother and baby in their ongoing relationship . <h> Hormones and feelings after the birth <p> The period about two to three days after the birth when the mother may feel tearful and upset is often referred to as the baby blues ' , and can be explained in part by the action of hormones . There are a number of factors which contribute to this , and the falling levels of most of the hormones described are probably a major cause . Usually the feelings disappear after a day or two . More serious and prolonged feelings of sadness or helplessness may develop into postnatal depression and mothers ( or fathers who also experience this ) will need professional help . 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056

There are two types of flat head syndromes in babies . <p> Plagiocephaly - This is a flattening on one side of a baby 's head . Its most common form is positional plagiocephaly ' , which happens when a baby 's head develops a flat area due to continued pressure on one side of their head . Babies are most vulnerable because their skull is soft and pliable when they 're born . <p> Brachycephaly - This refers to the condition where a baby 's head is disproportionately wide compared to its depth . It can happen when babies lie for long periods on their backs . This causes the whole of the back of their head to flatten , resulting in a much wider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the proportion of babies affected by positional plagiocephaly ranges from 16% at six weeks , 20% at four months7% at 12 months to 3% at 24 months . <h> Why are some babies affected ? <p> Babies ' skulls are made up of several plates of bone which are loosely held together . As they grow older the bones will gradually join . However , during birth and for the first few months their skulls are very soft and their shape can be changed by gentle pressure . In some babies continued pressure on one area of the skull may lead to some form of flat head syndrome . <h> Symptoms <p> Flat area on back or one side of the head . <p> Bulging on one side of the head . <p> One ear more forward than the other . <p> Unbalanced look to the face . <h> Possible causes <p> It is thought that there has been an increase in babies with flat head syndrome following the successful Back to sleep ' campaign , which advises laying babies on their backs to sleep . Research studies do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the condition . <p> The number of babies who have died due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome(SIDS) has halved as a result of this campaign . However , laying babies on their back to sleep , combined with the use of baby equipment which has babies leaning back onto their heads for periods of time , such as car seats and bouncers , can lead to babies spending more time on their backs than ever before . It must be stressed that the benefits of laying your baby on his back to sleep far outweigh the risks of flat head syndrome ( see articles on ' Your baby 's sleep ' ) . <p> Babies who have their head turned one way most of the time , perhaps because of an uncomfortable neck are more likely to develop a flattened head . <p> Other possible causes could include : <p> Sometimes a baby 's skull may be moulded whilst in the womb . There may not be enough amniotic fluid to cushion the baby , which means his head can become temporarily deformed as he travels down the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multiple birth as the babies become squashed within the womb . This sort of moulding tends to correct itself without treatment . <p> Premature babies are more likely to have an unusual head shape at first because their skulls are less developed . <p> Muscular problems " sometimes a baby will have tightened muscles in their neck ( torticollis ) , which prevents them from turning their head one way and means they will always rest their head on the other side , causing this to flatten . <p> Craniosynostosis " rarely a flattened skull can come about by the bone plates within the baby 's skull joining together too soon . This can pull the baby 's head out of shape and will need to be corrected with surgery , so its worth checking with your GP if you are concerned about the shape of your baby 's head . <h> Are some babies more at risk than others ? <p> This condition shows up most often in babies who : <p> are first born <p> have unusually large heads <p> are premature , twins or multiple births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> have limited ability to turn their head or torticollis ( tight or shortened muscle on one side of the neck , causing the chin to tilt to the other side ) . <p> There are other factors which are open to change including : <p> Caring for the baby on one side all the time <p> Not enough tummy time ' or carrying where there is no pressure on the head <p> Baby 's preference for turning their head to one side . <h> What can be done to help ? <p> Doctors recommend that your baby is not left on his back for too long or too often , as this can create pressure on the same areas of his head . <h> Suggestions for reducing pressure on your baby 's head <p> When asleep : <p> Always put your baby on his back to sleep .

Mild flattening of the skull will normally correct itself by the end of the first year or possibly two . However , this can be helped with a few simple measures to remove pressure on the affected area of the skull . These measures could include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the day so that the rounded side of his head is placed against the mattress , repositioning cribs and other areas that he spends time in so that he will have to look in a different direction to see you or others in the room . <p> If your baby appears to have discomfort or cries when they are repositioned , they may have a problem with their neck which you can discuss with your health visitor or GP . <p> For babies older than about five months , some people recommend the use of helmets ' or ' headbands ' , known as cranial orthoses to encourage the bones to mould into a more rounded shape . This is somewhat controversial as it is unclear how important head shape is and most babies ' heads would revert to a more rounded shape naturally . These custom-made devices are designed to be used for babies between six and 12 months ( during the period of greatest skull growth ) , to apply pressure to bulgy ' parts of the skull and relieve pressure from other parts .

There is evidence that helmet therapy may increase the initial rate of improvement of asymmetry , but there is no evidence that it improves the final outcome for babies with moderate or severe plagiocephaly . ' <h> The reality <p> It 's normal for a baby 's head to be slightly misshapen when they 're born , usually as a result of its passage down the birth canal . However , if after a few weeks it does not appear to have improved and/or you notice a flat spot or flattening area on your baby 's head then do take him to see your GP . <p> A baby 's skull toughens as they grow , so the sooner the condition can be dealt with the more successful the treatment is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whilst the more severe cases of head flattening may also improve , some flattening will remain .

These relaxing hormones can stay in your baby 's blood stream for a few weeks , making it normal for her hips to be stretchier ' and looser shortly after birth . Therefore , any problems may not be detectable until sometime after her initial check-up . However , indications that your baby may have DDH include : <p> Deep unequal creases in the thigh . <p> When changing her nappy one leg does not seem to move outwards as fully as the other . <p> She will crawl , dragging one leg . <p> Her legs will be of unequal length . <p> She will limp if one leg is affected or abnormal waddling ' walk if both hips are affected . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , rather than her feet . <h> DDH treatment <p> As with most conditions , early detection and treatment is important .

However , depending on when it 's detected , and how severe the condition is , treatment may vary . The most common treatments include : <p> Early diagnosis <p> Pavlik harness " this device , often referred to as a splint ' , will keep her hips in the correct position . It is most often used in children under six months old , and is usually worn for at least six weeks full-time and six weeks part-time in young babies .

The cord supplies oxygenated blood which supports her until she starts to breathe on her own . The cord runs from her tummy to the placenta , which is still attached to the inside of your womb until the placenta detaches and you push it out . <p> You can ask for your baby to be passed to you or you may want to lift your baby up yourself . Some mums prefer to greet their baby by looking and touching before lifting her up and holding her close . <p> When your baby is born , the cord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blood , whilst the remaining two thirds is in the baby . <p> The cord at this point is thick , tight , rubbery and pulsating ; pushing blood down the cord into your baby . After a few minutes the cord will stop pulsating . The mother will often feel an urge to push shortly after this and she pushes the placenta out or more often it slides out if she moves to a more upright position . The contractions may well be painful but the placenta usually slides out very easily and then the midwife will check it to ensure that it is complete and none is left inside the mother . <p> Delayed cord clamping is the process of waiting at least until it has stopped pulsating is also known as a physiological or natural third stage . <p> Many women prefer to have a natural third stage of labour and , particularly if they are planning a natural birth , see no reason to have drugs to help them with this stage .

Waiting until your body is ready to deliver the placenta can take a little time , from about 10 minutes to up to an hour ( this might sound like a long time but you will have been saying hello to your baby so the time goes by very quickly ) . <p> Breastfeeding your baby as soon as she is ready can stimulate a contraction and help your placenta separate from your womb . <p> You are slightly more likely to have a heavier blood loss immediately after the birth with this method of delivering the placenta but if you are fit and healthy and have a good haemoglobin level ( that 's the iron level in your blood ) that should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleed stops sooner after a natural third stage . <p> There are varying levels of intervention that may be offered . <p> The cord may be clamped when it stops pulsating but before the placenta arrives .

Most women will not notice the injection as they are too busy giving birth . The midwife will then clamp and cut the cord to stop the drug reaching your baby .

Some women think though that postnatal bleeding goes on longer after an active third stage but the choice is yours . Syntometrine has side effects which can include nausea , sickness and headache . <p> Cutting the cord early does mean that more blood is left in the placenta and less in your baby . <p> If you have had a more complicated birth and have needed a drip to speed up your labour or are having a forceps or ventouse delivery , your midwife will strongly recommend that you have an actively managed third stage as your risks of having a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happens to the umbilical cord ? <p> If there are problems " for example , the cord is wrapped tightly around the baby 's neck " the cord may need to be cut straight away .

The cord is normally just long enough for you to hold your baby with the cord still attached to the baby and to the placenta which is still inside you . <p> Whether the cord is cut straight after the birth or when the flow of blood from the placenta to the baby slows down and stops before it is cut , the midwife will : <p> clamp the umbilical cord about 3-4cm ( 1-+-2 inches ) from your baby 's navel ( belly button ) with a plastic clip and <p> place another clamp at the other end of the cord , near the placenta . <p> The cord will then be cut between the two clamps , leaving a stump about 2-3cm ( 1-1-+ inches ) long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the cord or ask if you or your birth partner want to do it . <p> There are no nerves in the cord , so cutting it is n't painful for you or your baby .

As you cuddle skin-to-skin , both you and your baby have rising levels of oxytocin , the hormone that encourages affection , bonding and contentment . This hormone also helps you release milk when your baby breastfeeds and causes your uterus to contract . You may feel these contractions as a period-like or labour pain which is often stronger with second and later babies . <p> Your midwife will stay close until she is sure all is well .

My baby is five days old and he has n't had a poo since day one . I 've been told that breastfed babies often go several days without pooing , so should I worry ? <p> It 's very unusual for babies as young as this , whether breast or bottle fed , to go without a poo " in fact , a more usual pattern is for babies to have at least two to three substantial-sized poos every day in the first week . Sometimes , a lack of poo in a young baby means he needs to feed more , so you need to check this with your midwife . If your baby 's gaining weight , if he 's feeding well , and you have no health concerns , then the lack of poo is not a concern . You can get more information about what - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week here . If your baby is not pooing regularly , that does n't necessarily mean that your newborn child is constipated . <h> Q. When is it normal for breastfed babies to stop pooing as often ? <p> Any age from about three weeks and over , but more commonly from six weeks , breastfed babies may start to space out their poos " even as much as a week or more apart . This can seem alarming , but in a healthy baby , it 's usually nothing to worry about and does n't usually suggest that your infant is constipated . The poo , when it comes , will be soft and easy to pass because of the way the gastro-colic reflex has changed . This is the reflex that is stimulated by food going into the top of the digestive tract causing a reflex action at the other end " and it 's very sensitive in a newborn . So it 's quite normal for a new baby to poo virtually every time he feeds . <p> As he gets a bit older , the reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to his poo , storing it in the lower bowel for some time .

How do I know if my baby is constipated ? <p> If your baby is very uncomfortable or clearly in real pain , and his poos are small and hard , then he has some degree of constipation .

You have options including donating to a milk bank and milk sharing . <p> Some mums make very generous amounts of milk , and this can be uncomfortable for them and for their babies . You might suspect breastfeeding over-supply if : <p> your baby gains weight very rapidly , <p> your baby sometimes splutters and gasps during feeds , <p> your baby is in discomfort after feeds and/or <p> your breasts always feel full and you are troubled by frequent leaking . <p> Some mums with over-supply notice their babies seem to have explosive , frequent stools , often green in colour ( though green poo can be normal , and in itself is not a cause for concern ) . <p> If you think your baby 's discomfort , and possibly your own , are related to over-supply , talk about it with a breastfeeding counsellor or your midwife or health visitor .

Sometimes , babies just take a little while to settle down , as does your milk production . <h> What can you do ? <p> Over-supply usually settles down in time , but you can take steps to manage it better . If you are currently offering both breasts at each feed , it may be enough to just offer one breast per feed . If this does not work it is possible to reduce your production by block feeding " though this should only be done once you are sure your baby is thriving and growing well over a period of a few weeks . <p> Block feeding means using one breast only each time your baby comes to the breast , within a period of three/four/five or even more hours . You do n't use your other breast during this time . <p> The unused breast ' may fill and be uncomfortable during this time . It 's important you 're careful , and watch for blocked ducts or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk to ease the discomfort " do n't express more than you have to , otherwise you will be stimulating more production . <h> How does it work ? <p> Block feeding does not mean preventing your baby from taking the milk they want .

Not much research has gone into this aspect of breastfeeding , so these suggestions are based on what some mums have found helpful .

Donating to a milk bank is a good option if you are experiencing high production or oversupply . There are currently 17 milk banks in maternity units across the UK .

After expressing it , the donor will then freeze it .

Do n't forget that your toddler is still a baby <p> When the baby arrives , it 's amazing how your toddler will seem so much bigger and older . Do n't forget though , they are still young , and being an older brother or sister does n't suddenly make them more mature or responsible . In fact , it 's very common for children to regress when a sibling arrives ; they might start wanting bottles again , for instance , when they 've been using cups . While frustrating , remember that this is just their way of adjusting to the new family situation and also maintaining their share of attention . Try not to let your expectations of them change because of the baby ; they still need your help and patience too . <h> 2 . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy for all the kisses and cuddles to be focused on the new bundle . But to help your older child still feel secure and loved , make sure they get lots of attention too . Encourage any visiting friends and family to lavish just as much attention on your older child as the new baby and make a point of praising them on being such a great big brother or sister ' . If friends ask what gift would be helpful , remember a small present for your toddler to unwrap can be very welcome . <h> 3 . Find ways for your toddler to help out with their new brother or sister <p> Toddlers often learn from copying and imitating their parents ; it 's something they enjoy doing too . Get them involved with their new baby brother or sister by asking them to help with simple tasks or giving them a special job to do . They could help pick out the baby 's clothes or toys to play with , for instance . <p> Your toddler may be expecting a new playmate and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view - a not very fun baby that mostly sleeps and feeds ! Involving them with the baby in different ways will help them to get to know their new sibling but still feel important at the same time . <h> 4 . Deal with one child 's needs at a timeit will be a balancing act <p> With two young kids , there will be moments when you have the stressful situation of two crying children who want you at the same time . It 's not always easy but it can help to decide how to respond to each child based on who has the greater need at that moment in time . So , for instance , if your toddler is crying because they just fell down and hurt themselves , and the baby is crying because they want to be held , then it probably makes sense to help your toddler first . Of course , any parent will want to make sure both children are safe and happy , and you will find different ways to balance the needs of both . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to scoop them both up for a cuddle ! <h> 5 . Try and keep some consistency in your toddler 's usual activities and routines <p> The arrival of a new baby will probably affect existing routines but it 's important , where possible , that your toddler 's usual routine is kept in place as best you can . It can help your toddler adjust to life with a new baby if they do n't feel everything they have always done has changed because of the baby . This is when help from family and friends can make a difference in taking your toddler to their regular playgroup or nursery , for instance , in the early days and weeks . <h> 6 . Consider your options for getting out and about with two <p> With a toddler in tow , you definitely need your hands free to play , clean or just keep hold of them ! Having a sling you feel comfortable with can be really beneficial when you need to get on with jobs or play with your toddler but also keep your baby close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be difficult to give your older child a cuddle or pick them up with a baby in a sling . <p> With two under two , it can also make sense to consider a double buggy where both children can sit or lie down if they need to . Toddlers under two are not always able to walk long distances so it can help to invest in a double buggy and then move onto a single buggy with a clip-on buggy board later . There are lots of options so do some test runs first . <h> 7 . Do n't rush your toddler into any major milestones <p> It 's probably best not to attempt any big changes at this point in your toddler 's life ; having a new sibling is probably enough to adjust to ! For instance , many parents start thinking about potty training at the age of two or moving them from their cot to a toddler bed but " with a new baby too - this could put too much pressure on you and your toddler . Take your time and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 8 . Try and enjoy special time with each child <p> It can feel like you 're not giving enough time and attention to each child ; especially when patience is not necessarily a well-understood virtue among babies or toddlers ! Some parents find that mum ends up spending more time with baby while dad often takes care of the older one . Think of ways you can both have special time with your children . Perhaps dad can bath baby while you do story time with your toddler . When the new baby naps , you could devote more attention to your eldest and play some of their favourite games . <h> 9 . Ask for help and support if you need it <p> Becoming a parent is a steep learning curve and having two under two can be particularly tiring . If friends and family offer to help , take them up on their offers . There are so many little ways they could make a difference , like doing a food shop , making a sandwich for you , or taking your older child out so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they might support you best . <h> 10 . Focus on the positivesespecially when things go pear-shaped <p> On those inevitable days when it all feels overwhelming and you wonder why you ever had your children so close together , focus on the positives of a small age gap - it might just help you through it ! <p> Siblings who are closer in age can have more in common , which can bring them closer together from an early age . For some parents , it can also be a relief to get all the challenging baby and toddler years done in a short period of time . And having children closely spaced can also offer practical benefits . They 're probably more likely to share activities and spend more time at the same schools , which can make for easier planning . <p> Most importantly , enjoy your new family and never be too hard on yourself ! 13050 @qwx423050 <p> We run Refresher antenatal courses , which are a good way of concentrating on the second baby and this pregnancy - often overlooked when there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a great way of meeting other parents and making a friendship group for the new addition . <p> Having two children " whatever the age gap " can be expensive .

Success is also greater in women who have had a baby before . <p> All hospitals should now offer women the chance to have an ECV if their baby is breech at 37 weeks . If your hospital does n't , you can ask to be referred to one that does .

An international trial in 2000 showed that caesarean section appears to give a safer outcome with no longer term drawbacks . Since this research , most doctors have recommended that breech babies should be born by caesarean section . And almost everyone agrees that if labour does n't go smoothly , it 's safer to deliver a baby by caesarean . <p> More recently , a Cochrane review published in 2011 concluded that for single babies , a planned caeasarean section is safer for a breech birth .

@@42383039 @2383039/ 13051 @qwx423051 <h> Radiation and pregnancy <p> It is generally possible to avoid ionising radiation exposure during pregnancy ( which can be harmful to your child ) . Find out more about radiation and pregnancy . <p> This article contains information about radiation and pregnancy , the effects of radiation and the differences between potentially dangerous ionising radiation and the comparatively safe ultrasound and MRI scans you can receive when you are pregnant . <p> The risks to pregnancy from exposure to ionising radiation are very small , and in most cases avoidable . We are all subject to natural background ' radiation , and this is nothing to worry about . You are most likely to be exposed to radiation during medical procedures , but medical staff take care to avoid exposing pregnant women , or women who might be pregnant to radiation , wherever possible . <h> Types of radiation and the impact on pregnancy <p> It is important to know that an ultrasound , which is used during pregnancy in antenatal screening and testing , does not use ionising radiation . Neither do MRI scans which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions that affect organs , tissue and bone . Scans involving forms of non-ionising radiation are less of a health hazard than tests involving ionising radiation . <p> Ionising radiation is used in x-rays , CT scans and nuclear medicine during procedures to diagnose certain medical conditions . It is the job of radiation professionals ( radiologists and radiographers ) to ensure that patients are only irradiated when the benefits of making a diagnosis outweigh the small risk from the radiation , and particular care is taken to avoid the exposure of women who are , or might be , pregnant . <p> At the low dose levels used in diagnosis , the only adverse effect is an increase in the risk of malignant disease ( cancer ) occurring during childhood . The natural ' risk of childhood cancer ( i.e. for a child not exposed before they are born ) is about 1 in 500 . <p> Some women worry about the x-ray scanners ( hand-held and whole body ) used for security screening in some airports . The radiation dose from these is tiny " equivalent to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only penetrates a few millimetres into your body . However , if you are worried , you can request a body search instead . <h> Ionising radiation during pregnancy <p> There are two situations in which you might possibly be subjected to medical irradiation while pregnant : <h> You did n't know you were pregnant <p> You may have an examination involving ionising radiation , and only discover later that you were in the early stages of pregnancy at the time . Great care is taken to avoid this , but sometimes patients just are n't aware of the pregnancy at the time of their x-ray or scan . <p> If this happens you will naturally be worried about the effects of the radiation on your unborn child . The good news is that even for the highest dose procedures likely to be carried out in hospitals , the absolute risk to the foetus is very small indeed . <h> When the benefits of using radiation outweigh the risks <p> In some situations , you may know you are pregnant , but a deliberate decision will be taken to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only happen if the doctors treating you feel that the risk to your health and that of your unborn child of not doing the scan ( and thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment ) is greater than the risk from the radiation .

For instance , some babies might fling out their arms or try to push themselves up to the sides of their cot or Moses basket . This is a short phase and to create that security , you can tuck your baby in , or carry him in a sling . <p> Rolling over is usually the next stage of movement so be careful about putting your baby on a bed or a high surface in case he starts demonstrating his new skill . <h> Tummy time <p> Giving babies supervised tummy time helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to roll over ; and gives them a different view of the world . You can do this once or several times throughout the day . Some babies do n't like being put on their tummies " this is perfectly normal and may change as your baby develops week by week . <h> Hand and arm movement <p> Your baby 's hands will be a source of endless fascination throughout much of his first year . As a newborn your baby 's hands will remain clenched a lot of the time . At around three months , he will begin to open his hands on his own and slowly gain control over his movements . You should notice his increased hand-eye co-ordination as he discovers they are part of his body . <p> Your baby 's attempts to bring his hands to his mouth will be persistent , but mostly in vain at first . By four months , however , he 'll probably have finally mastered this game and be able to get his thumb to his mouth and keep it there . This movement is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so try not to cover his hands , or otherwise prevent him from sucking his thumb if he wants to . <p> Your baby will also begin to reach accurately and quickly " not only with both hands but with his entire body . Reaching for objects and for you will all become part of his general physical development . <h> Sitting and crawling <p> Babies learn to sit , first supported and then unsupported . Your baby might enjoy holding onto your hands and attempting to pull up to a sit . Sometimes moving from sitting to crawling for a baby can be quite awkward , and they can hurt themselves . He might at times get stuck , so it 's a good idea for someone to be close by , and keep an eye out at this time to limit bruises . <p> When your baby does decide to crawl , his first efforts are likely to be towards something .

Some babies do n't crawl in the traditional way but rather shuffle around on their bottoms , pushing with their hands and legs . <h> Standing and cruising <p> Once your baby is crawling he will start pulling himself to a standing position , although some babies crawl for months before actually walking . You can encourage this by supporting his underarms with your hands and bouncing him up and down . You may notice he stiffens his legs and relaxes them again , stands on his tip toes and sometimes even resists being put down . <p> He may get up and not know how to get back down , resulting in a call for help . You can teach him to lower himself onto his bottom by pushing him down gently . Once he has learned how to stand , he may embark on what is known as cruising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few steps . <p> In the beginning , he may walk with his feet at a slight angle ; this can happen while the muscles in his legs become stronger . If this continues , you can seek advice from your GP . Remember some slips and falls are inevitable and all part of learning . <h> Milestones <p> Babies will choose the time at which they feel confident enough to roll over , sit , crawl , stand or walk . And , if your baby is learning a skill , it 's better to leave him to fully grasp that stage of development rather than push him onto the next stage . <p> Sometimes your baby may seem to lose a skill due to concentrating on gaining a new ability . However , once he has mastered the new skill , you will see that the old ones are still present . <p> Similarly , if your little one is i 'll , they may temporarily regress with their movement .

@@42383060 @2383060/ 13051 @qwx423051 <h> Flying when pregnant <p> Flying when pregnant during your first and second trimester is generally considered to be safe , read about rules and guidelines here . <p> There is no evidence to suggest that flying while pregnant is harmful for either you or your baby if you are having a straightforward pregnancy , however there are some safety guidelines on air travel during pregnancy that you should be aware of . Discussing flying with your midwife or GP beforehand is advisable , especially if you have experienced any of the following : <p> Spotting ( light bleeding ) <p> Diabetes <p> High blood pressure <p> Excessive morning sickness <p> A previous miscarriage <p> A previous early birth . <p> Many women prefer to avoid flying while pregnant during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy because of the nausea and exhaustion they might already be experiencing . Also , miscarriage is more likely during the first trimester , whether you are travelling or not , and once airborne , help will be limited if anything does happen . <p> In addition , new patient information published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on 6 February 2015 says the safest time to fly during pregnancy is before 37 weeks ( as after this a woman could go into labour at any time ) and before 32 weeks if you are carrying twins in a straightforward pregnancy . However , many airlines do n't allow women to fly earlier than this so it is important to check with the airline you are traveling with ( see below ) . <p> Airport security <p> Metal detectors are still commonly used to check passengers . These work by using a low frequency electromagnetic field which is able to detect anything unsuitable or illegal on flights . They are therefore safe for pregnant women to walk through . <p> Recent years have seen the emergence of the full body scanner ' . Although this does make use of radiation , the dose emitted is so low it is considered negligible . <h> Vaccinations in pregnancy <p> If you 're travelling somewhere that requires you to have a vaccination , seek travel health advice from a suitably qualified healthcare professional who can perform a risk assessment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinations/and or malaria medication . See links below for further information about vaccinations in pregnancy . <p> Flying safely during pregnancy <p> Here are some suggestions to help with your flight : <p> When booking your airline tickets , be sure to inform your booking agent how far pregnant you will be on your return . <p> Most airlines will require a certificate or letter from your GP if you plan to travel 28 weeks and onwards in your pregnancy . The letter must state your due date and confirm that there are no known complications in your pregnancy and that you are fit to fly . <p> Book an aisle seat so that you can move without disturbing passengers either side of you if you need to use the toilet or move around . <p> Pregnant women are more susceptible to dehydration so be sure to drink lots of water and avoid caffeine and alcohol as these drinks are dehydrating . Also , bring your own bottle of water , which you can purchase in the departure lounge before boarding . <p> Be sure to pack a supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dried apricots to snack on throughout the flight . <p> Do calf and ankle exercises " most airlines will provide you with information on how to do these . <p> Once on the plane , adjust the seatbelt so that it is underneath your bump . After which , adhere to the same health and safety guidelines as everyone else . <h> Deep vein thrombosis <p> There is a slightly higher risk of developing deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) when flying while pregnant . To help combat this , drink lots of water , try to move regularly and wear compression stockings ( flight socks ) , which can help to regulate your blood circulation . Put them on before you fly and try not to remove them until you go to bed after the flight . <h> General pregnancy holiday tips <p> Wherever , you go , be sure to ask about available health facilities . <p> Check that your travel insurance policy will cover you for any eventuality , including early birth and medical care , should you go into labour whilst away . <p> Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin will be more sensitive during pregnancy . <p> Be liberal with insect repellent , while there is no evidence that this can affect your baby , please read the advice given by the Health Protection Agency below . <p> If travelling in Europe be sure to pack your EHIC card , which ensures you are eligible for free or reduced cost emergency medical care . 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056

@@42383065 @2383065/ <p> Postnatal depression ( PND ) is a form of depression that is more likely to affect dads ( and mums ) in the first year of their baby 's life . It can happen gradually or all of a sudden , and can range from being relatively mild to very hard hitting . <p> While it is estimated that 10% of new mums suffer from PND ; it is now also recognised that PND can be experienced by dads , sometimes called paternal depression , and either parent is likely to be affected by concern about the other . <p> Research from NCT found that more than 1 in 3 new fathers ( 38% ) are concerned about their mental health . In general , studies have shown that one in 10 dads has PND and fathers also appear to be more likely to suffer from depression three to six months after their baby is born . <h> What causes postnatal depression in fathers ? <p> Similarly to mums who experience PND , there is no single answer as to why some new dads are affected by depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional and stressful events and having a baby can be an unsettling and challenging experience . The increased pressures of fatherhood , more financial responsibility , changes in relationships and lifestyle , combined with a lack of sleep and an increased workload at home , may all affect a new dad 's mental wellbeing . Concern about their partner is another worry for new fathers . <p> There are two factors that do appear to have a significant impact on dads experiencing PND : <h> 1 . Strained relationship with partner <p> It would appear that new dads are more prone to depression , both antenatally and postnatally , if the relationship they have with their partner has been strained throughout the pregnancy . <h> 2 . Partner experiencing postnatal depression <p> There is also a moderate but clear link between a dad experiencing depression and his partner also suffering from depression . <p> Other factors that are likely to influence a new dad experiencing depression are : <p> Finance - new dads who are on a low-income are also particularly vulnerable to depression . <p> As with mums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family history and past mental health history can also affect his chance of developing depression . <h> Common symptoms of postnatal depression in dads <p> The symptoms of PND among dads can be similar to those found amongst new mums experiencing depression .

Not wanting to do anything or take an interest in the outside world . <p> Feeling a sense of inadequacy or unable to cope . <p> Feeling guilty about not coping , or about not loving their baby enough . <p> Being unusually irritable , which makes the guilt worse . <p> Wanting to cry/crying a lot or even constantly . <p> Having obsessive and irrational thoughts which can be very scary . <p> Loss of appetite , which may go with feeling hungry all the time , but being unable to eat . <p> Comfort eating . <p> Having difficulty sleeping : either not getting to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being hostile or indifferent to their partner and/or baby . <p> Having panic attacks , which strike at any time , causing a rapid heartbeat , sweaty palms and feelings of sickness or faintness . <p> Having an overpowering anxiety , often about things that would n't normally bother them , such as being alone in the house . <p> Having difficulty in concentrating or making decisions . <p> Experiencing physical symptoms , such as headaches . <p> Having obsessive fears about baby 's health or wellbeing , or about themselves and other members of the family . <p> Having disturbing thoughts about harming themselves or their baby . <p> Having thoughts about death . <p> Each dad will experience PND differently and some specific symptoms may not be listed here but if you 're aware that you do n't feel quite right ' within yourself , talk to someone about it . <h> How does postnatal depression affect relationships ? <p> In the same way as other forms of depression , depression experienced by a new parent can affect their personal relationships with their baby , partner , older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new parents and their friends and families to be aware of the symptoms of depression so that , if needed , help and support can be found sooner . <p> Encouraging mums to support dads in their parenting choices and style may also be helpful . Dads who feel supported by their partners in finding their own ways of caring for their baby are likely to develop a strong connection to their babies and are less likely to develop depression . <p> It may be difficult , upsetting and frustrating to live with someone who has PND , but it 's important not to blame them for how they are feeling and to avoid being judgemental . <p> Perhaps the most important thing to recognise is that someone suffering from PND may need encouragement to seek help , and support to get it . Help them find someone to talk to and reassure them that they will feel better . <h> What can you do if you think you have male postnatal depression ? <p> The following suggestions might be useful to support positive mental wellbeing for all dads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feelings but it 's so important that you seek the support you need .

If you have concerns about your own or your partner 's mental health , it 's best to seek help from your GP who can help you to access support services . <p> Try to take some time for yourself by maintaining involvement in hobbies , exercise , or social activities , even an hour here or there can make a difference . <p> It may help to meet other new dads .

Premature babies , and other babies considered to be in high risk groups , will be offered immunisation against certain illnesses , including respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) . Your doctor will be able to advise you on which immunisations your child should receive . <h> Risks versus benefits of baby immunisations <p> Some parents decide not to immunise their children for various reasons . Choosing not to immunise is as much your right as choosing to immunise ; but it is not a decision to be taken lightly . <p> Some parents decide against it because they are worried about baby immunisation side effects .

Immunisations do n't only protect your child , they also protect your family and community along with children who , for medical reasons , ca n't have the immunisation. 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 13057 @qwx423057 13053 @qwx423053

This article outlines the causes , symptoms to look out for , where help can be found , the treatment you can receive and more . It was written in collaboration with Action on Postpartum Psychosis ( APP ) . <h> What is postpartum psychosis ? <p> Postpartum psychosis , sometimes referred to as puerperal psychosis or postnatal onset bipolar disorder , is a serious psychiatric illness . It can affect one in 500 to 1000 women who have a baby . <p> Anyone who has previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder , schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder has an increased risk of developing postpartum psychosis by some 25-50% , and should seek referral to a specialist perinatal psychiatrist during pregnancy . About half of cases happen out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of psychiatric illness . <p> It is a frightening condition , both for the woman experiencing it and those around her . It should be considered by health professionals as a psychiatric emergency ' as it can escalate rapidly and needs early treatment . A mother may not realise she is i 'll and partners , family or friends may need to ask for help . <p> Most women with postpartum psychosis are treated in hospital , ideally in a specialist Mother &amp; Baby Unit ( MBU ) , to ensure the safety of both mum and baby . In some areas there may be no local MBU but the benefits of such care may make it worthwhile accepting treatment further away . <h> What causes postpartum psychosis ? <p> It is thought that postpartum psychosis is triggered by the dramatic changes in pregnancy hormones at birth , but the factors involved are not yet well understood . We know that for some individuals , genetic factors are important . <p> Postpartum psychosis is more likely to occur if a close relative has also experienced it . Disrupted sleep patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social or emotional factors are generally not involved in triggering postpartum psychosis . <p> There is some evidence to suggest that women are more likely to experience postpartum psychosis : <p> If they have experienced a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder prior to getting pregnant . <p> If there is a history of close family members ( mum or sister ) having experienced postpartum psychosis . <p> After a first baby . <p> If postpartum psychosis was experienced after the birth of a first child then there is a high likelihood that it will return after later births . <p> The importance of seeking help for postpartum psychosis can not be overestimated . Women suffering from postpartum psychosis will need help to look after their baby until they recover . <p> Some women suffering from postpartum psychosis have been known to take their own lives ( suicide ) , and in rare , tragic cases kill their child , or both . Recognising the symptoms early can make a huge difference , so treatment can start as quickly as possible and mother and baby cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postpartum psychosis most frequently appear within two weeks after birth , although rarely , the illness may begin several weeks later . It can start very suddenly with symptoms developing within a few hours of birth . The earliest symptoms often include feeling high , not sleeping , feeling spiritual , talking more than usual or seeming confused . There are a number of key signs associated with a psychotic episode : <p> Delusions " false beliefs that are firmly held , sometimes related to the baby , such as it is sent from God ' , or is evil ' in some way . Delusions , such as that the mother has won the Lottery , that the TV or radio are referring to her , or that she has special healing powers , are not uncommon . <p> Confusion , rapid or muddled thinking . <p> A lack of insight - a woman experiencing this condition may be unaware that her behaviour is odd in any way . Very often it will be other people who notice that she is behaving oddly and is not well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that everyone ( especially hospital staff and/or loved ones ) is trying to harm her and/or her baby . <h> Postpartum psychosis treatment and recovery time <p> Referral to a specialist perinatal psychiatrist is needed . This can normally be arranged by a GP , midwife , health visitor , or other health professional , but it is important the care is provided urgently . The most common treatment for postpartum psychosis is anti-psychotic medication and drugs that are used to treat bipolar disorder . Mums who are breastfeeding or expressing milk may be able to continue to do so , but the medication must be confirmed as appropriate by a specialist health professional . <p> The most severe symptoms tend to last two to 12 weeks and mothers will usually remain in hospital throughout that time . The vast majority of women will recover fully . However , postpartum psychosis is often followed by a period of depression , anxiety , and low social confidence . <p> Returning home after treatment can be daunting and it is important that full support is given to women , both emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout the recovery period most women will continue to receive support from mental health services . This may be from a specialist perinatal mental health team , but in many parts of the country this is more likely to come from a community mental health team or an Early Intervention in Psychosis team . Further outpatient appointments with a GP or home visits from a community psychiatric nurse may also take place . Home Start , a national charity that supports parents in their homes , may be able to provide some help within the home . <p> It may take some time to come to terms with what has happened . Looking back on the episode , most women say that it took between six and 12 months to recover fully and sometimes longer to come to terms with the experience . <p> It 's normal to feel some sadness for missing out on early motherhood . It can take time to rebuild confidence in relationships and friendships . But most women get back to feeling like their usual selves again . <h> Subsequent pregnancies <p> As frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women do go on to have more children . Your chances of developing postpartum psychosis again are fifty:fifty . <p> However , so long as you plan carefully and inform your GP and midwife of your history ; a care plan can be drawn up , and if you do develop this again , with immediate treatment you are likely to recover more quickly the second time . <h> If I have a history of bipolar disorder or mental illness , what can I do to prepare for pregnancy and childbirth ? <p> For many women with postpartum psychosis there may be no warning . For other women it is clear that they have a high risk . If you have ever had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia , your risk of postpartum psychosis is increased by some 25-50% . If you have a diagnosis yourself and also have a mum or sister who has had postpartum psychosis , your risk may be even higher . <p> If you do not have a diagnosis yourself , but had a mum or sister who suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the general population ( 0.3% ) . <p> If you 're planning on having a child , it is advised that you speak with your GP as some medication prescribed for bipolar disorder or other psychotic illnesses could harm the developing baby . <p> Your choices with regard to care and treatment will be discussed with you . A care plan will be drawn up involving your midwife , health visitor and GP . <p> As it is most likely to affect you in the days immediately following birth , your midwife , or health worker , may arrange for you to remain in hospital longer , where support from a psychiatrist will be available . Or , if you are discharged , then you may be visited on a daily basis from a member of the community mental health team . <p> Most women make a full recovery from postpartum psychosis and go on to be fantastic mums .

At your first antenatal appointment ( your booking appointment , your midwife will calculate your BMI . The amount of weight that you might put on in pregnancy depends on what your BMI was before you were pregnant . <p> A high or low BMI will be referred to a consultant following the booking appointment .

Doing your homework in advance can really pay off . <h> 2 . Get mobile ( in the non-tech way ) <p> Festivals are often spread out so consider those with little legs . A pull-along cart or wheelbarrow can be a good way of moving kids and stuff around easily . <p> For babies , slings are great and for smaller children , a backpack-style baby carrier will allow them to see what 's going on and keep your hands free to throw shapes or play air guitar . <h> 3 .

Get in touch with your local NCT branch before heading to the festival to see whether they 'll be there . <h> 4 . Location , location , location <p> If you have younger children , opt for a family-friendly or quiet camping area as you 're less likely to be disturbed by the all-night party crowd . You are also more likely to be camped next to some willing playmates for your little ones . <h> 5 . Prepare for four seasons in one day <p> Even the smallest downpour has the potential to turn a festival site into a mud-bath so wellies and waterproofs are a very good idea . On sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget to slip on a shirt , slop on some sunscreen , and slap on a hat . <h> 6 . Here one minute , gone the next <p> Dressing your kids in brightly coloured clothes or fancy dress will help you spot them in a crowd if they try to wander off . It 's especially easy to lose kids after dark so glow sticks are not only fun , but can also help you keep an eye on their whereabouts . <p> Write your mobile phone number on your child 's arm in permanent marker pen . It will wash off ( eventually ) . <h> 7 . Protect those ears <p> Children 's ears are sensitive and prolonged exposure to loud music can cause damage , so investing in a good quality set of ear defenders is an absolute must . The only tricky part can be convincing your child to actually wear them so try them out a few times at home before you head off . <h> 8 .

Most festivals have First Aid tents for worst case scenarios . <h> 9 . Pack the snacks <p> It 's important for the family to be well-hydrated and full-bellied and the last thing you need when you sit down to watch your favourite band is a hungry child . Try and pack lots of snacks like nuts , dried fruit , and muesli bars . <p> Bringing some frozen water that will melt throughout the day will help keep you and your kids cool . <h> 10 . Do n't miss the magic <p> It might not be the kind of festival experience the pre-baby you is used to but taking your kids to a festival can create some lifelong family memories .

@@42383176 @2383176/ <p> We know that the majority of women stop breastfeeding before they wanted to ; a shocking 90% of women in the first six weeks . This not only causes distress and increases costs for families , it also costs the NHS through more hospital admissions and GP consultations . <p> Taking just a few of the illnesses where breastfeeding is linked to a reduction in risk , the study found potential savings to the NHS from a moderate increase in breastfeeding of about -40 million each year , although the true cost savings are likely to be much higher . The report found that , even taking a conservative view , investing in improving breastfeeding support would provide a rapid financial return , with higher breastfeeding rates leading to greater savings . <p> Four categories of diseases were identified with different levels of available evidence . Reliable costs could only be modelled for a few of the conditions where not breastfeeding has been linked to an increased risk , so the costs are likely to be only a proportion of the potential savings . <p> Summary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible : <p> If 45% of babies were exclusively breastfed for four months , and 75% of babies were breastfed on discharge from neonatal units , each year there would be : <p> 3,285 fewer babies in hospital with gastroenteritis and 10,637 fewer GP consultations , saving more than -3.6 million <p> 21,045 fewer ear infection GP visits , saving -750,000 <p> 361 fewer cases of NEC , saving more than -6 million <p> If half of for first time mothers each year who currently do n't breastfeed were to do so for up to 18 months in their life , there would be : <p> 865 fewer cases of breast cancer <p> Cost savings to the NHS of over -21 million <p> Improved quality of life equating to more than -10 million <p> 2 ) Where evidence was good but not clear enough for full economic models , the authors considered three conditions to predict the likely impact of increasing breastfeeding rates . They estimate that : <p> If the proportion of babies receiving breastmilk rose by 1% this could lead to a small increase in IQ so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be gained in economic productivity each year . <p> A very modest increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates could lead to at least three fewer cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome annually , avoiding the loss of life and profound consequences for families and saving around -4.7 million . <p> Increasing breastfeeding rates could lead to around a 5% reduction in childhood obesity , which would save around -1.6million each year . <p> 3 ) Illnesses where research finds a plausible or likely link with not breastfeeding , but where the evidence is not suitable for reliable modelling . For example , although raised blood pressure and cholesterol levels in childhood are markers of future cardiac disease that are related to not being breastfed , it is not possible to calculate the costs of cardiac disease based on these markers alone . <p> This category includes diabetes ( Type 2 for mothers and mainly Type 1 for children ) , cardiovascular disease , ovarian cancer , asthma , leukaemia , coeliac disease , and neonatal sepsis .

Yet , new research published by Digital Mums today , shows that for a large number of mums the absence of flexible working arrangements is preventing them from getting back into work . For those that do return to work , too often having children can be career suicide . <p> The alarming level of maternity discrimination in this country is compounding this problem . Many new mums are afraid to take time off work . These archaic business attitudes remain embedded in the dark ages ; one that values presence over performance . Women who re-enter the workplace after maternity leave are often faced with a triple whammy of biases : gender , age , and perceived skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to be mothers or carers rather than scale the corporate ladder . <p> These biases " whether conscious or not " are entrenched in so many businesses . I have seen first-hand people who make assumptions about flexible workers , in particular mums . They believe flexible workers are not interested in training and development , are n't fully committed to the organisation , or do n't have any career aspirations . <p> But things are slowly starting to change . Over the past few years , some organisations have woken-up to the potential benefits of mums returning to work and a number have launched formal schemes to help women get back into the workplace and juggle the commitments of a family . <p> While this is a start , we need to be honest with ourselves . A cultural shift must occur in businesses around flexible working , so requests for reduced or alternative hours do n't mean less commitment , ambition , or skill . <p> As a mum of three who works flexibly in a senior role , I am ashamed that I am the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation that has embraced flexible working on such as large scale and with such success has opened my eyes , beyond my personal experience , to its benefits . Seeing it in action there is no doubt in my mind that flexible working is a win-win for both the organisation and employees . <p> Of course working flexibly is not just for mums nor is it limited to caring for young families . It also encompasses caring for other family members , undertaking community roles , studying and volunteering . And it is all of these extra ' parts of our lives and the different skill sets gained from them that enrich employees and truly benefit the organisation . <p> At NCT we have staff who work remotely , staff who work compressed weeks , staff who are part-time , and staff that job share . And it works simply because we want it to . And that commitment is all it takes . <p> By the time my kids enter the workforce , it is my hope that flexibility in the workplace is the standard , not an allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a world where their professional worth is valued over their ability to clock in from 9 to 5 . <p> So I am adding my voice to the #WorkThatWorks campaign " unless we do something today to improve the situation facing mums returning to the workforce , then the problem for many women will continue to fester , crushing their confidence and ability to be both caregiver and breadwinner . <p> By changing our thinking and focusing on making flexibility in the workplace the norm , we have the opportunity to create more adaptable and sustainable workplaces . And that 's good for society , the economy and the working world as a whole .

Read on to learn more about midwifery , the pregnancy care you can receive , midwife appointments and the differences between using a community midwife and the experience of shared care . <h> Arranging antenatal care with a midwife <p> You will see a midwife regularly both during your pregnancy ( antenatal care ) and afterwards ( postnatal care ) . To find a community midwife you may need to contact your GP surgery , but there is no need to see a doctor unless you have a medical problem . <p> Once you have contacted your midwife she will arrange your midwife appointments . Your first visit will be at around eight to ten weeks of pregnancy . This is known as your pregnancy welcome visit ' or , more often , your booking appointment ' . <p> Another option is to arrange to have shared care ' with your GP and the hospital . This means the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this can be very convenient , your GP will not attend the birth and it means you are unlikely to know the midwives at the hospital when you go in to give birth . <p> You also have the option of choosing an independent midwife , who is a fully qualified midwife who has decided to work outside the NHS in a self-employed capacity to provide pregnancy care . <h> Midwifery and pregnancy care : your first appointment <p> At the booking appointment your midwife will spend quite a long time finding out all about you and your pregnancy . She will ask you questions about your medical history , any previous pregnancies and also about your current pregnancy . If she is a midwife you will be seeing regularly this is an opportunity for you to get to know each other and for her to find out about your hopes for the pregnancy and when your child is born . She will answer all your questions and should also be able to help you with any concerns . She will let you know how to contact her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments <p> At every antenatal appointment your midwife will , with your consent , routinely take your blood pressure , test your urine for glucose and protein , and feel your abdomen to see how your baby is growing . She will write everything down in your maternity notes . You 'll be given a copy of your own maternity notes to look at , keep , and to bring to appointments . <p> When the baby has grown enough , your midwife may listen to the baby 's heart rate with a hand-held device that uses ultrasound waves ( if you are happy to have ultrasound ) . Later in pregnancy the baby 's heart rate may be heard using a Pinard stethoscope . Once your baby is big enough for you to feel movements , your midwife will ask if the baby is active . Toward the end of pregnancy it will become more important for your midwife to establish which way the baby is lying in your uterus . At certain points further blood tests will be done with your consent . These checks form the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more frequent as pregnancy progresses . <h> Your midwife care during labour <p> If you have booked a home birth , your midwife will come to assess you at home when you go into labour . If you are having a hospital birth , some community midwives do home assessments before you go into hospital , but often you will have to make your own way to hospital at some point during your labour , before you are seen by a midwife . <p> During labour , your midwife 's job is to support and help you . She is also there to support any birth partners you have . Her role includes helping you to give birth in the way that you would like , and to monitor your health and that of your baby . She can help you to get into positions that are comfortable and will help labour progress , and she can suggest ways of coping with contractions .

In some areas , the midwife may stop visiting once your baby is ten days old , but in other areas she may carry on visiting for up to 28 days after the birth . She will ensure that your baby is feeding well and beginning to gain weight , and that you are recovering well from the birth . <h> How can I get continuity of care ? <p> Research shows that to receive care from the same person throughout pregnancy , labour and the postnatal period provides a better birth experience for a woman than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Changes occur at each stage of pregnancy , and so you may have some specific questions and concerns . This article covers : <h> Can sex in pregnancy harm my baby ? <p> Wondering whether pregnant sex can harm your baby is common but there is usually no need to be concerned about this . Movements and sounds from outside and from your body are an everyday part of your baby 's world , so there 's no sense in which she can know ' that you are having sex . <p> Your baby is cocooned inside the amniotic sac ( a balloon of warm fluid that cushions her ) and this prevents her seeing or feeling anything during penetrative sex . Also , the neck of your womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keeps your baby 's environment sterile so ejaculation , for instance , ca n't harm her . <p> You may feel your baby move when you have sex , but this movement is due to the rocking she feels and the increase in your heart rate , rather than her being in distress . In fact , if you orgasm your blood flow also increases , thereby increasing the amount of oxygen and nutrients being delivered to your baby . During orgasm your bump may also harden because the act of orgasm causes contractions in the muscles of your uterus . <p> There may be some circumstances when you are advised to avoid penetrative sex ( see below ) . <h> Will sex feel different during pregnancy ? <p> During pregnancy some women may feel more sensitive due to increased levels of hormones ( progesterone and oestrogen ) circulating in their body , plus increased blood flow to their breasts and genitals . Some women experience their first orgasm , or even multiple orgasms , during pregnancy . This can be because of the extra blood flow , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clitoral stimulation . You 'll also notice vaginal secretions increase and hormonal changes can give these secretions a stronger smell and taste . <h> What if I do n't want to have sex ? <p> It is important to keep a sense of togetherness through pregnancy , but if you do n't feel like having sex , then you do n't have to . When you are pregnant , sex may not be at the forefront of your mind . <p> Remember that penetrative sex is n't the only way of expressing how you feel and creating that sense of togetherness . You could explore oral sex and talk to your partner about what you want . <p> For your partner ( especially before the visible signs of pregnancy emerge ) it may be hard to understand how much your feelings about sex can be affected . If you do go off sex , then try to make time to just be together , such as : <p> relaxing on the sofa together , <p> a walk in the park , <p> having a cuddle in bed , <p> talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once the baby comes you will have less couple time ' so make the most of it now . <h> What about my partner 's feelings about sex in pregnancy ? <p> Some men might find out a lot about pregnancy by reading about it before the baby is born while others might not and therefore not fully understand what to expect . It may help you both if you can talk about how your feelings about sex might change during pregnancy , and the fact that this is normal . Sometimes you 'll just want to cuddle ( especially when you 're very tired ) . <p> To help your partner you could also explain that hormonal and physical changes can put a temporary hold on love-making . Reassure him that it 's not because he 's fulfilled his role and made you pregnant ( a worry for some men ) .

The important thing is to keep talking to each other about how you are both feeling . <p> You may find that this is a good time for your partner to discuss with you any concerns that he may have about childbirth , and about your physical relationship after the birth . Some men may worry about having penetrative sex again after a vaginal birth , are shocked at how much the vagina stretches during the birth to accommodate the baby , or are unprepared for the sight of blood or mucus . Talking together now can give both of you the chance to air any concerns or worries you may have . <h> Can I use a vibrator when I 'm pregnant ? <p> If for any reason you are advised not to have penetrative sex , you should not use a vibrator when pregnant for penetration either . But otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions about use , and it is important to read and follow the instructions . <h> Are there times we should avoid penetrative sex in pregnancy ? <p> Although penetrative sex in pregnancy is generally safe , there are times when you may be advised to avoid it : <p> If you 've had miscarriages before , or bleeding during this pregnancy , talk to your midwife or doctor who may suggest you refrain from sex , depending on the number and timing of previous miscarriages . However , remember that early miscarriage is very common and unavoidable , usually due to a pregnancy that is not developing normally , and there is no evidence to suggest that it is caused by sex . Tell your midwife or doctor if you have signs of infection " such as itchiness , an unusual or smelly discharge , or if there is pain when you have sex . <p> Cervical dysfunction or weakness ( when the entrance to the womb does n't hold tight shut ) may cause miscarriage or premature labour after the third month of pregnancy , so you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a previous pregnancy . <p> If you are expecting twins ( which often come early ) , or have previously had a premature baby , some consultants may advise avoiding sex late in pregnancy in case it sets off labour . <p> If at any stage you think your waters may have broken , contact your midwife to assess the situation . To reduce the risk of infection avoid intercourse and seek advice immediately if you think you may have an infection . <p> If you are worried about anything , always talk to your midwife . <h> Sexually-transmitted infections ( STI ) <p> If you think you might have a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) talk to your doctor about being tested , as many tests are offered at antenatal appointments .

An antenatal group for Muslim women in Edinburgh offers them the opportunity to find out about pregnancy , birth and parenting and to network with each other . <p> Established in March 2009 , this women-only antenatal group for pregnant and breastfeeding women serves the Muslim community in Edinburgh . It was set up by Nicola Goodall , an NCT antenatal teacher , and is run on a voluntary basis as a joint initiative between NCT , the NHS , The Pregnancy and Parenthood Centre and Amina " The Muslim Women 's Resource Centre , a Scottish charity to promote the social welfare of predominantly Muslim women in Scotland . <p> Previously there was very little antenatal provision locally for women from the Muslim community .

In particular , sleeping on your left side in later pregnancy may benefit your baby by improving blood flow - and therefore nutrients - to the placenta . It also helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate waste products and fluids from your body . <p> Dads can show signs of pregnancyTrue .

An over-hot bath may increase your body temperature , which could increase risks for your baby . The heat can also lower your blood pressure and affect blood flow to your baby . These risks are greater with a Jacuzzi or hot tub , which are maintained at a constant high temperature ( whereas baths cool down ) . <p> Eating a curry can bring on labour.Myth . Many people believe eating a curry will bring on labour , as it can stimulate the bowels which in turn stimulate the uterus . However , like many myths related to being pregnant , there is no scientific evidence to show this . <p> You should eat for two when you 're pregnant . Myth . The NHS advises women should follow a healthy diet , making sure to get enough fresh fruit and vegetables and not overindulge in foods that are high in fat and sugar .

During pregnancy , your sense of smell increases drastically , as does your sense of taste . This is probably to help pregnant women avoid eating small amounts of toxins that might not be dangerous to an adult but could possibly affect an unborn baby . Smoke , alcohol and coffee are all particularly noticeable to pregnant women . <p> A smaller baby means an easier birth.Myth.Births are all different , and the ease of a birth depends on a number of different factors . <p> If you have bad morning sickness , you 're probably having a girl.Myth.Morning sickness is thought to be caused by an increase in hormones in the early stages of pregnancy , and not by gender .

If the frog produced eggs within the next 24 hours , the test was positive . This was called the Bufo test , named after the type of toad originally used for the process . <p> Page last reviewed : 24 February 2014 13050 @qwx423050 <p> NCT 's helpline offers practical and emotional support in all areas of to find out more about birth , labour and life with a new baby .

Professionals and others who work with families should be open to parents adopting a range of parenting styles and should support mothers and fathers to develop confidence in their own approaches .

Here we discuss the signs and symptoms and what to do if you think you might have sepsis . <p> Sepsis is an illness that can develop in some pregnant women , as well as in women who have recently had a baby or babies . Sepsis that occurs during pregnancy is called maternal sepsis . Sometimes called blood poisoning , sepsis is the body 's inflammatory response to infection , but it can overload the body 's ability to cope . <h> What are the signs and symptoms of sepsis ? <p> With sepsis , the immune system goes into overdrive , and the chemicals it releases into the blood to combat infection trigger widespread inflammation . This inflammation leads to the formation of small blood clots and leaky blood vessels that block the flow of blood to the vital organs . In the most severe cases ( septic shock ) , blood pressure falls to dangerously low levels , multiple organs fail , and the patient can die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature ( over 38.3-C ) <p> Fast breathing , breathlessness <p> Chills and shivering <p> Headache <p> Extreme sleepiness <p> Fast heart rate <p> Severe abdominal pain <p> Sepsis can develop very quickly . Pregnant women or new mums can appear relatively well and yet become seriously ill very quickly . It 's really important that women and their families are aware of early warning signs and seek medical attention urgently . <h> Treating sepsis <p> Sepsis can be treated in its early stages with antibiotics alone . <p> Diagnosing sepsis in a pregnant woman or someone who has recently given birth can be challenging . Pregnancy and delivery causes many changes in the body , including a faster heart beat , changes in blood pressure , and faster breathing . Usually , these are signs that may alert a healthcare professional that there may be something wrong , such as an infection . Also , many women get chills and sweat heavily after giving birth . They may also have pain , or feel dizzy or light headed . <h> When to seek medical advice <p> Women who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they are not getting better after being prescribed antibiotics , for example if they continue to have high fevers , extreme shivering or pain , they should get further advice from their doctor or midwife urgently . <p> Do n't be hesitant about asking to be referred to more senior doctors or midwives . If you are i 'll during or after your pregnancy and you , or your partner or other family members , are not happy about how you are being looked after , be persistent about asking to see a more senior doctor or midwife . <h> Sepsis , septicaemia and blood poisoning <p> Sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia , although NHS Choices suggests that both terms are not entirely accurate . Sepsis is not just limited to the blood and can affect the whole body , including the organs . <p> Septicaemia ( another name for blood poisoning ) refers to invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream and this occurs as part of sepsis .

You can use this handy tool to find out what your choices are for birth in your area . <h> Why choose hospital birth ? <p> If a pregnant woman ( or her unborn baby ) is identified as having a health condition that may mean medical or surgical intervention is needed , she will be encouraged by her midwife to give birth in hospital . <p> If you choose to give birth in hospital , you will be looked after by midwives , but doctors should be available if you need their help . <p> You 'll still have choices about the kind of care you want .

The NICE guidance advises that planning to give birth at home or in a midwiferyled unit is particularly suitable for women with straightforward pregnancies who have already had a baby . For women with straightforward pregnancies who are expecting their first baby , it is advised that planning to give birth in a midwiferyled unit is particularly suitable , but that there is a small increase in risk for the baby if they plan birth at home . <h> Be prepared <p> When you are making your choice about whether to have your baby in a hospital : <p> Find out about your local hospital so you can compare it with your other options . <p> If you have a chance to look around your local maternity services , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sort of care you can expect . <p> Talk to as many people as you can : friends , family , other pregnant women and mums with young babies , midwives and your family doctor . <p> Find out if you will have the chance to get to know a small group of midwives before you have your baby . <p> Ask whether one of these midwives is likely to be present during labour . <h> You can change your mind <p> Remember , you can change your mind at any time during your pregnancy , even during labour .

@@42383270 @2383270/ 13052 @qwx423052 <h> Choosing contraception after giving birth <p> After you 've had a baby , you may be considering contraception . This article offers information about options for contraception after birth . <p> Although the last thing on your mind may be sex after giving birth , your body could be fertile within 21 days . Many couples take some time before they are ready to have sex , although some women feel more sexual after the birth . <p> Even if you do n't plan on having sex for a while after having a baby , knowing about your options , thinking about what you want and discussing it with your partner puts you in a good place when the time comes . <h> How soon can you get pregnant after giving birth ? <p> In the first 21 days after giving birth , you are extremely unlikely to get pregnant , so you do n't need contraception . After this , you can become pregnant , even before you have your first period . This is because ovulation ( when the ovary releases an egg ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change after giving birth and , if you were using contraception before you became pregnant , it may no longer be right for you . Also , there are other considerations you may need to take into account , particularly if you are breastfeeding , which are outlined below . <p> According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) , contraception should be discussed within one week of giving birth , with either your healthcare practitioner or midwife as some methods of contraception need to have been in use for three to four weeks to be effective . All the reliable birth control methods are for women except for condoms and male sterilisation . <h> Contraceptive choices after pregnancy <p> Barrier methods <p> Male and female condoms - you can use condoms any time after giving birth . <p> Diaphragm or cap - if you have been using a cap or diaphragm , you will need to wait until your vaginal area and cervix has fully recovered after you have had your baby . This is normally by about 6 weeks . As vaginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refitted to check what size or type of diaphragm or cap is right for you . A spermicide is recommended with the diaphragm or cap for it to be effective . <p> Intrauterine device ( IUD ) " this can be fitted within 48 hours of the birth . If it is not fitted at this time , it will need to be fitted from four weeks after you had your baby , whether you had a vaginal birth or acaesarean section . <p> Exclusively breastfeeding <p> Breastfeeding can be a very effective method of contraception , sometimes called the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method ( LAM ) . It works because the hormone required to stimulate milk production prevents the release of the hormone that triggers ovulation . It is more than 98% effective in preventing pregnancy so long as : <p> You are breastfeeding exclusively and have n't introduced formula milk , drinks or solids , with no long gaps between feeds . <p> Your period has n't returned , even light spotting counts . <p> Your baby is less than six months old . <p> You need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of six long breastfeeds per 24 hours . And if you wish to relyon LAM as a method of contraception then you need to ensure that there are no gaps of longer than fourhours from the start of one feed to the next during the day and no longer than sixhours at night . <p> Once you are giving your baby solid foods or formula milk and no longer exclusively breastfeeding then LAM will become less effective and other means of contraception will need to be considered if you want to avoid pregnancy . <p> Hormonal methods Progestogen-only <p> Although the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends that progestogen-only methods should not be used in the first six weeks after having a baby , it is common practice in the UK to do so as no evidence has been found which suggests that it affects your milk supply or baby during this period . These methods , listed below , include : <p> Progestogen-only pill ( mini-pill ) . <p> Progestogen-only injection - if you want to use the contraceptive injection , GPs recommend that you wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have heavy and irregular bleeding if you are breastfeeding . If you have decided to formula feed your baby you can have the injection as soon as you wish , but you may get heavy and irregular bleeding as a result . <p> Progestogen-only implant " You can have an implant put in three weeks ( 21 days ) after you have a baby . In this case it is an effective contraceptive straightaway . If the implant is put in more than 3 weeks after your baby is born , it will not be effective as a contraceptive for the first seven days . <p> Hormonal intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Usually fitted anytime from four weeks after a vaginal or caesarean birth . <p> You can also use emergency contraception if you are breastfeeding . <p> Breastfeeding women are recommended to avoid any contraceptive method which contains oestrogen , as this has been shown to reduce the milk supply . Contraceptive methods that use oestrogen include : <p> Combined oral contraceptive pill . <p> Contraceptive patch . <p> Vaginal contraceptive ring . <p> Making a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to you . But do n't forget , your body has changed and what suited you before may no longer be right for you now . If you are bottle or mixed feeding , then your periods will return around four to six weeks after the birth or later . <p> The combined pill is can be prescribed from six months after birth for women who are breastfeeding . It does not appear to affect either the quantity or the quality of breastmilk after this time , although some women prefer not to go down this route . <h> What about natural family planning ? <p> Natural family planning is possible though it can be more difficult to learn and use just after you have had a baby . If you used this method before your pregnancy , ask your natural family planning teacher for advice . 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 13053 @qwx423053

And of course , walking is a fun and cheap way of enjoying time together as a family or with friends . But with stiles , steps , etc not all terrain is suitable for buggies , although you can still always use a sling or baby backpack carrier , for instance climbing the steps up Leith Hill . And of course , your type of buggy is a factor to take into consideration - if the terrain is very muddy , you may still manage okay with a big 3-wheeler , but not a stroller . <p> And here are some of our other favourite local pushchair friendly walks or top tips of where to avoid : - <p> We often head up to Polesden Lacey , which is great for a pushchair - you can walk around most of the garden with no problems at all and there are lovely open areas for older children to play in . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Sam <p> Definitely Denbies and Box Hill for us though need to pick your path with a buggy but the views are well worth the effort ! Similarly a good walk over the Downs at Tattenham Corner with the view across to London was a favourite destination but car journey first of course . When they were small babies I really enjoyed the RHS garden at Wisley and judging by the number of families there I am not alone . Local to my end of Dorking involves our useful cut throughs - a shorter push around Pixham and Deepdene a few times did the trick to settle them and up to the Meadow bank via our alleys is another with duck feeding and the park of course as the ultimate incentive for toddlers . - Ruth <p> I walk on Holmwood Common most days . With a 3 wheeler/fixed front wheel buggy we manage very well . There are n't any stiles to get over , but when it rains it does get VERY muddy and rutty. - Kate <p> The Nower is brilliant - for buggies and toddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times a week to run around with the football , sit on a bench to blow bubbles , and say hello to all the dogs that get taken there for their walk - very much the same principle actually , toddler and dog-walking .... tire them out before tea ! We go in through the gate opposite Harrow Road and run down to the open space at the bottom which is brilliant , but the paths through the wood are also great . We went up the hill and along the top on Easter Monday - lovely , but there is a steep slope coming back down beyond the gazebo , with big wide ' steps ' - hard work and a bit hairy with a buggy - need 2 people hanging on really ! - Hannah <p> I walked a lot on Ranmore before I had my baby but have not found it particularly buggy friendly . The best path is the trackway to Dorking which is fine for a buggy but does get bumpy due to tree roots at the Dorking end . However the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet or has steps or stiles to negotiate . I have been on the Nower a few times but find only the path across the middle to be buggy friendly . The other paths are too bumpy with tree roots . - Nicky <p> You can do a nice gently ascending walk behind Denbies as far as the gate . This will be closed unless the Denbies train is operational that day and unfortunately it is rather a tight squeeze to try to get a buggy through the pedestrian side gate . Return the same way unless you want to brave the steep shortcut . Lots of lovely cakes in Denbies restaurant with the option to eat inside the huge conservatory or outside in their central courtyard . <p> Plenty of paths to choose from at the top of Box Hill for a circular walk avoiding the steep descent . And lots of open space for little ones to run around . Plus there is the Servery . <p> Most paths on Headley Heath are reasonably flat , so long as you avoid the steep valley in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch has a mobile catering van . <p> Or in Box Hill village , from the small carpark at the bottom of Headley Heath Approach , you can walk down past High Ashurst and back , or you can do a triangular route along Headley Heath Approach , Box Hill Road and Ashurst Drive . <p> From Reigate Hill carpark , cross the bridge over the road and walk along past the fort to the folly . Lovely location for a picnic or alternatively on your return , there is a cafe in the carpark . <p> There is a map in the carpark at Bocketts Farm for a circular walk outside , but there are a lot of tree roots , so it is rather a challenge , even with a 3-wheeler buggy . Instead I recommend a short walk following the footpath straight ahead between the farm and the tearoom , and when you reach the ploughed field , return the same way . From both walks , you can see some of the animals over the fence , without entering the farm . <p> From Bridge Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meadow . This used to be a nice walk , seeing the swans and ponies , but sadly there is now too much dog poo on the footpath . <p> Warnham Nature Reserve near Horsham is very buggy friendly with boardwalks over the marshes . -1 admission for adults . It has Tanhouse Cafe on site there , which offers a fairly similar menu to Tanhouse Farm in Newdigate . <p> Or a walk in Southwater Country Park near Horsham . This also has a children 's play area and cafe . <p> Painshill Park at Cobham , Cherkley Court at Leatherhead and RHS Gardens at Wisley . These are all quite pricy admission but very nice . Or Painshill usually offers some free admission dates during the winter . Plus they all have tearooms . Note that Cherkley Court is only open from April - September and closed on Fridays and Saturdays . <p> Further afield , Bushy Park and Hampton Court are very nice . From the free carpark by the Diana Fountain in Bushy Park , you can either stroll round the large pond or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the main road straight into Hampton Court via the Lion Gate and from here , you may also stroll along the Thames . <p> Or it depends what type of walk you want . If you just want a short stroll to settle your baby to sleep in the buggy , there are footpaths and quiet roads around Dorking town . How about around Tower Hill to name but one . Or alternatively you may want to power-walk or jog with the buggy to try to get trim again . So how about alongside the A24 heading towards Leatherhead , as far as you like - noisy but effective . <p> There is plenty more local countryside but I have no idea how buggy friendly . So if anyone knows about the Glory Wood , Norbury Park , the Old Coach Road to Brockham , Abinger Common , Reigate Heath , Friday Street , Horton Country Park or other nearby areas , do let us know for a future feature on buggy walks . Or perhaps a linear walk and returning by public transport , for instance walking along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Council has published a selection of 24 buggy friendly walks on their website . <p> See the Action For Life website for weekly organised pram walks at various locations in Surrey .

It is caused by an inflammation of the small airways in the lungs called the bronchioles , which restricts the amount of air able to enter the lungs , making it more difficult for a child to breathe . <p> Babies at greater risk of developing severe bronchiolitis include premature babies and babies with certain heart or lung conditions . In most cases bronchiolitis is not a severe illness , however , 3% of babies who are under one year and have bronchiolitis are admitted to hospital every year in the UK . <h> What 's the difference between bronchitis and bronchiolitis ? <p> Bronchiolitis should not be confused with bronchitis . <p> Bronchitis is a condition that affects both adults and children .

The condition is most common in young babies who are three to six months old . <p> The timing of the bronchiolitis season slightly varies in the UK from year to year but it usually occurs during the winter months , from October to March , when the viruses that can cause bronchiolitis are more common . It is also possible to develop bronchiolitis more than once during the same winter season . <h> What are the symptoms of bronchiolitis ? <p> Early bronchiolitis symptoms can be very similar to a common cold " the first symptom is often a blocked or runny nose , which is sometimes accompanied by a cough or slightly high temperature ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These symptoms are likely to get slightly worse during the first three days , then gradually start to improve .

In a small number of severe cases , your baby 's tongue and lips may turn blue ' in colour . If this happens , take your baby to A&amp;E or call for an ambulance immediately .

This is normal and here we look at some of the most common questions and concerns . <h> ' I 'm worried I 'll feel left out ' <p> With breastfeeding , parents do have different roles to play and it can take a while to get used to this . As a dad or partner , you may feel jealous or left out , especially as mum and baby can have a very close relationship . Remember , breastfeeding is only one aspect of caring for your baby ; you can still be involved with them in lots of different and rewarding ways , such as soothing , winding/burping and bathing them . <p> Eventhough your baby probably wo n't smile for the first four to six weeks , from birth they will be interested in looking at things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so talking and playing with them is also really important . <h> ' I really want to share the feeding ' <p> Surprisingly , this may be less important than you expect if you 're involved with your baby in other ways ( see above ) . But if you 're still keen to feed your baby you could give expressed breastmilk in a bottle , a cup or with a spoon . Many families find it is easier to wait a few weeks , until breastfeeding is going well , before introducing a bottle . Expressing is n't always easy to do and finding time to express can be difficult . Whether formula milk or expressed breastmilk is used , skipping a breastfeed early on can mean a woman 's breasts can become uncomfortably full , and overfull breasts are a signal to the body to make less breastmilk . There is also no evidence to suggest that not offering a bottle early on will affect a baby taking a bottle further down the line . Once your baby starts solids , you can also become more involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner breastfeeding in public ' <p> It may help to discuss this with your partner so that you can agree how to handle it .

You may have seen a mum feeding her baby in public before and not even realised . <p> Many places welcome breastfeeding now and provide facilities for mums to feed in private if they prefer " indeed , a mum 's right to breastfeed out and about is now protected by law . It might also help to talk to other families where mum is breastfeeding and find out about her and her partner 's experience of it . <h> ' Will breastfeeding affect our sex life ?

Sometimes a woman who is breastfeeding can lose confidence if feeding is n't going well , and she may worry that her baby is not getting enough milk , for example .

What 's your advice ? <p> In this situation , there are three questions that parents should ask themselves : <p> Is my child unable to go out and play or do their usual activities ? <p> Do they have something infectious or contagious ? <p> Do they need treatment or monitoring that their school/childcare ca n't provide ? <p> If the answer is yes , then they probably should n't go to school or nursery .

Parents can worry that a temperature is going to cause damage but , in reality , temperatures up to 40-C degrees will just make a child feel uncomfortable . It 's only when the temperature is much higher that it may be harmful but this is extremely rare . <p> Thirdly , know how to accurately measure and interpret your child 's temperature . This means using a reliable thermometer that you can have confidence in . <p> If your child has a fever with worrying symptoms then you should talk to a healthcare professional ; particularly , if they have signs of a serious illness , such as a rash , breathing difficulties , signs of dehydration , or fits .

You should treat a temperature if it 's high and making your child distressed or uncomfortable . Kids will feel groggy when their temperature goes up and often perk up when it comes down . <p> Most importantly , in the case of any illness , mums and dads should use their parental instinct and learn to trust their own judgment .

Do keep asking questions or request a second opinion if you 're not entirely satisfied after your baby 's first check . <h> Tongue tie symptoms : Can I see if my baby has ankyloglossia ? <p> If you look into your baby 's mouth when they are yawning or crying , you may be able to see a tie . Tongue-ties at the back of the tongue ( posterior ) are much harder to see than the ones tying the tip of the tongue . However , the effect on feeding is not related to how easy it is to see the tie . Some babies with the frenulum attached near the tip of the tongue manage to breastfeed well , while others with a small tie that is hard to see may really struggle to feed . <h> Do I need to have my baby 's tongue-tie fixed ? <p> Not necessarily . If your baby appears to have tongue-tie , but neither you nor your baby is experiencing any problems then you do n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to treat my baby ? <p> The frenulum can be cut ( sometimes called divided ' ) by someone trained to do the procedure . It 's quick and simple , and young babies usually do n't need any pain relief . The procedure releases the tie , and allows the tongue to move more freely . It is preferable if the baby goes to the breast immediately after the tongue-tie division , as breastfeeding is both calming for them and provides an opportunity to try out their freer tongue movement . <p> Although some babies may cry briefly , the procedure does n't seem to cause discomfort or distress . As with all procedures , there are some risks , such as significant bleeding rather than a few drops of blood when the cut is made , but the chances of this happening are small . The procedure is normally only carried out if it seems very likely that feeding will improve as a result . <h> How can I find someone who would do this ? <p> Ask your health visitor , midwife or local breastfeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some places through the NHS , and the service is variable so treatment may be offered within a week or two or your baby may be put on a waiting list . <p> It is important to seek help quickly though as a tongue-tie causing problems needs to be treated promptly , so that baby can feed properly and , if mum is breastfeeding , that this is comfortable for her . <p> There are private tongue-tie services offered in some areas . As with all private services it 's important to check the practitioner 's background and qualifications . <h> Does the treatment resolve the problems ? <p> Yes , research has shown that if babies have difficulty breastfeeding due to a tongue-tie , division results in improved feeding for the majority of babies . <p> Occasionally , a tongue-tie may need snipping more than once , because of a tendency to re-attach . Often a baby 's feeding can be improved if their parents are also shown how to do oral exercises that encourage them to move their tongue . <h> Take action <p> We have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve the diagnosis and treatment of tongue-tie in the UK , saving the NHS money and parents and babies stress and anxiety .

Bronze at the Commonwealth Games ( 5,000m ) , winning at the European Championships ( 10,000m ) plus coming third in Sports Personality of the Yearhave you taken it all in yet ? <p> Everything that happened in 2014 was unexpected as my main priority was being a mum . It 's such a precious time that you ca n't get back so I was really just concentrating on motherhood . I was breastfeeding Emily at the start of April 2014 and the trials for the Commonwealth Games started in May .

I had c-sections so it took time for me to get back into training . Keeping fit when you have a family is about finding time to train but not being regimented . Go with the flow and work some exercise gradually into your day when you can . Do n't feel you have to build yourself up to a massive training session ; remember that exercise little and often is a great way to build up your fitness . Why not walk or jog up the road and back , for instance ? <p> Make exercise a family activity too ; teach your kids from an early age that it 's fun to be fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also often take my youngest , Emily , on training runs in the buggy . <h> People have commented on your age " in terms of motherhood and also your sports achievements .

I also have a better mental approach to training psychologically ; I do n't dwell on every little detail anymore . I 'm so much happier now , enjoying running again and motivated to train harder . <h> On top of your running career , you 're also an ambassador for Dreams Come True , a charity that fulfils the wishes of seriously and terminally i 'll children . <p> Yes , I 'm thrilled to be involved with a charity that 's so close to my heart being a mum .

If you have a query which is n't covered below please go to our NNS Facebook Groupwhere you will be able to put your question to the organising team . <h> Q. Why ca n't I bring my pushchair ? Are n't you all about babies ? <p> A. We have so many people trying to get to the items for sale that pushchairs cause a real problem . If you can , ask a friend to babysit , or to at least come with you to the sale to hold your baby/keep an eye on your toddler while you shop . Failing that , do you have or can you borrow a sling or carrier for a young baby ? If you have never been before , imagine the first-day-of-the-sales scrum as people dash for the best bargains - do you really want to be trying to negotiate that with a pushchair ? <h> Q. Why are you so fussy about how I label my stuff ? <p> A. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sale , we have to sort all the labels into your individual envelopes . Tiny labels can get lost , flimsy labels can get torn - and if an item does n't have a label on , we wo n't sell it as we do n't know who it belongs to . Which means you might end up having to come and collect unsold items from lost property after the sale . Please write something useful for your item description . If a label comes off in the sale , we try to match them to unlabelled items so you have a chance to sell your stuff . <h> Q. ? I want to buy it but it has n't got a label , why wo n't you sell it to me ? <p> A. We used to sell items without a label , by agreeing a price at the paytable . However , not everyone has the same ideas about what something is worth , so it is safer for us not to risk selling something unpriced in case we sell it far too cheaply . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tills are taken to one side , and if the label turns up it is re-attached and the item is put out for sale . <h> Q. How can I pay for my purchases ? <p> A. We accept cash or credit/debit cards ( with a 50p donation ) <h> Q. What cards do you accept ? <p> A. Visa , Mastercard , Maestro and Solo cards - not American Express . <h> Q. Why do you ask for an extra donation for paying by card ? <p> A. Thechip &amp; pin machines cost a lot to hire , we ask for a 50p donation towards this as we have hired the machines for your convenience and security - no need for you to be carrying cash around , and no need to try to guess how much you need , or to have to leave things behind as they cost more than you brought with you . <h> Q.

@@42383359 @2383359/ <p> With the hot weather forecast , the situation for babies , toddlers and mums-to-be could quickly turn uncomfortable . So NCT has put together some top tips to help pregnant women and little ones stay cool this summer . <p> Avoiding Dehydration <p> The main symptoms of dehydration are feeling thirsty . In more severe cases you may also get headaches , dizziness and feel tired or lethargic , which are the early warning signs of heat exhaustion . To avoid dehydration pregnant women should drink regularly and have plenty of cold drinks ( water or fruit juice are best ) . <p> Babies , because they have a low body weight , are more sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss . Like adults , babies and young children need to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated . <p> Babies show that they are dehydrated by being more floppy or irritable than usual , looking unwell , losing weight , having dry skin and a sunken fontanelle ( the soft spot on top of their head is lower than usual ) and by having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine . <p> Breastfed babies do n't need extra water as long as they can breastfeed as often as they need to . Even in much hotter countries studies have shown that babies help themselves to more frequent , shorter feeds so that they get more thirst-quenching milk . They may often have a short feed from each breast if they are thirsty . <p> Babies fed on formula need to be offered cooled , boiled water in a small cup or bottle . Formula fed babies may behave as though they are hungry but if they then reject the feed it may be that they are actually thirsty . Offer water little and often but continue to offer formula as normal . <p> Be creative to keep your child hydrated . If over six months old , you could try giving them very diluted fruit juice , or homemade fruit juice lollies when it 's very hot . Fruit juice is n't necessary for babies ; their teeth are more vulnerable to acid attack and water is the only drink they need other than milk . <p> Protecting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and does not yet have much natural protection from the sun , so it burns and gets damaged much faster . Young children like to be outdoors but in the summer the sun is very strong in the middle of the day so you may want to be indoors between about 11.00am and 3.00pm . <p> Keeping your baby in the shade as much as possible helps to keep them cooler , as well as safer from the sun , but if you need to take your baby out : <p> Use a sunscreen cream made for babies or toddlers which blocks both UVA and UVB . Sunscreens appear to be safe for babies and should be used rather than risking sunburn . Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30+ . <p> Do n't forget to apply sunscreen regularly , particularly if your child is in and out of the sea or a paddling pool . <p> Tips for keeping cool <p> Have cool baths or showers , and splash yourself with cool water . <p> Babies and children like to play with water so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath in a washing up bowl if they are small , or let them sit up and play with the water in a bowl . For older ones a paddling pool is fun and helps them keep cool . <p> Wear loose , cool clothing and a hat if you go outdoors . Babies might be best in a bigger brother or sister 's thin shirt . Anything that let 's air circulate next to their skin will help . <p> Close blinds or curtains in the day where the sun comes in and leave windows open if it is safe to do so . <p> Opening upstairs windows and leaving doors open may help to get a breeze flowing up through the house . But with small children in the house avoid doing this if they can climb and reach the windows . <p> Cars are heat traps and it is hard to stay cool in a car unless it is air conditioned . If you can travel in the early morning or evening it will be more comfortable . <p> Keeping cool at night <p> It helps to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds or curtains . You can also use a fan to circulate the air in the room . <p> Open your windows and curtains at night if it is safe . <p> Bowls of water in the house also help to cool the air through evaporation . <p> Babies wo n't need much in the way of bedclothes or covers . You could dress your baby in just a nappy with a vest or a sheet that wo n't work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night .

No matter how ready you think you are , the early weeks of parenthood can be challenging . <p> Both you and your partner may be surprised by how all-consuming the baby is and what impact this might have on your day-to-day lives and your relationships . All couples experience stress and can also have negative feelings about each other and about their baby . <p> What makes a difference is how they respond to those feelings .

Before your baby was born you might have felt really close to your partner , enjoying being part of a couple and planning for the future together . The shift to a relationship based on three people can cause relationship stress after having a baby which can affect this closeness . <p> Establish early on how you want to be involved . <p> Talk about what you can do with your baby and what you can do to help your partner . <p> If you get involved with the baby and helping your partner take care of herself , you 'll feel closer and your partner will feel supported too . <p> There are lots of practical things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soothing the baby , fetching food and drinks .

Usually this passes but , in the meantime , continue to reassure her that she 's doing well .

It is easy to become snappy with one another , especially if you 're both short of sleep . <p> Keep talking and discuss why you do things in a certain way . <p> Remember that neither of you has a monopoly on good parenting skills . <p> Bear in mind that consistency is more important than arguing over whose method is best . <p> Remember " and remind your partner " these are the early days ' .

The most common cause is gastroenteritis - an infection of the gut more commonly known as a stomach bug - and it usually does n't last long . <p> In babies , the cause could also be swallowing air during feeding , a milk intolerance or reflux . In older children , it could be a food allergy if accompanied by a rash or swelling . <h> Diarrhoea and vomiting in babies <p> Most babies have occasional loose stools ( poo ) and breastfed babies have looser stools than formula-fed babies .

Find out what circumcision is , how common it is , whether it 's available on the NHS and more . <h> What is circumcision ? <p> Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin , which is the fold of skin at the end of the penis . The foreskin is normally loose in an unerect penis , and it can be gently pulled back . The majority of circumcisions are performed on babies and children . <h> Is circumcision for babies common in the UK ? <p> In the UK , most boys and men are not circumcised , unless they are from cultural or religious communities where this procedure is usual . <h> Does the NHS provide circumcision procedures ? <p> Not usually , unless there is a medical reason for it . <h> What would be a medical reason ? <p> At first , a newborn 's foreskin is attached to the head of the penis and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the connective membrane naturally dissolves . Very occasionally , a boy might have a foreskin that remains tight , and which ca n't retract easily . This condition is uncomfortable and can lead to infection and other problems . <p> Another reason might be that there are repeated inflammations of the foreskin and/or the tip of the penis . Usually , removal of the foreskin would be a last resort , after other treatments have been tried . Any medical reason why a newborn would require a medical circumcision would be very rare . <h> What happens during an infant circumcision ? <p> Under local anaesthetic , the foreskin is cut , and any bleeding is controlled . The surgeon stitches the edges of the skin that remain , with dissolvable stitches . <h> Is circumcision painful for a baby ? <p> It is likely to cause some discomfort for your newborn but the recovery is relatively quick . Pain and swelling afterwards is common , but this reduces after a few days . <h> Are there any health advantages to circumcision for children ? <p> Current UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumcision , and that the risks associated with it , such as bleeding and post-operative infection , while small , outweigh any potential benefits . There have been studies of routine circumcision in newborn boys in an attempt to establish health benefits . One review to examine the effect on the incidence of urinary tract infection concluded there was no evidence that circumcision prevented these . <h> Where can I get more information ? <p> Your health visitor or GP may be able to discuss this with you . If you decide you wish to have circumcision for your son , without a medical reason , your GP may be able to refer you to a private practitioner . If you have religious reasons for choosing circumcision , your contacts in your religious community are likely to help . 13050 @qwx423050 13056 @qwx423056 <p> You might find attending one of NCT 's Early Days groups helpful as they explore different approaches to important parenting issues with a qualified group leader and allow you to meet other new parents in your area . 13053 @qwx423053
