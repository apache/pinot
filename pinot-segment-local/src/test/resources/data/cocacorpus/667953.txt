These few obstacles have bypasses though , so you decide which way you want to go . The road is being systematically graded from the bottom up , but the top part of this trail changes after every winter season and even after each rain storm . In some places erosion has exposed more rocks and deep ruts have formed . Aggressive stock vehicles with good articulation can get up this trail with no problem , but you might have to skip one or two " fun hills " and take the easy route instead . This is a very popular trail on the weekends . Drive carefully and watch for ATVs and dirt bikes .

Make an important right turn uphill at 30.4 miles onto FS 192 . This narrow shelf road starts easy but deteriorates quickly . Probably the worst spot on the trail is reached at 31.2 miles .

There are a few rock outcroppings in the trail , keep your tires on the high parts and you should n't scrape . I never did and I drive a 2012 Toyota Tacoma quad cab 4+4 TRD . Keep in mind it is a rather long drive , bring water a few beers and a lunch , there are a lot of places to stop and the views are fantastic .

I made the trek on 05/30/2017 and essentially reached a dead end at the amateur mining site . The guy has diverted a stream and covered the trail with river rocks/boulders and my F150 was too long to navigate a gnarly S turn with large boulders dictating the path . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while that guy was no doubt laughing his ass off . <p> As to your question , I 'd guess that either the county/state/BLM officials do n't  know about it or cant/wont go back there to do anything about it . <p> Just made the trek on 6/3/2017 in a stock Jeep with 32 ? tires and my buddy had a tacoma trd with 2 ? lift . We both made it all the way without getting remotely close to getting stuck . Scraped the skids a couple of times but that was it . The trail goes through a miners private land and he is nice enough to leave the gate unlocked so people can pass through . You just have to drive through the wash to get to the next leg of the trail . Quite rocky and a tough trail in parts but it is a lot of fun . Air down for all the rocks and I recommend not going alone but you will likely see at least a few other vehicles on the trail .

@@109994579 @5394579/ <h> Jeep Wrangler JK hood flutter <p> If you own a Wrangler JK you might have experienced something very unsettling while driving on a freeway . When you go over 60 MPH , you ca n't help but notice the hood jumping up and down so violently you think at any minute its going to rip the latches off and come flying up at your windshield . Not everyone notices it and some people simply ignore it . I was ignoring it myself for over three years , even though it always seems to scare the crap out of me ! I know that the chances that both latches fail and the secondary , metal latch in the front fails also at the same time are slim , but its just a distraction that I do n't  need while I 'm driving my " brick on wheels " . It is funny though how my passengers react to it when I point it out to them Finally after three years of driving my jeep , the passenger that I 'm in a relationship with , asked me to do something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fact that the stock hood latches utilize a weak and stretch-prone rubber that allows the hood to lift and flutter at speed . The rubber is very soft ! You can actually pull on your locked hood , grabbing it right under the latch and see it lift slightly . That is not a good sign ! <p> The solution to this problem is to make sure your hood closes tighter and does n't  lift when the gust of wind hits it . There are few ways to accomplish that . Some are free and pretty " ghetto " and some require buying replacement parts , but are permanent : <p> 1 . You can remove the hood latch spring in the front This is the simplest and free fix , and it might take care of the problem for you . <p> 2 . You can wrap a zip tie tightly around the rubber piece of the latch to prevent it from stretching This is another simple and cheap fix , but you have to remember to carry extra zip ties in your jeep since they break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and LONG ... <p> 5 . You can buy replacement hood wranglers which are the rubber pieces of the latch This is what I decided to get . The best and most popular are made by Daystar . These hood wranglers upgrade the soft rubber on the factory latches with a heavy-duty polyurethane material that is much more stiffer and does n't  stretch almost at all . Installation is simple and maintains the factory look . <p> here 's a short install video : <p> It takes only about 15 minutes to replace the parts , but you will immediately notice how much shorter and stiffer this new part is . Honestly it might take you longer to close your new latches than to install them ! <p> When I installed them for the first time I seriously did n't  think they were long enough for me to be able to close the latches . After struggling for several minutes , I discovered that the only way to close the latch is to hold it with both hands and get as much stretch as possible from the rubber , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close it with one hand while holding the hood down with the other hand will not work ) . I have had the new latches for a couple of months now and I can say that they stretch out just enough to make it little easier to close , but they definitely do their job of eliminating all the hood flutter . Well worth the money ! <p> Feel free to comment if you have any experience with any of these methods .

And if you 're anything like me and like to be prepared for unexpected situations , you carry a lot of gear in your jeep . Whenever you go wheeling and especially camping you add even more stuff and quickly run out of room inside your Jeep . You have to be pretty creative and use every available square inch of space . <p> Having a two-door JK myself I 'm always looking for smart ways of storing my gear inside my Jeep , that would allow easy access and keep the items secure at the same time . While surfing the web I came across a subject of MOLLE racks , and specifically tailgate racks . It is such an obvious , great spot for storing gear with incredibly easy access . MOLLE system provides great flexibility and there are so many options when it comes to pouches ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attached to the tailgate . It all depends on what your needs are , and of course what you 're willing to spend on the system . <p> You can obviously build a simple panel or rack yourself , and customize it the way you wish . I 'm all about DIY projects , but after some calculations I decided that in this case I will save myself time and trouble and pick one of the available products out there . <p> After many hours of reading descriptions , reviews and looking at pictures I decided that I wanted four things out of my system : #1 MOLLE rack #2 solid steel construction #3 fold-down option that turns the panel into a table #4 no drilling into my tailgate There are also few options if you 're looking for a tailgate table only , but for me personally it was very important to have the MOLLE panel to which I could attach gear pouches and clamps . <p> I 'm sure there are other products available out there , but that is what I found so far . <p> After countless hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Springtail Solutions JK Rear Door Folding Tray/MOLLE Panel . It met all my requirements and it seemed to have very good reviews , both regarding quality of the product and customer service . I decided to buy it on Ebay where Springtail Solutions sells several models of their storage systems . I opted for the panel only option since I already had a plan as to what I wanted to install on the panel and did not need any more pouches . The listing delivery info mentions that handling might take more than 10 business days plus of course delivery time . I was very nicely surprised when it turned out that after buying it on Sunday , they shipped it on Monday . The very next day ! I received the package on Friday and was ready to install Saturday morning . <p> When I opened the shipping box , I was impressed by the high quality black powder coating on the MPAC grid and laser cut components . It was wrapped well for transit and arrived undamaged . The kit does require assembly , but goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youtube that walks you through the installation process . Just take your time and be patient . There are parts you can break if you over tighten them in a rush . The whole assembly takes about 15 minutes even with stops to watch the entire video . <p> Installation onto the Jeeps tailgate only takes about 5 minutes once you have the unit fully assembled as one piece , and it does n't require drilling and utilizes stock mounting locations . It can also be uninstalled at any point without any trace it was ever there . Do n't  get me wrong , I do not plan on selling my jeep EVER , but it is nice when you do n't  have to drill into it to add mods . The screws that hold the backing plate to the tailgate seem small , but there are 8 of them and everything feels very secure once tighten . The panels size is perfect , included hardware feels very solid , and the operation is smooth . You just pull on the paracord handles attached to the plungers and the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shut . I just wanted to point out that in my case I had to trim the provided weather stripping used to eliminate any rattling of the table . It was just to thick and after removing some excess with a blade everything fitted perfectly . <p> The MOLLE rack gives you plenty of options when it comes to attaching your gear to it . Everyone will have their own ideas . I decided on attaching my camping axewith a couple of Quick Fist clamps , two e-tool carriers ( one holds the actual Ames entrenching tooland the other one is for my leather gloves ) and some heavy duty trash bags . The rack is rated for about 40 pounds but there is always the option of drilling holes if you want to mount screws to the tailgate to take a heavier load . Just remember that adding too much weight to your tailgate might eventually take a toll on the hinges and the proper operation of the tailgate . <p> I really like the fact that the rack is made out of steel , because it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash bags to the side of it , as well as a bottle opener and have it handy when the need arises . <p> I 've only had the Springtail Solutions rack/table for a couple of weeks and I have n't been camping since getting it , but I am really looking forward to taking full advantage of this setup for a very long time !

@@109994583 @5394583/ <h> Jeep JK 3.6L V6 thermostat housing replacement <p> This post is my attempt to describe the process of replacing a thermostat housing on a 2012 Jeep JK with a 3.6L V6 Pentastar engine . I am not a professional mechanic , I just try to do as much work on my Jeep as possible . It helps me learn more about my vehicle and save some money that can be spent on parts and upgrades . The primary function of a thermostat is to maintain a minimum operating temperature in your cars engine . When you start your engine cold , the antifreeze / coolant mixture is kept within the engine by the thermostat . When the coolant temperature reaches the specified opening point of the thermostat , it opens . Coolant will then flow through the radiator to keep the engine at a temperature close to the rated temperature of the thermostat . The reason I needed to replace my thermostat was because one morning while driving to work , the " check engine " light came on . When I got home I plugged in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an indication of a faulty thermostat or ECT engine coolant temp sensor ) . After talking to few people I decided that the first thing I 'm going to replace is a thermostat and see if that fixes the problem . I got the new thermostat housing and a gallon of coolant at my local dealership ( $34.00 and $24.00 respectively ) . <p> VERY IMPORTANT : Make sure you get the correct type of coolant for your Jeep if you 're going to be adding it to your system . Read this post before proceeding any further ! Remember that if you drive a MY ( model year ) 2012 or older Jeep Wrangler you need a HOAT ( Hybrid Organic Additive Technology ) coolant , and if you drive a MY 2013 and newer Jeep Wrangler you need an OAT ( Organic Additive Technology ) coolant . These two types of coolants DO NOT MIX ! Like I mentioned before I own a 2012 JK so that 's the last model year that uses the HOAT coolant ( Mopar part number 68048953AB , label on the bottle states 5 Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post is written for . The procedure for Jeep JK thermostat housing replacement is the same for either type of coolant though . Also if you buy concentrated coolant , you need to get a gallon of distilled water to mix it with , before adding it into your cooling system . <p> Step 1 : Make sure you are parked on level ground and you let the engine cool down . Open your hood and remove the engine cover . <p> Step 2 : Using your socket wrench and 10mm socket , remove the two bolts holding down the air intake plumbing between the air box and the throttle . Then using your flathead screwdriver , loosen the hose-clamps at the airbox and the throttle . Also pop out the thin radiator overflow hose from the clips near where the 10mm bolts come out . This small hose stays in place , but just needs to be removed from the clips . <p> I found it impossible to disconnect it in its original position . I decided to carefully disconnect the intake plumbing first and flip it on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With a better view of the sensor I was able to squeeze the little tab on the plug and disconnect the sensor with no problem . <p> Step 4 : With the intake plumbing removed you will have much better view of the thermostat housing and an easy access to it . <p> Step 5 : Find yourself one of these skinny 1 gallon plastic jugs and cut the top off . <p> Step 6 : Put a drip tray ( and maybe some towels or cardboard too ) on the ground underneath and place the plastic jug just under the upper radiator hose clamp that secures it to the thermostat housing . <p> Step 7 : Take off the radiator cap to relieve any pressure that might be in the cooling system . You can also drain some of the coolant at this point , since there will be a lot of it coming out of the engine block as soon as you remove the thermostat housing . You can drain the coolant using the radiator draincock located on the bottom of the radiator just below the filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coolant to a large container ( coolant is toxic and dangerous ) . <p> Step 8 : Squeeze the radiator hose clamp and slide it down the hose away from the thermostat housing . <p> After the clamp is off , twist and pull the hose off the thermostat housing and aim it into the bucket since the coolant will start draining immediately . <p> Step 9 : Using your T30 Torx Socket , with socket wrench and short extension , loosen the bottom and top bolts holding the thermostat housing to the engine block . Re-position your plastic jug under the housing . Note : The housing will be likely stuck to the engine block . Start slowly lifting it from the bottom since much more coolant will leak out from behind the thermostat immediately . It will probably be difficult to get this coolant into the bucket below , which is why I had another drain pan on the ground . A couple of shop rags will help clean up the extra coolant that you ca n't catch . <p> Step 10 : Remove the old thermostat housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . In my case the old gasket was left behind . Make sure you peel this off as the new thermostat housing has a new gasket already pressed into it . <p> Make sure you scrape away any excess residue or piece of the gasket left behind . Start with a plastic scraper ( plastic card ) so you do n't  mar the mating surface ( which may end up causing more leaks ) . <p> Step 11 : Install the new thermostat housing in the same orientation as the one you just removed . Replace the top and bottom T30 Torx bolts . I believe these should be torqued to 105 in-lbs . If you do n't have a torque wrench , then you should be safe with getting the bolts snug tight , then about a 1/4 turn after that . The key here is to NOT over-tighten them . You can loosen the bleeder screw on the top of the new thermostat housing a bit at this point as well . <p> Step 12 : Replace the radiator hose and hose clamp onto the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stopper on the thermostat housing and then replace the hose clamp so that it is beyond the " knurled " end of the housing . <p> If you buy the concentrated coolant , you need to mix it 50/50 with distilled water . <p> Step 13 : Place a funnel securely into the radiator filler neck ( you can wrap the narrow end with duct tape if it does n't  fit tightly into the filler neck ) and add coolant until it starts to bleed out of the bleeder screw you just loosened . Then tighten down the bleeder screw ( hand tight , I used a pair of pliers because access was pretty tight , but again do not over-tighten . ) You can now remove the bucket from earlier that should have drained coolant in it . <p> Step 14 : Continue to top off your radiator with coolant . You 'll want to fill until the bottom of the filler neck has coolant in it , but not all the way to the very top of the neck . Top off your coolant reservoir bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed from the drivers side looking down . Use a flashlight to help see the MAX and MIN lines if need be.Step 15 : Replace your air intake plumbing that you removed in step 2 . Do n't forget to reconnect the sensor wire at the backside , and re-clip the small hose in at the bolting locations . Use the two 10mm bolts and hand tighten them down . Then hand tighten the hose clamps at the airbox and throttle side with the flathead screwdriver .

Step 18 : While the engine is running and warming up , you 'll notice that the level of the coolant in the funnel changes . Once the engine reaches correct temperature , the thermostat opens and the coolant level will typically drop quite a bit . Top off the coolant while the engine is running , again only to the top of the filler neck . The level might rise as the coolant heats up . You 'll also notice air bubbles coming out , which means the air is being bled from the system.Step 19 : Once the coolant level stays consistent , turn off the engine and wait several minutes.Step 20 : Stick a long screwdriver wrapped with a towel inside the funnel and plug the bottom of it ( the coolant might still be HOT ) .

Again , keep an eye on the temp gauge during this process . Then let the engine cool and check your coolant levels again . You may need to repeat this process a few more times depending on your situation ( may take a few hours depending on the ambient temperature outside ) .

Or , are they two separate components ? I had error code P0128 come up , and the dealership advised my wife to replace the thermostat . However , when I saw the dealership bill , the part code they used was " housing t 07043001 . Was that for the housing AND thermostat , or did they just replace the housing and kept the old thermostat in the engine and ripped me off ?

Ive read some reviews where people say they wear out pretty fast , but I have n't noticed it yet , since its been only about 50 hours of riding for me .
