What started as a design studio by day and yoga studio by night soon became a standalone store in November of 2000 on West 4th Avenue in Vancouver 's Kitsilano neighbourhood . <p> Our vision for our store was to create more than a place where people could get gear to sweat in , we wanted to create a community hub where people could learn and discuss the physical aspects of healthy living , mindfulness and living a life of possibility . It was also important for us to create real relationships with our guests and understand what they were passionate about , how they liked to sweat and help them celebrate their goals . Today , we do this in our stores around the globe . <h> Our product <p> Our first designs were made for women to wear during yoga . Through plenty of feedback from our guests , ambassadors and elite athletes , we now design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sweaty pursuits for women and men . Not to mention , our designers are athletes and sweat-minded people , too . <h> Our best life <p> A constant that has never wavered is our desire to empower people to reach their full potential through providing the right tools and resources , and encouraging a culture of leadership , goal setting and personal responsibility . Our core values of quality , product , integrity , balance , entrepreneurship , greatness and fun are lived by our people every day and are at the heart of our unique company culture . <p> We live a life we love . We set our goals to align with our vision , and it 's why , so often , our one-year goals become today 's reality . 
@@3187978 <h> Vendor Code of Ethics : Focus Areas <p> Our Vendor Code of Ethics ( VCoE ) outlines exactly what we stand for when it comes to manufacturing , and all vendors are expected to uphold legal , humane , and ethical standards of production . These areas are of particular interest to our stakeholders : <h> child labour <p> We have a zero-tolerance policy towards child labour at any of our manufacturing facilities . Vendors must ensure that all employees in their facilities have completed compulsory education and are at least 15 years of age or meet the local legal working age , whichever is highest . We require our vendors to maintain a labour force register that verifies the age of all employees and establishes a child remediation program if an underage employee is discovered . Our remediation program requires vendors to take full responsibility for the education of the child until they finish completing compulsory education . After that , we offer them employment when they reach age 15 , unless local law states a higher age . <h> forming unions <p> Under our VCoE , employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means employees can choose to form and belong to a union , or not belong to a union or any other type of employee organization . We believe that an open , direct relationship between employees and management is the best way to create a healthy and harmonious workplace . All vendors must have an internal grievance system that allows for anonymity , especially in places where employees have restricted legal rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining , to make sure honest feedback is exchanged . <h> human trafficking <p> Human trafficking , also known as modern day slavery , happens in many developing countries . We have a zero-tolerance policy toward forced or bonded labour and take actions to ensure this is not happening in our supply chain . Our assessment experts are trained to identify human trafficking , forced or bonded labour , and other practices that may infringe on employees ' basic human rights . <h> wages <p> Our vendors must pay employees at least the local minimum wage , and provide benefits in accordance with all relevant applicable local laws . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay an industry-average wage ( or higher ) that can sustain an employee 's needs . We do n't own any of the facilities that manufacture our products so we ca n't set wages , but we choose partners that treat their employees well and many of our vendors are preferred employers in their communities . <h> overtime <p> Our zero-tolerance policy for any kind of forced labour includes involuntary overtime . Working overtime must be optional and compensated at the legal premium rate . Regardless of the vendor country 's law , no employee should work more than 60 hours or seven days in a week , on a regular basis . If this can not be avoided due to unforeseen circumstances , our vendors must make an overtime request to our sustainability team for approval , and if approved , provide a substitute rest period or holiday . If we believe that excessive overtime is becoming commonplace in a facility , our sustainability team will work with the vendor to help identify the root of the problem and eliminate the practice . 
@@3187979 <h> Vendor Code of Ethics <p> Our Vendor Code of Ethics ( VCoE ) outlines our commitment to best-in-class industry standards . It outlines our responsibility principles to ensure that , despite cultural and legal differences among countries where we produce or source goods , all of our partners uphold a consistent set of policies . Where our VCoE conflicts with local laws , our partners follow the stricter regulations . We believe that by aligning on core values from the start , we create the foundation for successful long-term relationships to achieve our mutual goals . <p> Our Sustainability Team and commissioned third-party experts use our VCoE to conduct assessments at new and existing facilities . We assess our cut and sew facilities and raw material mills , including the living conditions in factory dormitories . We are working to include trim suppliers in our assessments . We require all approved subcontractors to uphold our VCoE and conduct selective assessments based on risk . <h> zero-tolerance policies <p> We have pre-conditions for engaging in and maintaining a business partnership and have zero-tolerance for : <p> Lack of transparency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Minimum wage violations <p> Child labour <p> Corruption and bribery <p> Our policy requires that all vendors be open , transparent , and cooperative by allowing full access to facilities and provide full disclosure on all practices , locations , and resources related to production . <h> action planning <p> Our zero-tolerance policies must be followed without any exception or deviation . We want to influence positive change through our business partnerships , and therefore usually engage to foster change rather than leave a facility when other deviations from the VCoE are found . Leaving can lead to worse working conditions and ultimately , deterioration in the lives of employees .

We have a strong Vendor Code of Ethics program , with requirements that all partners must uphold . <p> The issue <p> International Labor Organization research shows that there are at least 14.2 million victims of forced labour across different industries worldwide and that women and children are particularly vulnerable . This disclosure for the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act ( SB-657 ) outlines the steps we 're taking to prevent human trafficking and modern day slavery in our supply chain , ensuring our vendors meet internationally recognized standards and our Vendor Code of Ethics requirements .

Our Vendor Code of Ethics clearly outlines six zero tolerance policies , including forced and bonded labour . Our zero tolerance policy toward forced and bonded labour includes , but is not limited to , involuntary overtime and prison , indentured or bonded labour . We require that all work must be completed on a voluntary and legal basis . This means that employees must be free to move and/or resign from their role , be free to leave at the end of their shift or under extenuating circumstances , and employers must not engage in illegal practices that restrict their employees ' freedom of movement ( such as retaining identity documents , charging recruitment fees or deposits , withholding wages , barring exits , or using physical constraints ) . <p> Verification <p> We work with industry organizations , stakeholder groups and other brands to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery .

Facility audits are done by our in-house team of experts and our third party auditing partners . <p> Auditing <p> To ensure that our vendors uphold our requirements , we conduct announced , semiannounced , and unannounced audits , as well as regular follow-up visits and verification . Frequent visits and audits are an opportunity for us to strengthen our relationship , enhance transparency , and work together on preventive actions . At a minimum , we require all facilities to be audited annually . <p> Each audit is conducted over two days , at least , depending on the size of the facility . During an audit and any follow up visit , auditors meet with management , tour every part of the site ( including dormitories and canteens where applicable ) , review documents and interview employees at all levels of the organization . <p> Certification <p> Our Vendor Code of Ethics applies to every vendor partnership that we form , and vendors must sign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our Vendor Code of Ethics , we also have a zero tolerance policy toward unapproved subcontractors , facilities and homework , and vendors who are not open , transparent and cooperative ; this allows us to know exactly who is producing our product , and how it 's being produced . All of our manufacturing partners must abide by the laws of the country in which they are doing business . In cases when there is a difference between requirements of local law , international law and our Vendor Code of Ethics , the most stringent standard applies . <p> Accountability <p> If forced or bonded labour are found during a pre-production facility audit , we do not start business with the vendor and we require that they correct the problem immediately . If one of our existing vendors were found to be complicit in any form of forced or bonded labour , we would require the vendor to address and correct the problem immediately , and we would launch an investigation into the issue . Our approach to manufacturing is to establish and maintain long-term partners that share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action plans to address and correct issues that arise . In extreme cases of systemic non-compliance or violation of our zero tolerance policies , we reserve the right terminate the business partnership . <p> Training and education <p> We work to protect the integrity of our supply chain by educating our vendors , auditors , and our internal teams about human trafficking and slavery . We regularly engage with industry organizations and other brands to stay abreast of the latest developments , issues and regulations .

@@3188061 <h> How To Visvamitrasana <p> Carolyn Anne Budgell <p> Share <p> Like so many things in this wonderful life , the devil in Visvamitrasana lies in the details . Also known as Sage 's Pose , it 's named after an Indian warrior king named Brahmarshi Visvamitra who worked diligently to become recognized as a sage . The pose is complex in that it requires openness as well as strength from many different body parts and an embodiment of your physique 's tipping point as you balance on one foot and one hand . Thus , the challenge in Visvamitrasana lies in understanding the intricacies of all the little pieces in action and the simple steps required to achieve graceful balance , not unlike the commitment required to transform one 's self , as Visvamitra did . <p> NOT SUITABLE FOR : <p> hamstring injured <p> wrist injured <p> sacroiliac injured <p> PREPARATION POSES <p> Surya Namaskara A ( Sun Salutations ) , to connect to breath and heat the body with a conscious flow <h> Step 1 <p> Utthita Parsvakonasana opens the side waist along with the hips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body is in the general form of the full pose in Parsvakonasana so make sure to emphasize the upper arm extended and energized with the scapula firm on the back to open chest , the top side waist lengthening , front ribs drawing in and core engaged , the back foot rooted firmly with the inner arch lifted . <h> Step 2 &amp; 2.5 <p> Both hips ( including inner thighs and abductors , outer hips , glutes and abductors , hamstrings and quads ) need ample mobility for this advanced pose . Practice all the prep poses listed above to target the key hip points , and of course practice patience . Lizard " specifically the shoulder-behind-knee variation " is crucial due to the deep access into the hips as well as securing the shoulder-to-knee and knee-to-shoulder hugging action for lift and strength in the final pose . In this step keep front foot firmly planted with knee aligned above ankle , gather front knee tightly to the shoulder , snuggle shoulder deeply behind knee , engage core and mula bandha ( pelvic floor lift ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do in the final pose . <h> Step 3 &amp; 3.5 <p> Closing in on the final destination here , coming directly from Lizard with shoulder behind the knee , plant the hand with fingers spread , outside the front foot . This bottom hand will bear a lot of weight as you start to lean back into it ( practicing Vasisthasana will strengthen and stretch that wrist ) . In this step , we see the many actions at work that are needed for the full pose : bottom fingers gripping the mat , knee hugging in and shoulder pressing out into shoulder , a gentle lift and engagement of pelvic floor and core , reaching out through the front leg ( if the hamstring allows ) , a gentle twist of the abdomen towards the sky and the chest open . Keep back knee on the ground for now and focus on the foot lifting , opening the hip , remaining strong in the bottom arm , knee to shoulder connection and lift in the core and pelvis . <h> Step 4 <p> Ardha Visvamitrasana is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , balance and/or hip mobility . With back knee on the ground , grab hold of the lifted foot ( by bending the leg ) and press the foot strongly into the hand as leverage in order to twist the torso towards the sky ( on exhalations ) .

Well , sort of . It will certainly feel that way once you get all the body parts working in unison for this challenging pose . From the Ardha variation , root the back foot as you did in Parsvakonasana ( Step 1 ) .

@@3188070 <h> Yoga , Meditation and Pottery <p> Lara Zilibowitz <p> Share <p> For the first few months of learning to throw on a potter 's wheel , you struggle to centre the clay . After that , the clay begins to centre you . The clay tells you when you 're losing focus and it teaches you to stay grounded and maintain concentration . <p> I 've been practicing for more than 10 years now and the alchemy of wheel throwing , with its effect of merging the body and mind , is remarkably similar to my experiences on the mat . Similar to coordinating breath and movement when flowing through Vinyasa , working with clay for me is a meditation practice . <p> I 'm a very tactile person and my hands have always been my avenue to enjoy the world , whether it 's through yoga and massage , kneading bread dough with my eyes closed or eating with my fingers . My arms covered elbow-deep in silken clay is the ultimate , though . Manipulating a raw piece of earth from solid to liquid state and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure is miraculous , and highly therapeutic . That said , the mission is by no means easy from the outset . <p> Particularly on the first attempts , more often than not clay appears to be an uncontrollable organism with a mind of its own . As soon as the wheel starts to spin , the clay can buck and warp underneath your fingers , wobbling and deforming , even flying off the wheel in revolt . Squeeze too tightly and it will distort . Rush the process and it will spin out of control . All there is in the moment is sensation under your fingers , breath in the belly and complete presence . It 's a challenging feat of concentration and multi-tasking , with one foot on the pedal controlling the speed , strong core engagement providing stability , skillful effort applied with palms and dexterous fingers used as tools for shaping . All the while the breath needs to remain steady and the mind clear . <p> After returning to the wheel after a long hiatus , I was fascinated to see the parallels between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to me that all practices train for equanimity , to sit with frustration and difficult emotions , to accept inevitable disappointment and most of all find peace when chaos is spinning around them . Improving these practices is not just a case of refining skills using the body , but potentially even more so the mind . <p> The greatest lesson I 've learned at the wheel has been non-attachment and letting go . Placing the finished pieces in the kiln is an act of complete surrender to the heat and flames within . The fire may turn it into a masterpiece , but very possibly crack it , warp it , melt it , and in some cases completely explode it . The challenge is to pause , take a breath , and start over . <p> One-Week Meditation Challenge <p> Welcome to our seven-day meditation challenge podcast series led by Danielle Mika Nagel. 
@@3188072 <h> Waterproof Technology <p> Our hometown is Vancouver and we know a thing or two about rain . After all , there 's a reason people call it Raincouver " on average , it rains about 165 days a year . Needless to say , our outerwear designers are rain-savvy and well-equipped with first-hand knowledge to create truly intentional and functional gear to help you stay warm and dry in wet weather . <p> We sat down with our outerwear designers , Cath Lebrun and Joshua Hiney , to get an in-depth look at waterproofing and our new waterproof jackets : The Furtive Jacket and the Definitely Raining Jacket . <p> Cath hails from Quebec City and moved to Vancouver in 2011 to start her career as an Outerwear Designer with lululemon . <p> Design Director ( and Designer ) for Post Sweat , No Sweat and Outerwear , Joshua , brings a wealth of experience with him from San Francisco . He 's been living in Vancouver and working with lululemon since March 2014 . <p> One thing that we 're all excited about this fall is having waterproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cath : To make a jacket waterproof we need to combine a waterproof fabric and a waterproof construction . A waterproof fabric has a membrane that does n't allow the water in . A waterproof construction means that every seam will be taped and sealed so that water ca n't get in . Sewing the waterproof fabric makes tiny holes so we need to apply a tape to keep water out . The same goes for anything applied to the jacket like zippers and trims . <p> " Knowing why things were created helps you understand how to create them in technical and innovative ways . " <p> Interestingly , if you look at a waterproof military garment , it 's essentially a heavy piece of cotton that 's been woven so tightly it 's waterproof . You 'll also notice that there 's a lot of glue sticking out of different places . They used glue to make sure that they could re-glue the seams that came undone in the field . <p> Cath : We also get to travel for work and when we travel we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bigger when you travel . <p> What was your inspiration for waterproof outerwear this season ? <p> Cath : Vancouver . I love going outside and going on runs when it rains . If you have a good jacket , it does n't even matter that it 's raining . <p> You both have been designing for a while now , what does it mean for you to be a designer ? <p> Joshua : For me it 's about problem solving while keeping the design beautiful and functional . <p> " Everything is there for a reason , if it does n't have a reason , it should n't be there . " <p> Joshua Hiney , Men 's Design Director &amp; Designer <p> Speaking of problem solving , how does the design process work ? <p> Joshua : It starts with a need . We then do a lot of research and seek inspiration . You can take a lot of things that have been purposed for fashion only and make it in a technical way . <p> Then you 'll start sketching and working with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to construct the design . <p> Cath : When the collaboration starts , things start to change . <p> Josh : Just because you can draw it , does n't mean the factory can do it . After we 've figured out the construction , we go to the factory and work with them more closely . <p> " I do n't want to create something with such a small purpose that you can only wear it twice . If you love it , I want you to be able to wear it all the time . " <p> Cath Lebrun , Outerwear Designer <p> What goes into making sure that a waterproof product meets our standards ? <p> Cath : Lots of testing . <p> Joshua : First you need to find a tape that 's going to adhere to the fabric you 're using . That tape is used to seal the seams so water ca n't get in . When we 've found the right combination , we put a sample over a water pressure machine to see if anything comes through it . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waterproof . After you 've made the garment , you have to put it on a mannequin for a rain test . That 's when you can see if water gets in anywhere , rework the construction and continue testing until it 's waterproof . <p> What features are you most excited about on these jackets ? <p> Joshua : I think it 's the hood . The Furtive Jacket has a stowable hood so that you can wear it in multiple situations . We want to create options for our guests . <p> Outerwear is an investment , and it 's important that our guest does n't feel the jacket they 're buying is not a one-season-and-done type of jacket ' . All of the features we put in to our styles help create a jacket that our guest can wear in various seasons in various elements . <p> Cath : On the Definitely Raining Jacket it also has to be the hood with a double cinch that keeps your peripheral vision in check .

At last crops I do n't need to adjust the length of ! They also keep me cool in our 40+ degree temperatures . I 'm frustrated I have sweated through summers without owning a pair of these marvels .

I worship my black Inspire Crops &amp; Pedal to the Medals , but needed another pair of pants to keep up with winter workouts . I tried on so many - the Minimalist tights , Rebel Runner , Tight Stuff , with no luck . I blame my height ( 5 ' 3 " /163cm ) and short legs . But with City Sky Run , it was love at first sight ! They are truly flattering . The fabric is slightly thicker than I 'm used to but combined with the cut , it gives the pants a nice structured feel . The length is absolutely perfect too , about an inch past my knee . They 've survived a BodyAttack class and were also comfy for yoga . The real test will be taking them for a run . The downside ? No zip , but I was happy to sacrifice that given the pants fit so well ! 
@@3188134 <p> Rated 4 out of 5 by LoopDeLuLulemon from Flattering crops with risquT mesh detailingI was contemplating returning these as I did n't realize the mesh extends right up to the hip and I was n't sure I could feel comfortable working out at the gym in these . After trying them on and experimenting with different underwear I do really like them . The full on luxtreme cinches you in flatteringly and the flow of the mesh as it wraps slightly down the leg contour is unusual and it gives the illusion of slimmer legs . Beware though about the mesh . If your underwear is too low on your hips you can see it through the mesh . If it 's higher waisted you 'll have no problem and from a glance it looks like you have material underneath the mesh rather than 2 layers of mesh and then skin . Poseidon is a beautiful colour too . Goes well with a lot of other colours and is striking with black . It 's TTS so a 6 for me.

There 's only one stitch on the top of each shoulder holding it in place , whereas in previous years I 've purchased tops like these that had more stitching to keep everything in place for after they 've been washed . I might add a few extra stitches in myself to avoid the frustration , but I 'm a running mum not a sewing mum and expect more for the amount of money I spend with Lulu !

No need to fuss around with your hands behind your back to do this up , or wiggle around getting it over your head . It just slides on , like a cute little vest , with a simple clasp / zip at the front . Perfect for when your skin is all sweaty and sticky or post swim . It also looks super cute peaking out under a loose singlet , I 've received heaps of compliments ! No issues with the zipper rubbing inside on my skin either as there is a fabric seam that runs the inside of the zip , sitting softly against my skin : ) LOVE your work LLL !

@@3188254 @qwx17282 <p> Rated 5 out of 5 by lovestorun from Super Comfy Sports BraI love this sports bra . I 'm fairly picky about bras that I will run in as they do need to provide adequate support , even though I 'm only a 10C . This bra is easy to get on and super comfortable . I find that racer back style bras start pull on my shoulders if I wear them for more than a couple of hours . The double construction with the Glide and Stride really does distribute the weight across the shoulders . The fabric is very soft ( I 'm quite susceptible to anything that rubs and chafes ) . I also like the way the bra looks under a racer back tank , like I 'm layering two tanks , as the racer back part is hidden . I suppose the only downside would be that the two layers of fabric are quite thick , so there would be a tendency to get a bit sweaty in warmer weather . Perfect for winter runs though .

I really like my Swiftly half zip and wear it frequently , but I 'm not sure I would buy another .

The fit seems a bit looser than the Swiftly LS tops of the same size , especially in the arms ( but I note another reviewer complained about inconsistent sizing ) . The main issue is that in terms of functionality , it is more similar to a Swiftly long sleeve than other half zip tops , but it costs a lot more . Swiftly LS tops come in more colours , are often on sale ( AUD$54 , compared to AUD$109 for the Swiftly half zip ) and are easier to layer under vests or other half-zip tops .

@@3188333 @qwx17282 <p> Rated 3 out of 5 by Prettypeonies from Sleek and simpleI normally do not write reviews on my purchases . However , I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this hoodie . I had my eye on this for the longest time . I got this in December 2016 . It is roomy and had a great length to cover my bottom . I wore it in slight drizzle and the rain simply slides off . The front pockets are deep enough to carry a lip balm and tissues . The only drawback is that the surface of the hoodie starts pilling after a few wears and it looks horrible like as if I had it for years . It snags easily and i had several loose threads coming out . For a jacket of this price , I expected it to be more robust and to last me months if not years to come . I am genuinely disappointed and had stop wearing it due to the unsiightly pilling patches and loose threads

It is comfortable , keeps me nicely warm and the fit is as flattering as a hoodie can be . I was surprised at the warmth it provides because the fabric is quite thin and lightweight , but this means it is less bulky than other hoodies so I like that . The extra long cuffs with thumbholes are an especially nice touch . Here 's hoping Aus/NZ gets the lovely " heathered rain touch alberta lake " that is available overseas !

Otherwise a great peice that will get heaps of use in winter .

This is annoying b/c everytime you wash the bra the inserts get crumpled up inside the brad and you have to pull them back out , fold into quarters , and then wrangle them back in and spread them out .

Terrible quality for the price . The staff told me she 'll get the tailor to fix the problem . I paid 228SGD and seriously its even more expensive than the selling price in Australia . The selling point for it is Nulux , I would n't have purchased it if not for the nice fabric . I 've purchased several Lulu tights for workouts and each one of them had manufacturing problems ... poor quality . I returned those tights and got a credit note instead .

I bought these in the " warp super purple black " and wore them once and it was immediately obvious to me that they had been incorrectly sized , they were huge , stretched out and kept falling down . I took them into my nearest store where they immediately acknowledged they were much bigger than they should have been and exchanged them on the spot , no questions asked .

Extremely disappointed receiving the Power Y singlet after purchasing through the ' We Made Too Much ' online site as I 'd been advised they were being discontinued when buying the last one on the rack instore a few weeks earlier . Comparing the instore singlet to the ones received online , the composition is different : Power Y bought In-store : Made in Cambodia Body : 87% nylon / 13% Lycra Elastane Thick fabric , opaque coverage and good quality Power Y bought online - We Made Too Much : Made in China Body : 92% nylon / 8% Lycra Spandex Thin fabric , feels cheap , somewhat transparent and if I had n't bought directly through Lululemon I would presume it 's a counterfeit product .

Fit perfectly once i 'd made the adjustments ! Have always had the same problem with tanks which have inner supports , and Lululemon is apparently no different . Otherwise , this is a great tank .

My only complaint is that they are VERY long . Like , beyond half way down my bottom long . I DO think my body is proportionately a bit short , but I find it to be quite excessive . The length makes it difficult to wear with loosely fitted bottoms , such as shorts . With tights it 's not such a big deal . It also comes down to what you like and I prefer tops which sit around my hips/top of my bottom , not the lower end of my bottom . : - )

I am generally a 4-6 up top in lulu , a 4 normally in the crops but sized up in order to better accommodate my bust ( 32C/34B ) . This bra is so cute and comfortable on . It is suitable for all activities that are n't high impact . It 's not super tight fitting and is very lightweight and therefore I feel like I can breathe in it . Easy to get on and off which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or if you have DOMS and you ca n't lift your arms above your head . I find it looks a lot better and does n't tend to ride up at the back if the inserts are in , even though the inserts move when putting the bra on and then require adjustment so you do n't look lumpy . This is kind of annoying and as someone suggested it 'd be a good idea for the inserts to be anchored with a couple of stitches . The wide and constantly updated range of colours means that everyone should be able to find at least one colour they like . It is a little low cut at the front which looks good when upright but beware if you 're bending over as you may then need to readjust . <p> Date published : 2014-09-11 <p> Rated 4 out of 5 by chickadee from cute strapsI like the cute straps on this bra , however I have trouble with sizing .

Recently I tried the Nike Rival 6-inch running short too and they were good but like the Adidas , are a discontinued line . So as a runner who enjoys running in longer shorts so they do n't ride up and end up under my armpits , I 've been frustrated by the sheer lack of long running shorts available ... until now , I think . I was a Groovy Run Short fan for my gym workouts , but could n't run in these - too uncomfortable and I 'd get the ' ride up ' problem . But after reading some reviews , mainly on the USA LLL site where there are heaps more I thought I 'd give these a whirl . Today was the test run day for these shorts and I really liked them .

@@3188404 <p> Rated 2 out of 5 by Yass from Devastatingly SweatyI bought a pair of these in the most incredible navy blue ( and the crop version in black ) and they are the most comfortable , beautifully designed pants I own ... they are also the most unforgiving and mortifying if I forget to pair them with a loooooong T or singlet . They have zero sweat-wicking ability and from the minute I step into the gym I suffer from mortifying sweat patches . Worst of all it takes forever to dry and the black crops dry uneven so even when it is dry , it 's still patchy . Please do not underestimate my review .

They fit really well when I tried them on ( the staff member fit me to the size I purchased ) . I 've had no issues with pilling since my purchase , however I have had issues with stretch .

It 's not a good look having to hike up your pants every 5 minutes , and it can get frustrating during a gym session . If you 'd not about this life , I 'd suggest looking at another pair of tights .

For the first few wears , they were magnificent . They fit like a glove , and true to their name , held shape in the areas that count . The external stitch detail creates the illusion of length ( which helps , for a little 160cm person like me ! ) But after a few more wears , and one super gentle hand wash according to the instructions ..... I feel a little dismay and disappointment , as if the wondrous shine and promises have been let down : ( Similar to the previous review , the external overlocked stitch detail is an absolute MAGNET for pilling .

Because the body is longer and the general style of the jacket is quite bulky , it also bunched and pulled up at the front as you move or sit ( keeping in mind I only had this on for 5-10 mins ) .

Despite all the negative reviews , I decided to check it out anyway . I was especially curious to compare it with my scuba 2 hoodies . I tried it on in the shop .

I liked that the 3 was longer and was easier to move in . Front of the jumper ( Lulu logo shape that frames the front ) : scuba2-two layers of fleece fabric , scuba3- fleece in front and thin lining on the reverse side ( maybe that 's why it does n't feel as warm ) Ribbed fabric panels on the sides : s2-double layered , s3- single layer ( maybe that 's why stretches out easily , and is n't as warm ) Hood : 2 - fits nicely around the head , double layer cotton fleece , nice logo embroidery ; 3- looks like a helmet when you have it on , thin fabric lining on the inside , logo embroidery is less prominent , which is ok , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sleeves in both are barely long enough for my long arms if I want to use the thumb holes . Dear lulu please do n't make them any shorter ! Cotton fleece fabric : visibly thinner on the scuba 3 ( I put two sleeves together to compare ) . Scuba 2 feels more solid , that 's for sure . I will keep my one in pretty blue-ish-grey Gris colour . Really love this colour ! Would definitely repurchase this hoodie in other colours if double fleece fabric in front comes back , as well as the double layer ribbed fabric on the sides . Do n't mind the hood being lighter , but would like to see the old shape back thought . P.S.Fingers crossed this new cotton fleece washes as well as the old one .

Never liked Scuba I and II because the material was so stiff/bulky . You could put it on the floor and it 'd stand up on its own ! Tried on a 4 in-store ... way too tiny ( even though I 've always been a 4 in tops ( except tanks ) . Saw this one in WMTM , read all the reviews , and went for a 6 in hero/blue .

The overall fit on me is slim not bulky , arms are spacious enough not ' skin tight ' . The hood is more relaxed than earlier models which stood stiff on the neck like a 2nd head . The Lulu logo is too large in my view but on this hero/blue patterned color the stitching is dark blue so it hardly shows . Complaint : do n't like the turquoise blue lining which , when the zipper is part open , really detracts from the hero blue color/pattern around the neck . Indigo blue lining would 've looked more classy . It 's a small complaint . Have n't washed it yet , will wait to see if , as others have mentioned , pilling will reveal its ugly head , and dark patterned Luon will fade . Finally , Sz6 seems to be the new 4 !
