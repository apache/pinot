Earth 's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen , 21% oxygen , and 1% other gases . Carbon dioxide accounts for just 0.03 - 0.04% . Water vapour , varying in amount from 0 to 2% , carbon dioxide and some other minor gases present in the atmosphere absorb some of the thermal radiation leaving the surface and emit radiation from much higher and colder levels out to space . These radiatively active gases are known as greenhouse gases because they act as a partial blanket for the thermal radiation from the surface and enable it to be substantially warmer than it would otherwise be , analogous to the effect of a greenhouse . This blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse effect . Without the greenhouse gases , Earth 's average temperature would be roughly -20-C .

There are also a few other , highly specialized uses . These programs recycle halon through " halon banks " coordinated by the Halon Recycling Corporation to ensure that discharge to the atmosphere occurs only in a genuine emergency and to conserve remaining stocks . <h> Development of alternatives for CFCs <p> Work on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to stratospheric ozone were published .

Nevertheless , a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted . Later alternatives lacking the chlorine , the hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere . One of these compounds , HFC-134a , is now used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners . Hydrocarbon refrigerants ( a propane/isobutane blend ) are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia , the USA and many other countries , as they have excellent thermodynamic properties and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures .

Freon represents several different chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , which are used in commerce and industry .

They are well-suited for these and other applications because they are nontoxic and nonflammable and can be readily converted from a liquid to a gas and vice versa . <p> CFCs have been found to pose a serious environmental threat . Studies undertaken by various scientists during the 1970s revealed that CFCs released into the atmosphere accumulate in the stratosphere , where they had a deleterious effect on the ozone layer .

Although emissions of CFCs around the developed world have largely ceased due to international control agreements , the damage to the stratospheric ozone layer will continue well into the 21st century . <p> In 1978 The Montreal Protocol was adopted as a framework for international cooperation regarding CFC control on the basis of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer . 127993 @qwx987993

Aerosols ( sulfate particles , soot ) could have a cooling effect . Contrails formed due to the emission of particles and water vapor can increase the cloud cover in the upper troposphere . This may result in a cooling or heating depending on the size and optical depth of the ice crystals of which the contrails consist . Presently it is believed that contrails lead to a net warming effect . There may be changes in ( non-contrail ) upper level clouds : Most contrails decay after minutes to hours , but some continue to exist and are then not distinguishable from natural cirrus clouds . <p> Schematic based on DLR German Aerospace Center graphic and text <p> Schematic of aerosol and contrail formation processes in an aircraft plume and wake as a function of plume age and temperature .

Soot particles become chemically activated by adsorption and binary heterogeneous nucleation of SO3 and H2SO4 in the presence of H2O , leading to the formation of a partial liquid H2SO4/H2O coating . Upon further cooling , volatile liquid H2SO4/H2O droplets are formed by binary homogeneous nucleation , whereby the chemi-ions act as preferred nucleation centers . These aerosols grow in size by condensation and coagulation processes . Coagulation between volatile particles and soot enhances the coating and forms a mixed H2SO4/H2O-soot aerosol , which is eventually scavenged by background aerosol particles at longer times . If liquid H2O saturation is reached in the plume , a contrail forms . Ice particles are created in the contrail mainly by freezing of exhaust aerosols . Scavenging of exhaust particles and further deposition of H2O leads to an increase of the ice mass . The contrail persists in ice-supersaturated air and may develop into a cirrus cloud . Short-lived and persistent contrails return residual particles into the atmosphere upon evaporation .

The stratosphere comprises Earth 's atmosphere from about 9 to 25 miles ( about 15 to 40 kilometers ) altitude and includes the ozone layer . <p> Arctic polar stratospheric clouds <p> " Polar stratospheric clouds provide a ' double-whammy ' to stratospheric ozone .

The main conclusion of our study is that if this trend continues , Arctic clouds will remain longer in the stratosphere in the future , " Tabazadeh said . " An ozone hole forms every spring over the Antarctic in the Southern Hemisphere which is colder than the Arctic , " said Tabazadeh . " The Arctic has been getting colder and is becoming more like the Antarctic ; this could lead to more dramatic ozone loss in the future over the Northern Hemisphere , where many people live . " <p> NASA 's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite <p> Researchers used data from NASA 's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite to analyze cloud data from both the north and south polar regions for the study .

As a result , the chlorine concentration in the upper atmosphere is already starting to decline , according to Tabazadeh . " Scientists used to believe that as chlorine levels decline in the upper atmosphere , the ozone layer should slowly start to recover . However , greenhouse gas emissions , which provide warming at the Earth 's surface , lead to cooling in the upper atmosphere . This cooling promotes formation of the kind of polar stratospheric clouds that contribute to ozone loss , " she added .

What those readings mean for the remainder of the year is unclear . But what they mean for the long-term is that the recovery from human-induced ozone depletion is an uneven climb . <p> These maps of ozone concentrations over the Arctic come from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument ( OMI ) on NASA 's Aura satellite . The left image shows January 1 to March 23 , 2010 , and the right shows the same dates in 2011 .

During the first half of March there were several days with record-low temperatures in the stratosphere at altitudes of about 20 km , and the cold period continued for the entire month . This led to sustained low ozone values over the polar region . <p> The area with low ozone over the North Pole was observed by several satellite sensors , e.g. SCIAMACHY on the EnviSat satellite , and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI on EOS-Aura .

In contrast , the previous years 2009 and 2010 showed an early so-called stratospheric warming in January and mid-February . Temperatures in the stratosphere in the first half of March this year were low enough for polar stratospheric clouds to form . In these clouds chlorine compounds are formed from CFCs which break down ozone over the North Pole when sunlight is present . In addition to the cold temperatures , the transport of ozone-rich air from the tropics was reduced this year because of the strong winds around the North Pole at 20km altitude . <p> The ozone layer over the North Pole nevertheless has a thickness of more than 250 Dobson units ( a unit expressing the number of molecules ozone per square meter ) .

A certain amount of ozone is also produced in the troposphere in a chain of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing gases . Though ozone is a minor atmospheric constituent , with an average concentration of about 3 parts per million volume ( ppmv ) , the radiation properties of this greenhouse gas make it a significant contributor to the radiative energy balance of the atmosphere , and an important regulator of the ultraviolet solar radiation received at the Earth 's surface .

Measurements of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone are used for the verification of models that simulate the photochemistry or general circulation of the real atmosphere . Ozone is also measured to determine attenuation of the ozone layer by man.made gases , to validate model estimations of changes in ozone and to confirm the efficiency of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer and its Amendments .

This fact sheet provides a quick overview of the major health problems linked to overexposure to UV radiation : <h> Skin Cancer <p> The incidence of skin cancer in the United States has reached epidemic proportions . One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime , and one American dies every hour from this devastating disease . Medical research is helping us understand the causes and effects of skin cancer . Many health and education groups are working to reduce the incidence of this disease , of which 1.3 million cases have been predicted for 2000 alone , according to The American Cancer Society . <h> Melanoma <p> Melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer , is also one of the fastest growing types of cancer in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunburns and melanoma later in life . Melanoma cases in this country have more than doubled in the past 2 decades , and the rise is expected to continue . <h> Nonmelanoma Skin Cancers <p> Nonmelanoma skin cancers are less deadly than melanomas . Nevertheless , left untreated , they can spread , causing disfigurement and more serious health problems . More than 1.2 million Americans will develop nonmelanoma skin cancer in 2000 while more than 1,900 will die from the disease . There are two primary types of nonmelanoma skin cancers . These two cancers have a cure rate as high as 95 percent if detected and treated early . The key is to watch for signs and seek medical treatment . <p> Basal Cell Carcinomas are the most common type of skin cancer tumors . They usually appear as small , fleshy bumps or nodules on the head and neck , but can occur on other skin areas . Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly , and rarely spreads to other parts of the body . It can , however , penetrate to the bone and cause considerable damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nodules or as red , scaly patches . This cancer can develop into large masses , and unlike basal cell carcinoma , it can spread to other parts of the body . <h> Other Skin Damage <p> Other UV-related skin disorders include actinic keratoses and premature aging of the skin . Actinic keratoses are skin growths that occur on body areas exposed to the sun . The face , hands , forearms , and the " V " of the neck are especially susceptible to this type of lesion . Although premalignant , actinic keratoses are a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma . Look for raised , reddish , rough-textured growths and seek prompt medical attention if you discover them . Chronic exposure to the sun also causes premature aging , which over time can make the skin become thick , wrinkled , and leathery . Since it occurs gradually , often manifesting itself many years after the majority of a person 's sun exposure , premature aging is often regarded as an unavoidable , normal part of growing older .

Large increases in UV-B associated with the AOH have been measured with increases in UV-B at 297 nm of up to 38 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported significant increases in sunburns during the spring of 1999 on days with low ozone because of the AOH . <p> Methods : A surveillance of skin cancers occurring from 1987 to 2000 was performed . Age , sex , location , type of skin cancer and skin phototype were recorded . A Brewer Spectrophotometer was used in order to obtain in situ measurements of ozone and UV-B . Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) was used in order to establish pre-ozone hole climatology . <p> Results : Ozone levels as low as 145 DU ( Dobson Units ) were recorded , a 56% decrease in ozone , and UV-B levels up to 4.947 J/m2 . These levels are close to summertime levels at mid latitudes . For the 14-year period - from 1987 to 2000 - 173 cases of skin cancer were diagnosed , 65 during the first 7 years , 108 during the second , an increase of 66% . Cutaneous malignant melanoma ( CMM ) , 19% of the cases , increased by 56% , raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) , 81% of the total , increased the rate from 5.43 to 7.94 per 100 000 ( P &lt; 0.05 ) , a 46% increase . Patients with CMM and NMSC had skin phototypes I-II in 59% and 54% of cases , respectively . Days with more than 25% ozone loss occurred in 143 days during the last 20 springs . Significant increases of UV-B were observed under ozone hole conditions , especially around 300 nm , the most carcinogenic wavelengths . <p> Conclusions : Highly unusual ozone loss and UV-B increases have occurred in the Punta Arenas area over the past two decades resulting in the non-photoadapted population being repeatedly exposed to an altered solar UV spectrum with a greater effectiveness for erythema and photocarcinogenesis . This phenomenon has not previously been reported over other populated areas and an additional increase in the skin cancer rate attributable to the Antarctic ozone hole may be occurring . Research on the clinical and subclinical impact of these abnormalities is urgently needed . 
@@107018897 @2418897/ <p> for their work in atmospheric chemistry , particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone . <h> The ozone layer - The Achilles heel of the biosphere <p> The atmosphere surrounding the earth contains small quantities of ozone - a gas with molecules consisting of three oxygen atoms ( O3 ) . If all the ozone in the atmosphere were compressed to a pressure corresponding to that at the earth 's surface , the layer would be only 3 mm thick . But even though ozone occurs in such small quantities , it plays an exceptionally fundamental part in life on earth . This is because ozone , together with ordinary molecular oxygen ( O2 ) , is able to absorb the major part of the sun 's ultraviolet radiation and therefore prevent this dangerous radiation from reaching the surface . Without a protective ozone layer in the atmosphere , animals and plants could not exist , at least upon land . It is therefore of the greatest importance to understand the processes that regulate the atmosphere 's ozone content . <p> Paul Crutzen , Mario Molina and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone is formed and decomposes through chemical processes in the atmosphere . Most importantly , they have in this way showed how sensitive the ozone layer is to the influence of anthropogenic emissions of certain compounds . The thin ozone layer has proved to be an Achilles heel that may be seriously injured by apparently moderate changes in the composition of the atmosphere . By explaining the chemical mechanisms that affect the thickness of the ozone layer , the three researchers have contributed to our salvation from a global environmental problem that could have catastrophic consequences . <p> How this knowledge evolved Ozone is formed in the atmosphere through the splitting of ordinary oxygen molecules ( O2 ) by ultra-violet radiation from the sun . The oxygen atoms thereby liberated react with the molecular oxygen according to : <p> O2+ uv-light -&gt; 2O O+O2+M -&gt; O3+M <p> where M is a random air molecule ( N2 or O2 ) . <p> The English physicist Sidney Chapman formulated in 1930 the first photochemical theory for the formation and decomposition of ozone in the atmosphere . This theory , which describes how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , explains why the highest contents of ozone occur in the layer between 15 and 50 km , termed the ozone layer ( Fig. 1 ) . Later measurements , however , showed appreciable deviations from Chapman 's theory . The calculated ozone contents were considerably higher than the observed ones . Thus , there must be other chemical reactions contributing to the reduction of the ozone content . Some years later the Belgian Marcel Nicolet contributed important knowledge of how the decomposition of ozone was enhanced by the presence of the hydrogen radicals OH and HO2 . <p> Fig. 1 . Variation in temperature and ozone concentration up through the atmosphere <p> The scientist to take the next fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of the chemistry of the ozone layer was Paul Crutzen . In 1970 he showed that the nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 react catalytically ( without themselves being consumed ) with ozone , thus accelerating the rate of reduction of the ozone content . <p> These nitrogen oxides are formed in the atmosphere through the decay of the chemically stable nitrous oxide N2O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection demonstrated by Crutzen between microorganisms in the soil and the thickness of the ozone layer is one of the motives for the recent rapid development of research on global biogeochemical cycles . <p> The first threat noted : supersonic aircraft The power of nitrogen oxides to decompose ozone was also noted early by the American researcher Harold Johnston , who carried out extensive laboratory studies of the chemistry of nitrogen compounds . In 1971 he pointed out the possible threat to the ozone layer that the planned fleet of supersonic aircraft and supersonic travel ( SST ) might represent . These aircraft would be capable of releasing nitrogen oxides right in the middle of the ozone layer at altitudes of 20 km . Crutzen 's and Johnston 's work gave rise to a very intensive debate among researchers as well as among technologists and decision-makers . This was also the start of intensive research into the chemistry of the atmosphere which has made great progress during the past several years . ( The subsequent cancellation of plans for a large SST fleet had other reasons than the environmental risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ozone layer The next leap in our knowledge of ozone chemistry was in 1974 , when Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland published their widely noted Nature article on the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) gases - " freons " - used in spray bottles , as the cooling medium in refrigerators and elsewhere and plastic foams . Molina and Rowland based their conclusions on two important contributions by other researchers : - James Lovelock ( England ) had recently developed a highly sensitive device of measuring extremely low organic gas contents in the atmosphere , the electron capture detector . Using this he could now demonstrate that the exclusively man-made , chemically inert , CFC gases had already spread globally throughout the atmosphere . - Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone ( USA ) had shown that free chlorine atoms in the atmosphere can decompose ozone catalytically in similar ways as nitrogen oxides do . <p> Molina and Rowland realised that the chemically inert CFC could gradually be transported up to the ozone layer , there to be met by such intensive ultra-violet light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms . They calculated that if human use of CFC gases was to continue at an unaltered rate the ozone layer would be depleted by many percent after some decades . Their prediction created an enormous attention . For the CFC gases were used in many technical processes and their very chemical stability and non-toxicity were thought to render them environmentally ideal . Many were critical of Molina 's and Rowland 's calculations but yet more were seriously concerned by the possibility of a depleted ozone layer . Today we know that they were right in all essentials . It was to turn out that they had even underestimated the risk . <p> Ozone content over AntarcticaMolina 's and Rowland 's report led to certain restrictions on CFC release during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Not until 1985 , when the real shock came , was there any real urgency in the international negotiations on release restrictions . Then the Englishman Joseph Farman and his colleagues noted a drastic depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic , the " ozone hole " ( Fig. 2 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than expected from earlier calculations of the CFC effect . The debate among researchers now intensified . Was this a natural climatic variation or was it chemical decomposition brought about by mankind ? Thanks to pioneering research by many researchers , among them Crutzen , Molina and Rowland , as well as Susan Solomon and James Anderson , both from the USA , the picture has now cleared . The depletion is caused chiefly by ozone reacting chemically with chlorine and bromine from industrially manufactured gases . <p> Fig 2 . Thickness of the ozone layer ( mean monthly value for October ) over Halley Bay , Antarctica . Note the drastic depletion since the end of the 1970s . <p> The surprisingly rapid depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica could not be explained by transport processes or by gas phase chemical reactions . An alternative mechanism must exist which could accelerate the decomposition of ozone . Crutzen and colleagues identified this mechanism as chemical reactions on the surface of cloud particles in the stratosphere . Thus , the Antarctic ozone depletion appears to be connected with the extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nitric acid to form " polar stratospheric clouds " ( PSCs ) . The ozone-decomposing chemical reactions are greatly reinforced by the presence of cloud particles . This understanding has led to an exciting new branch of atmospheric chemistry : " heterogeneous " chemical reactions on particle surfaces . <p> The ozone layer and the climateThe ozone problem also has interesting connections with the issue of how mankind is affecting the climate . Ozone , like carbon dioxide and methane , is a greenhouse gas that contributes to high temperatures at the surface of the earth . ( CFC gases have a similar effect ) . Model calculations have shown that the climate is specially sensitive to changes in the ozone content in the lower layers , the troposphere . Here the ozone content has increased markedly during the past century , chiefly because of the release of nitric oxide , carbon monoxide and gaseous hydrocarbons from vehicles and industrial processes and from the combustion of biomass in the tropics . The elevated ozone content in lower atmospheric layers is itself an environmental problem for the damage it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the world 's leading researcher in mapping the chemical mechanisms that determine the ozone content at these levels . <p> What can we expect in the future ? Thanks to our good scientific understanding of the ozone problem - and very largely to Crutzen , Molina and Rowland - it has been possible to make far-reaching decisions on prohibiting the release of gases that destroy ozone . A protocol on the protection of the ozone layer was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations and signed in Montreal , Canada , in 1987 . Under the latest tightening-up of the Montreal Protocol , the most dangerous gases will be totally banned from 1996 ( developing countries have a few years ' grace to introduce substitutes that do not harm the ozone layer ) . Since it takes some time for the ozone-destroying gases to reach the ozone layer we must expect the depletion , not only over Antarctica but also over parts of the Northern Hemisphere , to worsen for some years to come . Given compliance with the prohibitions , the ozone layer should gradually begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Yet it will take at least 100 years before it has fully recovered . <p> Fig 3 .

Lower stratosphere temperatures in the winter and spring of 2001 over the Antarctic region were below average values , and were sufficiently low for ozone production of polar stratospheric clouds within the polar vortex . The ozone hole area and the PSC area were again among the largest of all previous years . For the year 2001 , the ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere polar vortex persisted into December , again among the longest duration of years since 1982 . <p> Observations of chloroflourocarbons and of stratospheric hydrogen chloride support the view that international actions are reducing the use and release of ozone depleting substances .

However , an intriguing aspect of recent observations of the Antarctic stratosphere is the apparent trend towards a later breakup of the vortex . A full explanation of such meteorological anomalies is not yet available .

In the near future ( barring unusual events such as explosive volcanic eruptions ) the severity of the ozone hole will likely remain similar to what has been seen in recent years with year-to-year differences associated with meteorological variability .

There is no protection for the planet from this fate . <p> Gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) pose one of the greatest mysteries of modern astronomy . About once a day , the sky lights up with a spectacular flash , or burst , of gamma-rays . More often than not , this burst out shines all of the other sources of cosmic gamma-rays added together .

It reached this maximum extent unusually early , as the hole is normally largest in late September . Minimum ozone values were measured in early October and were amongst the lowest on record . The edge of the ozone hole passed over the tip of South America and the Falkland Islands for significant periods between October 6 and 24 . The hole also closed in unusually early and the event was essentially over by early December . This early closure of the hole is probably linked with the QBO/ENSO and in retrospect was to be expected . <p> Satellite imagery gives a global perspective on the ozone hole . TOVS and TOMS currently have significantly different calibrations , with TOVS reading some 30 DU higher than TOMS . TOMS values are close to ground-based values . Stratospheric clouds were sighted from Vernadsky , Rothera and Halley . A mini ozone hole , with central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Antarctic Peninsula over the Weddell Sea during July . This mini ozone hole probably formed due to processing of ozone through PSCs , which are far enough north to be sunlit . The feature was particularly marked on July 10 and again on July 20 . <p> Ozone values over the Arctic are normally at their lowest in September and 2000 was no exception as can be see from the TOMS images . Although the values were low , they were low because of stratospheric dynamics and not chemistry . The temperature in the Arctic ozone layer was above " 55 -C , far too warm for stratospheric clouds to form . Hence there was no chemical depletion taking place and no ozone hole above the Arctic . In mid October there were regions of low ozone over Siberia . Stratospheric temperatures in this area were generally above " 65 -C , so again these features had a dynamic , not chemical origin . The temperature of the Arctic stratosphere did fall below the threshold for PSC formation at times in small regions during 2001 January and February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arctic , and in mid February values below 250 DU were recorded by TOMS over a small area of northwest Europe . Ozone values are currently high over most northern temperate and polar latitudes . <p> 7 September 2000- Japan 's Meteorological Agency on Tuesday September 5 said the size of the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic is at its largest ever -- more than twice the size of the surface of the Antarctic -- due to low temperatures beneath the stratosphere . The hole was estimated to be 28.4 million square kilometers on Sunday , larger than the previous worst record of 27 million sq . km in 1998 , agency officials said . <p> The ozone layer does a remarkable job of absorbing ultraviolet radiation . In the absence of this gaseous shield in the stratosphere , the harmful radiation has a perfect portal through which to strike Earth . This biologically damaging , high-energy radiation can cause skin cancer , injure eyes , harm the immune system , and upset the fragile balance of an entire ecosystem . <p> NASA Press Release <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrometer has detected an Antarctic ozone " hole " ( what scientists call an " ozone depletion area " ) that is three times larger than the entire land mass of the United States - the largest such area ever observed . The " hole " expanded to a record size of approximately 11.5 million square miles ( 30.3 million square kilometers ) on Sept. 3 , 2000 . The previous record was approximately 10.5 million square miles ( 28.2 million square km ) on Sept. 19 , 1998 . The ozone hole 's size currently has stabilized , but the low levels in its interior continue to fall . The lowest readings in the ozone hole are typically observed in late September or early October each year . " These observations reinforce concerns about the frailty of Earth 's ozone layer . Although production of ozone-destroying gases has been curtailed under international agreements , concentrations of the gases in the stratosphere are only now reaching their peak . Due to their long persistence in the atmosphere , it will be many decades before the ozone hole is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manager of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program , NASA Headquarters , Washington , DC . Ozone molecules , made up of three atoms of oxygen , comprise a thin layer of the atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun . Most atmospheric ozone is found between approximately six miles ( 9.5 km ) and 18 miles ( 29 km ) above the Earth 's surface . Scientists continuing to investigate this enormous hole are somewhat surprised by its size . The reasons behind the dimensions involve both early-spring conditions , and an extremely intense Antarctic vortex . The Antarctic vortex is an upper-altitude stratospheric air current that sweeps around the Antarctic continent , confining the Antarctic ozone hole . " Variations in the size of the ozone hole and of ozone depletion accompanying it from one year to the next are not unexpected , " said Dr. Jack Kaye , Office of Earth Sciences Research Director , NASA Headquarters .

" The measurements released today were obtained using the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) instrument aboard NASA 's Earth Probe ( TOMS-EP ) satellite . NASA instruments have been measuring Antarctic ozone levels since the early 1970s . Since the discovery of the ozone " hole " in 1985 , TOMS has been a key instrument for monitoring ozone levels over the Earth . <p> Environment Canada Southern Hemisphere Ozone Map September 3,2000 <p> NOAA 2000-072 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact : Barbara McGehan 10/5/00 <p> OZONE HOLE EARLIER , BUT NOT DEEPER IN 2000 <p> Scientists from the Commerce Department 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report that measurements of this year 's ozone hole at the South Pole show that ozone depletion occurred earlier there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The ozone hole , a region of ozone depletion over Antarctica , is the result of complex chemical and meteorological processes that occur in the stratosphere . <p> Using instrumented balloons to take vertical profiles of the ozone at the South Pole , researchers from NOAA 's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory located in Boulder , Colorado , reported that the September decline in ozone occurred about six days earlier than in any previous year and , as observed in other recent years , ozone was totally destroyed between about 9 and 13 miles altitude . Total column ozone reached the minimum reading of 98 Dobson units on September 29 , compared to 90 Dobson units in 1999 . The record low of 88 Dobson units was observed in 1993 . A Dobson unit is a unit of measurement that describes the thickness of the ozone layer in a column directly above the location being measured . Prior to the springtime period in Antarctica , when ozone depletion occurs , the normal Dobson unit reading is around 275 . <p> Another measure of the severity of the ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ozone hole are made at NOAA 's Climate Prediction Center by analysis of measurements made by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet ( SBUV/2 ) instruments on NOAA 's Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites operated by NOAA 's National Environmental Satellite , Data , and Information Service . Satellite data show the ozone hole area was over 27 million square kilometers for three days in early September , peaking at 28.5 million square kilometers . " This is the largest geographical size on record and comparable to the area of North America " , said Lawrence Flynn , a physical scientist at NESDIS . The ozone hole is defined as the size of the region with total ozone below 220 Dobson units . NASA released similar measurements using the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) aboard NASA 's Earth Probe ( TOMS-EP ) satellite . NOAA and NASA satellites have been measuring Antarctic ozone levels for almost 30 years . Continued monitoring by satellite instruments over the next two months will establish how long-lived the current year 's ozone hole will be . <p> " Even though the geographical size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ozone depleted earlier than ever , the severity of the ozone depletion within the hole reached about the same levels as the past few years , " said David Hofmann , director of CMDL . " Year-to-year fluctuations in the geographical size of the ozone hole and the timing of the ozone reduction are believed to be related to meteorological factors such as temperature and winds , rather than further increases in ozone-destroying chemicals in the atmosphere , " Hofmann said . <p> Each spring when the sun rises over Antarctica , chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine from man-made CFCs ( chlororfluorocarbons ) and bromine-containing compounds , occur in the stratosphere destroying ozone and causing the " ozone hole . " The global ozone layer has also deteriorated since 1980 but not to the extent that is observed each spring in Antarctica . An international assessment of the status of the global ozone layer , produced by hundreds of scientists for the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Program in 1998 , indicated that the amount of chlorine in the stratosphere from CFCs should soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and subsequent amendments . <p> The amount of chlorine in the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth was measured by CMDL to have begun declining already in 1994 . The thinning of the ozone layer is a matter of concern because the ozone layer protects the Earth from the harmful effects of the sun 's ultraviolet radiation , which affects life on Earth and contributes to skin cancer and cataracts in humans . <p> Hofmann says that " since chlorine in the atmosphere has reached nearly constant levels , annual variations in temperature , which affect the rate of the chemical reactions , will be the dominant factor in determining differences in the magnitude of the ozone hole . Total recovery of the ozone hole back to levels observed before 1980 will take at least 50 years , and expected changes in climate , including a cooler stratosphere , could cause a delay in the recovery of the ozone layer .

In late August , New Zealand experienced ozone values about 25% below pre-ozone hole norms for four days , and in early September they had values up to 20% below norms for three days .

My father was a lawyer ; he had a private practice , but he also taught at the National University of Mexico ( Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico ( UNAM ) ) . In his later years , after I had left Mexico , he served as Mexican Ambassador to Ethiopia , Australia and the Philippines . <p> I attended elementary school and high school in Mexico City . I was already fascinated by science before entering high school ; I still remember my excitement when I first glanced at paramecia and amoebae through a rather primitive toy microscope . I then converted a bathroom , seldom used by the family , into a laboratory and spent hours playing with chemistry sets . With the help of an aunt , Esther Molina , who was a chemist , I continued with more challenging experiments along the lines of those carried out by freshman chemistry students in college . Keeping with our family tradition of sending their children abroad for a couple of years , and aware of my interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland when I was 11 years old , on the assumption that German was an important language for a prospective chemist to learn . I remember I was thrilled to go to Europe , but then I was disappointed in that my European schoolmates had no more interest in science than my Mexican friends . I had already decided at that time to become a research chemist ; earlier , I had seriously contemplated the possibility of pursuing a career in music - I used to play the violin in those days . In 1960 , I enrolled in the chemical engineering program at UNAM , as this was then the closest way to become a physical chemist , taking math-oriented courses not available to chemistry majors . <p> After finishing my undergraduate studies in Mexico , I decided to obtain a Ph.D . degree in physical chemistry . This was not an easy task ; although my training in chemical engineering was good , it was weak in mathematics , physics , as well as in various areas of basic physical chemistry - subjects such as quantum mechanics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to Germany and enrolled at the University of Freiburg . After spending nearly two years doing research in kinetics of polymerizations , I realized that I wanted to have time to study various basic subjects in order to broaden my background and to explore other research areas . Thus , I decided to seek admission to a graduate program in the United States . While pondering my future plans , I spent several months in Paris , where I was able to study mathematics on my own and I also had a wonderful time discussing all sorts of topics , ranging from politics , philosophy , to the arts , etc. , with many good friends . Subsequently , I returned to Mexico as an Assistant Professor at the UNAM and I set up the first graduate program in chemical engineering . Finally , in 1968 I left for the University of California at Berkeley to pursue my graduate studies in physical chemistry . <p> During my first year at Berkeley , I took courses in physics and mathematics , in addition to the required courses in physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George C. Pimentel , with the goal of studying molecular dynamics using chemical lasers , which were discovered in his group a few years earlier . It was also at that time that I met Luisa Tan , who was a fellow graduate student in Pimentel 's group and who later became my wife and close scientific collaborator . <p> George Pimentel was also a pioneer in the development of matrix isolation techniques , which is widely used in the study of the molecular structure and bonding of transient species . He was an excellent teacher and a wonderful mentor ; his warmth , enthusiasm , and encouragement provided me with inspiration to pursue important scientific questions . <p> My graduate work involved the investigation of the distribution of internal energy in the products of chemical and photochemical reactions ; chemical lasers were well suited as tools for such studies . At the beginning I had little experience with the experimental techniques required for my research , such as handling vacuum lines , infrared optics , electronic instrumentation , etc . I learned much of this from my colleague and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . Eventually I became confident enough to generate original results on my own : my earliest achievement consisted of explaining some features in the laser signals - that at first sight appeared to be noise - as " relaxation oscillations , " predictable from the fundamental equations of laser emission . <p> My years at Berkeley have been some of the best of my life . I arrived there just after the era of the free-speech movement . I had the opportunity to explore many areas and to engage in exciting scientific research in an intellectually stimulating environment . It was also during this time that I had my first experience dealing with the impact of science and technology on society . I remember that I was dismayed by the fact that high-power chemical lasers were being developed elsewhere as weapons ; I wanted to be involved with research that was useful to society , but not for potentially harmful purposes . <p> After completing my Ph.D . degree in 1972 , I stayed for another year at Berkeley to continue research on chemical dynamics . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Professor F. Sherwood ( Sherry ) Rowland as a postdoctoral fellow , moving to Irvine , California , with Luisa ; we married in July of that year . Sherry had pioneered research on " hot atom " chemistry , investigating chemical properties of atoms with excess translational energy and produced by radioactive processes . Sherry offered me a list of research options : the one project that intrigued me the most consisted of finding out the environmental fate of certain very inert industrial chemicals - the chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) - which had been accumulating in the atmosphere , and which at that time were thought to have no significant effects on the environment . This project offered me the opportunity to learn a new fieldatmospheric chemistry-about which I knew very little ; trying to solve a challenging problem appeared to be an excellent way to plunge into a new research area . The CFCs are compounds similar to others that Sherry and I had investigated from the point of view of molecular dynamics ; we were familiar with their chemical properties , but not with their atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherry and I developed the " CFC-ozone depletion theory . " At first the research did not seem to be particularly interesting - I carried out a systematic search for processes that might destroy the CFCs in the lower atmosphere , but nothing appeared to affect them . We knew , however , that they would eventually drift to sufficiently high altitudes to be destroyed by solar radiation . The question was not only what destroys them , but more importantly , what are the consequences . We realized that the chlorine atoms produced by the decomposition of the CFCs would catalytically destroy ozone . We became fully aware of the seriousness of the problem when we compared the industrial amounts of CFCs to the amounts of nitrogen oxides which control ozone levels ; the role of these catalysts of natural origin had been established a few years earlier by Paul Crutzen . We were alarmed at the possibility that the continued release of CFCs into the atmosphere would cause a significant depletion of the Earth 's stratospheric ozone layer . Sherry and I decided to exchange information with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confer with Professor Harold Johnston , whose work on the impact of the release of nitrogen oxides from the proposed supersonic transport ( SST ) aircraft on the stratospheric ozone layer was well known to us . Johnston informed us that months earlier Ralph Cicerone and Richard Stolarski had arrived at similar conclusions concerning the catalytic properties of chlorine atoms in the stratosphere , in connection with the release of hydrogen chloride either from volcanic eruptions or from the ammonium perchlorate fuel planned for the space shuttle . <p> We published our findings in Nature , in a paper which appeared in the June 28 , 1974 issue . The years following the publication of our paper were hectic , as we had decided to communicate the CFC - ozone issue not only to other scientists , but also to policy makers and to the news media ; we realized this was the only way to insure that society would take some measures to alleviate the problem . <p> To me , Sherry Rowland has always been a wonderful mentor and colleague . I cherish my years of association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan . While he was on sabbatical leave in Vienna during the first six months of 1974 , we communicated via mail and telephone . There were many exchanges of mail during this short period of time , which illustrated the frantic pace of our research at that time while we continued to refine our ozone depletion theory . Soon after , Sherry and I published several more articles on the CFC-ozone issue ; we presented our results at scientific meetings and we also testified at legislative hearings on potential controls on CFCs emissions . <p> In 1975 , I was appointed as a member of the faculty at the University of California , Irvine . Although I continued to collaborate with Sherry , as an assistant professor I had to prove that I was capable of ponducting original research on my own . I thus set up an independent program to investigate chemical and spectroscopic properties of compounds of atmospheric importance , focusing on those that are unstable and difficult to handle in the laboratory , such as hypochlorous acid , chlorine nitrite , chlorine nitrate , peroxynitric acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my wife , began collaborating with me , providing invaluable help in carrying out those difficult experiments . We also started then to raise a family : our son , Felipe , was born in 1977 . Initially , Luisa had a teaching and research position at Irvine ; however , after Felipe was born , she decided to work only part-time so that she could devote more time to Felipe . Fortunately for me , she decided to join my research group . Throughout the years , she has been very supportive and understanding of my preoccupation with work and the intense nature of my research . <p> Although my years at Irvine were very productive , I missed not doing experiments myself because of the many responsibilities associated with a faculty position : teaching courses , supervising graduate students , meetings , etc . After spending seven years at Irvine as Assistant and then Associate Professor , I decided to move to a non-academic position .

We were able to show that chlorine-activation reactions take place very efficiently in the presence of ice under polar stratospheric conditions ; thus , we provided a laboratory simulation of the chemical effects of clouds over the Antarctic . Also , in order to understand the rapid catalytic gas phase reactions that were taking place over the South Pole , Luisa and I carried out experiments with chlorine peroxide , a new compound which had not been reported previously in the literature and which turned out to be important in providing the explanation for the rapid loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to academic life , moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where I have continued with research on global atmospheric chemistry issues .

I have also benefited from teaching ; as I try to explain my views to students with critical and open minds , I find myself continually being challenged to go back and rethink ideas . I now see teaching and research as complementary , mutually reinforcing activities . <p> When I first chose the project to investigate the fate of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere , it was simply out of scientific curiosity . I did not consider at that time the environmental consequences of what Sherry and I had set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to do something that not only contributed to our understanding of atmospheric chemistry , but also had a profound impact on the global environment . <p> One of the very rewarding aspects of my work has been the interaction with a superb group of colleagues and friends in the atmospheric sciences community .

I feel that this Nobel Prize represents a recognition for the excellent work that has been done by my colleagues and friends in the atmospheric chemistry community on the stratospheric ozone depletion issue . <p> Addendum , May 2006 My wife is Guadalupe Alvarez ; I am no longer married to Luisa Molina .

This converts chlorine or bromine ( from CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals ) into an active form , so that when there is sunlight , ozone is rapidly destroyed . Without the clouds , there is little or no ozone destruction . Only during the Antarctic winter does the atmosphere get cold enough for these clouds to form widely through the centre of the ozone layer . Elsewhere the atmosphere is just too warm and no clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather ' in the ozone layer , and the net result is that the temperature of the Arctic ozone layer during winter is normally some ten degrees warmer than that of the Antarctic . This means that such clouds are rare , but sometimes the ' weather ' is colder than normal and they do form . Under these circumstances significant ozone depletion can take place over the Arctic , but it is usually for a much shorter period of time and covers a smaller area than in the Antarctic . <p> How long has the Antarctic ozone layer been studied ? Ozone was first measured from British Antarctic stations during the International Geophysical Year of 1957/58 . It was originally studied because of its influence on the temperature structure of the atmosphere , and also as a tracer for the circulation of stratospheric air . In the 1970s , ozone became the focus of attention as a possible indicator of long-term changes in the atmosphere . Scientists realised that ozone might be affected by the increasing concentration in the atmosphere of man-made gases such as nitric oxide and CFCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherwood Rowland received the Nobel prize for this pioneering work . <p> Does the ozone hole affect the rest of the world ? At the moment , catastrophic ozone depletion is only seen in the Antarctic during the spring , but surrounding areas experience lowered ozone levels as the ozone hole decays at the end of the spring . As the ozone hole rotates , it may extend over populated areas for a short while when it is very elongated . For example it covered the tip of South America and the Falkland Islands for over a week in October 1994 ( Fig. 12 ) . <p> Limited ozone depletion can occur above the Arctic , but at present it is confined to parts of the region and only lasts for a few days at a time . If CFC releases had continued at the high rates of the mid 1980s , a continental sized ozone hole might have appeared over the Arctic . Elsewhere in the northern hemisphere , stratospheric ozone amounts over temperate latitudes have fallen by 5 to 10% during the winter . <p> How does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether microbes , plants or animals , contain a complex molecule called DNA which carries the genetic code . This is the set of instructions which describes the structure and biochemistry of an organism . Unfortunately , DNA readily absorbs high-energy UV-B radiation and becomes damaged so that the instructions can not be read properly . If the amount of UV-B entering the cell increases ( as during the ozone hole ) , the risk of damage also increases and may result in malfunction or death of the organism . Some Antarctic organisms such as algae , lichens and mosses also contain a pigment called chlorophyll . This absorbs visible light as the energy source of photosynthesis for making organic compounds . Chlorophyll also absorbs UV-B light so that the system becomes bleached and non-functional . Even enzymes and other proteins are damaged by this high-energy radiation . Living organisms therefore have to protect themselves from UV-B . Humans can cover their skin with artificial sunscreens , but natural protection systems have also evolved . Many microbes , plants and other animals synthesize protective pigments . Our skin cells synthesize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by UV-B radiation ) , and so do Antarctic lichens on rocks near the edge of the polar ice-cap . A variety of suncreen pigments are produced by Antarctic organisms on land , in freshwater and in the sea . That is why exposed , snow-free rocks are often covered with bright orange and yellow lichens . Some lichens and microbes even live inside translucent rocks to shelter from high radiation levels and desiccating winds ! <p> Does the Greenhouse effect cause the ozone hole ? The Greenhouse Effect ( producing global warming ) and ozone depletion are two separate problems , however there are links between them . Warming at the earth 's surface is caused by certain gases in the atmosphere which can trap energy from the sun . An increase in the amount of these gases produces an increase in the surface temperature . The largest increase is in carbon dioxide from burning coal , oil , gas and forests , but other gases such as methane ( from cattle and rice fields ) play a part . A link with ozone depletion is that CFCs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further link is that although the Greenhouse Effect warms the surface , it allows the higher atmosphere , where ozone is present , to cool . This means that more stratospheric clouds may form and so make the ozone hole worse . <p> Even if the problem of ozone depletion is solved , global warming will still remain . It will cause a rise in sea-level and change the regions where crops can be grown . The issue will be harder to tackle than ozone depletion , but is one which concerns everyone on our planet . <p> What is the Montreal Protocol ? The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement which was drawn up in September 1987 . It originally aimed to half the use of CFCs by 1999 . However , reviews of the protocol held in 1990 in London and 1992 in Copenhagen imposed more stringent controls , so that all production of CFCs , CCl4 and halons should cease by the year 2000 . Many countries have even agreed to stop using CFCs before this deadline . Production of other ozone depleting gases is to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ozone hole will not immediately disappear as CFCs are such stable gases that they will remain in the atmosphere for decades after release . <p> Independent reviews by panels of scientist ( eg the UK Stratospheric Ozone Review Group reports ) present conclusive evidence that CFCs are still increasing in the atmosphere and that chlorine from them is also increasing and is responsible for ozone depletion . Thanks to the provisions of the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent amendments the level of ozone depleting gases in the atmosphere will start dropping by the end of the 1990s . <p> Where were CFCs used ? CFCs were used in a wide variety of products . Thanks to public pressure the use of CFCs by the aerosol industry declined rapidly . The other major uses were " foam blowing " for upholstery padding , freezer linings , fast-food cartons , cavity-wall insulation , and as the fluid in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems . CFCs were also used as solvents in industrial and electronic cleaning processes . Halons ( bromo-fluoro-carbons ) were extensively used in fire extinguishing systems . CFCs were introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-flammable and compressible substances . It was their high stability which allowed them to get into the stratosphere where they were broken down to release active chlorine . The two simplest CFCs are CFC11 and 12 which have the chemical formulae CFCl3 and CF2Cl2 . <p> Is the ozone hole recovering ? <p> Some reports in the media suggest that the ozone layer over Antarctica is now recovering . This message is a little confused . Recent measurements at surface monitoring stations show that the loading of ozone destroying chemicals at the surface has been dropping since about 1994 and is now about 6% down on that peak . The stratosphere lags behind the surface by several years and the loading of ozone depleting chemicals in the ozone layer is at or near the peak . Satellite measurements show that the rate of decline in ozone amount in the upper stratosphere is slowing , however the total ozone amount is still declining . The small size of the 2002 ozone hole was nothing to do with any reduction in ozone depleting chemicals and it will be a decade or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering . This assumes that the decline in ozone depleting chemicals continues and that there are no other perturbations to the ozone layer , such as might be caused by a massive volcanic eruption or Tunguska like event . It will be the middle of this century or beyond before the ozone hole ceases to appear over Antarctica . What we saw in 2002 is just one extreme in the natural range of variation in the polar stratosphere and is the equivalent of an extreme in ' stratospheric weather ' . By contrast the ' weather ' in 2003 moved to the opposite extreme and we saw one of the largest ozone holes on record . <p> How can we mend the ozone hole ? The only way to med the ozone hole is to stop releasing CFCs and other ozone depleting gases into the atmosphere . The restrictions of the Montreal Protocol and its extensions are helping to do this . 127993 @qwx987993

Each instrument measures radiation emmitted by the Earth at several different wavelengths . The HIRS channel 9 measures Earth 's emmitted infrared radiation at 9.7 microns ( 10-6 meters ) . This is a " window channel " meaning that the radiation measured by the HIRS instrument is emmited from the earth 's surface ( as opposed to radiation being emmitted at other levels of the earth 's atmosphere ) . The amount of radiation reaching the HIRS instrument is dependant upon how much ozone is in the earth 's atmosphere ( less ozone = more radiation ) . Therefore , the TOVS Total Ozone algorithm uses this channel ( along with information from other HIRS channels ) to estimate the total amount of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere . The greatest contribution of the emmitted radiation occurs in a region between 200 hPa and 30 hPa ( 13km to 27km ) .

To obtain a " total " ozone amount , the TOVS Total Ozone algorithm adjusts the lower stratosphere ozone amount by a climatological amount that is variable with season and latitude . This is in contrast with satellite instruments which measure the amount of backscattered radiation at various ultraviolet wavelengths . Backscattered radiation levels at wavelengths where ozone absorbtion does and does not take place are compared with the same wavelenghts measured directly from the sun to derive a " total ozone " amount in the earth 's atmosphere . This methodology is used by the NASA TOMS and the NOAA SBUV/2 ozone monitoring programs . This methodology provides a truer measure of the total ozone amount in the earth 's atmosphere .

The " ozone hole " is a severe depletion of the ozone layer high above Antarctica . It is primarily caused by human-produced compounds that release chlorine and bromine gases in the stratosphere . <p> " From September 21 to 30 , the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed , at 10.6 million square miles , " said Paul Newman , atmospheric scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md . If the stratospheric weather conditions had been normal , the ozone hole would be expected to reach a size of about 8.9 to 9.3 million square miles , about the surface area of North America . <p> From September 21-30 , 2006 the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , the Antarctic ozone hole was equal to the record single-day largest area of 11.4 million square miles , reached on Sept. 9 , 2000 . Satellite instruments monitor the ozone layer , and we use their data to create the images that depict the amount of ozone . The blue and purple colors are where there is the least ozone , and the greens , yellows , and reds are where there is more ozone . <p> The Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA 's Aura satellite measures the total amount of ozone from the ground to the upper atmosphere over the entire Antarctic continent . This instrument observed a low value of 85 Dobson Units ( DU ) on Oct. 8 , in a region over the East Antarctic ice sheet . Dobson Units are a measure of ozone amounts above a fixed point in the atmosphere . The Ozone Monitoring Instrument was developed by the Netherlands ' Agency for Aerospace Programs , Delft , The Netherlands , and the Finnish Meteorological Institute , Helsinki , Finland . <p> Scientists from NOAA 's Earth System Research Laboratory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly over the South Pole . By Oct. 9 , the total column ozone had plunged to 93 DU from approximately 300 DU in mid-July . More importantly , nearly all of the ozone in the layer between eight and 13 miles above the Earth 's surface had been destroyed . In this critical layer , the instrument measured a record low of only 1.2 DU. , having rapidly plunged from an average non-hole reading of 125 DU in July and August . <p> " These numbers mean the ozone is virtually gone in this layer of the atmosphere , " said David Hofmann , director of the Global Monitoring Division at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory . " The depleted layer has an unusual vertical extent this year , so it appears that the 2006 ozone hole will go down as a record-setter .

NASA 's Aura satellite observed a low value of 85 Dobson Units ( DU ) on Oct. 8 in a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of ozone amounts above a fixed point in the atmosphere . This severe ozone hole resulted from the very high ozone depleting substance levels and the record cold conditions in the Antarctic stratosphere . <p> Observations by Aura 's Microwave Limb Sounder show extremely high levels of ozone destroying chlorine chemicals in the lower stratosphere ( approximately 12.4 miles high ) . These high chlorine values covered the entire Antarctic region in mid to late September . The high chlorine levels were accompanied by extremely low values of ozone . The temperature of the Antarctic stratosphere causes the severity of the ozone hole to vary from year to year . Colder than average temperatures result in larger and deeper ozone holes , while warmer temperatures lead to smaller ones . The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) provided analyses of satellite and balloon stratospheric temperature observations . The temperature readings from NOAA satellites and balloons during late-September 2006 showed the lower stratosphere at the rim of Antarctica was approximately nine degrees Fahrenheit colder than average , increasing the size of this year 's ozone hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctic stratosphere warms by the return of sunlight at the end of the polar winter and by large-scale weather systems ( planetary-scale waves ) that form in the troposphere and move upward into the stratosphere . During the 2006 Antarctic winter and spring , these planetary-scale wave systems were relatively weak , causing the stratosphere to be colder than average . <p> As a result of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments , the concentrations of ozone-depleting substances in the lower atmosphere ( troposphere ) peaked around 1995 and are decreasing in both the troposphere and stratosphere . It is estimated these gases reached peak levels in the Antarctica stratosphere in 2001 . However , these ozone-depleting substances typically have very long lifetimes in the atmosphere ( more than 40 years ) . <p> As a result of this slow decline , the ozone hole is estimated to annually very slowly decrease in area by about 0.1 to 0.2 percent for the next five to 10 years . This slow decrease is masked by large year-to-year variations caused by Antarctic stratosphere weather fluctuations . <p> The recently completed 2006 World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded the ozone hole recovery would be masked by annual variability for the near future and the ozone hole would fully recover in approximately 2065 . <p> " We now have the largest ozone hole on record for this time of year , " said Craig Long of NCEP .

@@107018937 @2418937/ <h> The Ozone Layer Fact Sheet <h> by Jonathan Shanklin <p> British Antarctic Survey <p> Ozone is a compound of oxygen that contains three atoms instead of the two found in the oxygen gas that sustains life . It was discovered in 1839 by a Swiss chemist , Christian Friedrich Schonbein.In high concentration ozone is a bluish green gas , with very strong oxidising properties.It is a toxic , irritating gas , often encountered in surface air pollution episodes , when it can trigger asthma and irritate mucous membranes.Dry air consists of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen and there are normally trace amounts of other gases , principally argon , water and carbon dioxide , present.The concentration of ozone is usually only a few parts per million and even in the ozone layer it is only one part in 100,000 . <p> Ozone concentrations at the surface were first measured reliably by Robert Strutt ( later 4th Lord Rayleigh ) in 1918 using spectra of a hydrogen lamp recorded through five kilometres of air . These measurements showed that ozone concentration could not be uniform throughout the atmosphere as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at around 300 nanometres ( nm ) seen in stellar spectra.Three years later Fabry and Buisson used spectrographic techniques to demonstrate that its principal atmospheric location is in the stratosphere , though it was not until the 1930s that the actual vertical distribution was first measured.It was soon recognised that measuring the variation in the total ozone column was of meteorological interest and Professor G M B Dobson developed a prototype ozone spectrophotometer in the 1920s.His instrument is still the standard today and around 120 Dobson spectrophotometers have been built . <p> The Sun emits radiation in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , roughly 7% in the ultraviolet between 200 and 400 nm , 41% in the visible between 400 and 760 nm and 52% in the infra red.The ultraviolet part of the spectrum is further divided into UV-A , UV-B and UV-C.UV-A lies between 315 and 400 nm and gives rise to a suntan and ageing of the skin.UV-B lies between 280 and 315 nm and is the damaging part of the spectrum.UV-C , which is totally absorbed by the atmosphere before it can reach the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's instrument measures ozone by comparing the intensities of two wavelengths of ultra-violet light from the Sun , one of which is absorbed quite strongly by ozone , whilst the other is only weakly absorbed.The ratio of the intensities varies with the amount of ozone present in the atmosphere , and a well-calibrated instrument can measure ozone amounts to within a few percent.The instrument uses wavelengths between 305 and 340 nm and these are selected by means of prisms and a series of slits.It was initially a photographic instrument , but photocells were introduced in the mid 1930s and a photomultiplier in 1946 . <p> Ozone is created in the upper stratosphere by the photo-dissociation of an oxygen molecule , which liberates a free oxygen atom and this can then combine with another oxygen molecule to create ozone.The dissociation of the oxygen molecule requires ultraviolet light of wavelength shorter than 240 nm.Ozone itself can be dissociated by light of wavelength shorter than 1100 nm . The free oxygen atom thus created quickly finds another oxygen molecule and the ozone is reformed with the net result of absorbing the solar radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is very efficient and virtually all radiation between 200 and 310 nm is absorbed , despite the relatively low concentration of ozone.The main ozone absorption bands in the ultraviolet are the Hartley ( around 200 " 300 nm ) and Huggins ( around 300 " 350 nm ) , and there is the weak Chappuis band in the visible ( 440 " 740 nm ) . In the lower stratosphere , below about 30 km , ozone has a long lifetime , and the ozone mixing ratio can be used to trace atmospheric motions . <p> In the normal state of affairs the creation and dissociation processes run in balance and a typical value for the total amount of ozone in a vertical column of our atmosphere is around 300 Dobson Units ( DU ) , or 300 **28;35;TOOLONG , which corresponds to a layer of ozone 3 mm thick at the Earth 's surface.This 3 mm is in reality spread through the column , with the bulk of it lying between the tropopause , at 10 to 12 km altitude , and 40 km , with a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the ozone layer . <p> Over the last 50 years we have introduced chemicals into the atmosphere that are capable of destroying ozone through photochemical processes . Chloro-fluoro-carbons ( CFCs ) are widely known , but there are also other ozone depleting substances such as halons ( bromo-fluoro-carbons ) and methyl bromide . In certain circumstances the chlorine or bromine from these substances can react with ozone to turn it back into oxygen . In most parts of the world the reactions are very slow and there is little damage to the ozone layer , however over the Antarctic a dramatic hole opens in the ozone layer every spring and fills in again by mid-summer . This is created by the unusual atmospheric conditions that exist during the Antarctic winter . <p> An international treaty , the Montreal Protocol , has been drawn up to control the release of ozone depleting chemicals into the atmosphere . This treaty is clearly working , and the amount of these chemicals in air near the surface is beginning to decline . The chemicals are however so stable that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that existed 50 years ago and it is likely that we will see an annual ozone hole over Antarctica for many decades to come . <p> Why does the ozone hole form over Antarctica ? The answer is essentially ' because of the weather in the ozone layer ' . In order for rapid ozone destruction to happen , clouds ( known as PSCs , Stratospheric Clouds Mother of Pearl or Nacreous Clouds ) have to form in the ozone layer . In these clouds surface chemistry takes place . This converts chlorine or bromine ( from CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals ) into an active form , so that when there is sunlight , ozone is rapidly destroyed . Without the clouds , there is little or no ozone destruction . Only during the Antarctic winter does the atmosphere get cold enough for these clouds to form widely through the centre of the ozone layer . Elsewhere the atmosphere is just too warm and no clouds form . The northern and southern hemispheres have different ' weather ' in the ozone layer , and the net result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normally some ten degrees warmer than that of the Antarctic . This means that such clouds are rare , but sometimes the ' weather ' is colder than normal and they do form . Under these circumstances significant ozone depletion can take place over the Arctic , but it is usually for a much shorter period of time and covers a smaller area than in the Antarctic . <p> Is the ozone hole recovering ? Some reports in the media suggest that the ozone layer over Antarctica is now recovering . This message is a little confused . Recent measurements at surface monitoring stations show that the loading of ozone destroying chemicals at the surface has been dropping since about 1994 and is now about 6% down on that peak . The stratosphere lags behind the surface by several years and the loading of ozone depleting chemicals in the ozone layer is at or near the peak . Satellite measurements show that the rate of decline in ozone amount in the upper stratosphere is slowing , however the total ozone amount is still declining . The small size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in ozone depleting chemicals and it will be a decade or more before we can unambiguously say that the ozone hole is recovering . This assumes that the decline in ozone depleting chemicals continues and that there are no other perturbations to the ozone layer , such as might be caused by a massive volcanic eruption or Tunguska like event . It will be the middle of this century or beyond before the ozone hole ceases to appear over Antarctica . What we saw in 2002 is just one extreme in the natural range of variation in the polar stratosphere and is the equivalent of an extreme in ' stratospheric weather ' . By contrast the ' weather ' in 2003 moved to the opposite extreme and we saw one of the largest ozone holes on record . <p> Global warming and the ozone hole . The ozone hole is a completely different phenomenon to global warming , however there are links between them . The ozone hole is caused by ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere , which have been produced by industry , for example CFCs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Enhanced global warming is a probable consequence of increasing amounts of ' greenhouse gasses ' , such as carbon dioxide and methane , in the atmosphere . Although the surface of the earth warms , higher up the atmosphere cools , thus increasing the area where stratospheric clouds can form . This makes a larger area susceptible to ozone depletion and provides another link between the two issues . <p> Nacreous clouds or mother of pearl clouds . Occasionally stratospheric clouds can be seen from the UK , normally during the late winter and just after sunset or before sunrise . A display was widely seen across the UK on the evening of February 16 1996 . These clouds form in the stratosphere , at heights of between 10 and 30 km , when the temperature there falls below -80-C and are probably composed of ice particles with a liquid coating of nitric acid tri-hydrate . They appear bright because they are high enough to be illuminated by the sun long after local sunset and the pastel colours arise through diffraction or interference effects in much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puddle of water .

@@107018938 @2418938/ <p> An important source of column ozone measurements from space is the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS ) , which when combined with measurements from NOAA 's TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder ( TOVS ) and ground-based measurements results in highly accurate images with complete global coverage .

However , in October the PSC area was somewhat larger than usual and in general PSC temperatures continued longer than any year since 1987 . From June to mid July the vortex area was smaller than usual , particularly on the lower levels where the area remained quite small until the end of October .

Furthermore , the monthly averages of October and November were the greatest on record . The ozone hole dissipated in early December , similar to the long lasting ozone holes of 1987 , 1990 , 1992 and 1993 , and reflects the continued strength of the vortex in November . In early October there was a large area with column ozone values up to 60% below pre-ozone hole norms . The maximum area with ozone values more than 50% below pre-ozone hole norms was 10 million km2 , somewhat below the maximum level of 1994 ( 12 million km2 ) . Nevertheless , the area in 1995 was at least twice as great as all other years . Some ground stations measured their lowest daily ozone values ever , with South Pole measuring column ozone nearly 70% below pre-ozone hole norms ( 85 DU ) .

The first week of October saw a major spring warming event , with a rise in mean total ozone to over 300 DU as the circumpolar high ozone belt moved across the station . Mean values then fell back to around 190 DU in mid October before rising again to over 300 DU in a second warming event at the end of October . Mean values dropped back again to 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DU in the final warming event of the year in mid December . Values slowly declined from the December peak to around 260 DU at the end of April . <p> Generally values in the 95/96 season were a little above those reached in 1993 and 1994 during the first half of the season and below during the second half . The final spring warming was much later than in either year . Values were significantly below those of the long term mean throughout the season . <p> for their work in atmospheric chemistry , particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone . <h> The ozone layer - The Achilles heel of the biosphere <p> The atmosphere surrounding the earth contains small quantities of ozone - a gas with molecules consisting of three oxygen atoms ( O3 ) . If all the ozone in the atmosphere were compressed to a pressure corresponding to that at the earth 's surface , the layer would be only 3 mm thick . But even though ozone occurs in such small quantities , it plays an exceptionally fundamental part in life on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen ( O2 ) , is able to absorb the major part of the sun 's ultraviolet radiation and therefore prevent this dangerous radiation from reaching the surface . Without a protective ozone layer in the atmosphere , animals and plants could not exist , at least upon land . It is therefore of the greatest importance to understand the processes that regulate the atmosphere 's ozone content . <p> Paul Crutzen , Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland have all made pioneering contributions to explaining how ozone is formed and decomposes through chemical processes in the atmosphere . Most importantly , they have in this way showed how sensitive the ozone layer is to the influence of anthropogenic emissions of certain compounds . The thin ozone layer has proved to be an Achilles heel that may be seriously injured by apparently moderate changes in the composition of the atmosphere . By explaining the chemical mechanisms that affect the thickness of the ozone layer , the three researchers have contributed to our salvation from a global environmental problem that could have catastrophic consequences . <p> How this knowledge evolved Ozone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules ( O2 ) by ultra-violet radiation from the sun . The oxygen atoms thereby liberated react with the molecular oxygen according to : <p> O2+ uv-light -&gt; 2O O+O2+M -&gt; O3+M <p> where M is a random air molecule ( N2 or O2 ) . <p> The English physicist Sidney Chapman formulated in 1930 the first photochemical theory for the formation and decomposition of ozone in the atmosphere . This theory , which describes how sunlight converts the various forms of oxygen from one to another , explains why the highest contents of ozone occur in the layer between 15 and 50 km , termed the ozone layer ( Fig. 1 ) . Later measurements , however , showed appreciable deviations from Chapman 's theory . The calculated ozone contents were considerably higher than the observed ones . Thus , there must be other chemical reactions contributing to the reduction of the ozone content . Some years later the Belgian Marcel Nicolet contributed important knowledge of how the decomposition of ozone was enhanced by the presence of the hydrogen radicals OH and HO2 . <p> Fig. 1 . Variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scientist to take the next fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of the chemistry of the ozone layer was Paul Crutzen . In 1970 he showed that the nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 react catalytically ( without themselves being consumed ) with ozone , thus accelerating the rate of reduction of the ozone content . <p> These nitrogen oxides are formed in the atmosphere through the decay of the chemically stable nitrous oxide N2O , which originates from microbiological transformations at the ground . The connection demonstrated by Crutzen between microorganisms in the soil and the thickness of the ozone layer is one of the motives for the recent rapid development of research on global biogeochemical cycles . <p> The first threat noted : supersonic aircraft The power of nitrogen oxides to decompose ozone was also noted early by the American researcher Harold Johnston , who carried out extensive laboratory studies of the chemistry of nitrogen compounds . In 1971 he pointed out the possible threat to the ozone layer that the planned fleet of supersonic aircraft and supersonic travel ( SST ) might represent . These aircraft would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ozone layer at altitudes of 20 km . Crutzen 's and Johnston 's work gave rise to a very intensive debate among researchers as well as among technologists and decision-makers . This was also the start of intensive research into the chemistry of the atmosphere which has made great progress during the past several years . ( The subsequent cancellation of plans for a large SST fleet had other reasons than the environmental risks they involved . ) <p> Spray cans and refrigerators damage the ozone layer The next leap in our knowledge of ozone chemistry was in 1974 , when Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland published their widely noted Nature article on the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) gases - " freons " - used in spray bottles , as the cooling medium in refrigerators and elsewhere and plastic foams . Molina and Rowland based their conclusions on two important contributions by other researchers : - James Lovelock ( England ) had recently developed a highly sensitive device of measuring extremely low organic gas contents in the atmosphere , the electron capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively man-made , chemically inert , CFC gases had already spread globally throughout the atmosphere . - Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone ( USA ) had shown that free chlorine atoms in the atmosphere can decompose ozone catalytically in similar ways as nitrogen oxides do . <p> Molina and Rowland realised that the chemically inert CFC could gradually be transported up to the ozone layer , there to be met by such intensive ultra-violet light that they would be separated into their constituents , notably chlorine atoms . They calculated that if human use of CFC gases was to continue at an unaltered rate the ozone layer would be depleted by many percent after some decades . Their prediction created an enormous attention . For the CFC gases were used in many technical processes and their very chemical stability and non-toxicity were thought to render them environmentally ideal . Many were critical of Molina 's and Rowland 's calculations but yet more were seriously concerned by the possibility of a depleted ozone layer . Today we know that they were right in all essentials . It was to turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content over AntarcticaMolina 's and Rowland 's report led to certain restrictions on CFC release during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Not until 1985 , when the real shock came , was there any real urgency in the international negotiations on release restrictions . Then the Englishman Joseph Farman and his colleagues noted a drastic depletion of the ozone layer over the Antarctic , the " ozone hole " ( Fig. 2 ) . The depletion was , at least periodically , far greater than expected from earlier calculations of the CFC effect . The debate among researchers now intensified . Was this a natural climatic variation or was it chemical decomposition brought about by mankind ? Thanks to pioneering research by many researchers , among them Crutzen , Molina and Rowland , as well as Susan Solomon and James Anderson , both from the USA , the picture has now cleared . The depletion is caused chiefly by ozone reacting chemically with chlorine and bromine from industrially manufactured gases . <p> Fig 2 . Thickness of the ozone layer ( mean monthly value for October ) over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the 1970s . <p> The surprisingly rapid depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica could not be explained by transport processes or by gas phase chemical reactions . An alternative mechanism must exist which could accelerate the decomposition of ozone . Crutzen and colleagues identified this mechanism as chemical reactions on the surface of cloud particles in the stratosphere . Thus , the Antarctic ozone depletion appears to be connected with the extremely low prevailing temperatures , which lead to condensation of water and nitric acid to form " polar stratospheric clouds " ( PSCs ) . The ozone-decomposing chemical reactions are greatly reinforced by the presence of cloud particles . This understanding has led to an exciting new branch of atmospheric chemistry : " heterogeneous " chemical reactions on particle surfaces . <p> The ozone layer and the climateThe ozone problem also has interesting connections with the issue of how mankind is affecting the climate . Ozone , like carbon dioxide and methane , is a greenhouse gas that contributes to high temperatures at the surface of the earth . ( CFC gases have a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is specially sensitive to changes in the ozone content in the lower layers , the troposphere . Here the ozone content has increased markedly during the past century , chiefly because of the release of nitric oxide , carbon monoxide and gaseous hydrocarbons from vehicles and industrial processes and from the combustion of biomass in the tropics . The elevated ozone content in lower atmospheric layers is itself an environmental problem for the damage it can cause to crops and human health . Paul Crutzen has been the world 's leading researcher in mapping the chemical mechanisms that determine the ozone content at these levels . <p> What can we expect in the future ? Thanks to our good scientific understanding of the ozone problem - and very largely to Crutzen , Molina and Rowland - it has been possible to make far-reaching decisions on prohibiting the release of gases that destroy ozone . A protocol on the protection of the ozone layer was negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations and signed in Montreal , Canada , in 1987 . Under the latest tightening-up of the Montreal Protocol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ( developing countries have a few years ' grace to introduce substitutes that do not harm the ozone layer ) . Since it takes some time for the ozone-destroying gases to reach the ozone layer we must expect the depletion , not only over Antarctica but also over parts of the Northern Hemisphere , to worsen for some years to come . Given compliance with the prohibitions , the ozone layer should gradually begin to heal after the turn of the century ( Fig. 3 ) . Yet it will take at least 100 years before it has fully recovered . <p> Fig 3 . Change in the chlorine content in the stratosphere up to the present and three different future scenarios : a ) Without restrictions on release , b ) Limitations according to the original Montreal Protocol of 1987 c ) The release limitations now internationally agreed .

Average total ozone from CCM simulations behaves in a manner similar to observations between 1980 and 2009 . The average column ozone for 1964 " 1980 is chosen as a reference for observed changes for two reasons : 1 ) reliable ground-based observations sufficient to produce a global average are available in this period ; 2 ) a significant trend is not discernible in the observations during this period . <p> Southern Hemisphere midlatitude ( 35-S " 60-S ) annual mean total column ozone amounts over the period 2006 " 2009 have remained at the same level as observed during 1996 " 2005 , approximately 6% below the 1964 " 1980 average .

A minimum about 5.5% below the 1964 " 1980 average was reached in the mid-1990s . Simulations by CCMs agree with these measurements , again showing the consistency of data with the expected impact of ODSs . The simulations also indicate that the minimum in the mid-1990s was primarily caused by the ozone response to effects of volcanic aerosols from the 1991 eruption of Mt . Pinatubo . <p> The latitude dependence of simulated total column ozone trends generally agrees with that derived from measurements , showing large negative trends at Southern Hemisphere mid and high latitudes and Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes for the period of ODS increase . However , in the tropics the statistically significant range of trends produced by CCMs ( G1.5 to G4 Dobson units per decade ( DU/decade ) ) does not agree with the trend obtained from measurements ( +0.3 - 1 DU/decade ) . <p> Ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone between 12 and 15 km decreased between 1979 and 1995 , and increased between 1996 and 2009 . The increase since the mid-1990s is larger than the changes expected from the decline in ODS abundances . <p> Northern Hemisphere midlatitude ( 35-N " 60-N ) ozone between 20 and 25 km declined during 1979 " 1995 and has since ceased to decline . Observed increases between 1996 and 2008 are statistically significant at some locations but not globally . <p> Northern Hemisphere midlatitude ( 35-N " 60-N ) ozone between 35 and 45 km measured using a broad range of ground-based and satellite instruments ceased to decline after the mid-1990s , consistent with the leveling off of ODS abundances . All data sets show a small ozone increase since that time , with varying degrees of statistical significance but this increase can not presently be attributed to ODS decrease because of observational uncertainty , natural ozone variability , and stratospheric cooling . CCMs simulate the ozone response to changes in ODSs and increases in greenhouse gases ; analysis of CCM results suggests that longer observational records are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the midlatitude upper stratosphere ( 35 " 45 km ) of both hemispheres , the profile ozone trends derived from most CCMs from 1980 to 1996 agree well with trends deduced from measurements . The agreement in both magnitude and shape of the ozone trends provides evidence that increases in ODSs between 1980 and 1996 are primarily responsible for the observed behavior . <p> In the tropical lower stratosphere , all simulations show a negative ozone trend just above the tropopause , centered at about 18 " 19 km ( 70 " 80 hectoPascals , hPa ) , due to an increase in upwelling . The simulated trends in the lower tropical stratosphere are consistent with trends deduced for 1985 " 2005 from Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment ( SAGE II ) satellite data , although uncertainties in the SAGE II trends are large . The near-zero trend in tropical total ozone measurements is inconsistent with the negative trend found in the integrated SAGE I + SAGE II stratospheric profiles . The tropospheric ozone column does not increase enough to resolve this discrepancy . <p> Polar Ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear each spring from 2006 to 2009 . This is expected because decreases in stratospheric chlorine and bromine have been moderate over the last few years . Analysis shows that since 1979 the abundance of total column ozone in the Antarctic ozone hole has evolved in a manner consistent with the time evolution of ODSs . Since about 1997 the ODS amounts have been nearly constant and the depth and magnitude of the ozone hole have been controlled by variations in temperature and dynamics . The October mean column ozone within the vortex has been about 40% below 1980 values for the past fifteen years . <p> Arctic winter and spring ozone loss has varied between 2007 and 2010 , but remained in a range comparable to the values that have prevailed since the early 1990s . Chemical loss of about 80% of the losses observed in the record cold winters of 1999/2000 and 2004/2005 has occurred in recent cold winters . <p> Polar stratospheric clouds ( PSCs ) over Antarctica occur more frequently in early June and less frequently in September than expected based on the previous satellite PSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new class of satellite instruments that provide daily vortex-wide information concerning PSC composition and occurrence in both hemispheres . The previous satellite PSC climatology was developed from solar occultation instruments that have limited daily coverage . <p> Calculations constrained to match observed temperatures and halogen levels produce Antarctic ozone losses that are close to those derived from data . Without constraints , CCMs simulate many aspects of the Antarctic ozone hole , however they do not simultaneously produce the cold temperatures , isolation from middle latitudes , deep descent , and high amounts of halogens in the polar vortex . Furthermore , most CCMs underestimate the Arctic ozone loss that is derived from observations , primarily because the simulated northern winter vortices are too warm . <p> Ultraviolet Radiation <p> Ground-based measurements of solar ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation ( wavelength 280 " 400 nanometers ) remain limited both spatially and in duration . However , there have been advances both in reconstructing longer-term UV records from other types of ground-based measurements and in satellite UV retrievals . Where these UV data sets coincide , long-term changes agree , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of UV . <p> Ground-based UV reconstructions and satellite UV retrievals , supported in the later years by direct ground-based UV measurements , show that erythemal ( " sunburning " ) irradiance over midlatitudes has increased since the late 1970s , in qualitative agreement with the observed decrease in column ozone . The increase in satellite-derived erythemal irradiance over midlatitudes during 1979 " 2008 is statistically significant , while there are no significant changes in the tropics . Satellite estimates of UV are difficult to interpret over the polar regions . <p> In the Antarctic , large ozone losses produce a clear increase in surface UV radiation . Ground-based measurements show that the average spring erythemal irradiance for 1990 " 2006 is up to 85% greater than the modeled irradiance for 1963 " 1980 , depending on site . The Antarctic spring erythemal irradiance is approximately twice that measured in the Arctic for the same season . <p> Clear-sky UV observations from unpolluted sites in midlatitudes show that since the late 1990s , UV irradiance levels have been approximately constant , consistent with ozone column observations over this period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by clouds and aerosols , in addition to stratospheric ozone . Daily measurements under all atmospheric conditions at sites in Europe and Japan show that erythemal irradiance has continued to increase in recent years due to net reductions in the effects of clouds and aerosols . In contrast , in southern midlatitudes , zonal and annual average erythemal irradiance increases due to ozone decreases since 1979 have been offset by almost a half due to net increases in the effects of clouds and aerosols. 127993 @qwx987993

They were of mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 17 , my mother , moved to Amsterdam to work as a housekeeper . There she met my father . He came from Vaals , a little town in the southeastern corner of the Netherlands , Bordering Belgium and Germany and very close to the historical German city of Aachen . He died in 1977 . He had relatives in the Netherlands , Germany and Belgium . Thus , from both parents I inherited a cosmopolitan view of the world . My mother , now 84 years old , still lives in Amsterdam , mentally very alert , but since a few months ago , wheelchair-bound . Despite having worked in several countries outside The Netherlands since 1958 , I have remained a Dutch citizen . <p> In May , 1940 , The Netherlands were overrun by the German army . In September of the same year I entered elementary school , " de grote school " ( the big school ) , as it was popularly called . My six years of elementary school largely overlapped with the 2nd World War . Our school class had to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscated our original school building . The last months of the war , between the fall of 1944 and Liberation Day on May , 5 , 1945 , were particularly horrible . During the cold " hongerwinter " ( winter of famine ) of 1944-1945 , there was a severe lack of food and heating fuels . Also water for drinking , cooking and washing was available only in limited quantities for a few hours per day , causing poor hygienic conditions . Many died of hunger and disease , including several of my schoolmates . Some relief came at the beginning of 1945 when the Swedish Red Cross dropped food supplies on parachutes from airplanes . To welcome them we waved our red , white and blue Dutch flags in the streets . I had of course not the slightest idea how important Sweden would become later in my life . We only had a few hours of school each week , but because of special help from one of the teachers , I was allowed together with two other schoolmates to continue to the next and final class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . More or less normal school education only became possible again with the start of the new school year in the fall of 1945 . <p> In 1946 , after a successful entrance exam , I entered the " Hogere Burgerschool " ( HBS ) , " Higher Citizen School " , a 5 year long middle school , which prepared for University entrance . I finished this school in June , 1951 , with natural sciences as my focal subjects . However , we all also had to become proficient in 3 foreign languages : French , English and German . I got considerable help in learning languages from my parents : German from my mother , French from my father . During those years , chemistry definitely was not one of my favourite subjects . They were mathematics and physics , but I also did very well in the three foreign languages . During my school years I spent considerable time with a variety of sports : football , bicycling , and my greatest passion , long distance skating on the Dutch canals and lakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranked as a " denksport " ( thought sport ) . I read widely about travels in distant lands , about astronomy , as well as about bridges and tunnels . Unfortunately , because of a heavy fever , my grades in the final exam of the HBS were not good enough to qualify for a university study stipend , which was very hard to obtain at that time , only 6 years after the end of the 2nd world war and a few years after the end of colonial war in Indonesia , which had been a large drain on Dutch resources . As I did not want to be a further financial burden on my parents for another 4 years or more ( my father , a waiter , was often unemployed ; my mother worked in the kitchen of a hospital ) , I chose to attend the Middelbare Technische School ( MTS ) , middle technical school , now called the higher technical school ( HTS ) , to train as a civil engineer . Although the MTS took 3 years , the second year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough to live on for about 2 years . From the summer of 1954 until February , 1958 , with a 21-month interruption for compulsory military service in The Netherlands , I worked at the Bridge Construction Bureau of the City of Amsterdam . In the meanwhile , on a vacation trip in Switzerland , I met a sweet girl , Terttu Soininen , a student of Finnish history and literature at the University of Helsinki . A few years later I was able to entice her to marry me . What a great choice I made ! She has been the center of a happy family ; without her support , I would never have been able to devote so much of my time to studies and science . After our marriage in February , 1958 , we settled in G+vle , a little town about 200 km north of Stockholm , where I had found a job in a building construction bureau . In December of that same year our daughter Ilona was born . In March , 1964 , she got a little sister , Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul is 12 years old . Sylvia is a marketing assistant in M++nchen , Germany . All were present in Stockholm , Uppsala and G+vle during the Nobel week . We had a happy and unforgettable time . <p> All this time I had longed for an academic career . One day , at the beginning of 1958 , I saw an advertisement in a Swedish newspaper from the Department of Meteorology of Stockholm H+gskola ( from 1961 , Stockholm University ) announcing an opening for a computer programmer . Although I had not the slightest experience in this subject , I applied for the job and had the great luck to be chosen from among many candidates . On July 1 , 1959 , we moved to Stockholm and I started with my second profession . At that time the Meteorology Institute of Stockholm University ( MISU ) and the associated International Meteorological Institute ( IMI ) were at the forefront of meteorological research and many top researchers worked in Stockholm for extended periods . Only about a year earlier the founder of the institutes , Prof. Gustav Rossby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly and was succeeded by Dr. Bert Bolin , another famous meteorologist , now " retired " as director of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . At that time Stockholm University housed the fastest computers in the world ( BESK and its successor FACIT ) . <p> With the exception of participation in a field campaign in northern Sweden , led by Dr. Georg Witt to measure the properties of noctilucent clouds , which appear during summer at about 85 km altitude in the coldest parts of atmosphere , and some programming work related to this , I was until about 1966 mainly involved in various meteorological projects , especially helping to build and run some of the first numerical ( barotropic ) weather prediction models . I also programmed a model of a tropical cyclone for a good friend , Hilding Sundquist , now a professor at MISU . At that time programming was a special art . Advanced general computer languages , such as Algol or Fortran , had not been developed , so that all programmes had to be written in specific machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations yielded numbers in the range -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 , which meant that one had to scale all equations to stay within these limits ; otherwise the computations would yield wrong results . <p> The great advantage of being at a university department was that I got the opportunity to follow some of the lecture courses that were offered at the university . By 1963 I could thus fulfill the requirement for the filosofie kandidat ( corresponding to a Master of Science ) degree , combining the subjects mathematics , mathematical statistics , and meteorology . Unfortunately , I could include neither physics nor chemistry in my formal education , because this would have required my participation in time consuming laboratory excercises . In this way I became a pure theoretician . I have , however , always felt close to experimental work , which I have strongly supported during my later years as director of research at the National Center of Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colorado ( 1977-1980 ) and at the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry in Mainz , Germany ( since 1980 ) .

@@107018958 @2418958/ <p> 2/8/01-Scientists have discovered a new class of particles present in the Arctic 's winter stratosphere that likely play an important role in ozone loss in that region , the Commerce Department 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced today . These findings give scientists a better understanding of the processes that set the stage for chlorine-caused ozone depletion in the stratosphere above the Arctic . <p> An international team of scientists published their findings in the Feb. 9 issue of Science magazine . Lead author David W. Fahey , a scientist at NOAA 's Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder , Colo. , and colleagues , discovered a new class of polar stratospheric cloud ( PSC ) particles , very large in size , that had previously been undetected . <p> Scientists have known for some time that during the cold Arctic winter , icy , nitric acid-containing polar stratospheric cloud particles are formed , which enhance the destruction of ozone by human emissions of chlorine and bromine . <p> The newly discovered particles have diameters of 10-20 microns ( millionths of a meter ) , which is about 10-20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These particles have eluded detection to date because of their unexpectedly large size and their very small abundance in the atmosphere . The PSCs are laden with nitric acid ( HNO3 ) , and thus serve as reservoirs for nitrogen in the polar stratosphere . As the particles " sediment " or fall out of the atmosphere , the stratosphere becomes " denitrified " . The discovery of this new class of large PSCs helps to explain a longstanding mystery , namely , that the extent of denitrification observed in the polar stratosphere could not be accounted for by the smaller , more slowly-falling PSCs . <p> The researchers say that the loss of nitrogen has important consequences for the ozone because ozone-destroying forms of chlorine and bromine are longer-lived in a denitrified stratosphere . <p> Fahey and colleagues made the observations during the period of January-March , 2000 , using instruments placed onboard a NASA ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft . Those instruments measured reactive nitrogen species as the aircraft traveled toward the Pole and deep into the region of highest ozone loss . <p> The large particles observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the available reactive nitrogen in the Arctic stratosphere , and were falling at a rate of 1-2 kilometers per day . This indicates that these particles may play an important role in denitrifying the stratosphere . The 2000 Arctic winter stratosphere was extensively denitrified . Large ozone losses of up to 70 percent occurred in the lower stratosphere throughout the Arctic vortex , according to Fahey . <p> Cold temperatures promote the growth of large PSCs and enhance the loss of ozone by chlorine and bromine . Unusually cold winters , or climate shifts that reduce stratospheric temperatures or increase the amount of water vapor in the stratosphere , could prolong chemical ozone loss in the Arctic even as chlorine levels fall in response to international curtailments in the use of ozone-depleting chemicals . <p> " Our findings suggest that we still need to learn more about how these large PSCs are formed , so that we 'll have a better understanding of how the ozone layer will recover in the future , " Fahey said . <p> For more information , visit the Aeronomy Laboratory Web site : http @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOAA 's Web site at : http : //www.noaa.gov

Recent studies have simulated the catastrophe that might have occurred if CFC emissions had not been halted.10,11 The resulting stratospheric ozone decrease would have doubled the erythemal UV radiation ( affecting skin conditions and blood vessels ) on the surface at northern midlatitudes by 2060 , and associated DNA damage would increase by approximately 650% . <p> The temporal evolution of effective stratospheric chlorine ( ESC , caused by upward transport of CFCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of Figure 1 , but with a negative sign .

The temporal evolution of stratospheric-ozone concentrations is tightly anticorrelated with ESC levels : stratospheric-ozone levels stabilized at a low level in 1995 , after one to two decades of ozone depletion . A recovery phase of stratospheric ozone appears to have started in 1995 but we believe that it is still too early to be sure about this perceived trend . <p> Some atmosphere models predict stratospheric-ozone recovery until 2050.12 Other models predict a an increased recovery rate ( super recovery ' ) of stratospheric ozone , exceeding the 1970 mean value as a consequence of stratospheric cooling caused by human-induced global warming of the troposphere .

It is surprising that Figure 1 shows a consistent picture of the temporal evolution of stratospheric ozone across a number of different measurement techniques , ground stations , and satellites . To some extent , the measurements have been controlled by past comparison campaigns .

Improvements of NDACC are required for continued global atmospheric-composition monitoring with an accuracy of 1% per decade . This will require ongoing measurement programs and careful improvements of existing instruments . New and future satellite instruments must be calibrated and integrated with existing data sets . Because of the continuing increase in CO2 levels , ozone recovery is expected to accompany a cooling of the upper stratosphere of approximately one degree per decade . Only satellites ( and ground-based instruments such as the NDACC lidars ) can reliably measure temperatures in the upper stratosphere . Remotely sensed temperature trends will therefore become a future focus of NDACC and the Global Atmosphere Watch .

This research appeared in the January 6th , 2012 issue of Geophysical Research Letters . <p> One of the most striking characteristics of the Earth 's upper atmosphere is that at the edge of space , 80 to 100 km , at polar latitudes , it is much colder in summer than winter , despite the presence of 24-hour sunlight , explains Dr. David Siskind , who works in NRL 's Space Science Division and is the principal investigator for this research . <p> Scientists have attributed this peculiar temperature reversal to the propagation of small-scale atmospheric gravity waves , which spread up from the lower atmosphere and by momentum deposition , drive the atmosphere away from a simple radiative equilibrium state . <p> The 80 to 100 km region , which is known as the " mesopause , " is so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These polar mesospheric clouds are being studied by a NASA mission called Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere in which NRL is involved . <p> NRL researchers are using the high-altitude extension of the Navy operational weather forecast model , NOGAPS-ALPHA ( Advanced Level Physics High Altitude ) to study how lower atmospheric disturbances propagate up to the thermosphere and ionosphere , above 100 km . This investigation is part of a long-term program to explore the coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere . NOGAPS-ALPHA extends up to 100 km , so the NRL team has mated the NOGAPS-ALPHA code with a community thermosphere-ionosphere model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) . <p> This NCAR model typically is forced at the bottom boundary , 95 km , by a simple averaged temperature field . The researchers first used this field to simulate lower thermospheric winds for the month of January 2010 , which is the southern summer . However , when the researchers used NOGAPS-ALPHA for January 2010 , the calculated thermospheric wind field throughout the entire domain changed dramatically and , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consistent with observational data , in the summer hemisphere between 100 and 115 km . This is similar to the wintertime lower atmosphere where the cold polar regions lead to the spin up of the wintertime polar vortex . <p> The NRL scientists ' modeling success with using the NCAR code forced by NOGAPS-ALPHA from below is significant for two reasons . First , the thermosphere is a viscous fluid . Stirring it at its base will generate a response throughout the entire domain , including those regions where the coupling to the ionosphere is important such as the tropics . So this suggests a link between the cold summer mesopause near 90 km altitude to the development of a vortex-like thermospheric wind pattern up to 115 km where space weather effects are important . Scientists believe these winds control the ionosphere at the same altitudes through ion-neutral collisions . Second , the cold summer mesopause has itself been linked in recent studies to long-term variations in stratospheric weather , including the seasonal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole . The link here is due to the filtering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cause the summer mesopause to be cold . <p> Bolstered by the success of their model and by the work linking the Antarctic ozone hole to the mesopause , Siskind and his research team have made the connection between this man-made disturbance of the stratosphere and the ionosphere . They conclude by suggesting that climatological studies of the ionosphere consider this link . This new coupling mechanism might furthermore have operational engineering consequences since many tables of ionospheric radio wave propagation were developed using data from the International Geophysical Year which was in the late 1950s , before the Antarctic ozone hole is believed to have opened up . <p> About the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory <p> The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory is the Navy 's full-spectrum corporate laboratory , conducting a broadly based multidisciplinary program of scientific research and advanced technological development .

The amount of radiation reaching the HIRS instrument is dependant upon how much ozone is in the earth 's atmosphere ( less ozone = more radiation ) . Therefore , the TOVS Total Ozone algorithm uses this channel ( along with information from other HIRS channels ) to estimate the total amount of ozone in the earth 's atmosphere . The greatest contribution of the emmitted radiation occurs in a region between 200 hPa and 30 hPa ( 13km to 27km ) . This " lower stratosphere " region is below the levels where the greatest contribution to the total ozone amount occurs ( 50hpa to 10hPa or 20km to 30km ) .

Backscattered radiation levels at wavelengths where ozone absorbtion does and does not take place are compared with the same wavelenghts measured directly from the sun to derive a " total ozone " amount in the earth 's atmosphere . This methodology is used by the NASA TOMS and the NOAA SBUV/2 ozone monitoring programs . This methodology provides a truer measure of the total ozone amount in the earth 's atmosphere . One drawback is that this method uses " backscattered " sunlight . Which means that data can not be retrieved in the earth 's shadow or polar night regions .

@@107018984 @2418984/ <p> NASA scientists have revealed the inner workings of the ozone hole that forms annually over Antarctica and found that declining chlorine in the stratosphere has not yet caused a recovery of the ozone hole . <p> More than 20 years after the Montreal Protocol agreement limited human emissions of ozone-depleting substances , satellites have monitored the area of the annual ozone hole and watched it essentially stabilize , ceasing to grow substantially larger . However , two new studies show that signs of recovery are not yet present , and that temperature and winds are still driving any annual changes in ozone hole size . <p> " Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline , " said Susan Strahan of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .

( Monday , March 23 , 2009 ) -- A University of Waterloo scientist says that an observed cyclic hole in the ozone layer provides proof of a new ozone depletion theory involving cosmic rays , a theory outlined in his new study , just published in Physical Review Letters . <p> Qing-Bin Lu , a professor of physics and astronomy and an ozone depletion expert , said it was generally accepted for more than two decades that the Earth 's ozone layer is depleted by chlorine atoms produced by the sun 's ultraviolet light-induced destruction of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in the atmosphere . <p> But mounting evidence supports a new theory that says cosmic rays , rather than the sun 's UV light , play the dominant role in breaking down ozone-depleting molecules and then ozone . Cosmic rays are energy particles originating in space . <p> Ozone is a gas mostly concentrated in the ozone layer , a region located in the stratosphere several miles above the Earth 's surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultraviolet light , which is potentially damaging to life and causes such diseases as skin cancer and cataracts . The Antarctic ozone hole is larger than the size of North America . <p> In his study , Lu analyzes reliable cosmic ray and ozone data in the period of 1980-2007 , which cover two full 11-year solar cycles . The data unambiguously show the time correlations between cosmic ray intensity and global ozone depletion , as well as between cosmic ray intensity and the ozone hole over the South Pole . <p> The Schwabe solar cycle or Schwabe-Wolf cycle is the eleven-year cycle of solar activity of the sun . <p> It was named after Samuel Heinrich Schwabe ( October 25 , 1789 April 11 , 1875 ) a German astronomer remembered for his work on sunspots . At periods of highest activity , known as solar maximum or solar max , sunspots appear . Periods of lowest activity are known as solar minimum . The last solar maximum was in 2001 . The solar cycle is not strictly 11 years ; it has been as short as 9 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This finding not only provides a fingerprint for the dominant role of the cosmic-ray mechanism in causing the ozone hole , but also contradicts the widely-accepted photochemical theory , " Lu said .

" <p> In the first submission of his paper to Physical Review Letters in August 2008 ( prior to the start of the ozone hole season ) , Lu predicted one of the severest ozone losses in 2008-2009 as a result of the cosmic ray cycle . <p> His study quantitatively predicted that the mean total ozone in the October hole over Antarctica would be depleted to around 187 Dobson units ( DU ) . The latest NASA OMI satellite data sets , released on March 13 , show that the mean total ozone in the ozone hole in October 2008 was 197 DU , within five per cent of Lu 's prediction . <p> " The total ozone values in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values in the months on record , " Lu said . " The 2008 ozone hole shrank quite slowly and persisted until the end of December , making it one of the longest lasting ozone holes on record . " <p> He added that in earlier studies he and former colleagues found a strong spatial correlation between cosmic ray intensity and ozone depletion , based on the data from several sources , including NASA satellites . " Lab measurements demonstrated a mechanism by which cosmic rays can cause drastic reactions of ozone-depleting halogens inside polar clouds . " <p> Cosmic rays are concentrated over the North and South Poles due to Earth 's magnetic field , and have the highest electron-production rate at the height of 15 to 18 km above the ground -- where the ozone layer has been most depleted . <p> Lu says that years ago atmospheric scientists expressed doubts about the cosmic ray mechanism , but now observed data shows which theory is the correct one . <p> For instance , the most recent scientific assessments of ozone depletion by the World Meteorological Organization and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that global ozone will recover ( or increase ) by one to 2.5 per cent between 2000 and 2020 and that the Antarctic springtime ozone hole will shrink by five to 10 per cent between 2000 and 2020 . <p> In sharp contrast , the cosmic ray theory predicted one of the severest ozone losses over the South Pole in 2008-2009 and another large hole around 2019-2020 .

For years , scientists have documented how human pollution is slowly destroying this protective layer . As Doug Schneider reports in this week 's Arctic Science Journeys Radio , this spring brought some of the worst ozone destruction in 40 years in the stratosphere over Europe . <p> STORY : Dr. Paul Newman is one of several NASA scientists who led the U.S.-European study of ozone losses over northern Europe . He 's quick to point out that the ozone losses measured this spring do n't constitute an actual ozone hole--such as seen over Antarctica in recent years--but rather a dramatic thinning of the ozone layer . <p> NEWMAN : " The total ozone loss , between the surface and space , was about 16 percent . This is about the second worst that we 've had ; 1997 was the worst . " <p> For ozone to be destroyed , several things have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be extremely cold in the stratosphere--that 's the layer from about 6 to 30 miles above the earth where ozone is found . Secondly , you need sunlight and a chemical called chlorine . In the presence of sunlight and extremely cold temperatures , chlorine destroys ozone faster than it can be replaced . These conditions came together this spring within some 14 million square miles over northern Europe . <p> NEWMAN : " It covered all of Greenland , and extended as far south as Great Britain , and cut across northern Russia . But did n't extend over Alaska or Siberia . So all of the North Atlantic . " <p> Newman says so much ozone was lost because much of the stratosphere over northern Europe remained unusually cold throughout late winter and into the spring . Temperatures of 130 degrees below zero caused the formation of crystalline clouds , called polar stratospheric clouds . These clouds concentrated airborne chlorine , and in the presence of sunlight , triggered a chemical reaction that destroyed ozone . <p> NEWMAN : " Well , there are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really get to record cold levels . But the region of cold temperatures was at a record size this year . That is , the region that was cold enough to form polar stratospheric clouds was really large .

It was a record size , and that meant that since you had a huge coverage of polar stratospheric clouds , you activated lots of chlorine . So that was happening quite a bit through the January , February , and March period . " <p> The chlorine itself comes from chemicals called chloroflorocarbons , or CFCs . Although CFCs are being used less and less in things like air conditioners , there 's still plenty of them making their way into the upper atmosphere . <p> NEWMAN : " I can say that about 75 to 80 percent of the chlorine we see in the stratosphere is man-made .

But by the end of the century , ozone levels could be slightly higher or slightly lower than before 1980 because of high natural variability and human caused changes like warming temperatures , said Weatherhead . <p> A paper by Weatherhead and Signe Bech Andersen of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen is featured on the cover of the May 4 issue of Nature . <p> " We now have some confidence that the ozone layer is responding to the decreases in chlorine levels in the atmosphere due to the leveling off and decrease of CFCs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had hoped for with the Montreal Protocol in place , " she said .

The increase may be partially a result of natural variability , including shifts in air temperatures and atmospheric transport , the influences of the 11-year solar cycle and an absence of major volcanic activity on Earth .

" <p> The Nature study , which shows ozone levels have stabilized or increased slightly in the past 10 years , used data from satellites and ground stations to compare changes in the ozone layer to past depletion levels . The researchers used data from 14 modeling studies published by scientific groups from around the world for the study . <p> The ozone data was collected by a suite of NASA and NOAA satellites and ground stations .

Ten times more powerful than typical supernovae , hypernovae are the source for long-duration gamma ray bursts ( GRBs ) , which are high-energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRB could travel 6,500 light-years and still inflict terrific damage on Earth , Thomas says . <p> The number of GRBs is much less than the number of supernovae , but the exact rate in our galaxy is still a matter of debate . A few years ago , a group of astronomers calculated that the likelihood of a GRB going off near us was very low , due to the fact that GRBs tend to arise in young galaxies with less heavy elements than the Milky Way . <p> But Thomas says that subsequent analyses have called this calculation into question , partly because our galaxy has merged in the past with smaller , younger galaxies that could have brought GRB-ticking-time-bombs in with them . " Our likelihood for hosting a GRB could vary with time , " Thomas says . <p> He speculates that on average a GRB lights up our galaxy about once every 10 million years . <p> Other possible culprits <p> Long-duration GRBs and supernovae may be the best-understood , but they are not the only super-stellar calamities . <p> Short-duration GRBs do not arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly be the merger of two neutron stars . Although less energy is released than in a long-duration GRB , the fraction of high-energy gamma rays is higher .

Nothing was damaged , but the source object was an amazing 50,000 light-years away . <p> Thomas and his colleagues will be pulling together recent data from the Swift satellite and the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope to better estimate the rates and radiation output of soft gamma-ray repeaters , GRBs and supernovae . <p> Although there 's no evidence that one of these went off recently in our neighborhood , it 's important to note that our sun migrates around the galaxy and therefore could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Worldwide ozone hole <p> The other half of the study will look at the possible biological aftermath of an astrophysical firework going off nearby . <p> Gamma rays and X-rays can not penetrate very far into the Earth 's atmosphere , but they still can have a long-lasting impact . The high-energy radiation breaks apart nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the Earth 's stratosphere , allowing them to reform as nitric oxide ( NO ) . This molecule destroys ozone in the same way that chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) do . <p> " The effect is like the current ozone hole , but spread over the globe , " Thomas says . <p> Ozone protects life on Earth from the sun 's ultraviolet rays . By shattering this atmospheric shield , an astrophysical blast could lead to higher rates of DNA and protein damage in organisms from greater sunlight exposure . <p> Thomas ' group has previously determined that a relatively close GRB could destroy 75 percent of the ozone in certain regions , with a globally averaged depletion of around 35 to 40 percent . In contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at most 60 percent depleted but only accounts for a globally-averaged depletion of 3 to 5 percent . <p> Thomas says that the ozone destruction would begin as soon as the radiation hits , and would continue for several years . It may take more than a decade for the Earth 's ozone shield to return to full strength . <p> Fried plankton <p> The loss of ozone would have serious effects on life across the planet . One of the most susceptible organisms would be phytoplankton . These single-celled organisms live at the top of the water column , where UV light is able to reach . They also reproduce quickly , so DNA damage would accumulate over several generations . <p> If phytoplankton began dying off , the effects would ripple throughout the ocean , since these photosynthetic microbes are the base of the marine food chain . They also produce at least half of the world 's oxygen . <p> The team has selected a couple representative species of phytoplankton to irradiate at different levels , and see how their productivity levels change . The results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely it is that our planet or another planet in our galaxy was zapped by a stellar eruption . <p> Possible signs of such astrophysical foul play are seen in the Ordovician extinction , which occurred 450 million years ago and resulted in the loss of 60 percent of marine invertebrates .

@@107019018 @2419018/ <h> The ocean less effective at absorbing CO2 emitted by human activity <h> In the Southern Indian Ocean , climate change is leading to stronger winds , which mix waters , bringing CO2 up from the ocean depths to the surface . This is the conclusion of researchers who have studied the latest field measurements carried out by CNRS 's INSU(1) , IPEV(2) and IPSL(3) . As a result , the Southern Ocean can no longer absorb as much atmospheric CO2 as before . Its role as a ' carbon sink ' has been weakened , and it may now be ten times less efficient than previously estimated . The same trend can be observed at high latitudes in the North Atlantic . <p> The increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere , which is the cause of climate warming , is the result of human activity ( use of fossil fuels and deforestation ) . However , warming is mitigated by the oceans and by terrestrial ecosystems , which are able to absorb a large part of CO2 emissions . The oceans are the planet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have become increasingly unable to play this role , in both the northern and southern hemispheres . <p> This is what has been discovered by Nicolas Metzl and his team at IPSL 's LOCEAN(5) laboratory . Their conclusion is based on data collected by the OISO(6) Indian Ocean observation service , which was set up ten years ago with the backing of INSU , CNRS , IPEV and IPSL in order to better evaluate variations in the oceanic carbon cycle on seasonal to decadal scales . From 1998 to 2008 , the OISO observatory carried out repeated campaigns of CO2 measurements in the Southern Indian Ocean between 20 and 60-S , on board the ship Marion Dufresne(7) . The data collected , together with earlier data ( 1991-1995 ) , show that the quantity of CO2 is increasing faster in surface waters than in the atmosphere ( by 2.1 microatmospheres/year in water as opposed to just 1.7 in air ) . So although the CO2 content in the atmosphere remains higher than that in surface waters , the difference is decreasing . <p> According to Metzl , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of climate change at high latitudes , which has led to an increase in the relative difference of atmospheric pressure at latitudes between 40 and 60-S , and therefore to higher wind speeds , leading in turn to increased ocean mixing , with surface waters mixing with deep waters . Surface waters contain less CO2 than deep waters , since CO2 is taken up by the photosynthetic activity of marine phytoplankton . In addition , when these organisms die , they are deposited in deep water where they are broken down by bacteria , thus enriching the deep water in CO2 . Thus when there is increased wind mixing of the ocean , greater amounts of CO2 are carried from the deep layers to the surface and , as a result , the ocean 's ability to absorb atmospheric CO2 is diminished .. This is the first time that field measurements have confirmed the role of climate change in the oceanic carbon cycle in the southern hemisphere . <p> The IPSL researchers used their data to estimate the efficiency of the oceanic carbon sink on a larger geographical scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data from the OISO program with other international oceanic CO2 data .

The carbon sink probably absorbs ten times less carbon than previously estimated : 0.05 gigatonnes of carbon/year ( GtC/year ) as opposed to 0.5 GtC/year . <p> Metzl and his colleagues also took part in analysing the oceanic CO2 sink in the North Atlantic(8) , combining data collected in the region since 1993(9) with other international data . The conclusion is that the CO2 sink diminished by 50% between 1996 and 2005 in the North Atlantic . The mechanism proposed by the researchers appears for the moment to be connected more to fluctuating weather conditions than to climate change(10) . <p> Routes of the OISO observation service 's oceanographic campaigns to measure CO2 , carried out on board the Marion Dufresne between 1991 and 2007 <p> Both in the northern and southern hemispheres , the last ten years have seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in atmospheric CO2 content and thus in climate warming .

March 2008 : Stratospheric ozone chemistry plays an important role for atmospheric airflow patterns Interactions between the stratospheric ozone chemistry and atmospheric air flow lead to significant changes of airflow patterns from the ground up to the stratosphere . This is the result of climate simulations , which have just been published in the journal PGeophysical Research Letters ( Brand et al , Geophys . Res . Lett . ) . Scientists at the Research Unit Potsdam of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research , which is a member of the Helmholtz Association , have investigated a fundamental process for climate interactions in the Arctic .

It 's a spacious oscillation of the atmosphere that is characterised by opposing anomalies in air pressure in the central Arctic region and in parts of the mid- and subtropical latitudes .

In the positive phase , which has been predominant since 1970 , the polar vortex during winter times is stable and the exchange of air masses between the mid- and higher latitudes is limited .

At the two upper levels , the vortex area has increased less than at the lower levels and is now oscillating around the 1979-2007 mean . <p> The longitudinally averaged heat flux between 45-S and 75-S is an indication of how much the stratosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 , the heat flux was oscillating around the 1979-2007 average . In mid-July , the heat flux decreased somewhat and has , since then , been below the 1979-2007 average . This is a sign of a stable vortex . <p> At the altitude of 18 km the vortex is now almost entirely depleted of HCl , one of the reservoir gases that can be transformed to active chlorine . In the sunlit collar along the vortex edge there is 1.0 - 1.6 ppb of active chlorine ( ClO ) , and some first signs of ozone depletion are visible . The south polar vortex is more concentric in 2008 than in 2007 , and this has led to a relatively late onset of ozone depletion . <p> As the sun returns to Antarctica after the polar night , it is expected that ozone destruction will speed up . It is still too early to give a definitive statement about the development of this year 's ozone hole and the degree of ozone loss that will occur . This will , to a large extent , depend on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that the 2008 ozone hole will be smaller than the 2006 ozone hole but larger than the one of 2007 . <p> WMO and the scientific community will use ozone observations from the ground , from balloons and from satellites together with meteorological data to keep a close eye on the development during the coming weeks and months
