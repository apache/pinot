/**
 * Background thread to refresh the realtime lucene index readers for supporting
 * near-realtime text search. The task maintains a queue of realtime segments.
 * This queue is global (across all realtime segments of all realtime/hybrid tables).
 *
 * Each element in the queue is of type {@link RealtimeLuceneIndexRefreshState.RealtimeLuceneReaders}.
 * It encapsulates a lock and all the realtime lucene readers for the particular realtime segment.
 * Since text index is also create on a per column basis, there will be as many realtime lucene
 * readers as the number of columns with text search enabled.
 *
 * Between each successive execution of the task, there is a fixed delay (regardless of how long
 * each execution took). When the task wakes up, it pick the RealtimeLuceneReadersForRealtimeSegment
 * from the head of queue, refresh it's readers and adds this at the tail of queue.
