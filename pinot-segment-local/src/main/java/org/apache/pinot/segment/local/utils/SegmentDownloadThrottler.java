/**
 * Used to throttle the total concurrent segment downloads that can happen on a given Pinot server. This throttler
 * works with the table level semaphore for deep store downloads. This throttler will also be used for peer downloads.
 * Note: the table level semaphore is only used for downloads from deep store.
 * - The table level semaphore is to ensure that each table's segment download is not starved under scenarios where a
 *   table is flooded with a large number of new / updated segments.
 * - This server level semaphore is meant to protect the Pinot server from resource exhaustion due to too many parallel
 *   downloads occurring at once.
 * Lock ordering (for download from deep store):
 * - Table semaphore
 * - Server semaphore
