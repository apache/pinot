## Publish helm repo

- Update Helm Verison:

Update `Chart.yaml` file for fields: `appVersion` and `version`.

- Package Helm Charts

Run below command to package Pinot Chart.
```
helm package pinot
```
This step will generate a `pinot-${version}.tgz` file.

- Index all the packages:

```
helm repo index .
```
This step will generate an `index.yaml` file which contains all the Charts information.

Update generated `index.yaml` accordingly:
- Revert the changes for all previous Charts;
- Change `entries.pinot.source` to `https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/tree/master/kubernetes/helm`.
