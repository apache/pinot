/**
 * Class to support multiple http GET operations in parallel by using
 * the executor that is passed in.
 *
 * This is a wrapper around Apache common HTTP client.
 *
 * The execute method is re-usable but there is no real benefit to it. All
 * the connection management is handled by the input HttpConnectionManager.
 * Note that we cannot use SimpleHttpConnectionManager as it is not thread
 * safe. Use MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager as shown in the example
 * below
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *    List<String> urls = Arrays.asList("http://www.linkedin.com", "http://www.google.com");
 *    MultiGetRequest mget = new MultiGetRequest(Executors.newCachedThreadPool(),
 *           new MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager());
 *    CompletionService<GetMethod> completionService = mget.execute(urls);
 *    for (int i = 0; i < urls.size(); i++) {
 *      GetMethod getMethod = null;
 *      try {
 *        getMethod = completionService.take().get();
 *        if (getMethod.getStatusCode() >= 300) {
 *          System.out.println("error");
 *          continue;
 *        }
 *        System.out.println("Got data: " +  getMethod.getResponseBodyAsString());
 *      } catch (ExecutionException e) {
 *         if (Throwables.getRootcause(e) instanceof SocketTimeoutException) {
 *           System.out.println("Timeout");
 *         }
 *      } finally {

 *          getMethod.releaseConnection();
