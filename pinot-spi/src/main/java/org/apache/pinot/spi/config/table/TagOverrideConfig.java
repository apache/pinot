/**
 * This config will allow specifying overrides to the tags derived from tenantConfig.
 * Supported override keys:
 *  - realtimeConsuming - value specifies the tag to be used for realtime consuming segments
 *  - realtimeCompleted - value specifies the tag to be used for realtime segments that are in ONLINE state.
 *
 * If a value is specified for the key 'realtimeCompleted' then realtime segments, once completed, will be moved
 * from the machines that consumed the rows in the segment to a pool of machines tagged with this value.
 *
 * These fields expect the complete tag name including the suffix, unlike the tenantConfig server and broker
 * where the suffix is added automatically. However the suffix in these tag names has to be one of OFFLINE
 * or REALTIME (for the present. We may extend it to have other tag suffixes later).
 *
 * Basic validation of the tags does happen when the table is being added. The validations include:
 * 1) checking if the suffix is correct (must be either _OFFLINE or _REALTIME)
 * 2) checking if instances with the tag exist
 *
