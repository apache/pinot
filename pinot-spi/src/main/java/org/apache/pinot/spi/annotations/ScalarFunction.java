/**
 * Annotation Class for Scalar Functions.
 *
 * Methods annotated using the interface are registered in the FunctionsRegistry, and can be used for transform and
 * filtering during record ingestion, and transform and post-aggregation during query execution.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *   1. The annotated method must be under the package of name 'org.apache.pinot.*.function.*' to be auto-registered.
 *   2. The following parameter types are supported for auto type conversion:
 *     - int/Integer
 *     - long/Long
 *     - float/Float
 *     - double/Double
 *     - String
 *     - byte[]
