/**
 * An interface to be implemented by streams consumed using Pinot LLC consumers.
 * Pinot expects a stream partition to be a queue of messages. Each time a message
 * is appended to the queue, the offset of that message should be higher than all
 * the previous messages appended to the queue. Messages will be retrieved (by Pinot)
 * in the order in which they were appended to the queue.
 *
 * This object represents a direct reference to a message within a stream partition.
 *
 * The behavior of the {@link #compareTo(Object other)} method when comparing offsets
 * across partitions is undefined. Pinot will not invoke this method to compare offsets
 * across stream partitions
 *
 * It is useful to note that these comparators and serialization methods should not change
 * across versions of the stream implementation. Pinot stores serialized version of
 * the offset in metadata. Also, Pinot may consume a message delivered by earlier (or later)
 * versions of the stream implementation
