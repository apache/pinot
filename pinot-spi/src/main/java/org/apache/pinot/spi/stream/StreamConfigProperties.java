   * Row count flush threshold for realtime segments. This behaves in a similar way for HLC and LLC. For HLC,
   * since there is only one consumer per server, this size is used as the size of the consumption buffer and
   * determines after how many rows we flush to disk. For example, if this threshold is set to two million rows,
   * then a high level consumer would have a buffer size of two million.
   *
   * For LLC, this size is divided across all the segments assigned to a given server and is set on a per segment
   * basis. Assuming a low level consumer server is assigned four stream partitions to consume from and a flush
   * size of two million, then each consuming segment would have a flush size of five hundred thousand rows, for a
   * total of two million rows in memory.
   *
   * Keep in mind that this NOT a hard threshold, as other tables can also be assigned to this server, and that in
   * certain conditions (eg. if the number of servers, replicas of partitions changes) where partition
   * to server assignment changes, it's possible to end up with more (or less) than this number of rows in memory.
   *
   * If this value is set to 0, then the consumers adjust the number of rows consumed by a partition such that
   * the size of the completed segment is the desired size (see REALTIME_DESIRED_SEGMENT_SIZE), unless
   * REALTIME_SEGMENT_FLUSH_TIME is reached first)
