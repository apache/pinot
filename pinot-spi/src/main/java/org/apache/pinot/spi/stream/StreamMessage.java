/**
 * Represents a Stream message which includes the following components:
 * 1. record key (optional)
 * 2. record value (required)
 * 3. StreamMessageMetadata (optional) - encapsulates record headers and metadata associated with a stream message
 *  (such as a message identifier, publish timestamp, user-provided headers etc)
 *
 * Similar to value decoder, each implementing stream plugin can have a key decoder and header extractor.
 * If the key and header extractions are enabled for the table, the schema will automatically contain these fields as:
 * "__header$HEADER_KEY" or "__metadata$RECORD_TIMESTAMP"
 *
 * These columns can be treated similar to any other Pinot table column.
 *
 * Usability note: In order to achieve this, table configuration should enable "populate metadata" option.
 * Additionally, the pinot table schema should refer these fields. Otherwise, even though the fields are extracted,
 * they will not materialize in the pinot table.
