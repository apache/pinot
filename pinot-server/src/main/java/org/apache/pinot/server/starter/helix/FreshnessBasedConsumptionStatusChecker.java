 * This class is used at startup time to have a more accurate estimate of the catchup period in which no query

 * for each consuming segment, we check if either:
 *   - the segment's latest ingested offset has reached the current stream offset that's
 *   - the last ingested message is within {@link #_minFreshnessMs} of the current system time
