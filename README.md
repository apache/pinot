# Apache Pinot (incubating)

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-pinot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-pinot) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/apache/incubator-pinot/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/apache/incubator-pinot) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/linkedin/pinot](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/linkedin/pinot?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/apache/pinot.svg)](LICENSE)

Apache Pinot is a realtime distributed OLAP datastore, which is used to deliver scalable real time analytics with low latency. It can ingest data from offline data sources (such as Hadoop and flat files) as well as online sources (such as Kafka). Pinot is designed to scale horizontally.

These presentations on Pinot give an overview of Pinot:

## Key Features

- A column-oriented database with various compression schemes such as Run Length, Fixed Bit Length
- Pluggable indexing technologies - Sorted Index, Bitmap Index, Inverted Index, Star-Tree Index
- Ability to optimize query/execution plan based on query and segment metadata
- Near real time ingestion from Kafka and batch ingestion from Hadoop
- SQL like language that supports _selection, aggregation, filtering, group by, order by, distinct_ queries on fact data
- Support for multivalued fields
- Horizontally scalable and fault tolerant 

Because of the design choices we made to achieve these goals, there are certain limitations present in Pinot:

- Pinot is not a replacement for database i.e it cannot be used as source of truth store, cannot mutate data 
- Not a replacement for search engine i.e full text search, relevance not supported
- Query cannot span across multiple tables

Pinot works very well for querying time series data with lots of Dimensions and Metrics. Example - Query (profile views, ad campaign performance, etc.) in an analytical fashion (who viewed this profile in the last weeks, how many ads were clicked per campaign). 

## Instructions to build Pinot
More detailed instructions can be found at [Quick Demo](https://pinot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) section in the documentation.
```
# Clone a repo
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git
$ cd incubator-pinot

# Build Pinot
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pbin-dist

# Run the Quick Demo
$ cd pinot-distribution/target/apache-pinot-incubating-<version>-SNAPSHOT-bin
$ bin/quick-start-offline.sh
```

## Deploy Pinot on Kubernetes
Please refer to [Kubernetes Readme](kubernetes/helm/README.md) to deploy Pinot using [Helm](<https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm> and load demo data set.

Pinot also provides k8s integration with interactive query engine [Presto](kubernetes/helm/presto-coordinator.yaml) and data visualization tool [Apache Superset](kubernetes/helm/superset.yaml).
