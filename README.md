# What is Apache Pinot?

[Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org) is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore, built to deliver scalable real-time analytics with low latency. It can ingest from batch data sources (such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, Google Cloud Storage) as well as stream data sources (such as Apache Kafka).

Pinot was built by engineers at LinkedIn and Uber and is designed to scale up and out with no upper bound. Performance always remains constant based on the size of your cluster and an expected query per second (QPS) threshold.

For getting started guides, deployment recipes, tutorials, and more, please visit our project documentation at [https://docs.pinot.apache.org](https://docs.pinot.apache.org).

## Features

Pinot was originally built at LinkedIn to power rich interactive real-time analytic applications such as [Who Viewed Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/),  [Company Analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/insights/),  [Talent Insights](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-insights), and many more. [UberEats Restaurant Manager](https://eng.uber.com/restaurant-manager/) is another example of a customer facing Analytics App. At LinkedIn, Pinot powers 50+ user-facing products, ingesting millions of events per second and serving 100k+ queries per second at millisecond latency.

* **Fast Queries**: Filter and aggregate petabyte data sets with P90 latencies in the tens of milliseconds—fast enough to return live results interactively in the UI.

* **High Concurrency**: With user-facing applications querying Pinot directly, it can serve hundreds of thousands of concurrent queries per second.

* **SQL Query Interface**: The highly standard SQL query interface is accessible through a built-in query editor and a REST API.

* **Versatile Joins**: Perform arbitrary fact/dimension and fact/fact joins on petabyte data sets.

* **Column-oriented**: a column-oriented database with various compression schemes such as Run Length, Fixed Bit Length.

* [**Pluggable indexing**](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing): pluggable indexing technologies including [timestamp](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/timestamp-index), [inverted](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/inverted-index), [StarTree](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/star-tree-index), [Bloom filter](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/bloom-filter), [range](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/range-index), [text](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/text-search-support), [JSON](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/json-index), and [geospatial](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/geospatial-support) options.

* **Stream and batch ingest**: Ingest from [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), and [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) in real time. Batch ingest from Hadoop, Spark, AWS S3, and more. Combine batch and streaming sources into a single table for querying.

* **Upsert during real-time ingestion**: update the data at-scale with consistency

* **Built-in Multitenancy**: Manage and secure data in isolated logical namespaces for cloud-friendly resource management.

* **Built for Scale**: Pinot is horizontally scalable and fault-tolerant, adaptable to workloads across the storage and throughput spectrum.

* **Cloud-native on Kubernetes**: Helm chart provides a horizontally scalable and fault-tolerant clustered deployment that is easy to manage using Kubernetes.

## When should I use Pinot?

Pinot is designed to execute real-time OLAP queries with low latency on massive amounts of data and events. In addition to real-time stream ingestion, Pinot also supports batch use cases with the same low latency guarantees. It is suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion. Pinot works very well for querying time series data with lots of dimensions and metrics.

Example query:
```SQL
SELECT sum(clicks), sum(impressions) FROM AdAnalyticsTable
  WHERE
       ((daysSinceEpoch >= 17849 AND daysSinceEpoch <= 17856)) AND
       accountId IN (123456789)
  GROUP BY
       daysSinceEpoch TOP 100
```

## Building Pinot

```
# Clone a repo
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/pinot.git
$ cd pinot

# Build Pinot
# -Pbin-dist is required to build the binary distribution
# -Pbuild-shaded-jar is required to build the shaded jar, which is necessary for some features like spark connectors
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Pbin-dist -Pbuild-shaded-jar

# Run the Quick Demo
$ cd build/
$ bin/quick-start-batch.sh
```

For UI development setup refer this [doc](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-controller/src/main/resources/Readme.md).

Normal Pinot builds are done using the `./mvnw clean install` command.

However this command can take a long time to run.

For faster builds it is recommended to use `./mvnw verify -Ppinot-fastdev`, which disables some plugins that are not actually needed for development.

More detailed instructions can be found at [Quick Demo](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/getting-started/quick-start) section in the documentation.

## Deploying Pinot to Kubernetes
Please refer to [Running Pinot on Kubernetes](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/getting-started/kubernetes-quickstart) in our project documentation. Pinot also provides Kubernetes integrations with the interactive query engine, [Trino](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/integrations/trino) [Presto](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/integrations/presto), and the data visualization tool, [Apache Superset](helm/superset.yaml).
