The program is the critical link in Heartland Care Partners ' ability to offer a full continuum of post-acute care services from our skilled nurse practitioners to our hospice practitioners . <h> FILLING A CRITICAL GAP WITH ADVANCED DISEASE MANAGEMENT <p> The Advanced Disease Management ( ADM ) program is a palliative service that provides nurse practitioner consultative services designed to help minimize the impact of a patient 's advanced disease through education , pain and symptom management , better patient outcomes , counseling regarding complex health care options , reduced rehospitalizations and advanced care planning , as well as coordination of care across the continuum . <p> Read More <p> Referrals primarily come from patients ' attending physicians , oncologists and hospitalists , skilled nursing facilities , assisted living facilities , community referrals , as well as hospice . Heartland Care Partners staff processes the referrals and matches patients with nurse practitioners . Visits with patients number about 2,000 per month in which a dedicated , palliative care-trained nurse practitioner spends on average about one and a half hours providing a comprehensive assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse practitioners work collaboratively with patients , families , referral sources and physicians in providing appropriate palliative care interventions related to diseases such as cancer , heart disease , pulmonary disease , Alzheimer 's disease and disease combinations . These- palliative service consultation visits can be performed in a variety of care settings including skilled nursing centers , assisted living centers , memory care communities and at home . The ADM program is unique in that services can follow patients from one care setting to another across the continuum of care . <p> New patient referrals are processed through Heartland Care Partners ' central intake department and seen by an ADM nurse practitioner within three to five business days . Documentation is maintained through electronic medical record , and a follow-up visit is determined by the nurse practitioner based on the individual patient 's needs . Currently , the program receives more than 400 referrals a month , while maintaining an active daily patient census of nearly 1,400 patients . Patients on service continue to benefit from palliative services to meet their needs until either electing hospice care , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active patients elect hospice care each month , and nearly 85 percent of these choose Heartland Hospice as their provider . <p> Advanced care planning discussions and complex pain and symptom management are the foundation of palliative services . This can be especially important in managing patients who have had frequent rehospitalizations . In fact , patients with two or more rehospitalizations in a 30-day window may be prime candidates for an ADM referral . Rehospitalization rates for patients in the ADM program are less than 3 percent on average . Nurse practitioners spend an average of two hours each visit performing an assessment of each patient 's advanced directives , code status and pain levels while providing education , pain and symptom management , counseling and advanced care planning . <h> HOSPICE CARE VS .

As a family , we 'd worked carefully to be certain Dad would be all right following Mom 's death four years ago . Even at age 85 , he continued to be very active and worked every day at his insurance office in Milford , Ohio . About two years ago , dementia began to creep into Dad 's day-to-day living , and it accelerated as time went on . We were able to move Dad from the home he 'd been in for over 50 years into a provider in Milford for about a year and a half .

The final few weeks for Dad were very difficult for him with the dementia and congestive heart failure . Again , Arden Courts was able to compensate and make the needed adjustments , even when we needed to bring hospice help in the last few days .

An additional 1,200 people are hurt and another 150 die annually in the 11,600 fires caused by candles during the holiday season . Property loss from those fires is estimated to be $173 million . So it pays to follow a few common-sense steps for a carefree holiday season . <p> - <h> Lights <p> If you 're using lights of any kind , inside or out , check them carefully before you plug in .

If wires look old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if sockets are cracked or broken , or there is a loose connection , discard the lights . When replacing any burned out bulbs , make sure the new bulb is the correct wattage . <p> Make sure all of your holiday lights and decorations bear the mark of a recognized testing lab like UL- to show they meet safety standards . Also check the package information to determine if lights are approved for usage inside , outside or both . Never plug more than 3 strands of lights into an extension cord , and use a UL or ETL rated extension cord designated for indoor or outdoor use . <p> When hanging exterior lights , use plastic clips or hooks designed for use with light strings . Never tack them up with metal staples .

Place the candle away from any combustible materials like plastic , fabric , evergreen trees and other plants . Keep candle wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch before you light them , and only burn for one hour per inch of candle diameter . Tapers or pillar candles should be disposed of when they burn down to two inches , and jar candles are done when there is one inch of wax at the bottom . Do n't forget to extinguish all candles when you leave the room or go to bed . Gently blow on the flame or use a candle snuffer to keep from spattering hot wax . <p> You may also consider using flameless candles .

Flameless candles give you all the atmosphere of a real candle with none of the fire hazards . <p> - <h> Trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check the tree for freshness by looking for nice green needles that bend instead of breaking , and are firmly attached to the branch .

When you put the tree up , make sure it always has plenty of fresh water . Place it away from fireplaces , radiators , heat vents and doorways . <p> Artificial trees can also be a fire hazard if not used properly . Only purchase a fire resistant artificial tree , and just like a real tree , keep it away from the fireplace or any home heat source .

Avoid using tinsel or garlands made of tinsel which can cause serious problems when chewed and swallowed by pets or little ones .

Medication problems are the sixth leading cause of death , so it 's important to be aware of what you 're taking , how to take it properly , and when to dispose of it . Keep a current list of all medications and supplements you currently take and understand why you take each one . It 's a good idea to list both the generic and trade name of each prescription . Store all medications in their original containers in a cool dry place , and discard after the expiration date listed on the prescription label or container . Read the labels carefully to make sure you are taking your medicine exactly the way your doctor recommends , and that the medication is what your doctor prescribed . Generic medications can vary in size , shape and color from brand to brand , but still be the same medicine , so check with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information provided with your prescription to familiarize yourself with the reason you are taking this medicine , its risks , benefits and side effects . Discuss any concerns with your doctor or pharmacist . Follow the instructions on your prescription label , and never share your medication with anyone else . If you are hospitalized or in a heath care facility , make sure your nurse double checks your wrist band when bringing your medicine . This will help to avoid errors . Medication can be a life saver , but only when used and managed correctly .

@@23922808 @3922808/ 30693 @qwx230693 <p> 13 April 2015 <h> How Do I Know When It 's Time To Consider Placement in a Facility <h> Bill E. Beckwith , Ph.D . <p> - <p> Placement in a memory care or skilled- nursing unit is a very difficult and gut- wrenching decision , one of the most- stressful decisions I have ever seen- anyone make . Most people suffering- from a dementing condition are cared for- at home by either their spouse or one of- their children . However , there may come- a time when a caregiver can no longer- safely manage alone at home. - <p> The most typical reasons for placement- are behavioral problems ( e.g. , wandering , - aggression , delusions , hallucinations ) , - incontinence , refusal of personal care , - and/or caregiver illness or stress. - Unfortunately , placement is usually- secondary to a crisis rather than a- planned extension of care . Placement- is better executed as part of a palliative- and safe memory care plan rather than- a reaction to a crisis . The objective is to- continue to engage in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lost abilities can no longer be- restored. - <p> When I work with a couple early in the- disease process ( stage 2 or 3 ) we devise- a long-term plan to pursue in case there- is further decline . We devise a strategy- for monitoring and adjusting care that- gradually transfers decision making- over the course of several years , as- that is the typical course of dementias- like Alzheimer 's disease . As decline- progresses there is a transition from- self-care to needing various types of- external support . Using outside resources- such as companions and aids is a natural- component of any good plan and helps- both the person with the decline as well- as the caregiver function better and- allows adaptation to external supports- for care. - <p> - <p> When external care and companions are- an integral component of caregiving all- along , placement is often less traumatic- as there is no single caregiver or place- of care . When placement is desired , it- may help to place in steps rather than all- at once . For example , getting involved- in lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change- for all involved . Because proactive- transitions are slower , familiarity can be- established with the new environment- and staff before moving in . The major- factor to consider in choosing a facility- is personalized programming that keeps- resident engaged rather than passive. - Even persons with middle stage dementia- need stimulation ; so care needs to- be active . Care needs to emphasize- productivity rather than competence. - <p> Finally , these decisions are- best made with the help- of a knowledgeable and- skilled professional who can- compassionately guide all through- this difficult process . There are- many excellent ways to monitor the- changes in cognitive decline with- the intention of helping all involved- be more proactive rather than- reactively responding to decline . It- is critical to have placement done- with support for both the person- who has declined and those who- are intimately involved in their care. -
