Audemars started producing component parts for movements and Piguet got the job as a repasseur , whose job it is to make the final regulation of the timepiece . They founded a firm later known as Audemars Piguet et Cie . Since 1882 , members of the Audemars and Piguet families have always sat at the Board of directors and directly or indirectly run the company . <p> Audemars managed the production and monitoring the technical part , and Piguet focusing on sales . However , instant success was not to come . The two talented watchmakers focused on the production of accurate watches with sophisticated mechanisms . After the company formation , Audemars Piguet opened its new branch in Geneva . Since 1889 , the company has created its own components and assemblies within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only products of the highest quality are permitted to be launched into the market . Between 1894 and 1899 the company produced about 1,200 timepieces . These included many watch complications . When the founders Jules Audemars and Edward Piguet died , in 1918 and 1919 respectively , the company continued its activity steadily growing and expanding its fame and prestige . Later Audemars Piguet launched several watches such as the world 's smallest minute repeater and a jumping second pocket watch . In 1925 Audemars Piguet amazed its supporters with the release of its thinnest pocket watch . Only three years later the company created the world 's first skeletonized watch . As the success of the company 's business grew , its customer base expanded to include Tiffany &amp; Co , Cartier and Bulgari . During World War II the manufacturer began producing ultra-thin chronographs , the heart of which was Calibre 2003 . The sales of Audemars Piguet grew further in the forties and fifties . Together with Jaeger LeCoultre it designed the thinnest automatic movement . The latter included a 21 carat gold rotor placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical watches with hexagonal screws that fastened a porthole-like bezel . Thus was born the Royal Oak , in honor of the British Royal Navy 's line of ships bearing the same name . The Royal Oak is among many of the most specialized and complex watches produced by this famous manufactory , and , designed by Gerald Genta , easily the most recogizable . Today Audemars Piguet maintains one of the leading positions in Swiss watchmaking . Audemars Piguet produces less than 16,000 watches each year , equating to less than 45 for each day of the year . Thus , when one wears an Audemars Piguet wristwatch , one is wearing a rare watch indeed . 31472 @qwx651472 31495 @qwx651495 31494 @qwx651494 31493 @qwx651493 31495 @qwx651495 31494 @qwx651494 31493 @qwx651493

Lange &amp; Shne was first established in 1845 by Ferdinand Adolph Lange in the little known town of Glasshutte ( near Dresden in Saxony ) . Today it is the registered trademark of Lange Uhren GmbH .

It was only after the German reunification in 1990 , that the founder 's great grandson , Walter Lange , began reviving the company .

All Lange watches are mechanical rather than quartz-driven , and , with the exception of a few special edition watches , all Lange cases are made of precious metals ( gold or platinum ) rather than steel . All Lange movements are developed , manufactured , and assembled in-house . Lange is also a pioneer in watchmaking technology . For example , it developed a rare double-split chronograph that enables a wearer to time two events for up to 30 minutes . The company also developed an innovative fusee winding system used in certain models including the Tourbograph . More recently , on March 15 , 2007 , the company unveiled the culmination of a multi-year effort to produce the first wearable mechanical watch with a 31-day power reserve ( The Lange 31 ) : that is , a watch that need be wound only once per month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power reserve for a month , the brand 's watchmakers used two stacked mainspring barrels that store the required energy . The big-sized barrels made it necessary to apply two mainsprings that are 5-10 times longer than those found in other wristwatch movements . At this point , Lange specialists faced a serious problem - a common winding crown train was not suitable for winding such strong mainsprings . To solve that problem , the watchmakers used the key technology of A. Lange &amp; Sohne pocket watches . Some Lange admirers lauded these technological achievements , while others expressed skepticism that there would be a significant market for this very large ( 46 mm wide by 16 mm deep ) and expensive platinum-cased watch . Lange watches tend to have a highly distinctive appearance . For example , the iconic 38.5 mm Lange 1 model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key components : a dial containing the hour and minute hands , a smaller dial containing the second hand , a double window containing oversized digits for the date , and an ab-auf meter registering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . Lange 's watches are often described as more austere or Teutonic in appearance than comparable watches produced by Patek Philippe and similar Swiss firms . Lange watches typically feature a display back a transparent surface on the back of the watch that permits exceptional views of the timekeeping mechanism at work .

Its octagonal shape , steel edges and the use of prominent hexagonal screws as a design feature strike a perfect balance between power and elegance . Worthy of its name , the Royal Oak has since become a legend . <p> Audemars Piguet watchmakers found themselves confronted with a new challenge : to reinterpret the classical watch for a new age . The solution they came up with is the refined heir to an aristocratic lineage : the peerless Royal Oak . Its octagonal design , originally produced only in high-grade steel , took the breath away even of many professionals . When the initial shock abated , some in the industry hinted that Audemars Piguet had taken a wrong turning . However , when the Royal Oak was unveiled at the 1972 European watchmaking fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unheard of for a watch bearing the Audemars Piguet name its success was beyond even its creators ' expectations ! <p> The legend of the oak stretches back to the dawn of history , when man discovered the virtues of wood as a toolmaking material . The oak 's structural strength was prefigured in the majesty of the tree itself . The oak has another , more recent association with majesty . In 1651 after the Battle of Worcester , King Charles the II of England , Scotland and Wales found refuge from pursuers in the hollow of an ancient oak . A ' royal oak ' indeed . The name Royal Oak was adopted by the Royal Navy for a series of vessels of the line , in the days at the height of imperial glory when Britain ' ruled the waves ' . The ships naturally distinguished themselves , in the Napoleonic wars and in the great wars of this century . It is this ancient , royal and naval heritage of the name Royal Oak that inspired Audemars Piguet in the creation of a legendary watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the starting point for this virile design . The choice of an octagonal form , with a bezel secured by hexagonal screws in white gold , followed naturally . And how does one turn a hexagonal screw , to drive it home ? That is just one of the closely guarded trade secrets of the engineers and designers in Le Brassus . The rugged look of this luxury sports watch is emphasized by the use of steel , satin-finished to highlight the quality of the Royal Oak 's design . The bezel 's rounded contours , somewhat soften the impact . The Royal Oak is also distinctive as the first successful use of integrated design , for watch and bracelet . The octagonal porthole motif is echoed in the bracelet , with its hand-made links of progressively diminishing size . 31472 @qwx651472 31495 @qwx651495 31494 @qwx651494 31493 @qwx651493 <p> About Audemars Piguet 31495 @qwx651495 31494 @qwx651494 31493 @qwx651493

Michelle desired to reiterate the concept of forms and shapes integrated within the watchs movement , this time with a visual scene centered on the symbolic themes of the Tiger and the Dragon , with a tiger and a dragon clutching the tourbillon movement . Created from 3N red gold , the figures are carved and incised entirely by hand . Special miniature tools were specifically made for the specific artistry required in the physical realization of these two creatures . To increase the realism of these special animals , a long and painstaking process of hand finished micro painting was executed , also including the unseen parts of these two marvelous entities . <p> The tiger and dragon have deeply influenced Asian culture . The Tiger , considered as Yang supremacy , therefore male , was viewed as a demon hunter .

Today we closely associate it with prosperity and happiness . <p> The three-part barrel-shaped case is highly curved which means the watch is comfortable to wear but considerable time is required for its production and quality control . The ergonomic and visually distinctive curvature of the case is typical of all Richard Mille timepieces , requiring absolute precision and a total lack of tension in the metal .

Michelle desired to reiterate the concept of forms and shapes integrated within the watchs movement , this time with a visual scene centered on the symbolic themes of the Tiger and the Dragon , with a tiger and a dragon clutching the tourbillon movement . Created from 3N red gold , the figures are carved and incised entirely by hand . Special miniature tools were specifically made for the specific artistry required in the physical realization of these two creatures . To increase the realism of these special animals , a long and painstaking process of hand finished micro painting was executed , also including the unseen parts of these two marvelous entities . <p> The tiger and dragon have deeply influenced Asian culture .

All Lange movements are developed , manufactured , and assembled in-house . Lange is also a pioneer in watchmaking technology . For example , it developed a rare double-split chronograph that enables a wearer to time two events for up to 30 minutes . The company also developed an innovative fusee winding system used in certain models including the Tourbograph . More recently , on March 15 , 2007 , the company unveiled the culmination of a multi-year effort to produce the first wearable mechanical watch with a 31-day power reserve ( The Lange 31 ) : that is , a watch that need be wound only once per month ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month , the brand 's watchmakers used two stacked mainspring barrels that store the required energy . The big-sized barrels made it necessary to apply two mainsprings that are 5-10 times longer than those found in other wristwatch movements . At this point , Lange specialists faced a serious problem - a common winding crown train was not suitable for winding such strong mainsprings . To solve that problem , the watchmakers used the key technology of A. Lange &amp; Sohne pocket watches . Some Lange admirers lauded these technological achievements , while others expressed skepticism that there would be a significant market for this very large ( 46 mm wide by 16 mm deep ) and expensive platinum-cased watch . Lange watches tend to have a highly distinctive appearance . For example , the iconic 38.5 mm Lange 1 model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key components : a dial containing the hour and minute hands , a smaller dial containing the second hand , a double window containing oversized digits for the date , and an ab-auf meter registering the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lange 's watches are often described as more austere or Teutonic in appearance than comparable watches produced by Patek Philippe and similar Swiss firms . Lange watches typically feature a display back a transparent surface on the back of the watch that permits exceptional views of the timekeeping mechanism at work .

The Swiss watch manufacturer has dedicated a special model to him : the Ingenieur Automatic Edition ZinTdine Zidane . This Ingenieur is ideal for the super technician and will be available in a globally limited edition of 1,000 watches . <p> Although Zinedine Zidane ended his career as an active footballer two years ago , he continues to play a leading position in the hearts of his fans and live up to his status as a sporting legend . ZinTdine Zidane , a French national born in Marseilles , has been named World Footballer of the Year on three separate occasions , and in 1999 even World Sportsman of the Year . Together with his clubs Juventus Turin and Real Madrid , he collected numerous national and international titles . However , the high point of his career was undoubtedly winning the World Cup . In 1998 , Zidane captained the +quipe Tricolore to take the title in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Cup in the Netherlands . <p> In many areas , IWC Schaffhausen feels united with this outstanding athlete . Both represent values such as precision , perfection , technical competence and social responsibility in their respective fields .

This congeniality of minds is now revealed in a partnership that IWC is acknowledging with a special watch . <p> Of all the models in the IWC collection , none is better suited to Zidane than the Ingenieur Automatic . Just as Zidane loved and played impeccable football , the Ingenieur is conspicuous by its clear , functional design . An attribute common to both is their supreme technical accomplishment , which in the case of the Ingenieur is represented among other things by the IWC manufactured 80111-calibre movement .

The most important element in this case is the color coding . Only a watch in the French national colors , which are reproduced both on the dial and in the blue crocodile leather strap with its red decorative stitching , is appropriate for a footballer who played for France 108 times over a period of twelve years . One distinctive feature characterizes the glittering blue dial with its red and- white minute graduations : the Arabic numeral 10 in a brilliant shade of red stands out against the eleven appliquTd , metallically lustrous hour indices . Regarded as a magical number by footballers , the squad number 10 on the back of the strip always characterizes the striker , the brains of a team the role played by ZinTdine Zidane for many years in the +quipe Tricolore . <p> The back engraving makes the Ingenieur Automatic Edition ZinTdine Zidane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Situated at the center of the solid stainless steel back are the engraved portrait and the autograph of the sportsman , framed by the inscription ZinTdine Zidane World Champion 1998 and the model designation Ingenieur .

This Ingenieur is ideal for the super technician and will be available in a globally limited edition of 1,000 watches . <p> Although Zinedine Zidane ended his career as an active footballer two years ago , he continues to play a leading position in the hearts of his fans and live up to his status as a sporting legend . ZinTdine Zidane , a French national born in Marseilles , has been named World Footballer of the Year on three separate occasions , and in 1999 even World Sportsman of the Year . Together with his clubs Juventus Turin and Real Madrid , he collected numerous national and international titles . However , the high point of his career was undoubtedly winning the World Cup . In 1998 , Zidane captained the +quipe Tricolore to take the title in his own country and two years later to achieve victory in the European Cup in the Netherlands . <p> In many areas , IWC Schaffhausen feels united with this outstanding athlete . Both represent values such as precision , perfection , technical competence and social responsibility in their respective fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation and in environmental protection , whereas Zizou , as the football star is affectionately known by his fans , supports the fight against poverty as ambassador for the UNDP , the United Nations development program . This congeniality of minds is now revealed in a partnership that IWC is acknowledging with a special watch . <p> Of all the models in the IWC collection , none is better suited to Zidane than the Ingenieur Automatic . Just as Zidane loved and played impeccable football , the Ingenieur is conspicuous by its clear , functional design . An attribute common to both is their supreme technical accomplishment , which in the case of the Ingenieur is represented among other things by the IWC manufactured 80111-calibre movement . It obviously possesses considerable stamina thanks to its automatic , highly efficient Pellaton winding mechanism . Finally , the integral shock-absorbing system ensures a high degree of robustness , supplemented by a sturdy case water resistant to 12 bar . <p> Visually , too , this latest Ingenieur model is united with the legendary footballer Zinedine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color coding . Only a watch in the French national colors , which are reproduced both on the dial and in the blue crocodile leather strap with its red decorative stitching , is appropriate for a footballer who played for France 108 times over a period of twelve years . One distinctive feature characterizes the glittering blue dial with its red and- white minute graduations : the Arabic numeral 10 in a brilliant shade of red stands out against the eleven appliquTd , metallically lustrous hour indices . Regarded as a magical number by footballers , the squad number 10 on the back of the strip always characterizes the striker , the brains of a team the role played by ZinTdine Zidane for many years in the +quipe Tricolore . <p> The back engraving makes the Ingenieur Automatic Edition ZinTdine Zidane an absolute must for fans of this exceptional footballer . Situated at the center of the solid stainless steel back are the engraved portrait and the autograph of the sportsman , framed by the inscription ZinTdine Zidane World Champion 1998 and the model designation Ingenieur . The back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 watches . <p> The Ingenieur Automatic Edition ZinTdine Zidane was introduced by Georges Kern , CEO of IWC Schaffhausen and the world-renowned footballer himself at an exclusive event on 16 June at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris . <h> About IWC <p> Founded in 1868 by an American , Florentine Jones , in Schaffhausen , Switzerland , IWC is probably best known for its world-beating complicated timepieces . IWC is a fully integrated Watch Manufacture ; creating and assembling its own movements , parts and watches all under one roof .
