We can not give you the definitive approach ( for that you will have to study PRINCE2 , or if you want to be a programme manager , MSP ) but we can give you pointers on identifying the different species of stakeholders . <p> What are stakeholders ? Stakeholders are people , groups or organisations that have an interest in or might be affected by the outcome of a project . <p> What do stakeholders look like ? There is not , unfortunately , a stakeholder guide , marking out the distinguishing features of the different species , so you need to know how to hunt out the many types ; our diagram will give you some idea of the varieties to be found . <p> How many stakeholders will there be ? This will vary throughout the project . Aside from the several key stakeholders who will normally stick with you to the end , there will be numerous others at different levels of importance who will migrate in and out . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to honey , any number of stakeholders will appear from nowhere . As a result , it is important to identify them in an organised and timely fashion . <p> Who is responsible for stakeholder identification ? Normally the process is undertaken at programme level , but all projects must have some stakeholder engagement and this is particularly so where a project is not part of a programme . Either way , since there is n't , unfortunately , one single stakeholder expert who you can call on , it 's a task for the team . <p> What should you bear in mind about the identification process ? Think about who should be or who might want to be involved in the process . Once you 've done that get the team to cast the net wide in order to capture as many stakeholders as possible . Make sure they focus on identifying the correct stakeholders rather than on worrying about how many are found or who they are . <p> What help is there to find stakeholders ? Plenty . You could , for instance , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for views from professionals in the field you are working in , or you could research government , academic or industry reports . In the end , whatever you do , you will still at some point have to sit down as a team and brainstorm . <p> What are the top tips for identifying stakeholders ? Questions can help direct and prompt ideas in the brainstorming process . Here are a few : who is affected positively or negatively by the project ; who gains and who loses from it ; who wants it to succeed and who wants it to fail ; who has the power to make the project succeed or fail ; who makes the money decisions ; who are the positive and negative opinion leaders ; who exercises influence over other stakeholders ; who could solve particular problems ; who controls or provides or procures resources or facilities ; who has the special skills needed by the project ? <p> How should you classify your collection ? You can categorise stakeholders in different groups , such as users and beneficiaries or governance and regulators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record who they are and their interest in the project . It is also worth working out which are the key and which the minor stakeholders remembering that , as always , things can change " and that they usually will . <p> What should you remember ? One characteristic common to both the natural and the business world is that every group has individuals with varying degrees of power and influence . So you need to find individual stakeholders within the formal and informal groups in an organisation . Do not be surprised if you find that some individuals fall into more than one group or have links with other stakeholders . Good luck ! <p> Potential Stakeholders " Watch out for Links Between Them and Remember to Look for Individual Stakeholders in Organisations <p> Useful Links : <p> To find out what part poor stakeholder engagement plays in project failure , go to the OGC ( Office of Government Commerce ) . <p> The APMG has a slew of useful information about PRINCE2 accredited training options . <p> The PRINCE2 e-learning experience provides cost-effective , rich and collaborative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media such as Twitter and Facebook . <p> ILX Connect can help companies implement PRINCE2 training . <p> ILX Consultancy provides everything from maturity assessments and organisational health-checks , through ITIL , MSP and PRINCE2 implementation , to programme and project performance management .

@@24890079 @4890079/ <p> Passing exams is never simple but we can take the pain out of the experience so that you gain the qualifications you need to progress your career <p> 1 . The Background . Basics first : the PRINCE2 Qualification Scheme is developed by the APM Group with the Office of Government Commerce ( OGC ) and The Stationery Office ( TSO ) . <p> 2 . Foundation Exam Figures . The bottom line is that in 60 minutes you must get 35 out of 70 to make the 50% pass grade . There are 75 multiple-choice questions per paper including 5 trial ones for which the scores do n't count . More details can be found on training provider exam pages and from the APMG . <p> 3 . Foundation Exam Facts . The Foundation exam is aimed at establishing if you will be able to act as an informed member of a project management team using PRINCE2 in an environment that supports it . To pass you 'll need to show that you understand the principles and terminology of the method . So you must show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight components , eight processes and sub-processes and the techniques . You must state which management products are input to , and output from , the eight processes , the main purpose and key contents of the main management products and you must state the relationships between processes , deliverables , roles and the management dimensions of a project . <p> 4 . Practitioner Exam Math . This is definitely no picnic : there are 9 questions per paper and 12 marks per question . You need to get 59 out of 108 to reach the 55% pass mark in 2 -+ hours in an objective testing format exam using only the annotated PRINCE2 manual . <p> 5 . Practitioner Exam Task . Once you 're training it 's easy to zone in on the detail of course and out of what the examiners want . They want to see that you know and can comment on explanations of processes , themes and techniques plus examples of PRINCE2 management products with regard to specific circumstances in a given scenario . You must show that you know how processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can apply that knowledge . They want evidence that you 've grasped the reasons behind the processes , themes and techniques and can tailor PRINCE2 to different project environments . <p> 6 . Set your Schedule . Every project needs a schedule and this one 's no exception . Exam day will loom before you know it ; we know ! Set up and make sure you stick your own course , revision and exam schedule and deadlines ; obviously you 'll have built in risk factors . If organisation is n't your thing then find an accredited training organisation ( ATO ) that 'll do most of the thinking for you . ILX 's Connect will guide organisations through implementing a training programme and its Support and other services will guide individuals flying solo . <p> 7 . Bone up on the Pre-course Books . OK , pre-reading yourself into a course is no fun but trust us , it 'll give you that over-used but accurate thing an edge ! This is your chance to mark out topics for tutor help and to make summary notes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the price . The best ones give free , public access to a wealth of downloads . <p> 8 . Master the PRINCE2 Manual for Practitioner Level . No need to revise like crazy , there 's time to find the answers in the manual during the exam . Right ? Wrong ! You have 2 -+ hours to get 108 marks that 's 0.72 marks every 60 seconds . What 's more you need to aim to get 100% of the 108 marks if you want a fighting chance of getting enough questions right to reach or even exceed that 55% pass mark to give you an edge in this tough promotion and job market . Time to eat , drink and sleep that PRINCE2 manual so you can turn to what you need , when you need in the exam . <p> 9 . Practise Exam Questions . The in-tray 's full and the out-tray 's empty so you try only one exam simulation or skip it altogether . Big mistake . Huge ! This is a challenging exam that 's eminently passable if you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 100% when you sit exam simulations and sit them early and regularly to gauge progress ; if you keep making the grade , the real thing should be a cinch ; if you do n't you can fix your weak areas . <p> 10 . Think Outside Course Box . When you 've got your exam head on it 's difficult to think beyond the immediate course . The best way , however , to pass PRINCE2 is through interacting with professionals , with fellow students and through finding opportunities to put learning into action both at work and through technology . How do you do all that ? Well , ask your tutor questions in class , by phone or by email , follow blogs , Twitter , go on Facebook , try games and get yourself on forums . <p> 11 . Do n't Panic in the Exam . The exam starts and you hit the ground running . Steady ! First read through everything cover to cover . Then read each question , underline key words and finally answer the question asked . Do the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch the clock , time can ebb away very quickly . And if you fail , do n't worry you can always re-take , just remember to keep calm and carry on !

Qualifications : You ca n't get away from them . They are a good way of learning and demonstrating to your employer that you have the fundamental knowledge and skills . They also show commitment to your self-development and to your career . The OGC 's Managing Successful Programmes ( MSP ) and the PMI 's Programme Management Professional ( PgMP ) are two recognised qualifications worth considering.2 . Experience : Several years of experience in dealing , not only with all the accepted nuts and bolts of project management , but also with tricky political situations and tricky people while still delivering a successful project would help to show your mettle.3 . Understanding the Role : Broad shoulders are useful as a programme manager for you are accountable for the success , and failure of course , of the programme . Responsibilities will include planning programme-level activities and schedule of projects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures and standards.4 . Multi-tasking and multiple techniques : The programme manager has a wide range of responsibilities and needs to be able to oversee multiple projects to ensure that they stay on schedule and bring benefits in keeping with the company 's strategic goals and objectives . At the same time you must factor in problems you might have as well as ways to solve them . A good knowledge of techniques needed for planning , monitoring and controlling programmes , of business change tools , of benefits identification and management techniques and of budgeting and resource allocation are all essential in getting the right end result . Success comes too from knowing how to delegate and that comes from knowing your team.5 . Excellent people skills : A trite but true requirement , for as the programme manager you will be working with highly qualified and confident people . You can expect to have to influence and deal with stakeholders whilst leading and managing multiple teams and individuals across several business units . You will also have to understand and meet their differing perspectives and needs whilst keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management skills , the ability to forge good interpersonal relationships and maintain good communication links as well as a talent for team building are some of the traits of good programme managers .

@@24890088 @4890088/ <p> PRINCE2 has facilitated the success of projects across a wide range of sectors , for companies of all sizes across the world . This dispels any misconceptions that PRINCE2 is a one-size-fits-all approach . The reality is that companies are tailoring ' PRINCE2 to make it the best fit for achieving their unique project goals . This blog will explore what it means to tailor PRINCE2 , what can be tailored , and what must remain the same . <p> The process of tailoring PRINCE2 is carried out on a project by project basis . This is very different to implementing PRINCE2 through an entire organization , i.e. embedding ' . There are a variety of reasons why organizations opt to tailor rather than embed . It can be due to company size , company culture or the frequency of long-term projects . Over-complicating your project to fulfil every facet of the PRINCE2 methodology defeats the purpose of using it in the first place . After all , one of the seven principles of PRINCE2 is tailor to suit the environment ' . <p> On the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can not be tailored . Instead , used them as a constant reference . This will let you tailor the processes and themes of PRINCE2 without compromising its integrity as a framework . Tailoring is not an arbitrary pick-and-choose method . It 's all about making sure you get the right fit for your project . Here are some specific examples on how you can tailor PRINCE2 : <p> Adapting Language and Terminology When PRINCE2 jargon conflicts with specific terms used in your business , stick to what you know . Unclear communication has been the downfall of many projects . If your company calls a business case a project case , make it easier on them and speak their language . <p> Condensing Project Documents No project team relishes administrative busywork , so do n't create more paperwork than necessary just because you 've seen it used in PRINCE2 . You can combine the Project Mandate and Project Initiation Document if the project is too small to warrant both . This means the projects necessity , strategic goals and operational directives go in one document . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles , such as Senior User , Project Assurance and Project Board Executive , may not balance out perfectly with your workforce . You should have the critical faculties to determine which roles can be combined if this is the case . The two big rules are : make sure all responsibilities are allocated and do n't  combine roles if it creates a conflict of interest . Standard examples of combined roles in a project include : <p> Executive and Senior Users on a Project Board <p> Project Managers and Team Managers <p> If you 're beginning to use PRINCE2 and certain aspects do n't fit your project , there are two things to bear in mind . First , PRINCE2 is all about best practice , and best practice does n't occur in a vacuum . Do n't follow the methodology blindly if it makes your project worse . Knowledge is great , but so is common sense . Second , if you 're relatively new to PRINCE2 , do n't let your lack of experience intimidate you from adapting it to your project .

Were not talking bedtime stories , of course , but business stories that can be just as inspiring and memorable . They 're commonly used to woo customers but can be very useful for pulling in employees to connect them to your organisation . The narrative can take many forms and include any amount and kind of information depending on circumstances . You may want to share the companys vision , highlight what makes the project special , outline employees roles within the organisation , and so on . <p> Get specific .

Just as its no good putting a square peg in a round hole , so its no good expecting meticulous people to be creative or asking ideas people to perform detailed tasks . In the chapter on Organisation PRINCE2 advises that as a project manager you should make sure that you know the characteristics and personality of the team to put them in the role in which theyll deliver the goods . <p> Train for the project .

Remember that you do n't have to organise training on your own ; the best learning companies provide 360o support by offering consulting services to make training effective . <p> Give them growing room . Were long past the days when employees had a job for life or stayed with a company for life ; people will leave at some time or other . Strange as it may seem , this makes it even more important to urge them to develop their skills and offer opportunities to develop their careers . In this way you 're more likely to get the best out of the whole team and to keep the best team members for longer . <p> Empower your team . People tend to respond to the attitudes of their leaders .

And since projects are about change and change involves risk " stuff can happen a lot . So a good manager will understand that and be prepared for risk and be supportive of people 's mistakes . One of the best ways of getting ready for risk is to aim to reduce , detect and control it " in other words to manage it using methodologies like PRINCE2 or Management of Risk . One of the best ways of being supportive is to understand the adverse effects of tiredness , stress and over-heavy workloads and do your best to minimise these problems . <p> Communicate . Whether through set departmental meetings , through chance encounters at the coffee cart or through daily chat on social media , use appropriate opportunities to communicate information , demonstrate the projects on-going feasibility , encourage perseverance , show appreciation and award rewards ; we all like being valued . <p> Create team spirit .

@@24890102 @4890102/ <p> Our previous blog showed how to apply positive project management habits to PRINCE2 . Now , we 'll look at the other side of the coin . Although project success rates are growing , project managers still struggle with many common pitfalls . Here are some of the ways PRINCE2 can prepare you for them . <p> Unclear scope <p> Every good project has a clear goal . It 's easier to assign work and correct problems when you know the end goal . Along with a clear scope , it also makes it easier to define project success . Even small changes like changing the colour of a logo create delays . When these little changes go unchecked , they can ruin projects . Here are some of PRINCE2 's tools for staying on scope : <p> Project Initiation Document ( PID ) " As the name suggests , this document is part of the Initiation stage . A complete PID will outline the project 's objectives , scope and exclusions . With these three documented , you can not only define the scope , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term issue ' to describe unplanned events that require management intervention . You ca n't stop issues from arising , but you can control how they 're handled . PRINCE2 has five steps to handling issues and keeping projects on-scope . This process is abbreviated to CEPDI : <p> Capture : Determine type of issue <p> Examine : Assess the impact of the issue on the project objectives <p> Propose : Propose actions to take <p> Decide : Someone decides to approve or reject the recommended solution <p> Implement : Put the recommended solution in action <p> Micromanagement <p> Micromanagement tends to be more prevalent among budding managers . However , managers at every level are susceptible to it , and the results are never good . Project teams should be able to get immersed in their work . Instead of fostering a babysitting ' corporate culture , consider this : <p> Manage by exception " One of PRINCE2 's 7 core principles . It means senior managers are only alerted to major process deviations . This not only gives the project team more breathing room , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management Strategy ( CMS ) " This document on how you 'll communicate with stakeholders was brought up in the previous blog , in reference to sponsors . Since everyone in the project team is also a stakeholder , the CMS should account for them . With regular meetings , the project team and team manager wo n't have to spend as much time updating you . Instead , they can raise issues without disruption . <p> Unrealistic timelines <p> Project managers are eager to make clients happy with a quick product delivery , but this often leads to overambitious estimates . It 's easier to form and stick to a realistic deadline with these tools : <p> Project Plan " Part of the Project Initiation Document ( PID ) . It details the start and end points of the project 's milestones/stages , and control points for these . By breaking the stages down , it 's easier to judge the length of the project . It will be less tempting to underestimate the project length when the stages are laid out in front of you . <p> Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control come in . After the first delivery stage , you may no longer agree with your original timeline . You can save a new version of your Project Plan with new information and estimates . Project Assurance can help devise these new estimates . Better yet , senior managers and sponsors can lend their support to get the project back on track .

Or it could be that you do n't have a Foundation qualification and want to jump straight to Practitioner . <p> To sit the Practitioner exam , you must have either a PRINCE2 Foundation , PMP , CAPM or IPMA certification . It 's not possible to make Practitioner your first project management qualification . However , you can take a joint Foundation &amp; Practitioner course . Whether you 're new to PRINCE2 or you 've already passed the Foundation exam , it 's important to know the difference between the two . <p> Foundation vs . Practitioner <p> The Foundation course teaches the basics and benefits of PRINCE2 . The final exam tests your ability to work as part of a project management team . It 's also a useful qualification for people who work with , but are n't part of , a project management team . <p> PRINCE2 Practitioner is for aspiring and existing project managers . This course shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes further than the Foundation course , explaining how PRINCE2 can be tailored to the needs of different projects . Those who work in a PRINCE2 environment but are n't project managers may prefer to stick with a Foundation certification . <p> Preparation <p> Take advantage of mock exam questions , which are available in the online and classroom course . The online course has a mock exam simulator . The classroom course has a workbook with sample examination papers . Practising the exam is the best way to prepare . It introduces you to the exam format and highlights areas you need to improve . <p> Make use of the official PRINCE2 guide , Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2 . It 's best to get it as soon as possible , as it 's also useful for studying at the Foundation level .

It 's worth buying a copy and studying it well ahead of time . <p> The Exam <p> While the Foundation exam is closed book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Practitioner exam . You can also write notes , make highlights and add earmarks to pages of the guide . However , you ca n't attach pieces of paper with extra information . This is something invigilators check for . Bear in mind that the Practitioner exam is 150 minutes long . If you 've recently passed the 60 minute Foundation exam , this may come as a shock . The questions in the Practitioner exam are more complex , so you still have to manage time wisely . <p> What 's Next <p> PRINCE2 is the de facto project management method . So for many , becoming a PRINCE2 Practitioner is a necessity . But that does n't mean that you have to stop there . After passing the Practitioner exam , you 're eligible to take the PRINCE2 Agile course . It teaches Practitioners how to deliver PRINCE2 projects using agile methods . Being able to blend these two respected methodologies will set you apart and greatly improve your skillset.

Even if you have all the relevant skills , knowledge , and experience to excel in the advertised role , the company may not consider you for the position if your CV is n't clear . <p> A good CV should highlight your professional and educational experience , as well as showing how you can contribute to the organisation . There is no standard template to land a project management job , but the best CVs have several things in common . Here are some points that you should include to make sure the organisation can clearly see why they need you on board : <p> CV Content <p> Personal details : Your name should be the document header . Keep your contact details to one phone number and one ( sensible ) email address . Your address is useful , although you can just give your town/city and postcode . Some people also include their LinkedIn profile address . <p> Career Goals : A 2 or 3 line profile can link your career objectives to your potential employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into the organisation and be of benefit to them . <p> Project Management Experience : Here you should list chronologically your experience . Include dates of employment , company name , job title , roles you have been given within projects , and your project manager responsibilities . <p> If you 're new to project management , highlight transferable skills and experience , such as communication , problem solving and leadership skills . Mention any training programmes you 've attended , such as a PRINCE2- foundation course , which demonstrates your commitment to your new career . <p> If you have considerable work experience , you may want to divide each role profile into two sections : job duties/responsibilities and achievements . Highlight the number and value of projects undertaken , experience of different industry sectors , challenges overcome , successful projects , and methodologies used and integrated . Where possible , quantify with - or % . <p> Key Skills : Whether you are IT proficient or a linguist , this is where you should highlight your hard/technical skills . List software packages used as recruiters will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific methodology or IT package , but if your CV is going through HR first , they will not be expert in your subject . Make it easy for them by telling them what you do . <p> Education/qualifications : Start with your most recent qualification and give its title , awarding body/institution where you studied and the date gained . If you have a degree ( or two ) , you do n't need to list your GCSEs or O Levels . Recent graduates should consider including thesis/dissertation title as it shows your area of interest and could provide an ice-breaker for interviews . <p> Professional activity : Include memberships of professional bodies , any involvement with committees or networking groups , articles you 've written and speaking engagements . If these are numerous , ensure they 're on your LinkedIn profile and include the link here . <p> Interests : This shows that you are a well-rounded person and that you are able to cope with work-loads . You should include interests that complement the industry or project management as well as any that show you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of a sport or musical ensemble , treasurer for a society ( showing financial acumen ) or management experience . <p> Keyword Focus : It 's important to make sure your CV is rich in industry-relevant keywords to highlight your capabilities . This could include terms such as PRINCE2 , risk management , project management . Be mindful of the acronym trap " always explain them in full , rather than making your CV jargon-heavy . Reflect the language of the organisation to which you 're applying and mirror their phrases . <p> Employment Challenges : If you have a gap in your CV , explain it " career break , redundancy , job-hunting , travelling " all of these are acceptable . <p> CV Presentation <p> Format : A CV is your chance to catch the potential employer 's attention , and you may only have a minute to do so . Use a clear font ( Arial or Times New Roman are both standard , Calibri is a little more interesting ) and a reasonable font size ( no smaller than 10pt ) . Avoid using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not travel well , electronically-speaking . If you do have complex paragraphs , columns and tables , PDF your CV once it is ready to send , thus reducing the chance of it appearing messy when opened at the other end . <p> Length : While it can be tempting to include all of your experience and education , a CV should not be your life story . Stick to 2 pages . If you have lots to say , make it 3 full pages , but not 2 and a half . Be concise and include the most marketable aspects of your career and skills to grab your potential employer 's attention . <p> Spelling and grammar : Do not rely on the colourful lines your computer provides as a method of checking spelling and grammar . Re-read your application documents before submitting them . Employers do care about spelling . <p> Covering Letter or supporting statement <p> Personalise : Your potential employer does n't want to feel as if your CV has been sent to multiple other organisations also offering a position . Find out the name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the letter accordingly . <p> Be Specific : Follow instructions " include reference numbers and where you saw the job advertised . If you are asked to address specific criteria , ensure you do . <p> Pitch Yourself : The covering letter is the chance to encourage your potential employer to look at your CV . Outline your areas of expertise and back them up with achievements and qualifications . This demonstrates how you can contribute to the business and meet the advertised job specifications . The covering letter or supporting statement is your opportunity to show how you can be of benefit to the organisation , not how this role will help you advance your career , as this sounds like you are viewing their job as a stepping stone and may not stay long . <p> Availability : Mention your availability for interview <p> Enthusiasm : Tell them you are interested in the job and their organisation .

However , when mistakes are made on projects , there is often a desire to scrub the past and start over with a new team for the next project . That 's understandable , but a lack of continuity does n't prevent mistakes from being repeated . What PRINCE2 teaches is the value of mistakes . They 're part of the learning process , and by nailing them down , you can often prevent repeat mistakes without having to overturn the project team . <p> Lessons Log <p> The Lessons Log is a record of a project 's positive and negative discoveries . It 's also a key to improvement .

Mistakes from previous projects are likely to get repeated if they 're not identified . The Starting Up phase has an activity called Capture Previous Lessons . This involves creating a Lessons Log if there is n't one already , and reviewing previous projects . Individuals , teams and even external organisations can offer insight that 's relevant to the current project . <p> Project Reviews <p> Do n't wait for the project review to start uncovering these lessons .

@@24890110 @4890110/ <p> Schedules are critical " they 're the glue that holds everything together and keeps things running smoothly , but they 're also the part of a project manager 's organisational structure that always seems to go out of the window first when things are n't going according to plan . But , as most of us know , this can just exacerbate the problem and make things far more difficult in the long run , and there a several ways to avoid falling behind schedule when those little things start to build up against you and your team . <p> In a recent review by Oxford University of 245 large dams built between 1934 and 2007 , it was discovered that each of the projects ran an average of 96% over their approved budgets and took an average of 8.2 years to build .

Many of these skills can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ILX , however . <p> It 's the simple fact that , no matter how efficient and competent a project team are , things will threaten to derail even the best teams at some point . So what can you do to avoid this becoming a terminal issue ? As well as being used to keep team members on task and make sure everything is done when it needs to be , another good use of the schedule is to track progress and report back to superiors or clients that need to be updated at regular intervals . This is why it is so important to craft your schedule around events you know will occur , such as booked holiday and appointments . <p> In most cases , the schedule comes in the form of a single document that is shared between the project manager , team members and anyone else with an interest in how things are running . This document is subject to change along the way simply because of the little bumps and triumphs that come along on the way to ultimate success but it is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schedule , rather than the other way around , that significant problems can start to arise . This is just one of the areas in which project management training such as ILX 's risk management courses , can help keep a project on track . <p> In a bid to get everything done on time or even early " demonstrated by the famous Hoover Dam completed two years ahead of schedule and around $15 million under budget " project managers can often forget that they and their team are only human , and it 's unfeasible for every minute of the day to be dedicated to complicated or time-consuming jobs . Tea breaks , watercooler chats , supply runs and other errands are all part of daily work life , and must be factored into the daily schedule as such . This is why it is almost always better to construct the schedule around the week , rather than from day to day , as this gives everyone a little extra room to move things around and fit important tasks around other everyday things that also need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each venture will have its own specific ups and downs that need to be navigated by you , the captain of the ship . As covered in the PRINCE2 training courses provided by ILX , it is part of the project manager 's job to foresee changes and additions that must be made to plans and schedules along the way and to factor these into the initial planning stages . Falling behind schedule can quickly snowball and mean that you and your team fail to meet agreed or published deadlines but , with a little foresight and good planning from the beginning , disaster can easily be avoided . 
@@24890111 @4890111/ <p> When every project is a priority and budgets are squeezed , how do you prioritise your projects ? We round up some of the things to consider so your decision is less of a gamble . <p> 1 . All Aboard : Since projects are essentially about people , consult all involved and establish which projects are supported by stakeholders , sponsors and so on to get everyone on side to meet and manage expectations.2 . Like for Like : Ensure project proposals include common data and come in standard format to be measured against common criteria to facilitate like-for-like comparisons.3 . Big Picture : Prioritising projects by finding the one that most closely meets company strategic objectives might seem like a good bet , but you need to take into account the subjective nature of human judgements . You and your colleagues may think you use a fool-proof decision-making system but you may unconsciously be inconsistent in the way you assess project alignment . Bear in mind too , that projects that seem to fit in well with a company 's vision and strategy may also involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken into account.4 . Show me the Money : Picking the project that promises the highest or quickest return on investment ( ROI ) may also feel like a safe choice . Indeed , a quick return might well appear to be preferable to a high return as risks rise while you wait for a project to deliver . It is worth remembering though , that ROI is only an estimate and that it gives a narrow picture . Costs and benefits need to be analysed with regard to stakeholders , sponsors and so forth , keeping in mind that they can be indirect or intangible and not forgetting that they can fluctuate . Resources : Remember too that factors such as time scale as well as resource requirements and capabilities need to be considered in the round . Thus the most profitable project may be so resource-hungry that other projects fold , equally , it may be that the resource-heavy project complements more completely company strategy than other proposals . Circumstances will dictate your choice and that choice could be to select a project or projects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Playing Safe : There is no doubting the attraction of picking the project with the least perceived risk but there might be a doubt about the wisdom of relying on that alone . Project risk levels may fluctuate during the project lifecycle as a result of internal or external factors ; furthermore a risky project may in fact offer the greatest ROI or customer satisfaction or even organisational benefit.6 . Paying the Price : Opportunity comes at a cost and you may need to manage the consequences of your decision to put off certain projects . As a result , you may look for an occasion to mitigate the impact of your selection by , for instance , re-allocating to held projects resources no longer needed by the top-priority project . Several heads are better than one : Decision by committee may sound like the stuff of nightmares but a senior executive team can set decision parameters and improve the chances of projects being selected on consistent goals and it will , of course , take on the responsibility.7 . Decision time : Determining which project or projects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balanced scorecard to net present value to cost/benefit analysis . A key philosophy of the approaches championed by the Office of Government Commerce is the Business Case , which can be used to determine if programmes and projects will bring the right change for the business .

@@24890114 @4890114/ <p> Closing a project is an essential skill in any business and PRINCE2 has a specific process for this purpose . For a definitive guide , you will need to do one of our courses which offer real-world-based training , but our pointers below give an overview of what is involved . <p> What is the point of the Closing a Project process in PRINCE2 ? One of the great strengths of PRINCE2 is that it has a beginning , middle and end that , rather like the Olympic Games , signal key moments . The Closing a Project process is a key moment in that it aims to give everyone a fixed point when acceptance for the project is confirmed and when original or modified objectives have been achieved . <p> Why do you need a fixed point of closure ? Take one look at projects that do n't have controlled closure and you 'll see why ! Either things come to a sudden stop or they drift endlessly on , without ever reaching a successful conclusion , and with people almost forgetting the point of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on , and on <p> What 's the objective of the process ? There are five main objectives and they involve , amongst other things , verifying user acceptance of the products , reviewing performance against baselines and dealing with issues and risks . <p> When should you plan closing activities ? Do this as part of the Stage Plan for the final management stage . Remember that there 's work to be done in preparing input to the Project Board before it can authorize closure and that the Executive should inform corporate or programme management that the project has closed . <p> What are the five activities in the Closing a Project process ? They are : prepare a planned closure , prepare a premature closure , hand over products , evaluate the project and recommend closure . <p> What must the project manager prepare ? Projects are based on results , so the PM must ensure that everything has been achieved and delivered . Action points would incorporate : updating the project plan with actuals from the final stage and confirming that the project has delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Product Checklist records major products and key delivery dates . <p> What is involved when products are handed over ? Quite a lot . Bear in mind that handover can be in phases or done in one massive operation at the end , and additionally , that life can get complicated if premature closure is involved . Broadly speaking , the actions recommended here are : preparing follow-on action recommendations to include any uncompleted work , issues and risks ; checking that the Benefits Review Plan incorporates post-project activities that will confirm those benefits that you can only measure when products have been put through their real-life paces ; examining the Configuration Management Strategy to confirm how products will be handed over . <p> How do you prepare for premature closure ? No-one wants to close a project before its due date but sometimes that 's the best option and the aim should be to do it as quickly and as efficiently as possible to avoid wasting valuable resources . Tasks include updating the issue register and seeking approval to give notice to interested departments that resources can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might you need to consider when working through the acceptance and handover process ? There 's so much we could put here . But two of the many things worth remembering are that you may need to get a legal sign off where lawyers have to approve , or have approved , documents or that you may need to get sign off from suppliers before your company will pay them . <p> How do you evaluate your project so that you do better next time ? This is a key strength of PRINCE2 for evaluation helps you , and the business , understand what happened in the project and how well you delivered so you can repeat successes and avoid failures . The actual tasks are pretty logical , like reviewing the original intent of the project , reviewing approved changes and producing an End Project Report to show how team and project performed . Do n't  forget to look at on-going product and business risks . <p> What 's involved in recommending project closure ? As the project manager you 're the one who can confirm if the project can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raised to the Project Board . Actions required here consist of tasks such as telling interested people or organisations that the project is finishing , closing all the logs and registers and archiving and securing all information . <p> Finally , what do you do for the team ? While you 're busy going through the Closing a Project process it 's easy to forget the people behind it , but projects are about people so some kind of end-of-project event " especially if it 's been a long slog will show everyone they 're appreciated . Think closing ceremony of the Olympic Games , then take it down a few hundred notches and you 've got the perfect end ! <p> Useful Links <p> Whether you 're just starting down the PRINCE2 route or whether you 're an experienced hand , it 's always good to catch up with the latest case studies and techniques and a good place to start is the PRINCE2 Downloads page which has a wealth of information for project managers . <p> The APMG has a slew of useful information about PRINCE2 accredited training options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative training that includes a blog , a forum and social media such as Twitter and Facebook . <p> ILX Connect can help companies implement PRINCE2 training . <p> ILX Consultancy provides everything from maturity assessments and organisational health-checks , through ITIL , MSP and PRINCE2 implementation , to programme and project performance management .

@@24890115 @4890115/ <p> Love them or loath them , stakeholders can make or break a project if you do n't engage with them . So we 've set out some questions you should ask about every stakeholder to help you do just that . If you 're a project manager who wants to fully understand stakeholder engagement , PRINCE2 and MSP will tell you all you need to know . <p> What is a stakeholder ? First things first , a stakeholder is anyone or any organisation that can affect or be affected by a project in any way . And by anyone , we do mean anyone ! They could be customers , suppliers , shareholders , politicians , local pressure groups , the list is almost endless . <p> What is stakeholder engagement ? No , it 's not the kind of commitment where you 'll end up walking down the aisle , but it could be as important . For this is where you manage stakeholder individuals and organisations , identifying them , communicating with them and so on . Although the process is normally undertaken at programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement , especially where a project is not part of a programme . <p> Who needs stakeholders ? You do and for better or worse you 've got them whether you like it or not ! Stakeholders are pretty much an inevitable part of every project . Think about it : as we 've already said there will be those affected and those who will affect your project , as a result there will always be someone for and someone against you ; and you can bet your bottom dollar that they wo n't be slow to act accordingly in order to help or hinder your plans . <p> Who are your stakeholders ? Blind dates are fun but not too funny in project management . The first step in stakeholder engagement is to identify who your stakeholders are to enable you to target messages . Begin by brainstorming ; remember to be systematic , to include not only current but also potential stakeholders and to include stakeholders both inside and outside your company ; this is one time when more is definitely more ! <p> What are they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stakeholders . It pays , therefore , to know who you 're dealing with . Profile them by using everything from general research to interviewing . You should end up with an idea of , amongst other things , their attitudes , interests , power and importance . <p> What makes them tick ? The secret to any successful relationship is to understand the other person .

@@24890119 @4890119/ <p> PRINCE2 is a project management methodology of 7s . The principles , themes and processes all follow this model . Here , we break down each one and discuss how they relate to each other . <p> The 7 Principles <p> PRINCE2 derives its methods from 7 core principles . Collectively , these principles provide a framework for good practice : <p> 1 . Continued Business Justification <p> A project must make good business sense . There needs to be a clear return on investment and the use of time and resources should be justified . <p> 2 . Learn from Experience <p> Project teams should take lessons from previous projects into account . A lessons log is kept updated for this purpose . <p> 3 . Define Roles and Responsibilities <p> Everyone involved in a project should know what they and others are doing . This includes knowing who the decision makers are . <p> 4 . Manage by Stages <p> Difficult tasks are better off broken into manageable chunks , or management stages . <p> 5 . Manage by Exception <p> A project running well does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project board is only informed if there is or might be a problem . <p> 6 . Focus on Products <p> Everyone should know ahead of time what 's expected of the product . Product requirements determine work activity , not the other way around . <p> 7 . Tailor to the Environment <p> PRINCE2 can be scaled and tailored . Projects that adapt PRINCE2 to their needs are more likely to succeed than projects that use PRINCE2 dogmatically . <p> The 7 Themes <p> Themes provide insight into how the project should be managed . They can be thought of as knowledge areas , or how principles are put in practice . They are set up at the beginning of the project and then monitored throughout . Projects are kept on track by constantly addressing these themes : <p> 1 . Business Case <p> Related to the continued business justification principle . This theme provides knowledge about whether a project is worthwhile and achievable . <p> 2 . Organisation <p> Related to the define roles and responsibilities principle . The organisation theme requires project managers to have everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Related to the focus on products principle . Quality can be an abstract concept , so defining it at the beginning of a project is vital to keeping the work on track . <p> 4 . Plans <p> A plan describes how targets will be achieved . It focuses on the products , timescale , cost , quality and benefits . <p> 5 . Risk <p> The purpose of this theme is to identify , assess and control uncertain events during a project . These are recorded in a risk log . Negative risks are called threats and positive ones are called opportunities . <p> 6 . Change <p> This theme is about handling change requests and issues that arise during the project . The idea is not to prevent changes , but to get them agreed on before they 're executed . <p> 7 . Progress <p> Progress is about tracking the project . This allows project managers to check and control where they are relative to the plan . Not only can projects go off the rails without this " or any one " of the themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware that it 's happening . <p> The 7 Processes <p> The PRINCE2 method also separates the running of a project into 7 processes . Each one is overseen by the project manager and approved by the project board . Here is a breakdown of each stage : <p> 1 . Starting Up a Project ( SU ) <p> Create a project mandate , which answers logistical questions about the project . It explains the purpose of the project , who will carry it out and how to execute it . <p> A project brief is derived from the mandate , lessons log and discussions with people involved in the project . <p> A team is assigned and with the brief , they should have all the information needed for next process . <p> 2 . Initiating a Project ( IP ) <p> This stage is about realising what needs to be done to complete the project . The project manager outlines how the following performance targets will be managed : <p> Time <p> Cost <p> Quality <p> Scope <p> Benefits <p> Risk <p> 3 . Directing a Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning to the end of a project . The project board manages these activities : <p> Initiation <p> Stage boundaries <p> Ad hoc direction/guidance <p> Project closure <p> 4 . Controlling a Stage ( CS ) <p> Project managers authorise work packages , which break the project down into manageable activities . These are assigned to teams and their managers . The project manager then has these tasks : <p> Overseeing and reporting on work package progress <p> Stepping in to correct problems <p> The team- manager , - meanwhile has these tasks : <p> Coordinating daily work <p> Communicating between team members and the project manager <p> 5 . Managing Product Delivery ( MP ) <p> This is how the communication between the team manager and- project- manager is controlled .

@@24890120 @4890120/ <p> Upon embarking on a brand new project with a brand new group of people , one of the only inevitabilities for project managers is the arrival of conflict between team members that they will need to resolve along the way . This may be conflict between them and a member of their team or two team members , and can be sparked by a lot of different circumstances and stressors , but it 's important for project managers to know how to quickly and effectively resolve such incidents without allowing the project itself to be negatively affected . <p> When any group of people are put together to achieve a single goal , it is always difficult to balance ideas and abilities in a way that will achieve the best results , and this is one of the areas where the controlling voice of the project manager is needed most . He or she must know and understand where everyone 's strengths and weaknesses are , listening to ideas from everyone while aligning them with each other and their own . Projects need this central point of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many common causes of conflict in project teams can be avoided from the outset . <p> That said , conflict can arise from anywhere , from the very senior level of the company right down to individual people working on the project , and this can be a hard thing to manage . It is often the case that everyone working on the project , whether remotely or in a very hands-on capacity , has different opposing ideas that ca n't be easily meshed . This is when effective communicative skills are needed , and project managers must be aware of the importance of communication and transparency when working with a team . Understanding the problem from when it arises is the first step , as misunderstandings can just aggravate things further . <p> A lot of conflict resolution sounds like common sense , but there are various schools of thought on how to achieve the best results . Dealt with badly , conflict can develop into full blown disputes that threaten to derail the entire project , but well trained project manager should be better equipped with the skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives are essentially what makes projects work and will drive them to eventual success , but if this volatile mixture is not properly managed through techniques learnt through training courses such as those provided by ILX , disaster may lie in store . <p> First , the conflict and its reasons must be acknowledged by the project manager , and then they can get on with discussing and resolving the problem before it gets out of hand . Ignoring issues within the team can lead to much more serious problems much further down the line , and even the most trivial of disputes can cause significant upset if they arise at a critical moment . If the project manager listens to and understands each person 's position on a particular task or upcoming decision , then it is easier to avoid or resolve any bumps , large or small , along the way . <p> Project managers must avoid being sucked into the argument themselves , as this essentially eradicates the go-to problem solver from the equation , but every single team member must also be open and understanding about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been clarified , it is often useful to split into smaller groups of opposing opinions in order to reconcile the team as a whole . It is useful here for the project manager to be neutral . <p> Conflict resolution can often be one of the most important parts of any project manager role , but it is important to not let it interfere with all of the other parts of the job . Avoidance is best , and many training courses can offer solutions and preventative measures for project managers to employ . 
@@24890121 @4890121/ <p> It is inconceivable for a project to succeed without collaboration between all parties responsible for its delivery . This has always been the case but today , more than ever , the size and scale of many of the projects being undertaken around the world are just too big and , more often than not , too costly for a single organisation to fund and manage . <p> Nowhere is this more evident than in the oil and gas industry , where the need to find new reserves to satisfy our energy demands becomes ever more challenging and expensive . Due to the complexity and the scale of investment required , these projects invariably become joint venture developments involving a number of operators who each hold a stake . <p> The multi-billion dollar Kashagan oil field development in the Caspian Sea is an example of one project that is being managed in this way . Identified as arguably the largest off-shore oil discovery of the last 30 years , a Joint Operating Company was set-up , which consists of a number of the world 's biggest oil companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering projects themselves , none of them are big enough or wealthy enough to oversee this project independently . The collaboration between project partners has been far from plain sailing though , with the project experiencing countless delays in its ultimate objective of bringing the field to production . <p> When one considers that at least 40 per cent , and up to 70 per cent , of joint ventures fail , it is not hard to see why the stakeholders on Kashagan have endured such a difficult time in keeping the project on course . The fact that it has not broken down completely is testament to the parties involved and a reflection of the vast capital that has been invested in the project . <p> Clearly there are many different types of joint ventures , but they all require systematic collaborative project management strategies in order to succeed . In fact , the reasons joint ventures fail invariably boil down to a common set of mistakes that partners make in the planning stages . Care should be taken to avoid the following seven pitfalls or risk seeing ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many joint ventures use up their initial capital at a faster rate than their partners expected . Partners who fail to plan for this possibility may be at a loss as to how to raise additional capital and resort to risky loans in order to raise funds . Joint Venturers who factor in risk and communicate effectively will anticipate the need for additional capital and reach consensus on acceptable sources of funding in the initial joint venture agreement . <p> 2 . Arguments over control <p> Companies naturally do not like surrendering control of projects that they have an interest in . Such a mind-set is a reason why many joint ventures fail , because the partners often struggle to agree on how the joint venture should be run . <p> As with any argument , they can develop to the point that the rowing parties feel they can no longer work together . This is why joint venture partners should assume that there will be conflict . Appoint a board of directors with representatives from each of the companies that make up the joint venture , so that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The board can then hire employees or contractors to manage the day-to-day operations . To defuse the prospect of disagreements further along the project lifecycle , the joint venture agreement should determine which decisions can be made by management and which require approval from the board . <p> 3 . Thirst for assets <p> Overall projects can be undermined in a tussle over assets . Smaller partners who give their larger counterparts more power on the board in exchange for a larger capital contribution may end up losing control of critical elements of the venture , which could cause it to fail . <p> Partners should ensure that their respective assets , such as intellectual property , capital or equipment , are appropriately valued and translated into reasonable shares of ownership and control . <p> 4 . Cultural differences <p> The clash of company cultures within a joint venture can lead to friction over which one should be used . To make it work , joint venture partners should discuss in advance how they plan to manage cultural differences and , if necessary , train managers to help employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unrealistic profit expectations <p> A return on investment and especially profits are what joint venture partners want to see as quickly as possible , but distributing profits is rarely as simple as giving each party a share proportionate to their ownership . It is likely that a number of considerations will need to be taken into account , such as loan repayments or the reinvestment of a portion of the profits back into the joint venture . <p> To deal with this , the agreement should outline explicitly how and when profits will be divided up and the order of priority in which they will be distributed . <p> 6 . Competing partners <p> Many joint ventures originate from a partnership between two or more companies that operate in the same industry . The competitive interests of the companies involved can create feelings of mistrust and envy , which is hardly conducive for effective project management . <p> The joint venture agreement should set specific boundaries regarding information that must be freely shared between partners and that which may be held back . If necessary , the agreement should stipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest . <p> 7 . Waiting to plan an exit strategy <p> Partners are often slow to consider their exit strategies during the planning phase of a joint venture , but leaving it until the venture is up and running is risky and could leave you unprepared in the event of an agreement breach of if a partner wishes to leave early . <p> Time should be set aside from the outset to consider all the scenarios that could result in the joint venture coming to an end . The agreement should lay out the terms and conditions for those that have been envisaged to avoid future conflict .

One of your New Year 's resolutions for this year may be to put steps in place to further your career in project management by obtaining a PRINCE2- certification . <p> Yet , we understand how it is : after a long and challenging day at work it can often be difficult to return home and start studying in preparation for your exams . With over 25 years ' of experience in Project Management training for both individual and corporate learners , we have come up with the following to help motivate you to learn : <p> 1 . Career goal <p> Whether you 're working towards a promotion or envisaging a career change , keeping your career goals in mind can be an important way of making sure you achieve them . <p> 2 . Competition <p> If your dream job is highly competitive , it 's important to stand out from the crowd .

Not only will you have a clear plan for the coming months , but this can incentivise you to study . <p> 4 . Why am I learning this ? <p> Sometimes when studying , it can be easy to become de-motivated and forget why you started . Keeping your career goal in mind will remind you of the importance of persevering , and if your company has put your name forward for a course , it 's important to understand why ? What is the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the organisation ? <p> 5 . Employer support <p> If you have signed up to a course under your own initiative , your employer 's understanding and backing could be an important part of your success .

Getting your colleagues on board is important , and making use of online learning communities , digital and collaborative learning environments , free downloads , blogs , and social media channels such as Twitter and Google+ can help provide the support you need . <p> 7 . Tutor support <p> Make sure that your chosen learning provider 's tutor support reflects what you require . For example , many of ILX Group 's e-learning students have found the remote tutor support useful in keeping them on track and motivated . <p> 8 . Personal mentoring <p> Alongside your peer and tutor support , finding a personal mentor amongst colleagues or friends can help keep you engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to sleep faster than a boring course . Finding a course that is engaging is vital in keeping your motivation high . Additionally , think about which form of learning works best for you .

The more traditional method of learning in a classroom means that a tutor can guide you through the course as you learn . Blended learning is a mixture of online learning and classroom , giving you the best of both worlds . <p> 10 . Maximise learning <p> Planning a learning schedule around existing commitments before starting your course can keep your studies on track . This will help you to utilise your free-time effectively and maximise your time for learning . <p> 11 . Achievable milestones <p> Set yourself key milestones throughout your learning journey .

@@24890124 @4890124/ <p> Everyone can have a brilliant idea for a product or service . The trick is to make sure that you follow the right steps to turn the idea into reality . PRINCE2 's themes help ensure this . They are the seven critical aspects of project management that , addressed and considered throughout the project , make it a success . <p> Are you on the case ? You 've got a great idea but how do you know if it will pay off ? The Business Case enables you to balance the expected benefits with the estimated risks and costs . While benefits outweigh costs and risks you continue with the project . When they do n't , you stop the project . Here 's a simplified example : imagine that you have decided to achieve X within one year because it will result in Y. You 've kind of looked at the risks and costs and they seem acceptable . Now imagine that it 's five years and thousands of dollars or pounds later and although you still have n't got X up and running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only subjected your idea to the rigor of the PRINCE2 business case it would have reduced the chances of this happening . <p> Whos doing what ? Ever organised an event where everyone thought someone else was in charge and that someone else was doing what needed to be done so that in the end nothing got done ? Well , if only everyone had known how to use PRINCE2 . Putting it in very simple terms , its Organisation theme ensures people know their roles ( roles not jobs , because roles may be shared and combined ) and know who they 're reporting to . In fact , it ensures that the buck stops somewhere for there are some people who will direct , some who will manage and some who will deliver a project . Result ? Absolutely ! <p> Is it up to scratch ? We have all bought something that promised particular features and results and then lo and behold you unpack it and it does n't live up to expectations . PRINCE2 can ensure your customer does n't suffer such disappointments . Quality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , a person , a process , a service and/or a system . By using the methodology you can be clear on what the customer wants , what you and the customer have agreed will be acceptable , how to achieve the required result , what should be in the product description and , you can also create a quality register which summarises planned and completed quality activities . <p> What 's the plan ? We all use plans every day , whether it 's to plan our day , to plan how to make something or to plan how to get somewhere . Business is no different . The beauty of PRINCE2 is that its Plans theme makes the planning of a project effective and efficient . Simply put , its product-based planning approach tells everyone involved what is required , how it will be achieved , who will achieve it , what they will use , when things will happen and whether you can produce the product within the required parameters . <p> What kind of a gamble is it ? If we 're planning a summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event ; if we 're manufacturing something there 's a risk that our component supplier wo n't deliver on time . Risk is all around us and it can be positive and negative . PRINCE2 's aim with the Risk theme , therefore , is to manage it through taking steps such as having a strategy , a register of threats and opportunities and a risk management procedure . <p> All change ? You 've created a product and got everything right about it and then would you believe it someone decides that they want to change the packaging . Well , perhaps you would believe it . Projects , like life , are subject to change . All you can do is manage change . Using a systematic and common approach PRINCE2 's Change theme helps ensure you can identify , locate and control unexpected or expected changes to the established baselines for the products . ( You need baselines otherwise you wo n't know what the change is . ) <p> Are we making progress ? This is kind of a no-brainer . After all it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if those were n't what the project was about . So PRINCE2 's Progress theme helps you keep a weather eye on how things are going . It involves monitoring and comparing actual with planned results , providing a forecast for project objectives and viability and involves controlling any unacceptable deviations . The kind of things that would be looked at are cost , time and quality and these would then inform decisions such as whether to close a project down early . <p> Useful Links <p> If you think PRINCE2 cant help you because you only do small scale projects , that couldnt be further from the truth .

It is human nature to put things off that we 'd rather not be doing , but it is the nature of project management that those tasks that seem least appealing are often the most important to the overall health of the project .

It is vital to use a collaborative system that reflects this fundamental change in the way people work . Information should be readily available to access from anywhere , on any device . Every action should be visible to every team member , as well as the ability to respond instantly . <p> Building Team Trust <p> In the age of mobile working , the promotion and protection of the principle of individual responsibility is hugely important , as is the need for project managers to trust their teams to uphold it . This is made more achievable with the use of modern collaborative systems , which can help employees realise their importance to overall project success by involving them more in decision-making , no matter where they are based . Unlocking the full potential of each team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal responsibility towards completing individual tasks that are critical to achieving the project 's overall objectives . <p> These are just some of the areas where technology will continue to have a positive effect on project collaboration . But as with all systems , their effectiveness can be undermined somewhat if the project management processes required alongside them have not evolved to reflect today 's project demands . ILX Group , through our best practice training courses and project management consultancy , can help you implement standardised and repeatable principles that will enable you to maximise your investment in collaborative technology and achieve sustained project success .

The way your company operates could be at a completely different end of the spectrum in comparison to your nearest competitors , yet you both may find yourselves taking the plunge into digital learning all the same . <p> The business world is constantly evolving . Whether it 's down to a new internal business plan , developments within your market or simply to ensure your staff remain up to date with company practices , e-learning is perfect platform to do so . You can create new content and distribute it across your workforce easily , and minor updates will not cause you to design and deliver new training schemes at inconvenient junctures throughout the year . <p> Learning retention is increased <p> By blending the different types of learning you deliver to your staff , you will be improving their overall capability for knowledge retention .

The first , obviously , is the expense . Not only will the cost of these courses dwarf that of a successfully designed e-learning course , the update feature we have previously mentioned will be completely removed . Instead , further courses will have to be arranged , multiplying costs by a huge amount over a number of years . This is not to mention the subsidies you will be required to cover for your staff should you choose to attend courses away from your workplace . <p> You will also be sacrificing a greater amount of time , something that will inevitably affect the overall output of your company .

Even by staggering training to ensure all members of a team are n't absent simultaneously , it undoubtedly puts those who remain under increased strain to meet productivity demands .

@@24890145 @4890145/ <p> As we have discussed in previous blogs , e-learning as a format is extremely easy to update and re-think should you find newer , more relevant material for your employees . If you 've already got a course in place , you are given a perfect platform to expand , streamline or revamp wherever you see fit . There are a number of ways tackling an update without having to design a completely new course , as the core structure would already be in place . Below are a number of techniques that ensure the process can be carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible . <p> Course Navigation <p> When initially designing a course , you must appreciate that not all of the learners will hold the same confidence in their own computer literacy . A course navigation section for the course , with clear and concise instructions regarding how to access various parts of the course is absolutely vital in the quest to remain wholly accessible to the audience . The creation of this navigation process will often be a relatively lengthy process , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to remove the need to produce another one from scratch . <p> Test Media Screen <p> It is extremely likely that different types of media will be added to and removed from your course along the way . These various formats are potential stumbling blocks if your course has not previously been optimised for them , so a slide including test points for each one is a valuable asset to your course as a whole . <p> Whether you are including a video , an audio clip or a small graphic , having these screens will mean both the designer and the learner will not be caught unawares by unplayable content or accidentally deafening audio . <p> Varying Title Screens <p> Your update or re-think of your course may have as much to do with a company rebrand as a wealth of new material . The content may or may not change , but there needs to be facility to alter it should you need to . Through the creation of a number of variations of section title screen , they will all be on hand when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of going back to the drawing board completely . <p> Gate Screens <p> A gate screen is undoubtedly a multi-purpose tool when it comes to e-learning design . It provides somewhat of a break in theme during the course , and helps the learner to orientate themselves for the following stage . Whether it is suited more to an interaction or as a stage of persistent instructions as to the subsequent material , the gate screen is very much an adaptable and integral feature of any course . Through successful templates , gate screens provide the ability for the updating process to remain flexible as well as relevant . <p> Resources Screen <p> The resources screen has the potential to contain any number of variables , each depending on the course itself . When creating the initial template , the prospect of updating the course would have been discussed at length and the extensive communication between the design team , the subject experts and the leaders of your business should result in little change being required to be made to the page . <p> Some e-learning software will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of external source would be able to be fitted into the pre-existing page structure , whereas others will require to you add various pages in order to display the resources " whether in full , a thumbnail image or via a linking system . <p> Exit strategy <p> Each update will require this page to state the overall objectives of the course , and where the learner can expect to go next with their training . Without providing a suitable , well-rounded explanation of the desired outcome of the course or the predicted trajectory of the learner 's career , you may fail to capitalise on the course 's success . <p> Closure is important as it provides a place for the learner to build from , and is rarely something that can be formulated via pre-existing templates .

@@24890146 @4890146/ <p> Not too many years ago , nearly all managers were male . This is certainly not the case today , but it is still true that fewer women than men stride the boardrooms of the UK and the world . The times , though , they are a-changing . Research suggests that women have the leadership qualities that business and project management in this century may well demand . <p> Role model for the future . There is a school of thought that suggests that had women held senior positions in the noughties the credit crunch might never have occurred . Women , they say , think before they act . They do n't take risks lightly . They take decision making seriously . As a result , they make better decisions and instill a sense of confidence in people around them . We shall never know what would have happened if women had been at the helm but we do know that these are helpful qualities in the modern project world buffeted as it is by the winds of global events . For women PMs who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , executives , users , suppliers , and others , must have a better chance of project success . <p> Inspirational leader . Great leaders and explorers have at least one quality in common : they have the ability to inspire a shared and lasting vision that persuades people to follow them into unknown seas . The same is true " some claim " of women who possess leadership material for they are thought to be able to motivate , influence and appeal to people to follow them . These are attributes that any project manager would value and , more importantly , attributes that any man or woman can acquire . PRINCE2 gives you the hard skills that help you understand elements such as the quality review technique which can assist you to lead . APMP instills soft skills such as leadership , communication and conflict management that help manage the people that help keep the project on track . <p> Communication expert . We all know the stereotype of women being chatterboxes . Fewer of us may be aware , however , that research indicates that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information enables women to pick up on the good and bad vibes in an organisation that help them steer business away from stormy weather . It is worth noting here that , whether man or woman , the project manager must remember that PRINCE2 communication does not only take place by the coffee cart but also via more formal means such as reports , registers and logs . <p> Conflict manager . Since projects are about people in one way or another , it is no surprise that differences between individuals can occur . What may be more of a surprise is that these differences can benefit a project . If a team member , for instance , highlights concerns about a particular approach or action , the whole team can reflect on it , re-evaluate any potential risks and adjust course to ensure a better outcome . The trick is to manage the process so that conflict is constructive rather than destructive . Which is where women come in . They are thought to possess the qualities required for conflict resolution , valuing communication , collaboration , inclusiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for , and people who feel cared for give their best . It is worth noting , however , that research also shows that men and women both have positive and negative qualities when faced with conflict . <p> Negotiator . Sometimes project management feels as if it should be called project negotiation as there 's so much of it ! Project managers negotiate with customers , suppliers , executives and sponsors about everything from budgets and timescales to technology and personnel . Researchers have discovered that when women have good information , when they care about an issue and when they are working for others they negotiate results that can exceed those of men . Whatever the truth of these gender differences , perhaps the one thing to remember is that good project managers can be created through appropriate experience and learning . <p> Useful Links <p> Fascinated by the role of women in the workplace ?

They ca n't provide the project management skills and knowledge that come with the UK 's de facto standard , PRINCE2 , but they can bring together information , people and projects . We 've divided our selection into two broad groups.For small businesses who do n't want to shell out for applications we 've found four great freebies for you to try . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-to-use web-based project management application that is supported by an army of volunteers . <p> Another free , multi-talented system is ProjectPier . It boasts unlimited users , email notification , Gantt , resource scheduling , data and timeline formatting . It must be downloaded and installed on your web server . <p> jxProject is n't too shabby either . Its clever at managing tasks , projects and teams and has a built-in constraint solver . It 's supported by discreet advertising but if you do n't like commercials you can upgrade to a paid , ad-free version . <p> Another nifty little application is GanttProject . It 's a cross-platform desktop tool for project scheduling and management with which you can create work breakdown structures , assign human resources , collaborate with others using WebDAV , generate a PERT chart from a Gantt chart , and benefit from other useful qualities . <p> In the end , you get what you pay for and you get plenty with both land-locked and cloud-based commercial offerings ! The positive sm+rg+sbord of applications out there includes DeskAway , 5pm , Springloops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to give you a taste of the facilities available ; look out for free trials or packages on their websites . <p> King of the hill for many PMs is Basecamp thanks to its emphasis on collaboration and communication as well as its easy configuration , speed , file sharing and task assignment abilities . Basecamp also offers Campfire for real-time , collaborative , group chat . <p> We all know Huddle and while it may not have every feature under the sun it 's got a lot going for it . It enables you to manage projects , run schedules , store files and hold meetings ; in addition it has loads of integration options . <p> Clarizen aims to leave clear blue water between itself and competitors . It includes project portfolio management , real-time project status visibility , built-in social communication and networking tools plus a knowledge base . <p> As you would expect from any Microsoft product , SharePoint does n't stint on capability .

Sharing content with every team member cost-effectively and efficiently is a major headache for project management professionals . Apart from the sheer weight of documents that might be involved there are issues around cost , travel , time zones , geography and so on ; fortunately they are issues that can be solved . <p> Chuck your presentations , videos and documents onto Slideshare rather than into your briefcase and you can bring together your virtual team . The free version gives unlimited uploads but you need to upgrade to have the advantage of privacy and web-meetings . <p> You know YouTube 's for fun but did you know it 's for projects too ? Project managers can use it to inspire , explain and share whilst HR managers can use it for training and inculcating best practices . <p> A picture is worth a thousand words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way of sending quick status updates with images , of sharing videos of meetings , and so on in a public and private arena . <p> 3 . Flag and share useful information . Let 's face it there 's a lot of rubbish out there on the web so how do you find project management material that 's worth your time ? Here 's the answer . <p> Digg has its detractors but it can be a useful way of discovering and sharing content . It works by people hitting the digg button when they find content they think is good , the service then builds lists of popular stories that are shared across the web . <p> Coming in much the same category is StumbleUpon which takes you to web pages , photos , and videos handpicked by your friends and like-minded people . <p> 4 .

It allows people following you to see everything that you publish , it let 's you publish backwards to your networks and it 's designed so you can use it over a number of platforms : websites , mobile phones and so on . <p> Amplify is a discussion platform but it can also be synced to your social networks to use as a hub for social media broadcasting , sharing and connecting . <p> If your head 's spinning through trying to choose from all the social media available , why not produce your own social site with Ning . Create or use a standard design , set up profiles , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , integrate with Twitter , Facebook et al , pull in RSS feeds from a blog , share photos and videos and more . <p> 5 . Can we talk ? Can we text ? Can we ? Communication is key to project management , of course , so we 're going to end with a look at some old and some not so old ways of communicating by email , by instant messaging and so forth . <p> Communication can cost so it 's no wonder that Skype is top of the pops for many . For free you can get Skype-to-Skype and one-to-one video calls , instant messaging and screen sharing . Various price points are available for calling landlines , calling abroad and for group communication . <p> It 's ironic that we live in an in-your-face , 24/7 world but privacy is what we crave .

@@24890157 @4890157/ <p> There is no shortage of quantitative and qualitative techniques for selecting and prioritising projects and here we run through six methods that provide a flavour of both <p> 1 . Net Present Value ( NPV ) : Much favoured by the public sector to compare the discounted value of a stream of future costs or benefits , this defines the difference between the present value of a stream of costs ( NPC ) and a stream of benefits . A positive NPV would indicate that a project should be profitable and pursued whilst a negative value would indicate that the project should be abandoned . A raft of first-rate resources about NPV on the Office of Government Commerce website demonstrates its successful use through detailed examples and case studies . The APMP for PRINCE2 Practitioners course covers this and similar topics . <p> 2 . Payback Period : By using this fairly straightforward method , managers can calculate how long it will take for project benefits to match cost , that is , recoup the initial cost . Projects with a quick payback period are naturally more appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go wrong ; all the time bearing in mind that a fast payback period does not guarantee a higher rate of return . It is worth noting that whilst payback 's simplicity is its strength , some might consider it over-simplistic to be used alone . <p> 3 . Internal Rate of Return ( IRR ) : This calculates the estimated rate of return of a project , with a higher rate of return making investment more probable . Organisations will generally set a minimum rate of return below which they will not normally consider a project . <p> 4 . Earned Value Analysis ( EVA ) : Viewed with caution by some because it is associated with large projects and requires , amongst other things , a culture of reporting within a company , this can be a helpful technique . Organisations can manage and measure a project to get an integrated view of its cost , spend and progress so allowing them to estimate resources that will have been used at completion . Managers can use EVA to help them keep an eye on project performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if necessary . <p> 5 . Balanced Scorecard ( BSC ) : Organisations employ this to align vision with business activities by viewing the company from four perspectives . For a financial perspective companies might look at everything from return on investment to cash flow . To gain a perspective on internal business processes managers might assess factors such as process automation or alignment . To realize high customer satisfaction levels factors like customer retention rate might be examined . Through the learning and growth angle firms can focus on areas such as employee expertise and job satisfaction . <p> 6 . Business Case : The Business Case provides a programme or project with its raison d ' +tre and is an important component of both PRINCE2 and Managing Successful Programmes . It outlines reasons for investing in a project , furnishes a framework for bringing about business change and runs for the life of the project to ensure that it stays on track . A detailed Business Case has five main parts . Strategic fit considers issues such as business need and strategic benefits ; options appraisal focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar ; evaluating a project 's commercial aspects would involve scrutinizing the financial case and looking at areas such as implementation timescales ; an assessment of affordability centres on the financial aspect too this time focussing on things like budget based on whole life costs ; decisions about the final ingredient , achievability of a project , would require an in-depth look at , for example , similar projects , project roles , procurement and , in short , the project management case . <p> Useful links : <p> For anyone interested in evaluating projects in a qualitative as well as quantitative way , the APMP for PRINCE2 Practitioners qualification with its coverage of NPV , IRR , Business Case and so forth , might fit the bill .

Will it illustrate lessons learned from ground-breaking projects ? <p> Who benefits and who loses out ? Will it be you alone , will it be the team or the whole organisation that reaps the benefits of attendance ? Consider any costs to other departments and the organisation as a whole . For instance , you should anticipate and manage colleagues ' concerns about dis-benefits such as production lost owing to staff attending a conference . <p> What are the monetary costs ? What with travel , hotel rooms , registration and the usual extras , conference costs can soon mount up .

@@24890160 @4890160/ <p> Project management " like life " can be unpredictable . The project management methodology that people adopt , however , is usually very predictable . The UK uses PRINCE2 ; the US uses PMIs PMBOK Guide . Both have similarities and differences and companies that recognize the special relationship between the two approaches are reaping the benefits of both . <p> In the last two years the UK 's Office of Government Commerce ( OGC ) released PRINCE2 2009 to replace the 2005 version and the US 's Project Management Institute ( PMI ) published PMBOK 4th Edition to replace the 3rd Edition . The similarities do not end there . <p> The OGC 's and PMI 's latest editions have had new sections inserted and old ones combined or cut to make them more coherent and cohesive . PMI 's PMBOK 4th Edition aims to align it with other standards , such as the Standard for Program Management : Second Edition . PRINCE2 2009 signals its clear link to other methods and bodies of knowledge and aligns with other OGC products ; for instance , the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have clarified the language : PMBOK 's process names are in a verb-noun format ; PRINCE2 has ditched obscure codifications ( such as SU1 ) that public consultations highlighted as difficult to understand . Both methods cross continents and cultures and both offer a generic approach for use with almost any project . <p> It is the differences , though , that make the UK and US systems so complementary in project management . PRINCE2 is a structured method for managing projects in the public and private sectors detailing from start to finish the activities to execute in a project . Focussing on key risk areas , it guides the Project Management team and organisation on how to create a successful project but equally offers greater flexibility and control than before . A PRINCE2 2009 project is led primarily from the top with the Project Board providing essential input . Considered as comprehensive and generally descriptive , PMBOK is a body of knowledge that details generally accepted best practices in terms of norms , processes and methods that successful Project Managers should know . Indeed , whilst recognising the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led primarily by the Project Manager . <p> Driven by the needs and requirements of the customer , PMBOK has a set of Knowledge Areas ( around which the manual revolves ) and Process Groups to which 42 project management processes with inputs , outputs , tools and techniques belong . Knowledge Areas include Integration Management , Scope , Time and Cost Management and Procurement Management . Process Groups set out the sequence in which Processes are used . Initiating refers to defining a new project or phase when one obtains authorisation to start . Planning establishes the scope and defines the plan of approach . Executing involves doing the work . The Monitoring and Control sections of the processes track the project 's progress and check performances identifying and implementing the required changes . <p> Driven by the needs and requirements of the business PRINCE2 2009 now makes explicit the Principles obligations and good practices " that were only implicit in its predecessor . Seven in all , arguably the most critical of the principles is that project should start and only continue to the end if business justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , not to throw good money after bad . The 2009 version is also alive to the PINO syndrome and so underlines the principle of management by stages and end-of-stage assessments as a control . <p> PRINCE2 2009 has seven Themes including : Business Case , Change and Progress to which seven Processes belong . The starting-up project process is actually pre-project involving the project board and the project management layers culminating in a clear project brief at the end . In PRINCE2 2009 , completed project elements can be handed over immediately so that the supplier gets paid and the customer gets access to the product as quickly as possible . The seven Processes in turn have a set of Activities ( formerly obscure codified sub-processes ) that suggest some sequencing but it is the project manager 's responsibility to ensure things get done . These activities are made up of clear and recommended but not prescriptive Actions . <p> PMBOK and PRINCE2 do not offer a one-size-fits-all formula . Each suggests that organisations tailor the system to suit the project culture . PRINCE2 2009 has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help users scale the method to the specific environment of their project ; Project Environment looks at areas such as projects in a programme , alignment with other lifecycle models and bodies of knowledge . <p> Like all good partnerships , PRINCE2 's 2009 and PMBOK 's 4th Edition have similarities such as Knowledge Areas and Themes and Processes and Activities . But like the best partnerships , it is the differences that make them unbeatable in project management . Two project management approaches are better than one .

@@24890188 @4890188/ <p> For those who 've passed the PRINCE2 Practitioner exam , there are a number of benefits to maintaining your Registered Practitioner status . It shows you 're on top of the latest best practice developments . Remember that PRINCE2 goes through revisions . The resources you used to pass the Practitioner exam may not be up-to-date . <p> Being a Registered PRINCE2 Practitioner will also help in the job market . People you 're competing with may have a Practitioner certification . However , if their Registered Practitioner status has slipped , then you can show that your best practice knowledge is more current . It also indicates a desire for continual improvement . These are some of the common questions from PRINCE2 delegates who want to stay on top of their game . <p> When does my PRINCE2 qualification expire ? <p> PRINCE2 certifications themselves never expire . This is true for both Foundation and Practitioner . Only the status as a Registered Practitioner has an expiration date . <p> When does my Registered Practitioner status expire ? <p> The status as a Registered Practitioner expires 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam 3 years after passing the Practitioner exam . <p> How do I check the expiration date ? <p> The expiration date is on the Practitioner certificate . Because AXELOS owns PRINCE2 , candidates also appear on their successful candidates register . If you have n't opted out of appearing on the register , you ( and potential employers ) can confirm your registered status and expiration date . <p> What happens after the expiration date ? <p> If you wait longer than 5 years and your status lapses , you can still take the re-registration exam and regain the status . In the interim , you 're not allowed to advertise yourself as a Registered Practitioner . Taking the re-registration exam before it expires will save you having to rewrite your CV and reprint business cards . <p> Do I have to re-take the Practitioner exam ? <p> You never have to retake the Practitioner exam after passing it . The re-registration has a different format . The two formats are displayed for comparison below .

@@24890190 @4890190/ <p> How do you find your perfect PRINCE2 training partner ? Ask training organisations these 7 questions and you could find the training that fits your expectations and needs . <p> 1 . Are you accredited with the APMG ? Would you sign up for an online degree course with a college you knew nothing about ? Nor would I ! By going to an APMG accredited training organisation ( ATO ) you 'll go to a recognized organisation , on a recognized course and get a recognized qualification . The accreditation process assesses the competence and reliability of training organisations and the knowledge and skills of the trainer . <p> 2 . What 's your track record ? When you 're investing good money in training some timely research can help ensure it 's money well spent . Find out how long an ATO has been in business . Ask for pass rates , evidence of success , testimonials and for a client portfolio ; that way you 'll be sure that it has the depth and breadth of experience to understand your business . <p> 3 . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd do background checks on potential employees , so you should verify the quality of an ATO 's trainers . Check who trained them , check they have n't just passed a training course themselves ( yes , it happens ! ) , check they 've got real-world experience and make sure support tutors for classroom , blended and e-learning can answer tricky PRINCE2 questions ( inexperienced trainers hate them ! ) . <p> 4 . What kind of learning experience can you offer ? Let 's face it , training can be like going through a sausage machine . So pick ATOs offering learner-centred courses designed to help you retain training and deliver change in the workplace . Look for quality materials , newsletters , downloads , video tutors , full tutor support , exam simulations so you can assess progress , mobile games , forums , blogs , social networking through sites like Twitter and Facebook as well as the chance to try the course before you buy it . People live and work in a rich , multi-media technological world and ATOs should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How flexible is your learning delivery ? Geography , time and budget can limit an individual 's or a company 's ability to go or send people on classroom courses so it 's worth hunting around for the ATO that gets this and provides a choice of delivery methods to suit you . Classroom learning should be supplemented by blended , mobile , live virtual classroom , e-learning and social learning to optimise costs , time , and of course , learning . If you 're new to e-learning , there are some simple steps you can take to make sure that your training project goes to plan . <p> 6 . How much is it going to cost and what do I get for my money ? It 's the old story : you 're on a great course and then they hit you for things you thought were included in the price . A good ATO will include lunch for classroom courses and take-away reference goodies like wall charts , manuals and a CD ROM training course for all learners .

People and organisations want opportunities to grow . They want to develop their skills , careers or the business . A good look at a training company will tell you if it 's a one-trick pony or if it will stay the course and grow with you . Ask yourself if its programmes complement each other and if it develops new courses and services and ways to deliver and support them . <p> Useful PRINCE2 E-learning Links : <p> The APMG provides a wealth of information about PRINCE2 and accredited training organisations . <p> For information about PRINCE2 courses , you could n't do better than go to the Office of Government Commerce website . <p> ILX recently launched PRINCE2 Practitioner Plus , a special stand-alone e-learning package that accelerates project management skills to enable you to deliver change efficiently in any organisation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you might need to get the most from an e-learning training programme . <p> Looking for deals on training ?

Ensuring that the highest possible standards in customer services are not only reached but maintained is something that all companies worth their salt aspire to , but too few actually achieve . When you think about it , when you consider how important good customer service is to an organisation 's reputation , it 's astonishing how many are found wanting in this regard . It does n't take long to recall from personal experience a company that demonstrated poor customer service , just as one that excelled sticks in the mind also . <p> That 's the thing about customer service especially in the digital age ; perform poorly and you 'll soon acquire a damaging reputation that precedes you and the likelihood is that prospective customers will be turned off from dealing with you . Conversely , show a commitment to outstanding customer service and you could well find that those who have benefitted from it have already recommended your company to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best product or service in their industry that demonstrate the worst levels of customer service , and those with offerings that are thought to lag behind who exhibit superiority in this area . It goes to show that quality of product and quality of customer service do not necessarily go hand in hand , yet they should because it 's the way that customers are treated and the efficiency and professionalism with which their enquiries are handled that largely determines whether a customer will continue to do business with you . <p> With this in mind , organisations that truly aspire to be the best at what they do will always be looking at ways to improve their customer service . A desire for 100 per cent service quality success is admirable and should be strived for , but it 's inevitable that failures will occur from time to time . It 's how businesses recover situations that matters and can make the difference between losing a customer and gaining a long-term advocate . Research has shown that a customer who has had their complaint resolved satisfactorily will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , whilst an unhappy client who has been the recipient of poor or ineffective service will tell ten people about their negative experience . Here are five tips for handling complaints more effectively and improving your chances of keeping customers onside : <p> 1 . Simplify the client complaints process <p> You are much more likely to retain business from customers who complain . For this reason , the complaints process should be as simple as possible . If it 's difficult to navigate for the customer or requires a lot of effort on their part , their dissatisfaction will grow and they will probably give up and take their custom elsewhere . <p> 2 . Accept responsibility for service failure <p> Nothing is likely to infuriate an already dissatisfied customer more than not acknowledging your mistakes . Being accountable is vital , as is ensuring that an issue is resolved quickly and to the satisfaction of the customer . Speed and clarity of service delivery is important , as you do not wish to have unhappy customers who are uncertain of the complaints handling process and the likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tools to resolve issues <p> Passing complaints from pillar to post is unlikely to appease disgruntled customers , particularly if there is no satisfactory resolution ! Give your employees who field complaints the ability to put things right , with the minimum of fuss . Wherever possible , enable your staff to take the initiative and take decisive action without always having to refer to a more senior member of staff . <p> 4 . Use training and coaching to improve customer service skills <p> Commit to pursuing a development programme that seeks to instil high performance standards throughout your organisation " including senior management . It 's especially important for frontline employees to have the required customer service skills so that , even when they 're under pressure , they can deliver the desired service standards and are comfortable handling customer complaints effectively . <p> 5 .

Both candidates came away satisfied with their course . One , a novice to project management , achieved a PRINCE2 Practitioner qualification within five days . The other accrued enough fundamental knowledge that it could be readily applied in their management of projects and other day-to-day work . <p> At ILX Group , we 're proud of all the varieties of training course that we provide . We believe that we offer some of the best computer-based online self-study solutions in the world , created by specialists in learning development , subject matter experts and multimedia strategists . We 're not shy about the quality of our classroom courses either , with invaluable face-to-face instruction coming from adept teachers who are well-versed in their subjects , both as instructors and practiced professionals . <p> Our guest bloggers did a great job providing some insights into what to expect from either style of learning . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best option , especially as there are similar exam pass rates across both styles worldwide . As a result , we have decided to compile some lessons and observations into one post for you , directly comparing the advantages and drawbacks of the classroom and the e-learning options . <p> Selling Points and Hidden Benefits <p> The two offerings " classroom and online " are going to be distinct in many obvious ways . For example , you should know that online study means learning at your own pace , using a mobile phone , tablet , desktop or laptop computer to access course materials remotely . What 's not always so clear is what this can mean for the student in practical terms . <p> Take the example of e-learning further . Many will look at this option as , primarily , a happy convenience when compared to the classroom course 's five days of instruction which threatens to use up the whole working week . But how many people see that extra time afforded , and twelve months ' access to e-learning materials , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject ? There 's only so much information you can cram within a five day workshop . With e-learning , you can sit your exam when you 're ready " not just when you feel you can pass the exam , you can qualify when you feel you have personally grasped the subject 's nuances enough to confidently apply its principles . <p> On the other hand , many people feel they know what to expect of a classroom course , having experienced this style of learning a lot over years of schooling and other employment-related training . Some feel they will benefit from learning within the dynamic of a group , or by receiving direct instruction . Others may think the opposite , signing on to an online course straight away , confident in their own ability to master the subject . However , they may not realise the missed extra value provided by ILX 's tutors , who " using their years of experience in training and in their fields " are able to supply tailored knowledge applicable to the projects and scenarios of classroom attendees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cons . But what you classify as a positive or negative is going to vary according to your preferences and your personality . That 's why we are going to offer a breakdown of both options , covering the basics , and some of the subtleties , in the differences between them . <p> Breaking Down Classroom vs . E-learning <p> PRINCE2 online/e-learning training : <p> Provides remote learning options , allowing access to study materials anytime , anywhere , for a whole year . Allows you to learn at your own pace , absorbing knowledge at a speed , and to an extent , that will best suit you and your requirements . Offers little to no interaction with peers , although support is on hand when you need it , accessible by phone and online . Has been carefully designed by a talented board of experts to provide a functional and memorable multimedia experience . Gives the added benefit of exam simulators , allowing you to test your knowledge and gauge your readiness for qualification . Can be readily tailored to your organisation 's specifications . Presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree of discipline , dedication and time management to complete . Without these there is no guarantee of the course 's completion or efficacy . Compared to classroom courses , though , there is no three-day allocation needed to complete it . <p> PRINCE2 classroom training : <p> Provides intensive two , three or five day classroom options . Allows for all of the purchased learning and examinations to be completed within the same timeframe , meaning accelerated qualification but at the cost of a demanding workload . Offers opportunities for peer interaction and networking , so you can learn from and discuss with others , as well as witness a wide range of PRINCE2 applications . Features instruction by tutors with years of relevant experience in their subject and in their field of project management . Adds extra value with tutors able to provide information specific to the student 's business or project environment , as well as tips specific to the examination you 're sitting . Can also be tailored to your company , or even brought to your doorstep for in-house training or consulting . Presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extremely high pass rates for classroom attendees to show for the added expense , but There is a chance you are paying more for a guaranteed and accelerated qualification , rather a promise of applicable knowledge with only five days ( or less ) to absorb everything . May present the strongest option for Practitioner-level study because the exam has a more challenging format than Foundation , and ILX tutors can provide invaluable information to aid in their completion . <p> Conclusion <p> Hopefully the above breakdown gives some useful indicators of the strengths and benefits of each type of course to those who currently favour either approach to learning . Convenient as it sounds , e-learning training may not be the best choice for those who doubt their ability to manage their time and enforce strict study hours . There have been those who purchased e-learning training , for instance , then failed to act upon it and never sought certification . There are those who work well alone and may feel they wo n't benefit from the added interaction and networking gained through workshop-style learning . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a level of focus they might not otherwise manage . <p> It 's wise , therefore , to think carefully about your approach to learning before investing in either option .

@@24890255 @4890255/ <p> When it comes to risk management , the stakes are never higher than when dealing with people 's safety . Failure to ensure that the correct protocols are followed means that the danger of death becomes very real . Like any project , implementing safety measures for potential natural disasters needs to be approached with the pillars of modern project management methodology in mind . <p> So how do you go about trying to prepare for the unpredictable ? Natural disasters by their very nature are unexpected and potentially extremely volatile . These processes , through the threat they pose to human society , are wrought with risk and therefore need to be approached pragmatically . This is to ensure the minimisation of damage to human life and , secondarily , the damage to property and infrastructure " although usually these two factors will be linked intrinsically . By gaining an understanding of the risks that natural hazards expose us to , we can begin to take steps towards serious damage limitation . <p> The energy required to undertake a project of this magnitude is huge . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's helm must take into account an extremely diverse range of factors that expand beyond the usual realms of project management . Whereas time , cost and human resources are usually the three main areas that project managers will need to focus on , disaster prevention requires equal attention on the complex science of probability . <p> What hazard is the most likely to hit a particular region and why ? Which scientific principles govern the natural processes responsible for the predicted event ? What is the chance that such a hazard will turn into a natural disaster ( i.e. how will humans be affected ) ? These are all contributing factors to a risk management strategy , and all need to be considered before the biggest question " how can each disaster be predicted and mitigated " can be answered . <p> The effects of these natural disasters are extremely diverse and are huge in number . The risk management setup would first need to consider the primary effects of the disaster , events that occur as a direct result from it , such as water damage during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , the secondary effects would need to be taken into account . These are events that are caused by a primary effect , such as the disruption of electrical power or the starting of fires . The tertiary effects are the more long term issues that arise from the disaster . Loss of habitat , permanent changes in river channels , crop failure " these are all equally integral to the risk management process as a whole . <p> The reason why there is such an emphasis on successful project management when it comes to hazard or disaster prevention is because of the huge array of factors that contribute to the overall structure of the plan . It is not just approached from a scientific perspective but a socio-economic one too . The location of areas of infrastructure in relation to the area of predicted damage is central to this . The probability of human interaction to the disaster via these areas of infrastructure also needs to be considered , and through this the project managers will able to estimate just how vulnerable the surrounding communities are should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , the project 's decision makers and scientists can compare and evaluate their findings regarding potential hazards and through that determine what their biggest priorities are when beginning to implement their prevention structure . They can also recognise what areas of their project need to be addressed with further research or a greater distribution of resources . <p> In normal project management scenarios , the next stage would be to transfer the model to real life scenarios . When dealing with natural disasters , this is not a practical way of testing the project 's validity so the methodology applied by project leaders must be flexible enough to cater for this . Practical implementation must be assessed to avoid the risk of failure , but this needs to be approached in a different way . The project managers need to have the correct training or experience in this field in order to ensure the correct precautions are taken . <p> This is undoubtedly one of the most complex strands of both project and risk management alike . While many of the attributes discussed here will not be directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are still many valuable lessons to be learnt .
