Even if not actively suspicious about its looks and origins , it is doubtful whether she could have ever allowed a strand of the ragged green branches past her lips . But then she refused till her last breath to eat anything with garlic , and certainly not that dubious foreign concoction sent to undermine the British way of life called pizza ' . I doubt she had even heard of samphire ( sapphires were a different story ) and she was certainly not the sort to go foraging along coastal rocks and cliffs .

To gather , search for a stretch of green that looks like a mown lawn .

It is reputed to have a superior flavour " although some describe it as medicinal ' " but is tricky to gather as it is usually found high up on cliffs and rocks . The risky method of foraging is even mentioned in King Lear , with Shakespeare describing it as a dreadful trade ' . <p> Once foraged or bought , wash the samphire thoroughly under running water to get rid of any grit and sand ; also remove any remaining roots and tough stems .

Food writer Annie Bell came up with the brilliant idea of coating large fronds in batter before deep-frying them as fritters to serve with tomato salsa , something Irish chef Denis Cotter has re-worked with coriander yoghurt . <p> Some of the best UK samphire is found on the East Coast ( Norfolk in particular , where it is frequently pickled in vinegar ) and North Wales , along the River Dee marshes .

The currency in New Caledonia is the Comptoirs Fran+ais du Pacifique Franc . New Caledonia is 11 hours ahead of GMT . The islands enjoy a semitropical climate all year round . Temperatures in November reach an average high of 27-C , while the lowest average high is 23-C in August . <p> GETTING THEREAircalin ( http : //aircalin.com ) operates regular flights to Noumea from Brisbane and Sydney in Australia , among other Pacific destinations . <p> RESOURCESTourism New Caledonia ( http : //visitnewcaledonia.com ) is the official tourism website , packed with essential travel information , videos and itineraries . <p> FURTHER READINGCultural Centre of Kanak People by Werner Blaser ( Birkh+user Verlag ) . Finely illustrated with duotone photographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tjibaou , a cultural centre designed by renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano ( perhaps best known for The Shard in London ) . It explores the architectural influences , which include island culture and the natural environment . <p> Esme peels back the steaming banana leaves to reveal the gently bubbling stew . Her young son Michel watches on . He 's seen this countless times before but is as excited as if it 's his first . The smoked leaf aroma mixes with the meaty , sweet scent of what lies within ; it 's distinct but enticing . A coconut-heavy broth , it 's laced with stock from meat that 's been boiled for several hours before being wrapped in leaves with a mix of tropical roots and fruits and cooked once again . <p> By the time the broth is ready to serve , the tough yams have relented to the sweet talk of the coconut milk and taste more like a squash . The paw-paws are melt-in-the-mouth tropical deliciousness . And then there 's the broth itself : it has kept the best of the coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veg and the gamey-ness of the meat . It 's good . The meat , picked from the slender limbs of an unfamiliar carcass , has a flavour not dissimilar to rabbit . In Michel 's book , Esme tells us in her soft , French accent , it 's even better than chicken . But it 's not chicken . It 's bat . A flying fox , they 'll tell you " technically true , yes , but still a bat . Webbed wings , pointy teeth , piercing eyes , **39;260;TOOLONG bat . <p> This is n't going to become your classic tale of Pacific island cuisine , though . For although bat is one of many foods served up in traditional bougna ' style ( cooked in banana leaves , often underground in a pit ) and in some parts they may indulge in the odd turtle on special occasions , this is New Caledonia we 're talking about . And for New Caledonia , read French . Literally , read French " it 'll come in handy . Because despite its closest , most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west " the Gallic tongue is spoken by everyone . <p> It was in 1774 that British explorer Captain James Cook discovered the island , naming it after his father 's native Scotland . He dropped the ball by not claiming it . The French snapped it up in 1853 , at first using it as a penal colony . With the help of the nickel that 's mined in abundance , it 's now a thriving , tricolourwaving , baguette-chomping French dependency . <p> This collection of islands and islets has everything going for it . Glimpsed from the air it 's a coral patchwork filled with every shade of blue , from azure to turquoise , so vivid and piercing it 's as though a computer programme has been used to perfect the image . <p> Down on the ground , the waters are so gin-clear , it 's all you can do not to pop an olive in , as the waters lap lazily upon the white , powdery shores . On Grande Terre , the main island , the terrain is as varied as the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , French cowboys ! ) to forestcarpeted hillsides of the kind normally reserved for forest-dwelling folk in fantasy films . Jaw-dropping waterfalls , craggy mountains , sunken tree marshland " it 's remarkable that Cook did n't just drop anchor for good and make the place his home . <p> In the south lies Noumea , New Caledonia 's capital and where a huge chunk of the island 's 260,000 or so population lives . In Noumea they like to rise early " especially those who work at the market at Port Moselle , which opens for business at 4.30am . That 's not for trade either , which starts two and a half hours earlier . <p> The fish have n't quite flopped from the sea to the numerous market stalls , but it 's about as close as you can get . Thirty or so fishing boats set off from the quay at night to cast their nets , returning at sunset with their haul , which they 'll keep on ice until the first traders arrive to inspect the catch . Most of the fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Harold Mary , our guide , born locally and a thoroughly French former chef . Tahitians make good fishermen for some reason . ' <p> A circuit of the market reveals an assortment of aquatic treasures that would appease even the most ardent of fish fanciers . Big , ruby-red chunks of glistening line-caught tuna occupy every other stall . The smiley dawa ( bluespine unicornfish ) is a favourite among the locals , best served simply grilled , allowing its heated oils to gently flavour without overpowering . Prawns of every denomination , disco lobsters ( named for their colours , not their dancing ability ) , green-fringed mussels for moules marini+res , oysters , marlin , mackerel , octopus and crab all rub fins , shells , tentacles and claws with such local celebrities as saumon des dieux . The caviar of fish , ' says Harold . It 's like filet mignon ! ' Its name means salmon of the gods ' but its taste is more akin to tuna , and it 's actually a moonfish . The petit wiwa ( beautiful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mahi-mahi with its monstrous fillets , and the vivaneau rouge ( red snapper ) are big sellers too " the latter being a family favourite in Noumea . It 's often the Sunday roast " baked whole , thus allowing its meaty flesh to soak up the flavours of the wine , onion and tomatoes with which it shares its hot oven bath . If the super-sized Pacific fish and crustaceans are something of a giveaway to the market 's location " despite the incessant French chatter " then you could certainly only be in this part of the world when you reach the fruit and veg . <p> To the random soundtrack of what can only be described as the Melanesian equivalent of a working men 's club band ( think islanders wearing bad suits and playing keyboards ) , traders sip espressos and wave croissants as they discuss the cost of root veg . And if there 's one thing that 's a big deal here , it 's root veg . A very big deal , in fact " there are over 100 different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) grown in New Caledonia , a good few of which are on offer here , some the size of woolly mammoth thighs . Then there 's the equally prehistoric-looking cassava . For both , suggests one trader , the best way to eat them is in a stew with coconut milk , chicken , Pignon bananas ( the chubby ones ) , onions and tomatoes . <p> But much as the locals love their yams , France and some of its other former colonies have made their mark here too . So you 'll find the best of the Pacific " think bananas so tropical in taste that the fruit from whose loins they sprung must have fooled around with passion fruit " plus all the herbs and spices that south-east Asia has to offer ( Vietnam , another former French colony , has a big input ) and every ingredient that a chef with Gallic flair could desire . <p> And no one in New Caledonia has quite as much flair as Patrick Morand , a chocolatier who , having plied his trade in Switzerland , the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thuri+s ' famed Maison Pillon ) made Noumea his home over a decade ago . I like to play with chocolate , I like to play with the spice , the fruit , all the time I 'm trying new things people are surprised by what we do , ' he says , before reaching for a tray of gold star-covered chocolates from the rows and rows of cacao decadence in his boutique shop in the Latin quarter . You must try one of these , ' he insists , handing over one of the perfectly formed squares . Inside its dark chocolate casing lies a thyme ganache with a layer of apple and lemon fruit jelly . Delicious . The same goes for the tomato fruit jelly with basil ganache proffered immediately afterwards , painted with delicate green leaves . <p> Morand likes to tread the line between sweet and savoury , with the initial citrus burst eventually giving way , the chocolate melting to gently release the thyme flavour . His mint chocolate made with ingredients from the market is so fresh it 's like you 're nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed with the deftest of touches , and Morand would sit comfortably with Europe 's finest exponents of the art . He darts about his kitchen with child-like enthusiasm eager to show off his new toys . What 's this flavour ? Go on , guess ' Violet ? ' Yes , and this one ? ' Lychee ? ' He picks up bottle after bottle of different flavours , both tropical and European , asking us to guess each one . Samples of chocolate hailing from everywhere from Venezuela and Tanzania to Ghana and Mexico are plucked from bags to demonstrate the different percentages . He insists we try every one to note the differences , some subtle , some stark . It 's so important to get the balance right , ' he says , repeating the mantra with which he clearly runs Chocolats Morand . Sometimes I go to the market , see an ingredient and just try to see if it works . Or when I go to France , I see what is happening there " you want to see what Patrick Roger is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , he 's crazy ! ' <p> While his chocolate creations are a thing of beauty with their delicate refinement of both flavour and presentation , the macaroons scream indulgence . Sweet ganache spills out from between two doorstep-sized biscuits " Morand knows what his customers want . <p> French cuisine lies at the heart of everything in New Caledonia , particularly in Noumea , and not just at the higher-end places like Chocolats Morand . Visit a typical , well-stocked wine store , such as Le Pavillon des Vins , and you wo n't find much that does n't hail from France . We do have some from Australia , ' we 're told at the counter , before the lady disappears amid a maze of aisles covering every wine region of France worth knowing . Here you go , ' she says , handing us a bottle of sauvignon blanc . From Marlborough , New Zealand . That 's Australia covered then . Champagne , as you 'd expect from a French outpost , is a must-have . Every house always has a bottle of Champagne in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We like the best of everything in New Caledonia , but we pay for it . At one point , we 've been the biggest consumer per capita not only of Champagne but also whisky and Porsche cars ! ' <p> Locals have even tried to make their own wine , with one ambitious farmer attempting to create a New Caledonian drop as we visit . They 've been trying for two years now , ' Harold tells us , but they pressed too early this year and it tasted like vinegar . Even then , the grapes just ca n't cope with the humidity . ' <p> Other French additions to the islands have worked considerably better , notably venison , which is one of the local meats you 'll find on plenty of menus . It stacks up favourably against its European renditions , particularly when prepared by the likes of Didier Broux at Le 1881 restaurant . Having left strips of venison to soak in lime and olive oil overnight , the chef serves them on a salad and twirled with tropical fruits such as papaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat is still deliciously tender , and the bittersweet citrus combines with a gentle curry kick to create what is a perfect example of New Cal fusion . Other meats from the island " for logistical issues more than anything " have n't fared so well when it comes to reaching the chopping board , especially when the chefs of the finer establishments are resolutely French in everything they do . <p> Meats come from New Zealand or even join the regular gastronomes ' rescue shipments of cheese from the motherland . Foie gras makes it onto most line-ups , the best being served up by the likes of Broux " after all , he has worked at around 15 Michelinstarred worth of restaurants in his time . He simply pan-fries slabs and serves them with a fig compote and toasted brioche .

So why did I used to hate them so much ? Especially when they were served on toast . <p> And as for the dreaded pilchard , or sardinus pilchardus , it was no surprise to learn it was a grown-up sardine " larger and older if not wise enough to avoid being brutally smothered in a can of acidic tomato sauce . <p> Perhaps it was the word nutritious ' that condemned it in my teenage soul , or the rank oiliness of the bargain-basement cans , or the weird crunch of little bones . Or even being suffocated in a childhood game of sardines . But that was BM , Before Malaga . Before a first holiday in the sun revealed an astounding truth : you could eat a sardine grilled fresh from the sea and move straight to heaven on Earth . Especially when the sardines were threaded on to skewers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , salty breeze and sunburnt skin all optional ) . <p> Mediterranean countries have always known the delicious truth about sardines and pilchards and it 's crazy that we Brits have often been prepared to pay more money for fresh , large sardines from France that were probably caught off the English coast anyway . <p> Rebranding the pilchard as the Cornish sardine has helped restore the balance , along with the proper realisation that both sardines and pilchards are among the fish that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids , as well as other vitamins and minerals . <p> Forget the word oily ' . Despite the high content , much of which is held in the skin , sardines lack an overly slick mouthfeel . <p> The dark flesh is pleasingly succulent with a robust , sesame-like nuttiness . The small bones are filament- thin and are scarcely noticeable when they 're eaten . <p> The fish swim in shoals , feed on plankton and grow rapidly . They also have a reputation for timidity . In A Natural History of Ireland ( 1755 ) , the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cork was supposedly due to the shock that they experienced after the battle between the English and French . <p> Sardines are perfect for fine- weather grilling and barbecuing . Fire crisps the skin and outdoor cooking provides natural ventilation ( there 's no denying their somewhat pungent odour ) . In Spain and Portugal , they are often butterflied before being grilled or deep-fried . <p> They lend themselves well to North African-style treatment . Preserved lemon , for example , cuts the oiliness in a refreshingly tart way , and spices such as ginger , cumin , cinnamon and nutmeg bring out the richness . <p> Seafood chef Mitch Tonks suggests a simple but brilliant way of grilling them with fennel seeds , black pepper and sea salt , while Greek cookbook author Aglaia Kremezi has a recipe for sardelosalata , a sardine version of taramosalata . <p> Pilchards can be used in a similar way . In the past , Cornish folk would pickle the fresh fish or bake them in a marinade of spiced vinegar . Fresh pilchards poked their heads heavenwards in stargazy pies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called dippie . <p> Pilchard preservation is part of a very old export trade when Cornish fish would be salted and pressed for France or salted and smoked for hotter countries such as Italy and Spain . The Pilchard Works in Newlyn keeps the tradition alive in partnership with the oldest sardine cannery in Brittany . <p> France was the birthplace of the canned sardine industry , when the technology of new 19th-century conservation methods came together with the push to feed the growing number of French foot soldiers . <p> The second most exciting innovation to happen to the sardine was probably the replacement of the ever-elusive key with the ring-pull . <p> The finest , hand-prepared , canned sardines are always fresh , never frozen . They command a cult following , have vintage years like wine and need to be turned regularly so they age evenly . Iconic cookery writer Elizabeth David was once sternly informed by the director of a top French cannery that its fine sardines should never be cooked or served hot on cold toast ... Please , no shock treatment ' . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , is R+del . They are packed in olive oil , with or without skin and bones , but they also make flavoured ones with green peppercorns , lemon , peppers and truffles . I never thought I would get so excited about tinned sardines until I tasted them , although they average around -5 per elegant can . My mother and all her friends down the Co-op would have had a fit . <h> Wit and Wisdom <p> On St Anthony 's Day on 12 June , the Portuguese eat masses of sardines on bread , usually at big street parties . <p> The term sardine ' in the US can also refer to other small canned fish such as herring . Norwegian sardines are brislings ( also known as silds or sprats ) , a small fish native to the North Sea . <p> One of the most unusual varieties of sardine is the sardinella tawilis , a freshwater species found only in the Philippines . <p> Oscar Wilde 's son , Vyvyan Holland , started London 's first sardine tasting club in 1935 . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 15th century , is derived from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia . <p> Spike Milligan wrote a poem Sardine Submarine , in which a sardine describes the latter as a tin full of people ' . <p> This article was published on 12th October 2016 so certain details may not be up to input 191561 @qwx1051561 191571 @qwx1051571

It is the country 's designated capital , although internationally it is rarely recognised as such , with disputes over territory meaning most countries regard Tel Aviv as the capital .

Layered with history , riven by politics and permeated with religious intensity , every inch of this city has been disputed , worshipped and fought over for millennia . Originally a small mountain stronghold among the cliffs and valleys of the surrounding hills , it was already ancient when David captured the citadel of Zion . The Old City walls remain intact " the skyline should be a wonder of the world " but the modern city to the west is an earthly counterpart to its heavenly twin .

Here is a babble of tongues , a maelstrom of beliefs and a million prayers summoned by bells and muezzin and voices that cry out from the wilderness . The intensity can be both inspirational and overwhelming . Jerusalem Syndrome , a recognised psychological condition brought about by religious excitement , takes its toll on pilgrims every year . Multiple images bombard the visitor : a Moroccan-Jewish busker playing an oud ( similar to a lute ) ; black-hatted hasidic men , heads bowed before the Western Wall ; Ethiopian priests in mysterious candlelit chapels ; shopkeepers reading their Koran aloud ; sophisticated , ironically named Margaritas Al-Jazeera ' ; melange coffee and strudel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery steps of Via Dolorosa ; and hawkers of thorn crowns , olive-wood crucifixes and shot glasses embossed with the motto I Jesus ' . <p> Yet despite the undeniable tensions , people are people here , not labels , and there are daily examples of co-existence that bridge the fault lines . Jerusalemites like to tell the story about the years the city was divided between Israel and Jordan , when the armistice line , instead of today 's sleek light railway , ran past the French Hospital . A patient coughed so hard one day that her false teeth flew out the window , landing in no-man's-land . A diplomatic mission ensued , with the dentures finally retrieved thanks to the intercession of the UN . <p> For all the contradictions and complexities , there is a common current of humanity here for those who choose to look for it .

The Jerusalem Hills are covered with wild herbs and plants " hyssop , sumac , saltwort , chicory , wild garlic and rocket , beet leaves and rue . Even wild caper plants spring like parables from the boulders of the Herodian Western Wall . Deuteronomy cited seven species in the Land of Israel : dates , pomegranates , olives , figs , grapes , wheat and barley . Today , that list could be multiplied infinitely . <p> A re-awakened interest in native foods now informs much of the strong and bold , sweet and sour cooking of new Jerusalem cuisine : green almonds with fuzzy , peach-like skin ; nutty roasted young wheat called freekeh ; toasted sesame seeds ; labneh ( a creamy strained-yoghurt cheese ) ; pomegranate molasses ; and spice blends such as rose petals , cumin and cardamom . <p> After the first winter rains , green mallow is used like spinach .

When the fighting stopped , they were only too glad to abandon it until chefs such as Moshe Basson reintroduced it to a new generation eager to explore their local and biblical roots . <p> An Iraqi refugee who came to Jerusalem in 1951 as a small boy , Moshe learnt about wild herbs from the kitchens of Arab and Druze friends . Still an enthusiastic forager , he is astonishingly knowledgeable about botany , herbal medicine and religious lore . Jerusalem sage , which he stuffs like grape leaves , he explains is also called moriah , like the mountain , and looks like a Jewish candelabra ( menorah ) when it flowers . On the terrace of his restaurant , Eucalyptus , facing the Old City walls , Moshe grows a wide variety of edible plants so diners can pick their own salad . He also forages for recipes and stories . One of his most famous dishes is the theatrical maglube , a Palestinian speciality of chicken , rice and potatoes cooked in a huge pot then turned upside-down . There is no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Rather his philosophy is about learning , sharing and the breaking of bread with others . <p> It is a view implicitly shared by Palestinian chef Aharon Alian , who is greeted by stallholders as he picks his way courteously through the congested alleys of the Arab Market . Past stalls brimming with vegetables , spices , seeds and nuts , shawarma and kebab stands , he points out the best brand of Nablus tahini , and we nibble loops of sesame bread sprinkled with ground hyssop from paper twists . <p> Over the legendary hummus of Abu Shukri he describes favourite feast-day dishes such as mansaff ( whole stuffed lamb with almonds , pine nuts and rice ) and vine leaves with tongue . Morning , he says , is the customary time for hummus , otherwise It sits like concrete in your stomach ' .

( Za'atar also happens to be the Hebrew word for hyssop . ) Even more elemental is the goat 's cheese produced outside the city on the slopes of Mount Eitan , on the edge of nowhere . The white-bearded Shai Seltzer strikes a visionary , Old Testament figure as he awaits visitors . The world comes to Shai , not the other way round . For over 40 years , he has made an outstanding range of cheese , matured in a natural limestone cave , and has bred a variety of goat highly adapted to the habitat .

Okay , that might be overstating things , but it does seem that spinach is for grown-ups " whatever Mr Popeye has to say . <p> Perhaps the widespread childhood revulsion is due to the brutal treatment so much spinach has suffered at the hands of careless cooks over the years . A slimy mound of battle-dress green on the plate is never going to tempt youthful tastebuds " especially when promoted with the dreaded tag line : And , it 's good for you .

Spinach is mentioned in the first-known English cookbook , The Forme of Cury ( 1390 ) , where it is called spinnedge ' . When Catherine de Medici , born in Florence , became queen of France in 1533 , she so loved spinach she insisted it be served at every meal .

Kitchen gardeners have a wider choice of varieties , including Bordeaux Red ' with striking red stems and star-shaped leaves , Mediana ' with a pleasant , earthy flavour , and Scenic ' which has a soft , melt-in-the-mouth texture and slightly bitter flavour . The gardener 's choice , perhaps , is Dominant ' , favoured in Raymond Blanc 's vegetable garden at Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons for its superb texture and taste , and resistance against mildew and other diseases .

It 's an ideal vegetable for a desert island choice , marrying with just about anything . It can be eaten raw with nuts , cheese , oranges , fennel and the like , but also appears in tarts , curries , soups , pasta , dumplings , omelettes and more egg dishes than you can count .
