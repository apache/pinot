No , these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the post that these are for decor use only . However , I know there are paints that are food save . They do require being " set " in the oven first . Ill have to test these out and share in a future post <p> Hi Violets Cottage ! In this case ( with the old dishes ) , I did not use a primer . I bought the " paint and primer in one " spray paint , and it really has held up well . I flip my objects with each coat . Light coats are the trick and I typically start with the object right side up . Once in dries , I flip it upside down and give it another ( light ) coat . I just repeat this process until the object has a nice paint coat . Thanks for the comment ! <p> Great post and I love the how-to info . I would only add to make sure that your thrift store finds are actually worthless before painting . I 'd hate to see a Roseville pot worth $1600 turned worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antiques Roadshow and then that day found one at Goodwill , but mine was only worth $60 ) . Quite often Ive seen on Flea Market Flip where they plan to paint over a piece of furniture and the host shows them how much more its worth in its current condition . Check before you wreck <p> You 're right , Dave ! That would definitely be a tragedy ! Painting is a great thing when its used on ( worthless ) pieces that would otherwise be thrown to the curb . Its always good to do your research before you pull out the paint ! Thanks for you comment . <p> Great post ! Although I noticed you would n't be able to serve food in it . Do you think it would be safe if just the outside is repainted ? I found a white gravy dish with hideous printing on the side that I just want to cover up so the whole thing is white . <p> Hi Samantha ! I hate to tell you yes if there is something toxic in the paint , but I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried any yet , but its completely safe for eating . You do have to bake the piece in your oven ( just like you would in a kiln ) to set the paint . Good luck and thanks for the comment ! <p> Hi Joyce . I really do n't  think you need to worry about this . I 'm guessing very few people paint their dishes like I did . But if a dish was spray painted , it would be fairly easy to tell that it was done . Its almost impossible not to have a few drips here and there . So , no worries ! <p> lovely idea . I stumbled across a lovely teapot on a flea market and will spray paint it to give to my Mum for her birthday . What do you figure , if I close off the spout and lid area , so only spray paint the outside that it can still be used ( as in used to make tea every 2 years , knowing my Mum ) ? <p> I would love to be able to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic . I recently spray painted the outside of the lids to my canisters , but the paint will never be heated liked your teapot . There is ceramic paint , and I definitely think your Mums teapot would benefit greatly from this type of paint ! You paint it and then set it using an oven to heat it . Good luck , and I hope I helped ! <p> I really do think they would be fine for water and flowers . Spray paint is oil based , so it should hold up well to a situation like this . Also , you just need to paint the outside of the vases . Good luck ! ! <p> I just happened upon your blog and had to laugh when I read your bio . I too love to paint and there is nothing I wont try . Everyone knows this about me . In fact , my husband often says that the only reason he has n't  been painted is because he keeps moving ! My latest project was a fabric tub chair . It needed a lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VanGogh chalk paint to the rescue . It turned out great ! Keep on creating ! <p> Kim , I think you and I would be the best of friends !

If you do n't  know this technique , I promise its fairly simple and you can check out my tutorial HERE . <p> Making the calendar lines was the hardest part . I went with 7 boxes across for the days of the week and 5 boxes down . Unfortunately I did n't  think about the fact that a few months start on Saturday and actually require 6 boxes down ( Like this month , March 2014 ) . Anyway , I 'll just be a day late ( or early ) switching the months , and this will solve my problem . <p> I used a ( semi permanent ) chalk pen on the quote , days of the week and grid lines ( I did 4 inch squares ) . This way , when I erase the board every month , only the events erase . <p> *I found these chalk pens on Amazon . They are great for chalkboards you want to keep more " permanent " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so long to get back to you on the dimensions for the mail sorter turned shoe cubby . Here they are : <p> The actual shoe cubbies vary in size . They are anywhere from 5.5 " 6.5 inches in height &amp; width . <p> The entire piece is 56 inches long &amp; 48 inches high The piece is 8.25 inches wide . ( My oldest son wears a men 's size 7 shoe , and his shoes are almost too big for this piece . I would suggest making the piece wider to accommodate larger sizes . ) <p> I love that little organizer sitting on top of your cubby . Where did you get it , or did you make it ? Its adorable , I really like it . Perfect for important papers you need to keep close to your beautiful claender &amp; the drawers are perfect for chalk , erasers , &amp; pens etc .

Good luck ! <p> Chalk pens are pretty permanent I use them and do n't  have any problems with them erasing when I change the calendar . However if these are n't  working for you , you could try a china marker . Its actually an oil based pencil , and it is definitely permanent . You can find them on Amazon . Good luck with your school year ! <p> So crazy I saw this post yesterday and 20 mins later I headed to goodwill to drop off some things , I thought I 'd have a wee snoop around and I think I found the exact same mirror as you have here for $9.99 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could post a picture here ! 24 hours later and thanks to your tutorial I now have an awesome calendar !

Im thrilled to say that I finally found the perfect mirror though it is a bit larger than yours thankfully the space can hold it !

For my calendar , I used the chalk pen to create the little quote and gridlines , and then I just use regular ( sharpened ) chalk for everything else ( my changing things ) . I have been using china markers ( actually more like an oil pencil ) for projects like this . However , it also is more permanent and best for things that do n't  need changed . Unfortunately I do n't  think I really have a solution for you , but I hope I helped a little ! <p> Through a series of clicks and such via Pinterest , I spotted this chalkboard mirror .

Sometimes I pressed so hard with the pen , that the chalkboard has a slight indentation but nothing big . Good luck on your project ! <p> This looks so pretty . You chose great fonts . I have a chalkboard fridge like yours and love writing Scripture verses on it above the area where my 2 year-old doodles . Thanks for showing me how to make it look even prettier ! <p> LOVE your site , your talent , your kindness and help and inspiration ! ! !

As in sizes , brands , etc . ? ? ? ? ? I would appreciate it , if its not too imposing or intrusive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole . It helps to " season " your chalkboard first . To do this , take long end of the chalk and basically color the entire board . Then using a dry rag , rub in the chalk all over the board . The chalkboard will no longer be a stark black , and you wo n't notice the chalk around the letters as much . Also , using the chalk pen helps . Once it dries , you can run a dry cloth over it and its wont erase or smudge . Hope I helped ! <p> Hi Karen ! Its confusing how I had it set up , so I ( hopefully ) made it easier . Check out the post now , and see if you can find the links . They are called " give us " and " give us2 . " Let me know you you have any problems ! <p> Life changing ! This totally works !

Found you on Pinterest ! <p> Hi Sonal If you use chalk pens , you just wipe away the extra chalk from outside the font . Chalk pens are great for more permanent chalk art because you ca n't wipe away the chalk pen you have to use water . <p> I like to use rub a pencil on the back and it transfers clean so you can fill it in and have no mess . = I use this method when painting lettering for signs or the walls or doors at home . Its awesome . LOVE your mirror . <p> Just wanted to say that I used this excellent tutorial ( which I found on Pinterest of course ! ) to make sign of an Emily Bronte quote for my wedding = it turned out beautifully and I 'm so happy I found your post ! Thanks ! <p> Hi ! Just wanted to add that some paint stores ( like Benjamin Moore ) sell chalkboard paint that you can get tinted any colour instead of just black or green . Makes your projects stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mine is a colour called Dinner Party from Benjamin Moors Affinity Colour Collection . <p> i am thinking of doing this for my 5 year anniversary . How do you get the excess chalk off after you cover the back of the paper with chalk ? Is the chalk pen safe enough to wipe the excess off without messing up ? <p> 1 . cover the back of the paper entirely with chalk ? 2. tape the paper onto the chalkboard with the words facing you 3. then trace . <p> Those are the steps correct ? Sorry for the redundancy by i 'm not an artist and i 'm just trying to ensure i 'm doing it correctly . <p> Hi Raymond ! Once you use the chalk pen and it dries , you can easily wipe off the excess chalk . And yes , your steps are perfect ! You really only need to put the chalk behind the letters/art you 're transferring . So , if you have a lot of white space around your letters , you could cut around it if that makes sense ? Also , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want it shifting around . Also , make sure you apply pressure when tracing . <p> Hi Lucy ! This is absolutely not a silly question . Once the chalk pen dries , you cant smudge it . The only way to remove it is with water . So , dusting off the chalk residue does n't  smudge your chalkboard art . Good luck ! <p> I 've had a couple pieces made by a local chalkboard artist , and she used china markers . ( You can find them on Amazon , and they actually are pencils ) . The piece she created for me was setting behind my stove for a long time , and the " chalk " never smeared , faded or melted ! Also , I know she frequents art fairs , and Ive see her stuff sitting in the hot sun and it does great ! She does spray a clear sealant over her pieces , but I 'm not sure if this is necessary or not . I hope this works for you . Good luck with you chalkboards for the cafe ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and it works great ! I used actually chalk , as the chalkboard I am using is for work and I will be changing it every month .

Click HERE for the source ! <p> I have been admiring shiplap walls for awhile , and I finally decided to create one for our home . - I enlisted the help of my husband , and we completed this large wall ( 9 feet x 20 feet ) in one weekend ! <p> There are several ways to create a shiplap wall ( see my earlier post HERE ) , but we- decided to go the easy route and bought pre-cut pine boards that have a- simple- tongue and groove system . <p> We- found these boards at Lowes- and bought 11 packages . We had plenty of extra small pieces leftover ( the extra will be used on a smaller wall in our mudroom ) . <p> Do n't  get overwhelmed at the thought of doing this project because it is definitely doable. - We installed the shiplap- with some hard cuts ( two outlets , a light switch and a hood ) in one- day and painted the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sanding Block <p> Tape Measure <p> Pine Tongue and Groove Boards <p> Wood Filler <p> Primer &amp; Paint <p> Jig Saw <p> Chop Saw <p> Stud Finder <p> Pencil <p> Nail Gun &amp; Nails ( we used 16 gauge nails ) <p> Caulk <p> Level Ruler <p> The cost of the supplies for this wall was under $200. - The wood boards cost around $100 and the primer , paint , nails , wood filler and caulk were under $100 . <p> Begin by sorting the boards , - because you will find flawed boards . - Save the flawed boards to cut into smaller pieces . <p> Although most of our flawed boards were minor , there were a couple that looked like this . <p> To begin , mark the studs ( using the stud finder and level ruler ) . - Then begin at the bottom with the first row . - Use a level to make the first row is straight ( and continue using the level throughout the entire process ) . <p> When possible , use- the full 8 foot board . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure to measure ( twice ) before cutting . <p> In order to keep seams consistent , make a game plan . <p> For our wall , we started from the bottom right with a full 8 foot board and cut the one on the left . - Then we used a full 8 foot board on the left and cut the one on the right . - We continued this patterned all the wall up the wall . - The door frame obviously required another solution . <p> Use- a nail gun and put two nails in each stud . <p> Use- a chop saw for the easy cuts . <p> And a jig saw for- harder cuts . <p> The jig saw is great for going around outlets , light switches and any other obstacle you may need to tackle . <p> You can buy electrical box extenders for outlets and light switches to bring them out over the ship lap . - We left ours sunk in in because we are in the process of ( slowly ) replacing them throughout the home . <p> We created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen hood , traced the pattern on the wood and cut with the jigsaw . <p> With some planning , patience and time , we had a completed wall ! <p> The next step was filling the nail holes . - I had my oldest help out with this , and we managed to fill 800 ( ! ! ) - holes pretty quickly . <p> After the wood filler dries , we sand the holes and use a roller to prime the wall . <p> Once the primer is dry , add paint . - Our wall required one coat of primer plus two coats of paint .

I only recommend products that I love and use myself ! <p> I love the shiplap on your wall . You &amp; your husband did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your entire space that I can see from the photos . Just beautiful ! Are you all the next Joanna &amp; Chip ? lol <p> Hi Sara ! Great work ! I absolutely love shiplap . As for the outlets and light switch plates , you can get little extensions for the outlets and oversized plates so they do n't  have that sunk in look . We have used them on many projects and love it . <p> Hi Briana ! Were in the process of updating all our light switches , but its been a slow process . When we ( eventually ) replace ours in the kitchen , were definitely going to use the extensions . Thanks for the suggestion ! <p> Your wall looks amazing . We are buying a new house and I want to add a couple shiplap walls in our home . But I have a really " dumb question . On some of the walls I have looked at online they seem to have a dark color in between the boards and others do not . I love the look of the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving this or is it just the way the light hits the wall ? Help ! ! ! <p> That 's not a dumb question at all ! The wood I used as shiplap has a tongue and groove system which makes installation really easy . The real shiplap does n't  have this , and the dark color between the boards is actually just a gap in the wood . So if you want the dark color in-between the boards , you need to go with something that does n't  have a tongue and groove . Good luck with your new house ! <p> Hi Kathy ! You should be able to go up to the crown molding without removing it . However , cutting the boards will be tricky because the wood is very soft . Caulking it will give you some forgiveness , but removing it may be easier than trying to cut around it . I think I would leave it up and see where the shiplap ends up you may luck out and not have to cut anything ! However , if you 're not so lucky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molding . <p> I do n't  understand why you would go through all of that work and not put the boards underneath the outlets and light switches . Its baffling to me . It wouldve been easier . It wouldve looked nicer with a more finished look . All you wouldve had to do would take the plates off , put the boards around the outlet , applying spacers if needed to make the outlet more secure to the wall once its screwed back in . You are n't  the first one Ive seen do this . If anyone decides to do this , put the boards under the plates ! You would n't have to worry about very precise cutting in those areas at the very least ! = <p> Hey Laura we left ours sunk in because we are replacing the light switches/outlets in our home slowly ( actually my dad is and he does a room every time he visits ) . The new switch plates are larger , and we decided wed pull them out ( and deal with spacers or whatever else was required ) once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-entertainment center using the tongue and groove also . I 'm getting ready to paint it and I have a question for you . Did you hide the vertical seams or just let them show . I cant decide if I want them or if I want it to look like one continuous board going all the way across ? <p> Hi ! I love how your wall turned out ! I just finished helping my friend shiplap a wall in her kitchen with the plywood planks . Something her husband ( who 's an electrician ) showed us is to cut the boards around the outlets bigger than the size of the box that 's in the wall . This way you can pull the outlet out flush with the wall and have something to screw into to secure it . We were just going to buy the extenders but this worked perfectly ! I know you are replacing your outlets but I thought maybe someone else would benefit from this little tip . And I love your sign as well ! <p> I 've just done the same thing in my entryway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joints has cracked once dried ( probably to do with expansion and contraction .

The rast works , but its not the highest quality piece , and the drawers stick a little . As far as supplies , its hard to say exactly how much I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a friend who owns a glass/mirror company , so he did the mirrors for me and the hardware company sent me the drawer knobs .

I guess this is pretty inexpensive when you compare it to the Anthro version ? ! <p> Thanks so much , Meaghan ! I LOVE the way it turned out . Unfortunately ( just recently ) my daughter was playing with the knobs and tightened one too much and cracked a mirror . I can have it replaced , but I 'm so bummed ! Good luck if you go for it , and keep little hands away from the knobs ! = <p> I think its just the reflection of my ( beige ) carpet that you 're referring to ?

I would suggest putting felt under the knobs ( per a readers suggestion ) . I made the mistake of not doing that , and my 4 year old tightened the knobs too much and cracked a mirror on a drawer . Keep 4 year olds away , and you should be fine ! Good luck ! <p> Hi Sara , The dresser came out beautiful ! I bought the dresser and plan on copying what you did this weekend ..

This made it more difficult for my husband to follow the lines , so I would skip this step next time . <p> Now is where my husband stepped in . He put the baseboard in first ( he used trim nails for this and hit studs whenever possible ) . <p> Next , he put up the wider piece at the top . <p> Now it was time to put in the vertical pieces . <p> And then , it was time for the small horizontal pieces lots of cutting , leveling , and fitting .

Thanks , nancy <p> I have n't ever used chalk paint on paintable wallpaper , but I assume it would work ! It would just be thicker than your typical latex paint , but you can water down chalk paint if needed . Chalk paint is great for adding dimension which is what it sounds like you need . Also , you could try using gilding wax to add a metallic look if that 's what you 're looking for .

@@28898756 @2598756/ <p> One Step Paint eliminates the need for sanding , stripping and priming , and it has the chalky finish you know I love . I cleaned my bench , and I was ready to paint ! <p> One step paint is meant to be opaque , but you can add a second coat if you prefer complete coverage . For my bench , I was looking for that more opaque look , so I painted only one coat of Atelier . <p> Although I eventually want to reupholster the bench seat ( the faux leather is in bad condition ) , I decided to paint it as a temporary fix . I used the One Step Paint in Bauhaus Buff . I stippled it on using a large round brush . <p> Since I wanted complete coverage , I added a second coat once the first coat was dry .

I brushed it on using long clean strokes . I waited until it came to tack meaning it was sticky . I waited around 15 minutes for it to come to tack , but it does depend on how thick you paint on the sizing . <p> The gold leaf comes in book . I cut my book in half so it was the right size for my piece , and I did n't  waste the leaf . <p> Applying the gold leaf takes a little practice , but the more you do it , the easier it becomes ! <p> Pull the tissue back and while holding onto the tissue and the gold , turn it toward your piece and hold the end with your left hand and lay down firmly . <p> While holding the tissues in place rub your fingers back and forth burnishing it into the surface . <p> When you pull up , pull the tissue away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match lines .

This allows for some of the paint to show through . <p> Once the gilding process is done , you can begin the waxing process . Although One Step paint does n't  require sealing , I used light wax to give my piece some age . <p> I put my brush into the wax and off loaded it to get the wax even on my brush . <p> Next , I went over the entire piece and allowed it to dry for around 20-30 minutes . Once dry , I did the same process with the Dark Wax . <p> The Dark Wax is what makes the piece look aged .

Its amazing what you can do with paintthe bench turned out perfect .. I love it ! <p> I have used rub n buff before , and it can provide really pretty results !

@@28898757 @2598757/ <h> How to Paint a Faucet <p> Have you ever wondered if you can paint a faucet ? - Our house was built in the 90s. - The 90s = brass . - Lots and lots of brass . So , believing anything can be painted , I decided to paint the brass bathroom faucet . <p> I used Rust-Oleums Painters Touch Ultra Cover paint in Metallic oil rubbed bronze , and this bathroom project barely put a dent in the can . Looks like I have a lot more paint to use ( ! ! ) <p> You can find it on Amazon here ( affiliate link ) : <p> I realized after I had started to tape off my faucet that I did n't  have primer . Now , I was too excited to stop my project and run and get primer . So , although I strongly recommend that you use primer , I did n't  . Ill be the guinea pig for this little experiment , and well see how the faucet holds up without a primer . I figure its a win win situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oil bronze faucet instead of a brass faucet . If it does n't  , I guess I will " have " to buy a new faucet for the sink . I know which scenario my husband is rooting for = <p> Now , it would have been SO much easier to spray paint the faucet ( Rust-Oleum also offer the same product in spray paint ) , but I did not want to have to remove the faucet . So , I taped it off and got to work . <p> It took around three coats of paint and the drying process was long . I did this over a course of 2-3 days . I also had to pull out q-tips to paint some of the hard to reach areas . <p> I havent had much experience using oil-based paint , and it is- a pain ! It is- SO hard to clean off anything your hands , brushes , the sink . I went through a lot of mineral spirits <p> When I pulled off the tape , the paint had seeped through some areas of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden kabob stick to scrape the extra paint off . <p> Overall , I think the project went okay . - I 'm not sure how it will hold up , but I do like the way it looks ! It was MUCH more time consuming than I had expected , but I know a can of paint and time is MUCH cheaper than a new bathroom faucet . <p> My only concern ( and I 'm doing it anyway ) is how did you keep the handles from being ( permanently ) stuck and unable to turn ( on the water ) , etc . Otherwise , love it and as I stated doing it and going for the paint in just a few . Its just beautiful . <p> It looks great I am really curious if it holds up too . But in the meantime wondered if you 'd mind sharing how you prepared the faucet etc to be painted did you use anything special to clean them ? Did you sand ? <p> Its only been a couple weeks , but so far so good ! No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean them with normal bathroom cleaner ( Mr. Clean ) before I painted . I should have used a primer , but I did n't  . I 'll keep you posted on what they look like after a few months of use . Also , if you can remove your faucet , spray painting would be MUCH easier . I just did n't  want to remove it , but I spent a lot more time painting ( by hand ) as a result . Thanks for stopping by , Tina ! <p> I spray painted all my faucets and inside and outside light fixtures ! Hubby removed them and I scuffed them up with med. grade steel wool before spraying them with 1 coat of primer and 2 coats of polished nickel ! All looks awesome <p> I spray painted all my faucets and inside and outside light fixtures ! Hubby removed them and I scuffed them up with med. grade steel wool before spraying them with 1 coat of primer and 2 coats of polished nickel ! All looks awesome <p> Hi Tonya , I 'm so sorry ! I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-painted mine since I did n't  remove the faucets . You can try mineral spirits to remove the overspray , but I would n't use spray paint unless I removed the faucets . I hate that you have this problem ! <p> Hi Jan ! I have n't ever painted a sink , but I think you should go for it ! You can only make the rust spot better , right ? I would try and paint the spot only , and if it looks funny , you can always attempt the entire sink . Start small and go from there . I looked it up on eHow , and buying the right paint is what 's most LONG ... <p> Hey Judy ! I hope it continues to hold up . My sinks have been painted for over 18 months , and they have held up pretty well . I do have to do the occasional touchup , but its been pretty minor . Good luck ! <p> For the pain of painting and cleaning with oil based paint over several days , put your brushes etc in a plastic bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Works for both oil and latex paints . Rollers and brushes are fine after a few minutes of thawing time . <p> No , I do n't  have a particular primer that I would recommend . I have used Zinser BIN in the past on other projects , and it works well . Honestly I would probably look for a paint and primer in one next time . I know it has n't  been very long , but so far the paint is adhering great to the faucet as is . Rust-Oleum does make an amazing product ! ( And I 'm not being paid to say that . ) <p> Hi Lynette ! My faucet actually had some ( not much ! ) calcium buildup on it too , and I just painted right over it . However , this is probably not the correct thing to do . = I googled it , and there are all kinds of remedies to remove calcium buildup . I 'm not sure if any of them work , but there are a lot of solutions out there various chemicals , vinegar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to try and remove the buildup , I would try sanding or using steel wool before I painted the faucets . Good luck ! <p> I was wondering how it has held up on the drain part of your sink ? We just bought a house in January that was built in 1998 and the master bath is all brass . It has a jacuzzi tub with the brass fittings and I HATE them lol I was thinking of painting them but not sure how it would hold up to the water jets <p> I think our house was built the same year , and we have the same jacuzzi tub you 're talking about . = You know , the drain has actually held up well , and I was fully expecting it to be chipping quickly . Really the only paint coming off is around the section where the faucet handles turn . There 's just a little bit of paint coming off because of the constant moving of the faucets on and off , but not enough that anyone else would probably notice . I say go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ! ! <p> I 'm very curious how your facet will hold up with cleaning they look fantastic ! ! ! I have used the same product to paint all my gold light fixtures and my gold cabinet pulls . I also chose to hand paint it on as I did n't  want to remove the ceiling light fixtures time consuming , but well worth every minute . Keep us posted on the stay power with cleaning of your facets ! ! ! <p> Hi Cindy ! I 'm actually posting a 3 month blog update on the faucets tomorrow , so come back and check it out ! They have held up pretty well , and I 'm a *little* paranoid of germs , so they 've been cleaned with some pretty hard cleaning agents including bleach . = I love that you painted all your fixtures and pulls . I 've got a lot more work to do around my house <p> I am still pleased ! I have had to do quick touch ups twice since I originally painted this faucet and these were 5 minute touch ups where I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any touch ups with your light fixture since it does n't  get touched . Good luck with your project , Carla ! <p> Oh , I wish I ha know about that paint 3yrs ago ! I bought the spray an it was a major pain to get off the fixers . Some are still NOT painted because I did NOT want to take them off . Now , I do n't  have any more excuses . Yes , I did prime my shower head first . Still looking great . <p> Love your blog , Sara , and have been popping over every so often . = My husband and I live overseas and the only paint we 've found is oil based ! I did n't  realize it when we purchased the paint but when I went to wash my hands I totally realized ! ( Should have been tipped off by the " slight " odor when I opened the can ! ) Anyway , what has really saved me for getting it off my hands , brushes , and accidental little spills ( even my clothes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regular old cooking oil first ( until the paint starts smearing ) , THEN washing them with traditional liquid dish soap ! It comes off SO easily ! ! I was SHOCKED ! ! And in some ways I actually prefer it over latex for getting it off since I feel like I 've usually had to scrub and scrub when I 've gotten those itty bitty paint splatters on myself . Anyway , sorry for the long comment but this little regimen has been such a game changer for me , I thought I 'd share ! Beats using a screwdriver to chip it off ! = Thanks for blogging ! <p> Lisa , Thanks so much for popping over to see me keep coming back ! Thanks also for the tip ! I generally stay away from oil based paint because its so hard to clean up , but I love this tip and it could be a game changer . Thank you ! <p> Sara : We just got thru upgrading ( somewhat ) our master bath and I replaced some things , but as far as the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to spray paint a dark brass color . That worked just fine . However I have not yet replaced my faucets and am seriously considering doing what you have done to yours . They look awesome . I 'm just wondering how well it would hold up especially when the faucets need to be cleaned ? Any comments ? <p> Hi Margaret ! The faucets have held up fairly well . I am a germ-a-phobe , so I used pretty harsh cleaners . I usually use Mr. Cleans Scrubbing Bubbles , so I am hard on my faucets . I painted them over a year ago , and Ive done two touch ups since then . The touch ups were quick little 5 minute touch ups using a q-tip . However , although small , they do require little touchups from time to time . I hope this helps ! <p> I know I 've seen people on Pinterest do it , so it can be done . It will just require a lot of painters tape and time , but I 'm sure you can do it ! My only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could possibly see some peeling where the door shuts . Good luck ! ! <p> i guess I would use RubnBuff that you rub on and not worry about primers , sealers . Its found on Amazon . You do n't  have to worry about spray particles or chemicals in the air or sink . I have only used it on pulls for dressers and legs for a treadle sewing machine and sold all of them so have n't followed . I would however use disposable gloves when using it so prevent staining your hands altho mineral spirits or even Criso cleans oil base paint up . <p> I love RubnBuff , but I have found that the longevity is n't great . I have a friend who did her cabinet pulls and knobs with it , and it rubbed away within a few months . However , I would love to hear others experiences with it ! <p> I wanted to get your thoughts on my next project . I have gold trim around my shower that I want to paint an oil rubbed bronze . I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are holding up well . I used the Rust-oleum spray paint / primer on them but I am a little afraid to spray paint my shower trim . I have nightmares of spray mist going all over my bathroom and onto the stone . Instead , I purchased a can of the Rust-oleum Painters Touch Ultra Cover that you used for your first venture with painting faucets . I wanted to get your thoughts on the pros and cons of spray painting vs regular painting since you have done both . I have n't found anyone else who has tried regular painting for shower trim so I am a bit nervous about doing it . Do you have any thoughts or suggestions ? Thanks ! <p> I also have some gold trim that I NEED to paint . Its a big project , but I believe you 're thinking about it the right way . I once tried spray painting something inside , and I still got overspray on my floor despite covering the area first . The paint in the can is GREAT . Just tape off your areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure each coat is dry before you paint the next . Since its oil-based , it will take a while to dry . You may not be able to use the shower for several days to a week . Let me know how it goes ! <p> Thanks so much for your thoughts I think I 'm going to go for it ! And I think doing several thin coats as opposed to a heavy coat is the way to go . I 'll let you know how it turns out this will be my first project of 2016 . No more putting it off ! Thanks so much for your advice ! = <p> Hi Sindhu ! My faucets are still painted ! However , I am at the point where I need to do some touch up work . They are still painted but there are some places where the paint has chipped . I am considering new faucets since I feel happy that my painted faucets lasted several years , and its probably time to replace them . <h> Trackbacks <p> ( to see more about painting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sconces , click HERE ) , I decided to paint my wall sconces. - And while I was painting , I thought I may as well throw a <p> projects and ideas . - I blog about my DIY home decor endeavors , and I will paint anything . - My painted faucets tutorial is one of my most popular posts along with my tutorial for- perfect chalkboard <p> projects and ideas . - I blog about my DIY home decor endeavors , and I will paint anything . - My painted faucets tutorial is one of my most popular posts along with my tutorial for- perfect chalkboard <p> your fixtures with paint .

Luckily it worked mathematically to have five diamonds running across and three diamonds running vertically . <p> It was a little overwhelming when I walked into the room and saw the blank wall . ( My friend had painted it the color of the lighter diamond . ) <p> We used Porter Paints for this wall in Ghost Writer and Hot Stone . <p> I used lots of rulers on this project level ruler , " regular " ruler and a tape measure . <p> I went across the wall and drew lines down the length of the wall one ( center ) line for each of the five rows of diamonds . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) <p> From there , I marked ( with dots ) the corners of all the diamonds . Then , I connected my dots to draw the diamonds . <p> I had to paint the diamonds in sections . I did every other diamond my first round . <p> Then I went back through and painted the second batch of diamonds . <p> ( After I saw the above picture , I immediately schedule an appointment with my hairdresser to fix the bleach out bun . ) <p> Once the diamonds are all painted and dried , you can start on the " stripes . " Again , there was a lot of measure and dots involved . I went through and found the center of each diamond and drew a diagonal line connecting them all before I started painted . <p> For each diagonal line , I used three pieces of tape .

@@28898764 @2598764/ <h> Paint a FABRIC Chair <p> I 'm not afraid to paint things . My motto is : its just paint you can always repaint ! However , I was a little skeptical of the recent popularity with painting upholstered furniture . But , I can now add it to my list because I painted a fabric chair ! <p> The chair I painted was 10 years old , and I actually had it in my Goodwill pile . It looks much better in the photo , but it has seen some wear and tear . <p> Lena had drawn on it , there was a hole in the upholstery , and the seat was pretty grimy despite my numerous attempts to clean the seat . Honestly , this picture does the chair way too much justice . <p> Anyway , I had seen lots of Pinterest pins on people painting upholstered furniture , and I decided this was the perfect opportunity to test it out . <p> I painted the fabric in Annie Sloan Duck Egg and the wooden legs and arms in Annie Sloan Old Ochre . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did two coats ) , I dipped the brush in water before I dipped it in the paint . It helps the fabric absorb the paint better . The first coat took a while , but it was n't hard . Just a little time consuming . <p> It was a little boring at this point , so I decide to give it some stripes inspired by the beach towel I was painting on <p> Or inspired by Lenas little striped socks sticking out in the top right of the photo ? = <p> Anyway , I taped off the stripes . I did n't  measure , but I attempted to visually make them straight and even . <p> I used frog tape , and it worked great ! I really think frog tape is worth the extra money . <p> Next , I sanded down everything . I usually sand after I remove the wax , but I find that I go through so much sand paper this way . The wax really gunks up the sandpaper fast . So , sanding before the wax worked well , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added the wax . <p> I used a bigger wax brush for this project . It helps the waxing process go so much quicker ! <p> ( By the way , I need some lotion on those hands ! ) <p> Then , I used a lint free cloth ( tshirt ) to buff the wax . <p> I was seriously impressed at how easy it was to paint fabric . And , the fabric still can move . The paint does n't  crack at least not yet ! <p> I would n't do this on a " tv watchin ' " chair , but it will make the best office chair ! <h> Comments <p> I love this ! Well , I love all of your projects ! Such a creative mind . I would never think to paint a fabric chair , but I 'm glad people like you are clever ( and brave ) enough to try it out for people like me ! <p> Hi Joy ! I havent had any issues with the chalk paint bleeding or coming off , but I 've only used it indoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not sure if it would hold up outdoors . However , if you were using it in a covered porch I think it could work . Good luck ! <p> I have been working on a chair , a velveteen fabric . Took a couple coats of paint and it is stiffI am hoping I am going the right direction .. so .. sand .. sand .. sand nd then wax ? Your pieces are beautiful ! ! ! ! h <p> Hi Shelly ! Velvet is by far the hardest fabric I have painted . It REALLY soaks up the paint and requires much more paint than other fabric . As a result , it does feel stiffer than my other projects . I sanded ( lightly ) so that the fabric had a smooth look just to even out the paint . I did find that the wax helped soften the paint and give it the more " pleather " feel . So hopefully the wax will soften your piece . Good luck with your project , and I hope I helped ! <p> Hi there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge chair . What a nightmare the chair is . The seat and arms are cracking and the lounger after one weekend of sitting on it , has now started to crack as well . Have done alot of research on how to do this . Yes , usesd ASC paint and wax . The lounger took 4 quarts , plus the wax . This is not that cost effective . That is not the problem , the issue is the cracking . I have sanded the chair on the arms and the seat and there are now visible areas where I have reapplied the paint . Have also left it to cure a couple of weeks before sanding and waxing . Help any suggestions on what could be wrong . Chair on the sides , back etc just need touching up , every couple of weeks . The lounger is not used that often either , but it is also showing cracking etc . Very disappointing as I research more again . No one is mentioning the cracking . I can not be the only one . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oh , Frances . That does sound like a nightmare ! I am so sorry you 've had problems . My first question is did you mix chalk paint &amp; water and not use straight chalk paint ? My other question is what kind of fabric is on the pieces you painted ? I 've had a lot of luck on thick upholstery fabric and not so much luck on velvet . Velvet soaks up the paint and requires SO much paint which can result in some cracking . However , this chair ( which was upholstery fabric not velvet ) in my post is used a lot , and I have n't see any cracking . <p> I adore the way your project has turned out ! i recently found a wingback outside on the side of the road . It had great bones so I snagged it up ! ! ! I am ready to use it ! I have also been pinning on painting fabric but am too afraid I will ruin the chair . <p> I can tell it has been reupholstered within the past 20 years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would you suggest before watering down the fabric ? <p> Also , did you water down the fabric first THEN paint with chalk paint ? OR did you did your brush in water then in paint then painted ? <p> Hi Tiffany ! I painted a tufted fabric headboard I bought at a flea market . I was kind of scared of where it had been , so I did scrub/wash it down as much as I could . However , it really do n't  matter because the paint traps all the gross stuff . = I have tried both watering down the fabric and using paint AND mixing paint and water . I think the best solution is to wet down the fabric some ( you could use a squirt bottle ) and then mix 1 part water to 1 part paint . It takes longer , but I think the result is better .

Good luck ! <p> Beautiful post , thanks for sharing ! Do you have any tips for waxing those intricate details ? I just painted a nightstand with beautiful accents but it was difficult to ensure paint coverage so I 'm nervous about the waxing process there . Thank you ! <p> When waxing , it can be hard because wax can get caught and clump up in the intricate details . A good wax brush is helpful as well as a rag . However , there are times a brush and rug ca n't get all the wax out . I 've used q-tips ( a tedious process ) to clean out some of the extra wax which is what most of us use them for anyway , right ? ! <p> I was disappointed after putting on clear wax . I did n't  want a high gloss but there was absolutely no difference in the look before and after . Did I do something wrong ? I thought it would have somewhat oh a semi glossy look . <p> Hi Sara .

I look forward to hearing from you . Regards , Loraine van Rooyen <p> Hi Loraine ! Thanks so much for the sweet words . Yes , she suggesting varnish instead of the wax . I would suggest a water-based sealer called polycrylic . You can find it at any hardware store . Its so much easier to clean up and wont yellow over time like an oil-based sealer . However , I would n't suggest using a wax and the polycrylic . I would use one or the other . In regards to Mod Podge , they have types that are specifically for furniture/higher used areas . I would suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mod Podge website , you should be able to find what I 'm talking about . It sounds like you have all kinds of fun projects planned . Good luck ! ! <p> Hi ! So my bedroom furniture was a lighter wood , that I painted very dark . I have annie sloan paris grey paint . I really do n't  need to sand down the dark color ? ? Just paint right over it with no prep ? Thank you ! <p> Hi Morgan , you should n't have to sand down the darker color . Chalk paint usually adheres to most surfaces .

@@28898794 @2598794/ <h> Painting Furniture with Milk Paint <p> I love it for the fact that it does not require any prep work , and it is a paint with beautiful dimension . Also , if you paint raw wood , milk paint will soak in and act more like a stain . However , my control-freak self cant handle how unpredictable it can be if you paint a piece that has an existing finish because it has the tendency to chip , and it it hard to control . <p> Milk paint comes in powder form , and as I just mentioned , provides various beautiful results since it reacts to different surfaces in both color and adhesion . Because it is made from natural pigments , milk paint has beautiful dimension and can leave lighter and darker streaks . Also , milk paint will soak into wood ( which is why its so durable ) , but it will react completely differently to a piece that already has a finish . If a finish exists on a piece and milk paint is added , there 's a good chance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us control freaks : If you do n't  love the chippy look and are painting a piece with a existing finish , you can add a bonding agent . A bonding agent is sold separately from chalk paint and usually added to paint . Chipping can still occur with the bonding agent but not to the same extent as it would without . <p> Step One : Mix <p> Milk paint requires mixing . It comes in powder form which is great because it has an indefinite shelf life . However , once mixed the paint needs to be used fairly quickly . To mix , you add one part powder to one part paint . You can add more powder ( or water ) to get the consistency you prefer . Allow the paint to sit for a bit to allow the clumps to absorb water and help the bubbles to go away . Keep in mind that you will need to occasionally mix the paint from time to time since the powder will try and settle at the bottom . <p> Step Two : Paint <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sanding or priming ! Milk paint is thin and drips pretty easily . Use quick strokes and try to stay on top of the drips . Wait for the coats to dry before adding another . I usually do 3 coats of milk paint . <p> Step Three : Sand <p> After you 're done painting , you can sand the piece . Sanding is great if you want to distress and smooth out the finish ( you 'll notice some powder lumps ) . If you have a lot of chipping , you 'll want to smooth out these areas . <p> Step Four : Wax <p> I use wax on my milk painted pieces , but you can also use a polycrylic or oil . I would suggest a polycrylic for highly uses pieces such as cabinets or desks . Hemp oil is great because its food safe . <p> Step Five : Buff <p> Buff the wax using a lint-free cloth . Its pretty easy to see where you missed with the wax , so you can touch up those places with the brush or cloth . Buffing helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also see the more basic tutorials in my Painting Furniture Tutorial Series by clicking HERE . 117092 @qwx317092 <h> Comments <p> Where did the myth get started that milk paint does n't  require prep ? I see it everywhere . Milk paint , of all paints , NEEDS just a little prep . No prep is exactly why it does n't  bond for some folks . Always sand a piece with an existing finish before painting with milk paint . Use a fine grit paper , like 220 . Sanding roughs the glossy surface leaving very tiny valleys , so that the milk paint has something to grab onto . I think you 'll encounter much , much less peeling this way . You may even be able to get by without a bonding additive . Test first though . Just a kindly suggestion . 117095 @qwx317095 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 117093 @qwx317093 <h> Meet Sara 117094 @qwx317094

Then it turned into one wall of the uppers which led to the next wall of cabinets . Well , this week I painted the lower cabinets too .

I did n't  want to be left behind , so I painted what I had left . <p> But first , here 's the kitchen before : <p> And the after : <p> painting kitchen cabinets <p> I painted all the cabinets in Annie Sloans Chalk Paint . The Uppers are painted in Annie Sloan Old Ochre and the lowers are painted in Annie Sloan Versailles .

I am thinking of painting the spare upstairs bathroom cabinet . Would recommend chalk paint or could I use another type . I am think black in color . Any suggestions would be helpful . Thanks . Chelsea <p> The nice thing about chalk paint is that it is SO much easier than the traditional way of painting you skip sanding , primer , etc . However , it really does depend on what look you 're going for . Mine have a rustic farmhouse feel . ( And you can see them in person soon ! ! ) If you want a true black , I 'm not sure chalk paint is the way to go . I do know that there are cabinet painting kits ( I think RustOleum makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cabinets . AND , since you 're doing a bathroom , you have WAY less cabinets than a kitchen . Priming and sanding would n't be as horrible as if you had numerous cabinets . Did I help at all ! ? = Just thinking out loud <p> Sara , you did help . Maybe I need to check out Annie Sloans color options before I commit . Yes I would love to paint my kitchen cabinets but I want to pay a professional painter . One it will be no work for me and hopefully they have more patience and technique . : ) . I think I could take on one lower cabinet though . We can chat more next Saturdsay . Thanks ! <p> Hi . I did paint my oak kitchen cabinets white a of years ago because I wanted to brighten up the room which it did . I painted them with a high gloss enamel paint so I could wash off easily and I wanted them glossy . They do look better but I an still not happy . I have a friend who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are beautiful and this is what I was trying to achieve . Do you have any suggestions of what I need to do ? ? ? Thanks for your help . <p> Hi happy . Are you unhappy because of the color do you want your cabinets to be a light yellow ? Or do you want them glossier ? Unfortunately I rarely work with glossy paint . I tend to stick with chalk paint which is definitely not glossy . However , I do wonder if you can add a coating to the your cabinets to make them glossier ? The finish must be able to work over enamel paint , but a finish would be much easier than repainting everything . Good luck ! <p> Metal cabinets from the 40s ? ! Sounds kind of interesting ! Its been year since I painted mine , and I 'm still exhausted . Its a HUGE undertaking but totally worth it ! I 'm so sorry you havent had luck from professional painters . That 's crazy . Thanks for the comment ! <p> Judy , you can definitely use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to pair with the chalk paint . I LOVE the wax with most of my projects . However , I 'm not loving it for the cabinets . It is n't the easiest to clean , so I would not recommend it . Have you tried a polyurethane or polyacrylic depending on what type of paint you used ? This may help with the chipping . Good luck and thanks for the comment ! <p> I am thinking of painting the cabinets in our trailer and love the idea and look of the Annie Sloane Paint . Would you paint with this and then poly urethane over top ? Can you urethane over the wax as I love the look of the antiquing dark wax . <p> Hi Cheryl ! Since chalk paint is water based , you can use a polycrylic ( which is also water based ) . Also , you ca n't use polycrylic over wax , so I would use a dark glaze instead of the dark wax . You can get a similar look , and you should be able to find the glaze at Lowes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck on your project ! <p> Hi Sara , I love your site and have learned so much more about AS chalk paint . I have taken a class and have done some small painting projects , but I am ready for furniture ! I will be having my kitchen cabinets , along with all three bathrooms , painted ( I wont be doing THAT job ) after the first of the year and have been considering Annie Sloan Chalk Paint . One bit of advice I keep getting is to use Annies floor finishing product rather than her soft wax on kitchen cabinets . Just FYI So other than the cabinets I am almost done remodeling and upgrading our whole house what a huge and expensive job and I am still married ! Ha ! The final room to be done ( floor to ceiling literally ! New beadboard ceilings and hardwood floors ) is my art studio/office . I have selected three big pieces to paint with ASCP , including my huge old oak teachers desk , and your tutorials have been incredibly helpful . I feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so glad you found me , and thanks so much for the tip . Using the floor finishing product instead of the wax probably is a great idea . The wax has held up okay , but I do wish I had received advice to not use it in the kitchen before I did my cabinets . I 'd love to see your home before and after . It sounds like you are doing some amazing things ! Good luck and thanks so much for the comment ! <p> Love your blog ! We did a remodel/addition with new kitchen . My old kitchen is now my laundry room . Do you think using AS chalk paint with wax finish would be ok for old kitchen cabinets/new laundry cabinet ? Im assume the laundry cabinets wont get as dirty/greasy as they would like in your kitchen . Or if the cabinets were still in your laundry room you would try a different sealer like a polycrylic ? Thank you ! ! <p> Thanks , Kaylin ! I really would still advise you to stay away from a wax finish even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lint that flies around a laundry room and how it will constantly be trying to stick to the wax . I 'm actually just getting ready to paint my laundry cabinets , and I 'm going to use Amy Howards chalk-type paint . Its available at Ace Hardware stores , and I LOVE her stuff ! Its actually called One Step Paint , but it is a chalk paint . AND , she has a matte ( or glossy ) sealer that works great on cabinets , tables and floors . here 's a link to her products : http : **32;0;TOOLONG I think the cost is similar to Annie Sloan paint , but I do find the One Step paint to come in colors I prefer and it seems to show less brush strokes . Good luck ! <p> Hi ! I 'm going to do my first chalk paint project soon , so thanks so much for your tutorials ! I 'm going to start with a smaller project , but I am also interested in doing my kitchen cabinets . I would be painting oak cabinets that have already been painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two questions First , how has the ASCP held up on the corners and other high wear areas after a year of use and water drips ? Second , I 'm assuming I can paint right on top of the previous paint job , after a good cleaning , right ? <p> Hi Elisabeth ! My ASCP has held up amazingly well over two years later . My only complaint is that I used wax instead of a polycrylic sealer . The " high gloss " part makes me a little nervous , but the paint should hold . I would definitely us a stronger cleaner like TSP which you can find in the paint section . It can also serve as a deglosser which would be good for you . Check out Amy Howard paint : http : //www.amyhowardhome.com She also makes a chalk-type paint ( she calls it " one step paint " ) , and it is great . She has a matte sealer I 'm getting ready to use on my laundry cabinets , and you can find her product at Ace Hardware .

@@28898807 @2598807/ <h> Chalkboard Fridge <p> We are not big fans of the fridge that came with our house . Its old , glossy black and just hard to maneuver . It opens towards the cabinets , and not only are you squashed , but you have to be on your knees to rummage through the fridge . However , my husband and I are too pratical to replace it right now . <p> I decided the only way to make this thing work in the space was to paint it . Luckily my husband was okay with this idea especially since it will eventually become the garage fridge . <p> First , you need to clean your fridge with a cleaner . You want a clean surface for the paint to adhere to <p> After you have a clean surface , the fun can begin ! I taped off the edges ( I wanted crisp lines even if I was painting black over black ) . And , I used a small roller for this project . <p> I gave the fridge *two coats of chalkboard paint . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foil so it did n't  dry out . <p> *I would suggest using a primer before the chalkboard paint especially on a glossy surface like my fridge . <p> I gave the fridge the second coat with the roller and left it alone for 24 hours . <p> The next day , I treated the chalkboard paint with chalk . You cover the entire " board " with chalk and rub it in with a rag . <p> Now , my fridge was ready ! <p> I wanted the top to be our family schedule , so I printed out the days of the week along with a cute little design to go on the side . <p> I used a chalk pen on my design and days of the week . ( See more about the chalk pen in this post . ) This way , its a lot harder to wipe it away ( you actually have to use water to remove ) . My weekly schedule , on the other hand , I just write in with chalk and can easily wipe it away every week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love your adventurous creativity ! If the direction your frig opens is a problem , it may be possible to remove the door and change the handles and hinges . Many refrigerators have the ability to be either right-handed opening or left-handed opening . Check your owners manual if interested . <p> Hi Becky ! Thanks so much for visiting my blog and thanks for the suggestion ! We did look into switching the door , but there is n't a handle on the other side . Which now that I think about it , may be a good thing . A childproof fridge would help me better control the juice box consumption <p> You know , we looked into switching the direction of the door , but there is an obvious handle on one side of both the freezer and fridge .

What a brilliant idea I love the idea of a removable chalkboard . Were stuck with ours . I also love that you have a Lena , too . Our Lena is just Lena its not short for anything . I 've always loved the name . I had a great grandmother named Lena and saved the name until I got my girl ! = <p> Hi Shawn ! No , chalk markers are n't  permanent .

I 'm wondering if this is because drywall is somewhat soft ? I also wonder about the markers leaving indentations on the drywall as well . The markers do require a little more pressure than chalk . If you attempt chalk markers on your chalkboard wall , report back and let me know your thoughts . Thanks for stopping by ! <p> Hi , Is it possible to change the writing ? I mean , how can you clear the writing without clearing the black paint off ? If is possible , it would be great just to hand write each time something new . thanks <p> Hi Eva ! You can use water to remove the chalk ink , and it shouldnt remove the chalkboard paint . The only issues Ive run into with doing this is that there is often an imprint left behind . The chalk pen requires a lot of force when using , and it can actually dent into the chalkboard paint . However , you can change out the writing without wiping off the chalkboard paint . <p> I- painted our refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and it just did n't  fit with my kitchen decor vision . - I also added a weekly calendar so we can keep all of our family activities straight . 117095 @qwx317095 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 117093 @qwx317093 <h> Meet Sara 117094 @qwx317094

@@28898814 @2598814/ <h> Painted Upholstered Chair using Chalky Finish Paint <p> I recently painted an upholstered chair I found at a consignment shop . Before the redo , the chair looked like it belonged on the set of the Huxtables circa 1988 . Now , thanks to Americana Decor Chalky Finish Paint , it has a cool vintage French ? vibe ! <p> The fabric was in good shape , but it was dingy and outdated . So , I tackled the fabric first with paint ! <p> I watered down the paint : 1 part water to 1 part paint . Then , I stirred the paint and water and started painting the fabric . I let the first coat dry and applied the second coat . Once the second coat dried ( and I painted the rest of the chair ) , I applied 2 coats of clear wax to the fabric . <p> Next , I started painting the actual chair . Its basically the same process as painting the fabric , but you do n't  water down the paint . <p> I painted 2-3 coats of paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next coat . <p> Then , I waxed the entire chair with clear wax .

As you can see in the picture above : <p> Clear wax <p> Dark wax <p> After buffing away some of the dark wax <p> I used a cheap chip brush for painting , and Americanas wax brush for waxing .

I wish I had an ugly chair <p> Hi Joanne , Its really not crunchy the fabric still gives a lot . I 've done another fabric chair with a different kind of wax ( it was much thicker than this particular brand ) , and it has a pleathery feel with a glossy shine . However , this one feels much more like outdoor fabric with a matte sheen due to a thinner , watery wax . I use this chair in my office ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so far I have n't ended up with any on my clothes . Go to some yard sales and find an ugly chair ! = <p> Hi , I 've just finished painting a chair using a satin acrylic paint , fabric medium , and water . ( Equal parts ) I was curious if you think a wax on this would help contribute to a " softer , more appealing feel . " To wax , or not to wax . <p> For this particular project , I used The American Decor clear wax . I use my chair at my computer desk so I sit on it A LOT ! I 'm not sure about pets since I do n't  have any . I assume if its okay for us humans , then its okay for them ! I just do n't  know if you would find that they 're hair sticks to the surface . It has a pleather like feel . Sorry I cant help more ! Good luck ! <p> I am in the middle of chalk painting fabric for the first time . I have a sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tested out my paint before I destroyed the big piece lol . However , when I waxed my sample piece , it looked great before it dried , but then once it was dry , I had tons of itty bitty waxy flakes on the fabric . The flakes do NOT wipe off , either ! Where did I go wrong ? <p> Hi Candy ! I 'm so sorry you 're having problems but so glad you tested the fabric first . First , did you let the paint dry before you waxed ? And , did you buff ( wipe away excess wax ) right after you waxed before the wax dried ? I have had the wax ball up , but its always right after the wax and when I 'm able to wipe/rub it in . Another question what kind of wax did you use ? Sorry for all the questions , but well figure out what 's going on ! <p> My cushion was not made of down , and ( unfortunately ) I have n't tried painting anything that had down in it . However , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't  think the paint would even have a chance to get inside to bother the down . Hope I helped ! <p> I painted a chair that I sit at a ton during the day its at my desk where I work on my computer . It has seen a lot of use and has held up well . Now , I 'm not sure if I would paint a chair where comfort is key like something youd sit in by the tv . The paint and wax give the chair a pleather-like feel . Hope I helped ! <p> Your chair fabric still looks somewhat soft even though you say it feels a little " pleathery " . I would like to replicate a chair that felt like it was painted vinyl even though I know that it was originally upholstery . Any suggestions ? <p> Hi Liz Maybe your description of painted vinyl would better describe what this treatment feels like ( rather than my " pleather " description ) . It gives , but its not soft . I think painting with watered down chalk paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're hoping to achieve ! I hope I helped ! Thanks for the comment . <p> Thank you SOOOO much for this step-by-step ! I am about to tackle my first chalk paint project and had no idea about dark wax ! When I tried looking for step-by-step instructions , everyone else MENTIONED the wax instructions , but sort of " glazed " over it . I need very precise details . Thank you ! ! Ca n't wait to try it ! <p> love your chair ! And like person above want to paint an outside chair(cushions) could I use some sort of poly instead of wax ? Because I think it will melt like a mess in the sun . Any help would be great . Mimi <p> I assume there is some sort of weather-proof coating you could put on the chair . I also have seen weather-proof fabric paint maybe that would be a better option for you ? I just do n't  know what the chalk paint would do under a different type of coating .

Can you please tell me what did you apply the clear wax with on the fabric ? A wax brush , cloth etc ? Did you apply a thin or thicker layer ? Does it matter what direction you apply the wax or does it have to be in a circular motion ? <p> Hi Maya ! I usually use a wax brush . I have a video tutorial that may be helpful : https : //youtu.be/Jkk2YKUlB2M It really does n't  matter which direct you apply the wax in , but I do recommend thinner layers . Less is more . Hope I helped ! <p> Honestly , the chalk paints are similar . Its the waxes that make the difference . I prefer the Annie Sloan wax , but the Americana wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still use it daily , and it looks great ! I would just buy whichever is more convenient for you . Good luck , Debbie ! <p> I have some woven material dining room chairs and I was just wondering if this would work , and if I would have to adjust the paint thickness . I 'm thinking the paint would soak in pretty easily , but they are textured so I 'm not sure how the wax woulld buff out either . I cant really ruin them , after being the main chairs with two rowdy boys ( they started out white ) , worst that happens is it does n't  work and I have them reupholstered . But wanted to try this first to save some money and have a little creative fun ! <p> Hi Tammi ! Ive painted some thicker woven fabric and it works , but you will still see the texture of the fabric . If they 're already ruined , its worth a shot especially if you 're up for some painting fun ! You will use a lot more paint than you expect . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the fabric wet before adding the watered down paint to see if maybe this decreasing the amount of paint the fabric soaks up . The key to painting fabric is patience , and it will take several coats of watered down paint . If you go too thick on the paint , it can crack . You also need to finish with the wax which helps soften the paint . <p> Hi , I 'm thinking of painting my sofa with chalk paint , the cushions are loose covers , and I 'd like to still be able to wash them ( messy household ! ) . Do you think you could still wash these every now and again after painting with chalk paint ? <p> That is a great question , and I really do n't  know how the chalk paint would hold up in the wash . Keep in mind that chalk painted fabric has a vinyl feel , so your couch wont be soft like it probably is now . However , the vinyl-like painted fabric would be easier to wipe down which means you may not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a couch would require A LOT of paint and patience .

We bought the house knowing about the leak ( that is a long story in itself ) , and thought it would be fixed soon after we moved in . Life happened since we moved in three years ago , and we had to fix and replace part of the roof , replace an air conditioner unit , replace a furnace , replace a house water heater and a pool water heater . It was one home project after another , and we have n't been able to use our shower since we bought the house . Our inspector warned us that the leak was so significant that unless we were okay with falling into our crawl space , we probably should n't use the shower . Obviously we did n't  go near the shower and are a little more than excited to get this bathroom remodeled ! <p> Our master bath was demoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our inspector had warned us rotted subfloor AND a rotted support beam .

However , I just softly rubbed in the drip marks while they were still wet . <p> Once you 're done ( I washed my sprayer in-between primer and paint ) , just rinse out the container and any extra paint it may have . <p> Once cleaned , fill half the container with warm water and soap ( for oil-based paint you 'll need to use a cleaning solution recommended for oil-based paint ) .

Weve lived in our home for almost two years , and its time the master bedroom received some attention . <p> Its a beautiful room architecturally , but it also poses some difficulty with decorating .

I talk about how creating has always been a passion of mine , and my creative journey has led me to my blog where I share my home decor endeavors . And , building a brand from a blog does n't  happen immediately . It takes persistence , consistency and a love for what you do . <p> I began dabbling in blogging in early 2013 .

I had come a long way from where I was at the year before . When I discovered that pins could actually be scheduled , I joined Analogy . ( More From Your Blog does a great job explaining what Analogy is .

" is how I signed off on my blog posts . <p> So , my second logo ( maybe late in 2013 ? ) was introduced : <p> It still felt too stuffy to me . I wanted it to look more handwritten . So , I hired a hand lettering artist to create something for me , and this is the logo I currently have : <p> Its been such a fun journey , and I 've learned so much in the past few years !

I have a couch that is used everyday and was thinking about painting it . Is it comfortable to sit on ? What would you advise ? Thank You , Beverly <p> I would n't suggest this technique for a couch for a couple reasons . First , a couch would go through a TON of paint . At that point , it may be just as cost effective to consider reupholstering . Also , this technique makes the fabric feel vinyl . It would n't make for a good , comfy couch-watching tv .

@@28898926 @2598926/ <h> Painted Faucet Update Over Two Years Later <p> One of my first ( and most popular ) DIY projects in our new home was our painted faucet . <p> Our home was filled with lots of brass , and I was loving oil-rubbed bronze everything at the time . Since moving into a new home comes with lots of expenses , I could not justify replacing a faucet that worked . As a girl who turns to paint to solve almost any problem , I decided to paint it . I knew the worst thing that could happen would be buying a new faucet . <p> In the early spring of 2014 , I said goodbye to the shiny brass faucet and welcomed an oil-rubbed bronze faucet . <p> Being a little bit of a germ freak meant that that painted faucet experience a lot beyond normal use . It was scrubbed with harsh cleaners and surprisingly held up fairly well . The first year I would occasionally touch up nicks with a q-tip and paint . However , I stopped the touch-ups on year two . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint missing from the drain . I knew the painted faucet was temporary ( and I had quit touch-ups long ago ) , so I decided it was time to say goodbye to the painted faucet . <p> I had no idea the amount of work replacing the faucet would require . We ( when I saw " we " I actually mean my dad ) had to remove the pedestal sink from the wall to even get back to the faucet . Removing the pedestal sink was just a chain reaction which meant removing part of my paneled wall which required the paneling to be redone and recaulked and repainted . <p> It was all worth it for my Ultra UF55113 Two-Handle Brushed Nickel Lavatory Faucet . I think it is funny that all I wanted 2.5 years ago was a brushed-nickel faucet . Then when it came time to select a replacement I went with brushed nickel . If I had waited a little longer , I may have ended up with another brass faucet . Preferences and styles change so fast ! <p> This faucet cost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , brand-new faucet is wonderful ! <p> Do I think painting the faucet was worth it ? Absolutely ! It bought me over two years of replacing a faucet ! 117092 @qwx317092 <h> Comments <p> I have some questions : 1 ) why would you have had to remove the faucet in order to use spray paint ? Seems to me that good ventilation and covering a little extra area for overspray would have been enough . Was there any other reason ? 2 ) do you think using primer would have made a difference with the chipping and wear over those two years ? <p> Hi Elizabeth ! My bathroom did n't  have the best ventilation , and the last time I attempted spray painting something inside I had overspray everywhere . However , I know people spray paint inside and have success ( with proper prep/covering ) . I do n't  think primer would help because I did use a primer on some additional faucets and they also chipped . I do wonder if sanding would have helped . I hope this helps good luck ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expected it to last past two or three uses , let alone a few years . I really expected the drain to flake immediately , but the faucet itself held up pretty well . In the end , you could just replace the drain piece , with an oil rubbed bronze one and you might have gotten a few more years from your painted faucet . I give you kudos for trying this , as I do n't  know if I would have done it , but when you are on a budget an inexpensive can of paint sure beats buying a bunch of new faucets for your home . It just goes to show , if you try something and it works , great . If not , at least you gave it a shot . I had an old fiberglass spa once that was a horrible baby blue and lost all its shine . I painted it with tan colored epoxy paint and it lasted 10 more years . Paint is a wonderful thing !

We decided to forgo our normal Christmas gifts for each other and put the money we would have spent on each other towards this home build and trip . <p> The day after Christmas , all 15 of us ( which included 7 kids ) traveled to San Pedro in The Dominican Republic . The next day , we were picked up from our hotel and taken to the neighborhood where we were building the house . <p> The neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to drop us off , and we had to walk much of the way ) .

In the photo above , you can see the entrance to their home . The green door opened to a small room with beds covered in mosquito nets . The space was SO small I had trouble taking a photo : <p> Thanks so YWAM , our home build was well organized . When we arrived to the site on the first day , a concrete slab had been poured and all the supplies were waiting for us . <p> I attempted to stand in the same spot and take a photo as the house went up .

@@28898935 @2598935/ <h> painting a piano <p> I painted a piano this week . <p> Weve been talking about getting a piano for a little while since our oldest son is going to start lessons this fall . <p> While on Facebook a couple weeks ago , I ran across someone selling an upright for $50 . I was excited because it obviously needed help . My husband would definitely be okay with me painting it , and it was so inexpensive that I could n't mess it up . Plus , how cool would a painted piano be ? ! <p> Now , I decided to use milk paint for the first time ever . Note to self : Do n't  try a paint you 've never used next time you paint a piano . <p> What I did n't  think about was how unpredictable it can be .

I 'm not saying this is a good thing , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this started to happen : <p> The charm of milk paint is that it does have a tendency to chip . However , to avoid this , you can mix a bonding agent in with the first paint layer . I did but I ran out of paint for the first batch and got a little lazy with my second batch and did n't  add the bonding agent . The areas I painted without the bonding agent ( obviously ) is where the major chipping occurred . <p> Another thing about milk paint is that it comes in powder form . I did n't  love having to mix my own paint . I 'm a pretty impatient person , and mixing just added another layer in the process of painting . Its not a huge deal to mix , but there 's something great about just popping a can of paint open <p> All that being said , milk paint does have its charm . If you like the ( very ) distressed look , this paint is for you . It comes in a bunch of BEAUTIFUL colors and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint for color washing pieces you can easily water the paint down to achieve the washed look . <p> So , after I painted the piano , I used ( cream ) chalk paint to accent some of the parts and I also used the chalk paint on the areas that I had n't  used the bonding agent in my first layer of paint . I was n't loving the extreme chipping happening in these areas and luckily my cream " accents " look intentional . <p> After everything was painted , I took a sander to the entire piano . All the tutorials I watch show the people sanding by hand . Again , I do n't  have patience for this . So , I used this big guy : <p> At the end , I did wax the entire piece with both clear wax and a small amount of the dark wax .

@@28898944 @2598944/ <h> DIY faux Wallpaper a painted wall treatment <p> As I said in my dining room reveal , I wanted the look of wallpaper without the cost or commitment . So , here is my solution . AND , I promise you can recreate the look ! It does n't  have to be floral there are so many options ! <p> First , you need to decide what pattern/design you want . I used vinyl decals to create the look . However , I painted over the decal and removed it so appears to be hand painted . I found my vinyl decals on Etsy . Unfortunately the store ( VinylLettering ) I bought the decals from no longer sells this pattern . It came with birds , but I just used the flowers and leaves : <p> All the pieces were separate , so I was able to place the flowers and leaves wherever I wanted on the wall . There 's no rhyme or reason to my pattern I just tried to make sure it was visually balanced . Also , when you order the decal , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> here 's how my wall looked before I started : <p> I went ahead and used the existing cream color as my base . <p> The vinyl decal make for a pretty colorful wall ( kind of a country granny look , is n't it ? ! ) <p> The store you buy the vinyl decals from will give you directions for how to apply them . Once you get the hang of it , the process goes pretty quickly . <p> No , on to the fun part ! Its time to PAINT ! Just paint the wall like the decals are n't  there . Trim out the wall and roll the rest . <p> Once the wall is dry , you can start removing the decals . I used my fingernail to get the sticker started and just pulled . It was fun to watch the wall unfold <p> I did have some bleeding occur around the edges of my decals , and its not the perfect line I had envisioned . However , as a whole , you really do n't  notice the small imperfections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own faux wallpaper ! It is MUCH easier than you think ! <p> ***UPDATED 2/24/14 As fun as this wall was , I grew a little tired of its boldness . So , I white washed it well , actually I grey washed it . I took some paint , watered it down and brushed over the entire wall . I then used a rag to clean up and remove any extra . here 's the toned down wall : 117095 @qwx317095 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 117093 @qwx317093 <h> Meet Sara 117094 @qwx317094

Also when using Annie Sloan chalk paint I know finishing with the wax is what helps the color darkensand develop . Would using that matte sealer do the same ? <p> Hi Kristina , I do think chalk paint would adhere better than a latex paint . However , it does sound like you have a very slick surface . I would probably suggest sanding or at least using a strong cleaner to eat away some of that finish . The matte sealer also darkens the color , but it gives it a more gloss look than the wax .
