 items from truckload of burned mail <p> Postal Service officials reported Thursday that a truckload of mail was destroyed in a truck fire along Interstate 35 near Ankeny on Tuesday . They 've been working to recover as much mail as they can from the burned tractor-trailer . <p> Ames Postmaster Todd Oxley said they have a lot of wet and charred mail to go through , but they 're trying hard to salvage what they can . <p> Dozens of people drove past the semi-truck on fire Tuesday not realizing their mail might have been on board . <p> " Now , they 're starting to realize , ' Hey that may have been mine . ' So I 'm sure the phone will be ringing pretty constantly today , tomorrow people concerned about their items , " said Oxley .

One of them is Nevada Van Wall HR Manager Kathy Johnson . <p> " We had to think through what we had sent and fortunately that day we had n't mailed that much invoices and things to customers .

 cons of officer body cameras <p> The Obama administration now wants more police officers to wear body cameras . Though many communities and police departments across the country agree , there is one major roadblock preventing their widespread use : the cost . <p> In the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson , Missouri , the tension is high between communities and law enforcement . It 's not hard to find supporters of more transparency , in the form of a small camera that 's worn by police . <p> " I think maybe it would be a little reassuring . Just for the fact that we 've had so many things happen with police officers lately , " said Sarah Pohlman , of Des Moines . <p> Des Moines resident Tyrone Weston agrees . <p> " I think it would just cut down a lot of the police shootings and maybe justify , on camera , why it 's being done , " Weston said . <p> Many officers want the cameras to not only help prevent false claims against officers and help discourage excessive force , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's easier for me to just talk , to have that on , and I can have it on rather than write notes or anything like that , " said Sgt. Jason Halifax , of the Des Moines Police Department . <p> In Central Iowa , some law enforcement officials already have these body cams , but not many of them . For example , Des Moines only has them for its school resource officers and the Polk County Sheriff 's Office keeps them for its jail staff . <p> " If it were n't for the actual cost of the camera , we would have our officers outfitted right now , " Halifax said . <p> Just one body camera initially cost between and , which adds up to hundreds of thousands for many departments . Then , there 's maintenance . <p> If Congress approves the president 's request for federal funding , that will solve the cost issue for many departments . However , policies still need to be designed to avoid creating problems with the cameras . <p> " You call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera because I 'm on an official call for service . And now that video gets requested through the open-records process , and that video gets dumped out . Now it 's someone showing you in your house with all of your valuables , " Halifax said . <p> Overall , Halifax said the good of these cameras will likely outweigh the bad for both the police and the public . <p> Obama has dedicated million to increase the use of body cameras , including 75 million over three years to help departments purchase them .

 Folds of Honor Quik Trip 500 <p> HAMPTON , Ga . Jimmie Johnson won the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday for his second straight win at the track and his 76th career victory , tying him with Dale Earnhardt for seventh on the all-time wins list . <p> " It 's such an honor , " Johnson said of tying Earnhardt 's record . " With the chaos at the end and the crash and wondering about overtime and how it worked these days , I kind of lost sight of that . I remembered it on my victory lap coming down , and I had to come by and throw a ' three ' out the window to pay my respects to ' the man . ' There 's a huge void in my career that I never had the chance to race with him , but at least I was able to tie his record .

Kyle Busch finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded out the top five . <p> " I loved it , " Earnhardt said . " We were sliding around and driving the hell out of the car . I had a blast . I had some good races there on the track with the No. 2 ( Brad Keselowski ) and the No. 18 ( Busch ) and a bunch of guys . Man , it was so much fun . " <p> Kevin Harvick dominated throughout the second half of the race until Johnson utilized a pit strategy of pitting early during the final cycle of green-flag pit stops to gain time on newer tires . Johnson made his final stop with 49 laps remaining , nine laps before Harvick . <p> " Definitely a gutsy call , " Johnson said . " It was just a great team effort . The No. 4 ( Harvick 's ) car was awfully tough , and it was going to take some strategy to get by him . When he told me to whip it as hard as I could , there , I just felt like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it worked . And I got rolling around the top and got to where I got this Lowe 's Chevy in victory lane . I 'm so happy for Hendrick Motorsports and for everybody at Chevrolet . " <p> Johnson had a lead of more than 14 seconds over Harvick by the time the cycle completed . Harvick was able to cut his deficit to between six and seven seconds before a late-race caution for Ryan Newman 's blown engine bunched up the field . <p> After taking tires , Johnson got off pit road first to maintain his lead and drive on to the win . Harvick restarted next to him on the front row , but dropped back to sixth by the finish . <p> " We had issues about the last three runs , " Harvick said . " I had to start driving the car different . It just required a little bit different handling . And then we had a slow pit stop there . We got way behind and the No. 48 ( Johnson ) was way out front , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-rear burned up . We just did n't execute today , but everybody on our Jimmy Chevrolet hung in there all day we 'll keep at it . " <p> Harvick took the lead on lap 136 . Prior to Johnson 's race-winning pit strategy , most of the laps not led by Harvick in the second half were laps during green-flag cycles of stops . Martin Truex Jr . was the only driver able to pass Harvick on the race track , doing so twice , each time leading for about a lap . <p> After pole sitter Kurt Busch showed the way early in the race , Matt Kenseth took the lead on lap 64 . Kenseth lost the lead to both Johnson and Harvick , but was the primary leader before a pit road miscue during a cycle of green flag pit stops on lap 121 . <p> Kenseth 's No. 20 of Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota team was assessed a penalty for improper fueling because the gas man laid a wrench on the deck lid of the car while the gas can was engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalty , his crew , preoccupied with arguing its case to a NASCAR official , failed to tell Kenseth to pit before NASCAR stopped scoring him .

 was found guilty of genocide and other crimes against humanity , in what was seen as one of the most important war crimes trials since World War II . <p> A special U.N . court in The Hague , Netherlands , sentenced the 70-year-old to 40 years in prison for his participation in four " joint criminal enterprises , " including an overarching plot from October 1991 to November 1995 " to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from Bosnian territory . " <p> He was found guilty of 10 of the 11 charges against him , including extermination , persecution , forcible transfer , terror , hostage taking and genocide . <p> The latter charge related to his role in the Srebrenica massacre , in which more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces under his command . <p> As the leader of the breakaway Serb Republic in Bosnia , Karadzic commanded troops who carried out widespread massacres of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia . <p> The verdicts which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 2008 , when he was arrested after 12 years as a fugitive . <p> Rise to power <p> Karadzic was born on June 19 , 1945 , in Petnjica , Montenegro .

" During the next three years , he ordered Bosnian Serb forces to seize the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina . <p> He also announced , according to his U.N . indictment , six " strategic objectives " for the Serbian people . They included the establishment of state borders between the Serbs and the other two ethnic communities , Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats . <p> Answering to him , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mladic . <p> From May 1992 , the indictment said , Bosnian Serb forces under Mladic 's command targeted civilian areas of Sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city . <p> In July 1995 , according to the U.N . indictment , troops under Mladic 's command executed an estimated 8,000 Bosnian Muslim male prisoners in Srebrenica , a U.N . safe area , and then participated in a comprehensive effort to conceal the killings . The massacre is considered the worst in Europe since World War II . <p> The indictment states that Bosnian Serb forces acted under Karadzic 's direction and worked to " significantly reduce the Bosnian Muslim , Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations " in municipalities that were seized . <p> Years in hiding <p> Karadzic disappeared from the public eye in September 1996 , a year after the Dayton Peace Accords brought a formal end to the conflict and banned anyone accused of war crimes , including him , from office . <p> He reportedly shaved his trademark bushy hair , grew a beard and donned priest 's robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid capture . <p> CNN correspondent Alessio Vinci said in 2008 : " He enjoyed protection from the local population , wherever he was hiding .

He had served time in jail with Salah Abdeslam , who would join him in attacking Paris . <p> On Jan. 20 , 2014 , Abaaoud flew from Cologne , Germany , to Istanbul , accompanied by his 13-year-old brother and another would-be jihadist , Yoni Patrick Mayne , also from Molenbeek . <p> Days earlier , according to intelligence documents obtained by CNN , Abaaoud had received a call from a Turkish mobile number . <p> The call was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jihad in Syria in 2012 . Radicalized in jail in France , Nemmouche had become a guard and torturer of foreign hostages in Syria , according to one of the few to survive , French journalist Nicolas Henin . <p> What was said is unknown , but the call confirmed a link between the two . Weeks later , Nemmouche would head back to Europe . He used an elaborate route to disguise his travel from Syria , via Malaysia , Singapore and Hong Kong , before arriving in Frankfurt on March 18 , 2014 . <p> German authorities notified the French but , perhaps already sensing Europe 's weak security coordination , Nemmouche went to Belgium . And on May 24 , he allegedly staged a gun attack on a Jewish museum in Brussels that killed four people . When he was arrested in the French port of Marseille a week later , Nemmouche was in possession of a Kalashnikov rifle and a flag with ISIS rubric . He is still awaiting trial . <p> Nemmouche was the first among French and Belgian ISIS fighters some encouraged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the beginning , it was a trickle but gradually it became a stream . <p> ISIS began developing encryption techniques and producing high-quality fake documents for its Europe-bound fighters . Flights were eschewed for sea and land routes that would exploit the migrant flows already stretching European frontier agencies in the summer of 2014 . <p> The exact equation between " freelancers " or " lone wolves " inspired by ISIS and those trained and directed by the group remains elusive . Unlike the more hierarchical al Qaeda , ISIS gives its operatives much more autonomy . <p> But by the autumn of 2014 , Abaaoud 's determination to export terror likely endorsed by other French jihadists such as Fabien Clain and Salim Benghalem appears to have found an audience among the ISIS leadership . The change in sentiment was probably because of the beginning of coalition airstrikes against ISIS first to defend the Yazidi population in Iraq in August and then to support Syrian Kurds fighting ISIS in Kobani the following month . <p> It was then that ISIS spokesman and leading ideologue Abu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " O Americans , O Europeans , the Islamic State did not initiate a war against you , " Adnani said . " It is you who started the transgression against us , and thus you deserve blame and you will pay a great price . " <p> Adnani made this threat to Europeans . " You will pay the price as you walk on your streets , turning right and left , fearing the Muslims . You will not feel secure even in your bedrooms . We will strike you in your homeland , and you will never be able to harm anyone afterwards . " <p> By then , according to European counterterrorism officials , some 300 European jihadists were already back from Syria . And security services were struggling to keep up with the inflow . <p> One official acknowledged to CNN , even before airstrikes began , that " the threat of attacks has never been greater not at the time of 9/11 , not after the war in Iraq never . " <p> He and others envisaged a flood of small-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry is that Europeans in the group may out of their own initiative return home to launch attacks . The question becomes to what extent will the ISIS leadership try to control this ? " <p> The answer would be : to a great extent . As airstrikes intensified , taking out key leaders of ISIS and eroding its control of territory , so did the group 's desire for revenge . What was different was the ambition : no longer opportunistic and individual but complex and directed . <p> Despite an international arrest warrant for terrorism , Abaaoud left Syria at the end of 2014 and sneaked into Greece , moving between apartments in Athens . From there he began to plan attacks in Europe . He later boasted in the ISIS online magazine that he had traveled as far as Belgium with two men who were later killed in a shoot-out with Belgian police . <p> " We spent months trying to find a way into Europe , " he told Dabiq ... " We succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium . We were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we planned to carry out operations against the crusaders . " <p> The Belgian security services had monitored calls from Greece to relatives of men planning the attacks in Belgium , before surrounding their safe-house in the town of Verviers on Jan. 15 . <p> Two days later , as European intelligence agencies scrambled to find Abaaoud , Greek police raided two apartments in central Athens . They found Abaaoud 's fingerprints but no trace of the man himself . They did , however , according to sources cited by Le Parisien newspaper , discover a computer which contained bomb-making instructions and attacks plans . <p> Intelligence sources say Abaaoud slipped back into Syria to step up the training of foreign fighters for attacks in Europe . There was no shortage of French and Belgian fighters in and around Raqqa who had the language , contacts and local knowledge to survive in Europe . <p> Many ISIS members who had gone to Syria had criminal records ; they were street-smart and had long-established underworld contacts in Europe . They knew how to take advantage of borderless Europe even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other factors working in favor of Abaaoud 's plans : the Turkish border was relatively open . ISIS had secured a large supply of blank Syrian passports . It also had plenty of cash . <p> Another Abaaoud associate was a 29-year-old Frenchman , Reda Hame . According to a French investigation document obtained by CNN , Abaaoud provided him with training in Raqqa and pushed him to return to France " to open fire at a concert or in a crowded place where he could take hostages and then stage a suicide attack when police arrived . " <p> Hame traveled via Prague in June 2015 but was arrested soon after he reached France and began cooperating . He provided information on the weapons training he 'd received and the encryption software he 'd been given to communicate . <p> According to a transcript of his interrogation obtained by Le Monde , Hame said ISIS was now focused on exporting terror to Europe . <p> " All I can tell you is that this will happen very soon . It was a real factory over there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> By then , European intelligence services were beginning to fear exactly that . But they had inadequate specific , actionable intelligence . There was no cascade of orders to intercept , no obvious money trail . And despite many promises , improving Europe-wide intelligence coordination was lagging . <p> While Hame was being questioned in early August , the cell that would attack Paris three months later and its support structure was already being infiltrated into Europe . On Aug. 4 , Salah Abdeslam left a Greek port for Italy in the company of Ahmed Dahmani , who would later be detained in Turkey after leaving Amsterdam the day after the Paris attacks . <p> How many others may have slipped in by land and sea from Syria ? <p> Most of the Paris attackers for sure , and at least one of the Belgian bombers , as well as an associate of Abdeslam arrested with him in Molenbeek two weeks ago . <p> Another of those travelers may have been the young man who left Cologne with Abaaoud back in January 2014 . Last year , ISIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Mayne in Syria . <p> His mother insists he was killed . The Belgian newspaper Heure reports that investigators apparently have other pictures of his body than those shared on social media , which were identified by Mayne 's family . And yet a European security bulletin issued after the Brussels attacks and obtained by CNN listed Mayne as one of eight men still wanted in connection with the Paris and Brussels attacks . As the saying goes , perhaps he 's not dead yet . <p> And there may be dozens of other ISIS operatives across Europe planning further episodes in regularly monitor these comments . <p> According to a

 Lord was the original segregationist , " proclaimed Ross Barnett , Mississippi 's governor , in the early 1960s . " He made the white man white and the black man black , and he did not intend for them to mix . ' ' <p> For much of the past century , that 's the way it was in Mississippi , whose history is stained by civil rights-era prejudice and violence . From the lynching of Emmett Till to riots over desegregation at Ole Miss , it 's a legacy that modern-day Mississippi wants to leave behind . <p> But now , decades later , comes a controversial new law passed in the name of religion that critics decry as state-sanctioned bigotry against gays , lesbians and transgender residents . And some here are wondering whether Mississippi 's shameful past is once again rearing its ugly head . <p> " Discriminating because ( someone is ) gay , that 's still discrimination , just like when we ( were ) coming up as black ( and ) they would discriminate against our color , " said Juanita Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 children on a cotton farm southeast of Jackson . Moore has little use for the state 's " Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act , " perhaps the most far-reaching of the so-called " religious freedom " bills sweeping through the South . <p> " It 's the new Jim Crow , " she said . <p> Moore was born just as Jim Crow , the collective name for the state , local and regional laws that segregated and subjugated African Americans in Mississippi and other parts of the South until the 1960s , was being forcibly dismantled by the federal government . But she believes " we got a lot of people in Mississippi still stuck in those days . " <p> No less an authority than U.S. Congressman John Lewis , a towering icon of the civil rights movement , agrees . <p> " The hateful new law in Mississippi is plain wrong , " he said earlier this month on Twitter . " Mississippi has a long dark past , and once again it is on the wrong side of history . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , which goes into effect July 1 , will shield private businesses and some public-sector employees from legal action and discipline if they refuse a customer on the grounds that doing so would violate a " sincerely held religious belief . " For example , the law would protect a bakery owner who declines on religious grounds to make a cake for a same-sex wedding . <p> In fact , Bryant said the law is meant to prevent discrimination against people like him , Christians with deeply held religious beliefs about marriage and sex . <p> " All we 're trying to do is say that people of faith have some protection from an overbearing government , " he added . " People of faith have some rights as well in this country . " <p> In this , Mississippi is hardly unique . <p> In addition to high-profile battles playing out over religious-freedom laws in Tennessee and North Carolina , there have been some 100 bills proposed in legislatures across the United States in 2016 that invoke religion as justification to refuse services to gay people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But Mississippi 's legislation is exceptionally far-reaching . It will allow " the right to discriminate against a broad range of Mississippians in a variety of contexts including housing , employment , public services , education and adoption , " said a memo signed by 19 law professors from Mississippi and beyond . " Those who will be most harmed by this law are LGBT Mississippians , intersex persons , persons who defy sex and gender stereotypes . " <p> Critics also see echoes of past prejudices , both in the state and elsewhere . <p> " Governor Bryant turned back the clock to a dark time in Mississippi 's past , " said Wade Henderson , president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , a national advocacy group . <p> " Religious liberty is meant to be a sacred shield to protect people from discrimination , not a sword to deny civil rights and equality to others . These are the same arguments used to oppose women 's suffrage , interracial marriage , the acceptance of Asian immigrants , the Americans with Disabilities Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone I know is ashamed ' <p> In the days after its passage , CNN spoke with dozens of Mississippians of different ages , genders , races , sexual identities and religious beliefs about the new law . Some supported it , some opposed it and some were ambivalent . But one thing tied almost all of them together : a wounded sense of pride about the place they call home . <p> John Haynes , a Tupelo native whose family history in Mississippi dates back to the 1700s , is worried the new law strikes dangerously close to wounds from the 1950s and 1960s that have not yet fully healed . <p> " It harkens back to that era , " Haynes , 39 , said . " To those sins of 50 years ago that we 'd long since put behind us .

" <p> " I am so upset and disappointed ( because ) we have done so much work over the past few decades to rehabilitate our image , " he told CNN . " Everyone I know is ashamed . " <p> " I feel like it 's taking us back years , " agreed Jeromie Jones , 30 , who owns a bakery in Pearl , a suburb of Jackson . " At one time , I felt like we were progressing and getting somewhere , but now all that is being overshadowed by another law that puts ( Mississippi ) at the bottom of the totem pole . " <p> Jones , who married his husband , George , in December , is so concerned over the law 's potential effects that he is seriously considering leaving the state . <p> " I always wanted to stay here , because this was home , " he told CNN . " Every time someone gets big from this area , they move away ( ... ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from , but I did n't want to be that person , " he said .

The 28-year-old bartender is straight and married and has no plans to switch genders . <p> But , like Jones , he is fuming . <p> " When outsiders who 've never been to Mississippi look in and see these headlines , they do n't see the good part about Mississippi , they only see the bad , " he said . " And the people that are from here are sick of being the ass-end of every joke . " <p> Even among those who supported the spirit of the law , there is a sense of regret . <p> " This is what I share in common with the framers of the bill , " said Robert Green , a senior pastor at Fondren Church in Jackson . " We are concerned about religious freedom because if we 're told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of wedding or that kind of wedding , that 's not America anymore .

 a last resort of a desperate economy , " says Kathy Jones , chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab . " I would n't rule it out . " <p> Ahead of the Federal Reserve 's meeting that started Tuesday , an old metaphor helicopter money is gaining new traction as world leaders try to improve global economic growth , which the IMF recently described as " fragile . " <p> Famed economist Milton Friedman first introduced the idea of helicopter money in 1969 . Essentially , as former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke recently put it , the Fed would write a huge check to the U.S. Treasury office , which would then send tax rebates ( read : cash ) to millions of Americans . <p> The thinking and hope behind such an action is that Americans would then spend the money . Consumer spending makes up the majority of U.S. economic activity so more spending would boost the country 's growth prospects , which are currently very dim . First quarter economic growth figures come out Thursday and growth is projected to be below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start a helicopter money program or even a rate hike when its meeting ends Wednesday . But mere talk of helicopter money illustrates how desperate central bankers are to spark growth . <p> Japan and the European Central Bank are using negative interest rates to stimulate spending . The ECB is also in a bond buying spree . Last year China 's central bank spent billions to ease the country 's economic slowdown . <p> Experts across the spectrum say Japan , which has struggled with deflation , is the most likely to consider using helicopter money . But so far its central bank chief has denied any interest in the idea . <p> Reporters asked ECB President Mario Draghi last week about helicopter money . He says the ECB has no such plans and that it has n't been discussed . He argues that helicopter money is fraught with challenges . <p> " It 's a very interesting concept , " Draghi noted . However : " The concept is fraught with operational , legal and institutional difficulties . But the bottom line is we have never discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter money is Bernanke . In fact , in a 2002 speech he referenced Milton Friedman 's famous lines , thinking everyone would know what he was talking about . But no one really did , and Bernanke was dubbed at the time as " helicopter Ben . " <p> In an April blog post , Bernanke says helicopter money is " extremely likely to be effective " if it 's ever used , albeit as a last resort . <p> He argues helicopter money from a central bank would be better than Congress increasing spending or creating a tax cut both of those options risk driving up the national debt or making it more expensive to pay off debt down the road . <p> But if the Fed paid for a tax rebate , America 's debt burden would n't go up , Bernanke argues . Helicopter money could be used in other ways too , such as financing a major infrastructure program , creating jobs , more incomes and higher spending . <p> Helicopter money still faces key roadblocks . Who decides how much money and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk that such a program could muddle the independence central banks are supposed to have from lawmakers and politics . <p> No matter whether it is ever considered , bottom line is that even talk of helicopter money is just a sign of the times that central banks may consider anything to reboot the the global economy . <p> " Helicopter money could prove a valuable tool , " Bernanke wrote . " Under extreme circumstances ... such programs may be the best available alternative . It would be regularly monitor these comments . <p> " It 's 
 of terror after bin Laden raid <p> On the fifth anniversary of Osama bin Laden 's death , President Barack Obama sharply defended his targeted approached to fighting terror and said the next president would most likely follow his lead rather than his predecessor 's . <p> " The kinds of Special Forces and intelligence-gathering that we saw in the bin Laden raid is going to be , more often than not , the tool of choice for a president in dealing with that kind of threat , " he said . <p> " The ideology has not been extinguished , " Obama acknowledged in an exclusive interview with CNN 's Peter Bergen on Monday night . " The world is still dangerous . In many ways , the Middle East is in a more chaotic situation . " <p> But -- without directly referring to President George W. Bush 's decisions to send U.S. troops into Afghanistan and then Iraq Obama said such large-scale operations , which continue to reverberate in the current presidential race , would only make the fight against extremism harder . <p> Obama said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where an organization like this appears going be counterproductive and , in some ways , feeds the kinds of ideology that we 're fighting . " <p> Obama offered the assessment as part of three hours of conversations Bergen had with the President and his top circle about details of the raid that killed bin Laden for the Anderson Cooper 360 special " ' We Got Him , ' Obama , Bin Laden and the War on Terror . " <p> While Obama spoke with confidence of the decision to launch the raid despite the odds being " probably 50/50 " that that the U.S. was correct that the target in the Abbottabad , Pakistan , compound it was tracking was bin Laden , he did speak about the difficulty in making wrenching decisions , especially with the expanded use of drones during his presidency . <p> Unmanned aircraft have become an invaluable tool in areas tough to reach with U.S. soldiers , Obama said . Within the first two years of his presidency , though , Obama said he felt the legal architecture and control systems in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became so easy to use them without thinking through all the ramifications , " he said . " What we 've tried to do is make sure that we are accountable at the highest levels for how we 're using Predators . " <p> The standard is of " near certainty " that the target is an active terrorist threat and that civilian casualties are being avoided , the President said . <p> " Having said that , you always lose sleep because you know there 's always the possibility in a kinetic action that somebody who should n't be killed is killed , " he said . <p> And he spoke of the risks of the bin Laden operation in the shadow of U.S. history . <p> Reminded that former President Jimmy Carter had lost a chance at a second term because he 'd taken a similar risk in trying to free U.S. hostages from revolutionary Iran and failed -- Obama responded , " if I had n't thought of it on my own , it was raised by a number of my advisors . " <p> Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , even when it started with a downed helicopter . <p> " My initial concern there was extraction . That if something happened to the helicopter that we could make sure that we got our guys out , " he said , pointing to the backup helicopters that had been prepared as part of their " plan B. " <p> " Nevertheless , it gave you a little jolt , " Obama said . " I think it reminded you that no matter how well you plan , there 's always going to be something that comes up . " <p> Obama said U.S. Special Forces had developed a deep capacity during years in Iraq and Afghanistan that meant this was n't completely foreign terrain for them . <p> " It was uniquely complicated because the stakes were so high , " Obama said , " and we were operating inside of Pakistan . But these guys had been through a lot of harrowing moments . " <p> " One thing about having been through a lot of this previously , and everybody sitting around this table had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the President said . " It 's interesting the degree to which nobody cheered or nobody high fived , because we could n't be sure at that point . " <p> Obama said it was n't until the helicopters had landed in Afghanistan with bin Laden 's body " that all of us breathed ... a sigh of relief . " <p> Obama and his team said that now , any future terror-fighting formula will have to include working with allies to address the political resentment and economic frustration that give extremist groups such fertile ground . <p> The case of Pakistan has proved particularly thorny . There has continued to be speculation that the government was aware of bin Laden 's presence in Abbottabad . <p> Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN that she believes that senior Pakistanis knew bin Laden was there . <p> Clinton said it was " just too much of a coincidence ... that that house , that unusual-looking house would be built in that community near the military academy , surrounded by retired military professionals , " even though " we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any evidence that we could uncover that led directly to the top of the Pakistani military and intelligence service , " Clinton said . " I believe Pakistanis knew . <p> Clinton , the Democratic presidential front-runner , will have to evaluate what 's needed to continue the fight against al Qaeda should she take the White House . But Obama 's aides stressed that the next commander in chief will for sure need a blend of the fine-grained intelligence work and surgical force that defined the lethal 2011 strike against al Qaeda 's mastermind . <p> In the years since the raid on bin Laden 's Abbottabad compound , the U.S. has worked systematically to degrade core al Qaeda and go after its leadership , Obama said . Meanwhile , the ability of organizations like ISIS or al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to carry out a catastrophic attack is much lower , he said . <p> But Obama and his advisors acknowledged that the fight against terrorism did n't end with bin Laden 's death . If anything , they said that despite their efforts , that battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of groups and extending their reach . <p> The President praised the " incredible structure of cooperation " between intelligence , military and law enforcement " that has hardened the homeland , " but he did n't directly mention the controversy surrounding measures such as National Security Agency surveillance and the use of drones , though both are central to Obama 's terror-fighting approach . <p> John Brennan , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , said that " if counter-terrorism is going to be effective and you 're going to take offensive action , you need to have the care and the precision of a surgeon 's scalpel . " <p> Obama said the scalpel has only gotten sharper and more precise since he took office . He said that U.S. intelligence gathering as well as the accuracy and lethality of Predator drone strikes have " increased significantly " in the past eight years . <p> The next president , whether Republican or Democrat , will have to think strategically about the battle against terrorism , Obama said , a long-term undertaking that does n't involve just force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current presidential race directly , Obama and his officials offered an indirect criticism of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump 's proposal that American Muslims be denied entry to the U.S. if they leave the country . <p> " We have to make sure that we 're not engaging in the kind of knee-jerk anti-Muslim sentiment that we 've heard from some politicians , " Obama said . American Muslims ' success and integration has insulated the U.S. from some of the terrorism Europe is seeing , he added . Broadly speaking , the U.S. should " not react in ways that make the problem worse rather than better , " Obama said . <p> The current occupant of the Oval Office dismissed the possibility of Trump taking over from him , saying , " I do n't expect that to happen .

 abortions were a booming business . They were advertised in newspapers and could be bought from pharmacists , from physicians and even through the mail . If drugs did n't work , women could visit practitioners for instrumental procedures . <p> The earliest efforts to govern abortions centered on concerns about poisoning , not morality , religion or politics . It was the mid-19th century , long before abortion became the hot-button issue it is now . <p> All of this is according to historian Leslie Reagan , whose 1996 book on abortion history in the United States is considered one of the most comprehensive to date . <p> Today , as we await a U.S. Supreme Court decision in what 's been called the biggest abortion case to hit the high court in two decades , many states still clamor to ramp up restrictions . <p> Since 1973 , when Roe v. Wade legalized abortion across the United States , states have enacted more than 1,074 laws to limit access to the procedure , according to the Guttmacher Institute , a sexual and reproductive rights organization . More than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was n't always like this , says Reagan , a professor of history , medicine , gender , women 's studies and law at the University of Illinois . <p> So how did we get here ? <p> With the help of Reagan , author of " When Abortion Was a Crime , " and the nonprofit Our Bodies Ourselves , we set out to learn what abortion was like in America before 1973 . <p> What we found was full of surprises . <p> The view from centuries ago <p> In the 18th century and until about 1880 , abortions were allowed under common law and widely practiced . They were illegal only after " quickening , " the highly subjective term used to describe when pregnant women could feel the fetus moving , Reagan said . <p> " At conception and the earliest stage of pregnancy , before quickening , no one believed that a human life existed ; not even the Catholic Church took this view , " Reagan wrote . " Rather , the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abortions would become criminalized by 1880 , except when necessary to save a woman 's life , not at the urging of social or religious conservatives but under pressure from the medical establishment and the very organization that today speaks out in support of abortion access , Reagan explained . <p> When it comes to modern cases to restrict abortions , the American Medical Association is quick to file amicus briefs to oppose any laws that would impede the freedom of physicians to provide care using their best medical judgment . <p> Back when it was still a fledgling organization , however , it began a crusade in 1857 to make abortion illegal , Reagan wrote . The impetus was manifold . Some of it came " out of regular physicians ' desire to win professional power , control medical practice , and restrict their competitors , " namely midwives and homeopaths . <p> But this was also a time , Reagan said , in which women were lobbying for entrance into Harvard Medical School , in part so they could pursue work in obstetrics and gynecology . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatio Storer , a Harvard Medical School graduate who dedicated much of his practice to OB-GYN work before he died in 1922 . <p> The crusade proved to be a form of backlash against the shifting aspirations of women . It was " antifeminist at its core , " Reagan wrote . <p> The AMA pushed for state laws to restrict abortions , and most did by 1880 . Then the Comstock Law , passed by Congress in 1873 , banned items including abortion drugs . <p> But before abortions were banned , a woman known as Madame Restell ran abortion businesses from New York to Philadelphia and Boston . Her main clientele , Reagan wrote , were " married , white , native-born Protestant women of upper and middle classes . " <p> Abortions , birth control and general efforts to manage the timing of pregnancy meant birth rates among white women were falling just as immigrants streamed into the United States . And the idea of being out-populated by " others " worried some anti-abortion activists like Storer . He argued that whites should be populating the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than blacks , Catholics , Mexicans , Chinese or Indians , he said , according to Reagan . <p> " Shall these regions be filled by our own children or by those of aliens ? This is a question our women must answer ; upon their loins depends the future destiny of the nation , " Storer said , according to Reagan 's research . <p> Even after abortions became illegal , women continued to have them ; they just were n't advertised the same way . Practitioners did their work behind closed doors or in private homes . Or women without means resorted to desperate and often dangerous or deadly -- measures . <p> At times , abortion rates increased in the face of the law . The Depression was a perfect example . <p> Specialists passed out business cards and opened up clinics , Reagan explained , and nobody bothered them . In that era , abortion was n't seen as a women 's issue , it was an economic issue . <p> In the 1950s and 1960s , the estimated number of illegal abortions ranged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guttmacher Institute . <p> Inspired by the civil rights and anti-war movements , the women 's liberation movement gained steam in the 1960s and reproductive rights took center stage . <p> Women with means had been able to get abortions by leaving the country or paying a physician in the U.S. a large fee for the procedure . Others were n't so lucky . They sought out back-alley procedures or took matters in their own hands : inserting knitting needles and coat hangers into their vaginas , drinking chemicals or douching with lye . These methods resulted in medical emergencies and , in some cases , death . <p> Some groups sprouted to help prevent such outcomes . <p> In the late 1960s , before abortion was legalized again in the United States , concerned pastors and rabbis set up the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion to help women find safe illegal abortions . <p> An underground abortion service also was established by feminists in Chicago . The Abortion Counseling Service of the Chicago Women 's Liberation Union , better known by the code name Jane , helped provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just through referrals . But then trained members began performing procedures themselves . Between 1969 and 1973 , the members of the group provided more than 11,000 safe abortions , according to Laura Kaplan , author of " The Story of Jane . " <p> The Rubella ( or German measles ) outbreak in the United States between 1964 and 1965 posed significant dangers to unborn children and played a big part in changing the conversation about abortion in the United States . <p> With the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973 , the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortions in this country . <p> Now , in Latin America , where the Zika virus is threatening pregnancies , women there are seeking abortions at higher rates , a new study shows . <p> In most of those affected countries , though , abortion is highly restricted and , in regularly monitor these comments . <h> Germany game will 
 the undisputed financial capital of Europe , but that status is now clearly in doubt . <p> Many global banks use Britain as a springboard for their business throughout the EU . Banks that set up business in one EU country can automatically operate across the entire bloc , without having to apply for additional permits . <p> Leaving the union may disrupt this link , with some high-profile EU officials already calling the so-called " passporting rights " of U.K. banks into question . <p> There 's another problem : Much of the global trade in euros takes place in London , despite the U.K. opting out of the currency used by 19 members of the EU . The city handles transactions worth trillions of euros -- currencies , shares , bonds and other financial contracts . <p> Britain went to court last year to stop the European Central Bank forcing some of that business to take place in the eurozone . The bank and EU leaders may now try again to correct what they see as an anomaly . <p> Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem , a key euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe would be the " price " Britain would pay for Brexit . Speaking to Dutch TV station RTL on Friday , Dijsselbloem said rival financial centers like Amsterdam and Frankfurt would benefit . <p> The governor of the Bank of France also questioned London 's future as the financial capital of Europe . <p> " If tomorrow , Britain is not part of the internal market , the City can not keep its European passport , " Villeroy de Galhau told a French radio station on Saturday , using the moniker for London 's financial district . He heads the French central bank and is a member of European Central Bank 's governing council . <p> The uncertainty is already hitting the banks . Shares in financial companies like HSBC , Lloyds Bank , Standard Chartered and RBS were among the biggest losers as markets went into a free fall on Friday . Major U.S.-based banks with global businesses , like JPMorgan and Citigroup , were also hit hard by selling from investors . <p> The U.K. government could try to negotiate full access to the EU for British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country stays a member of the single EU market . <p> And that would in turn require the U.K. to agree to the principle of free movement of people -- something that those campaigning for Britain to leave the bloc firmly rejected ahead of the vote . <p> Britain has already lost an influential voice in Brussels , after Britain 's EU commissioner , Jonathan Hill , resigned over the weekend . He was in charge of the financial services portfolio within the commission , which proposes European laws and enforces them . Latvian commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis will now take over the crucial post . <p> Losing access to the rest of Europe would hurt not just the banks , but also the wider U.K. economy . The financial and related services sector accounts for 12% of the country 's GDP . <p> London is the world 's No. 1 location for trading in foreign currencies . More than 40% of the world 's foreign exchange trades take place in the city . <p> The U.K. has the fourth-largest banking and third-biggest insurance sectors globally , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold and derivatives , which allow investors to hedge their bets . <p> Brexit could also put at risk the planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange by Deutsche Boerse , which operates the main German stock market in Frankfurt . <p> Many big banks warned ahead of the vote that they could be forced to relocate some jobs away from the U.K. if the country leaves the EU . On Friday , several big banks hinted at the possibility . JPMorgan said it " may need to make changes to the location of some roles , " while Morgan Stanley said it may " adjust " its business to the new environment . Neither bank said it had already started making changes . <p> " A sizable portion of activity in Britain 's financial sector is likely to be repatriated across different parts of the EU , affecting the U.K. economy and sterling , " said Karthik Sankaran , global strategy director at Eurasia Group . <p> There is no shortage of European cities keen to jump on the opportunity to take business away from London .

 leads long-time leader Mickelson by one stroke at 12-under with a five-shot cushion back to nearest chaser Bill Haas of America going into the final day . <p> Stenson , 40 , an accomplished Tour winner , former world No. 2 and three-time Ryder Cup star , is bidding to become the first Scandinavian man to win a major title . <p> Mickelson , 46 , is chasing a sixth major title and first win since clinching the Open at Muirfeld in 2013 . <p> The tussle at Troon on a blustery , mizzly Saturday was reminiscent of the famous " Duel in the Sun " Open featuring Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson down the road at Turnberry in 1977 . Except in much worse weather . <p> Mickelson led by one starting out but Stenson quickly joined the American as co-leader at the first hole and by the fourth was clear on his own . <p> It was like the maverick against the machine . Mickelson was erratic off tee and fairway , but scrambled time and again to save par . Stenson was cool and metronomic , gently applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " So he is human , " muttered a Scots voice in the crowd beside the sixth green as the Swede missed a tiddler for par . <p> Mickelson had to come into the green from beyond a TV tower in the left rough , but for " Lefty " it comes with the territory and he made another par the hard way . You ca n't be swashbuckling if you do n't buckle now and again . <p> " I was off today . I did n't have my best stuff , " he said . " My rhythm was a little quick and I was jumpy . It could have been a day that got away from me , instead I shot under par and kept myself right in it so I 'm proud of that . " <p> By now the spectators sensed there was only one game in town and the galleries around the last group swelled to final-day volume .

Flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ups , while handing used balls to kids behind the ropes endears him to multiple generations . <p> Stenson is a lesser-known quantity to the public although privately deadpan funny but as a three-time European Ryder Cup player he had plenty of followers . <p> By coincidence victory for Stenson would also reverse the fortunes of 2013 at Muirfield when Mickelson came past at a clip in the final round to win his first Claret Jug and fifth major . <p> " It would be great to hand one back to him , " said Stenson , when reminded of the occasion afterwards . <p> The maverick turned the tables on the Postage Stamp short eighth , catching the fringe with his tee shot as Stenson 's ball plunged into the front bunker . A par to a bogey put the American back in front . <p> More driving trouble for Phil on the 12th as his tee shot ran through the fairway into a gorse bush . He hacked out and his approach span back sufficiently close to make his par putt . Mickelson let out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one . <p> " Some days it 's easy and it looks pretty like the first couple , and some days it 's hard and looks terrible like today but either way I shot three rounds under par , " he said . <p> The Californian ramped up his celebrations a notch with a big uppercut fist pump when his first birdie of the day dropped on the 13th to grab a two-shot lead . <p> But like boxers landing scoring punches they traded the lead again until by 18 the robot had fully rebooted to sit atop the leaderboard . <p> Mickelson dismissed the notion that Sunday would be a straight head-to-head , although Stenson suggested he would have one eye on the American , one on the course . <p> " I enjoy his company , " he said of his rival . " He 's always fun to watch . He hits some spectacular shots and he 's a great competitor . So it 's inspiring . I know I 'll have to bring my best .

That 's because Gaston is also the Benton County representative for the Salvation Army . <p> And he got a firsthand look at what it cost to provide just a few days in a motel for the 48 families who lost homes in the storm and needed a temporary place to stay . <p> " We do n't know exactly how many we had but the motels were full and you 're figuring $80 a night so maybe $15,000 for the first week , " Gaston said . <p> But after the initial rush to help Vinton tornado victims find both temporary and permanent housing , Gaston thought there had to be a better way to respond to the next disaster .

 <p> Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country , The Associated Press has found . <p> Advertisement <p> About 700 of these men are confined to vessels in Honolulu , some making less than $1 an hour to catch premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America 's most upscale restaurants and grocery stores . <p> In this unique fishing arrangement , Hawaii 's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 for each crew member sent from abroad . Because the workers do n't have visas , they are n't allowed to arrive at Honolulu 's airport . Instead , they 're flown to foreign ports and put on fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii . <p> Story highlights <p> -- Hawaii 's premium fish is sold everywhere from Costco and Sam 's Club to Trump International Hotel Waikiki <p> An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman says agents found no situations that legally justified criminal charges related to working conditions <p> Before they start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get that , Hawaii requires that they are " lawfully admitted " to the U.S. As proof of legal admission , state officials point to landing permits issued to all fishermen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents when the men arrive at the dock . <p> Here 's the hitch : AP has learned Customs agents stamp " refused " on all the landing permits , which voids them . So instead of being " lawfully admitted , " the fishermen are actually barred by law from setting foot in the U.S. <p> " Try taking a check to your bank that says ' void ' on it and telling them , ' Oh , but they wrote the check to me , ' " said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins , who advocates for the workers . <p> Nonetheless , in a written opinion , Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are " lawfully admitted .

A draft of the findings , published online , finds some fishermen have contracts requiring them to pay for replacement workers if they break their agreements , or facing $5,000 fines for absconding more than a year 's salary for some . <p> " There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay , " the report says . <p> However , the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains .

 <p> Parents are addressing bullying issues in the Winterset School District after a teenager killed himself amid nationwide controversy over the popular Netflix show " 13 Reasons Why . " <p> The show chronicles the story of a 17-year-old high school student named Hannah who kills herself and leaves behind 13 tapes explaining why she did it . <p> But Winterset parents said there are more realistic problems than a TV show affecting their children . <p> School officials sent out a letter this week warning parents of the show , which is based on the novel by Jay Asher and depicts graphic scenes of drug use , sexual assault and suicide . The letter said administrators are closely monitoring the students , especially after the recent tragedy . <p> " The bullying just needs to stop , " said Tiffany Putnam , who transferred her son to a different school district for what she calls a bullying epidemic in the Winterset schools . " It 's out of control . " <p> She said her heart sank when she received an email from the school district about a teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same grade as her son . <p> " First thing I thought about ( was ) , ' That could have been my son , ' " Putnam said . <p> District officials warn parents that even if their child is not watching the Netflix series , they could be hearing about it from their peers and that counselors and administrators are addressing concerns anyone may have . <p> Critics say though the show has good intentions , it glamorizes teen suicide and glosses over serious issues . <p> But some parents told KCCI that the TV show had nothing to do with the teen 's death , which they say stemmed from deep-rooted bullying in the district . <p> " I do not think it 's that TV show . I just do n't , " Putnam said . <p> " I think every person who commits suicide has a different reason , " said Sheryl Moore , whose son , A.J. Betts , killed himself four years ago . " I am appreciative of the fact that it is causing people to talk about suicide more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in when A.J. committed suicide . " <p> Chris Wilson , the well-being coordinator for the Johnston School District , said the series may be overwhelming for some teenagers to watch . <p> " This is something you might want to watch with your kids , " Wilson said . " The suicide scene is amazingly graphic , and it can be a trigger for young people who have struggled with mental health issues in the past or are struggling now . " <p> Wilson suggested using the TV show as an opportunity to talk to young adolescents about the reality of suicide versus some of the unrealistic portrayals in the show . <p> " There 's not the real pain that goes with it , " Wilson said . " The way the show is shown from different perspectives , it almost seems like she is still living sometimes , and so she is speaking even though she has already died , which is kind of a dangerous perspective to give young people . " <p> The series has generated the social media hashtag in which users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . <p> " Their brains just work differently than ours , so the way we perceive something as an adult , we ca n't assume young people are going to perceive things the same way , " Wilson said . " Their perception of risk is very different than ours . " <p> " I 've often wondered , if I lived somewhere other than Iowa , would A.J. still be alive right now ? " Moore said . " So I welcome the opportunity to have a discussion about the mental health support system in Iowa . " <p> Selena Gomez , who is an executive producer of " 13 Reasons Why , " has defended the graphic content , saying in part , " We wanted to do it in a way where it was honest , and we wanted to make something that could hopefully help people , because suicide should never , ever be an option . " <p> " As a society , we tend to shy away from these hard topics , and sometimes in cinema we do that , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bryce in the series . " I think this is great because it says , ' No , this is a problem and it needs to be addressed . ' " <p> " This school is out of control , " one email to KCCI read . " The bullying has gotten out of hand . It was n't because of some TV show . " <p> " The Winterset Community School District has a huge bullying issue and it needs to stop , " read another email . <p> A parent said , " We as a community of Winterset need to take a stand . " <p> Putnam said there is going to be bullying in every school , but she wants school leaders to address the problem . <p> " It hurts . It 's just painful , " she said . " I want to hold my kids close tonight and let them know that it 's not OK . It 's not OK to be bullied . " <p> KCCI contacted the superintendent multiple times Friday , but calls were not returned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of suicide , they can call the Suicide Crisis Line at . <p> You can also download a free app ( http : ) to help a friend who may be contemplating suicide . <p> Wilson has also created a blog ( http : ) discussing the series . <p> Read the full letter here : <p> Dear Parents - We were informed this morning that a WHS sophomore student committed suicide .

Parrish argued that 911 call recordings prove that Soules met the requirements of Iowa law in the crash , and should not be charged with leaving the scene . <p> Audio released last week by the Buchanan County Sheriff 's office shows Soules telling a dispatcher that he " rear-ended a guy on a tractor " at 8:20 p.m . Monday near the northern Iowa town of Aurora . <p> In a motion filed Tuesday , state prosecutors argued against a dismissal of charges , saying the court has already determined " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been committed and the defendant committed it " at the Defendant 's Initial Appearance on April 25 , 2017 . <p> The prosecution argues that in order to be in compliance with the law , Soules was to " immediately return to the scene of the accident or inform the law enforcement authorities where he could be located . " Prosecutors say Soules did neither . <p> " Furthermore , the only permissible reasons for which Defendant could leave the scene of the accident in the first place was to seek necessary aid or report the accident to law enforcement . " In this case , prosecutors say , Soules did neither . <p> Prosecutors also said in Soules ' motion to dismiss , he made no attempt to obfuscate his identity . However , prosecutors say he " did attempt to obfuscate the immediate facts and circumstances surrounding the accident , including a determination of his level of intoxication and an explanation of the empty and partially consumed open alcoholic beverages located in and around his vehicle that he was seen purchasing at a convenience store shortly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unconscious in a ditch . The call shows that other people were there . Authorities say Soules left before emergency responders was arrested later at his Arlington farm several miles away . He is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly crash . He was released from jail Tuesday after posting bond . <p> A statement issued last week through a spokesman says that his attorneys are " confident that once all the evidence is made public , it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to aid Mr. Mosher.

 <p> As Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad prepares to step down from office to become a U.S. diplomat , he 's highlighted what he sees as his administration 's successes in recent years . <p> Advertisement <p> They include a low unemployment rate , multibillion-dollar private-sector investments and a slate of workforce initiatives . The results are more mixed when considering four goals he promised when he returned to office in 2011 . <p> Branstad , the longest-serving governor in U.S. history in his 23rd year on the job , is expected to resign soon to become ambassador to China . A Senate vote to confirm his nomination could happen as early as this week . <p> Branstad wanted to achieve these objectives by 2016 : 200,000 new jobs ; a 15 percent reduction in the cost of government ; a 25 percent increase in family incomes ; and having the nation 's best schools . <p> Last year , Branstad aides said the governor met the job goal and the others needed more work . His administration still notes those goals but now emphasizes other successes , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and job programs aimed at veterans and post-high school education . <p> Ben Hammes , Branstad 's spokesman , said the goals have n't all been achieved but that Branstad , " would tell you that we have made substantial progress in all the areas . " <p> In assessing Branstad 's success since returning to government in 2011 , Senate Democratic leader Rob Hogg , of Cedar Rapids , emphasized the most recent session , when the Republican governor worked with GOP majorities in both legislative chambers on a host of conservative bills . <p> Hogg notes Branstad signed measures reducing collective bargaining rights for public employees and prohibiting local governments from raising the minimum hourly wage . With those measures in mind , Hogg called Branstad 's efforts on family incomes " a miserable failure . " <p> " They have not pursued policies that have provided for broad economic growth , " Hogg said . <p> Jeff Kaufmann , chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa , applauded the governor 's accomplishments and said he expects Lt. Gov . Kim Reynolds to keep up the good work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . <p> " I see no indication that there is not going to be continued progression to meet those goals and surpass those goals , " he said . <p> Here 's a look at the four goals : <p> 200,000 NEW JOBS <p> Asked recently about the objectives , the 70-year-old Branstad said , " We exceeded our goal of 200,000 new jobs . " Then he noted the 3.1 percent unemployment rate , far less than the 5.7 percent rate when he returned to office in January 2011 . <p> The U.S. Labor Department 's data on current employment statistics show Iowa added nearly 85,000 private sector jobs between January 2011 and January 2016 , though the Iowa Policy Project has noted other data showcasing that it 's closer to 105,000 . Branstad 's office points to statistics from Iowa Workforce Development , which highlighted more than 206,000 new jobs had been reached by December 2015 . The figure does n't take into account net growth , or jobs lost in that time . <p> Hammes said the administration has always been up front about not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF GOVERNMENT <p> Branstad 's administration cited data from the Iowa Department of Management to note about 2,300 fewer state employees today than in January 2011 . But the figure does n't include employees at Iowa 's three public universities , staff overseeing that system under the Board of Regents , the courts system , the Iowa Legislature or community-based corrections . Hammes said those areas of state government are not part of the executive branch . <p> Hammes would n't specify what statistics would measure a 15 percent reduction . The cost of running state government has increased , from about $6 billion in the budget year that ended in 2012 to roughly $7.2 billion for the upcoming spending year . <p> 25 PERCENT INCREASE IN FAMILY INCOME <p> Branstad 's office measures family income as per capita personal income tracked by the U.S. Department of Commerce and its Bureau of Economic Analysis . Hammes said Iowa 's personal income had a nearly 20 percent growth in the five-year span . The latest data indicates that percentage is now about 24 percent . <p> Those numbers include wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment benefits and Social Security . <p> Hammes added when compared to the rest of the country , " we are doing quite well . " <p> The same bureau in March released annual personal income data by state that showed Iowa ranked 42nd , with 2.3 percent growth in 2016 over 2015 . <p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the median household income in 2015 was about $53,000 . It was a little over $50,000 in 2011 . <p> BEST SCHOOLS IN THE NATION <p> The goal to make Iowa 's schools the best in the nation is difficult to track since additional parameters were n't set . The state spends roughly $3 billion on K-12 education , and Branstad 's office pointed to gradual funding increases over the years . They also noted an investment in teacher leadership training . <p> That has n't been enough to quell complaints that spending has n't kept up with inflation , leading educators to say it 's led to layoffs and larger classroom sizes . In 2017 , Iowa 's three public universities collectively cut about $30 million mid-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will lead to increases in student tuition . 
 <p> Storms are likely to develop in the early afternoon along the northern border of the state , moving eastward . A second round of storms is likely late , in the northern part of the state .

Marco Mendez , 19 , said he was placed in the Rays ' foster home four years ago and that he watched them terrorize Sabrina Ray for months . The two spent eight months together in the Perry home in 2013 , he said . <p> " She was really sweet , " Mendez said as he fought back tears . " Sabrina was the main one who got beat the most . " <p> She endured intense physical abuse at the hands of her adoptive parents and she would be kept from eating , Mendez said . <p> " Sabrina would take the trash out , " Mendez said . " She would be so hungry that she would eat out of the garbage . Like old food . Trash ( that ) has probably been there like a week .

Another kid has fallen through the cracks , ' " said Sen.

 <p> Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek on Saturday characterized the recent rise in homicidal violence as a " behavioral problem " that starts in the home , a sharp comment made hours after the city 's 16th homicide this year . <p> Advertisement <p> Authorities in Ames apprehended 50-year-old Harold Dudley , who is accused of shooting and killing his estranged wife , 36-year-old Mary Dudley around 9:30 a.m. in her apartment in the 1500 block of Evergreen Avenue on Des Moines ' south side . <p> The suspect has since been transferred into the custody of the Des Moines Police Department . He was taken to the Polk County Jail and been charged with first-degree murder and first-degree burglary . <p> Parizek said the violence stemmed from a domestic-related incident , though he did n't elaborate on the suspect 's motive nor did he say what firearm was used in the shooting . He confirmed that Harold and Mary Dudley were married but living apart at the time of the shooting . <p> When asked if access to guns contributed to the uptick in deadly shootings , Parizek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes too far into legislative issues , but we 're a right-to-carry state . We unfortunately find a lot of legally possessed firearms used in crimes these days . That 's a problem . " <p> He said police officers try their best to prevent crime on the backside , but education and prevention starts in the home , and communication among family members and neighbors is key to curbing potential tragedies from happening . <p> That proved to be the case in Dudley 's arrest after neighbors -- with whom the victim grew well-acquainted , Parizek said -- when authorities were able to quickly locate the suspect vehicle based on the description they were given . <p> " It 's to my understanding that the victim had great support from her neighbors with some ongoing domestic issues , " Parizek said . <p> Neighbors told KCCI that the couple lived at the apartment building for two months and they seemed like relatively quiet residents . <p> Online court records , however , show Dudley has had numerous run-ins with law enforcement agencies . In 2006 , he pleaded guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual abuse . <p> Des Moines police , along with city leaders , announced last month a pool of money , which was collected from nearby businesses and private donors , has been reserved to use in violence crime cases as an incentive for people who come forward with information that would help lead to an arrest . <p> " Right now , it seems we are hitting a roadblock with people willing to come forward with information , so this is kind of an innovative way to create that incentive , " Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert said . <p> The money , however , wo n't be handed out freely . <p> " The nice thing about this funding is that we are able to get people in front of us and vet their information before we start going out rewarding money and then also manage that fund accordingly , " Parizek said . <p> Though the initiative did n't appear to be instrumental in Dudley 's arrest , it fosters a discussion about city violence and how to better protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue ; it 's behavioral control . And we need to focus our efforts on behavior control -- making sure people know what 's acceptable and what 's not and that starts at home , " Parizek said . " Sometimes , ( violence is ) just going to happen , and there 's no excuse for it to happen . It 's certainly not acceptable to us , but it 's an unfortunate part of our lives right now . " 
 <p> The boss of Qatar Airways has accused the U.S. of fanning the flames of a dispute between the country and its Gulf neighbors . <p> Advertisement <p> Akbar Al Baker told CNNMoney 's Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios that the decision by Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and other states to severe diplomatic and transport links with Qatar amounted to an " illegal " blockade that the U.S. should be doing its best to resolve . <p> President Trump has endorsed the decision of Gulf nations to ostracize Qatar , even as U.S. Cabinet officials have said it is hurting the campaign against ISIS . <p> " I do n't want to comment about Trump , " Al Baker said in an interview in Doha . " I am extremely disappointed . " <p> " The U.S. should be the leader trying to break this blockade and not sitting and watching what 's going on and putting fuel on the fire , " he added . <p> Qatar Airways has been hit hard by the dispute , with 18 destinations now out of bounds for the airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UAE of supporting terrorism , claims that the tiny state has rejected in the strongest terms . <p> In addition to closing their airspace to Qatar Airways , Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also shut down the airline 's offices . <p> " It is actually a travesty of civilized behavior to close airline offices . Airlines offices are not political arms , " said Al Baker . " We were sealed as if it was a criminal organization . We were not allowed to give refunds to our passengers . " <p> He accused the Gulf countries of violating a 1944 convention that the UAE and Bahrain have signed . <p> Any country party to the convention should grant freedoms including " the privilege to fly across its territory without landing , " according to the International Civil Aviation Organization , an agency of the United Nations which administers the Chicago convention . <p> " We have legal channels to object to this , " Al Baker said .

 <h> Related Content <p> Neighbors . They 're such a roll of the dice , am I right ? Sometimes you end up with good ones , people who you get together with on Friday nights in someone 's garage to enjoy a cold brew . Sometimes you end up with the kind you spy on from your window , imagining they 've killed their spouse , only to end up being right , but there 's nothing you can do about it being stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg . OK , that might be a tad specific , but you get my point . <p> What if you see a neighbor doing something awful ? What is your recourse in that situation ? Do you say nothing , convincing yourself it 's none of your business , or do you step in and speak up about it ? Will getting involved help things or just exacerbate things ? Even if you do get someone to listen , will your efforts get stalled due to other peoples ' apathy or personal connections ? These are the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Naomi Watts ) is a single mother of two boys , Henry and Peter ( Jaeden Lieberher and Jacob Tremblay ) . Henry , the oldest , is a genius whose intelligence far exceeds his 11 years of age . He 's always tinkering with projects in a clubhouse in the woods behind their house . He 's also the de facto adult of the house , since Susan is unsure of her ability to be a parent . She 's content with living her protracted childhood of a life , filled with waitressing , playing video games and more-than-occasionally getting drunk with her best friend Sheila ( Sarah Silverman ) . <p> Christina ( Maddie Ziegler ) is a girl in Henry 's class who lives next door . Her mom has passed and she lives with her stepfather Glenn ( Dean Norris ) , the town 's police commissioner . Henry has seen enough evidence from his bedroom window , as well as observing what he knows are signs in the changes in Christina 's patterns and behavior , that he 's certain Glenn is abusing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get charges brought up , but keeps getting stonewalled . Therefore , Henry devises a plan on how to make Glenn pay permanently . <p> Before he 's able to put his plan in motion , Henry falls seriously i 'll . He has outlined everything in a notebook and on an audio tape , like a gruesome version of the Rube Goldberg devices he 's constructed in his clubhouse . The only thing left is to convince his mother to carry out the plan in his stead . <p> The Book of Henry is nowhere near your typical summer entertainment . This is a very heavy film that , as I 've looked around the internet at other reviews , has really evoked strong reactions . I can thoroughly understand these feelings , especially since there 's a certain aspect to the story that I was n't prepared for and evoked emotions that I try to avoid due to personal reasons . So , for some -- well , most , apparently -- I 'm guessing they are reacting to the manipulative nature of the film 's story . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that the story worked . Yes , it does use your own emotions against you to pull you along with it , but any drama is going to try this tactic . Most movies just do n't wear it as blatantly on their sleeve as this one . It 's a tricky path to tread , since people tend to react poorly when they are aware of being emotionally manipulated . <p> I do agree that things could 've been handled with a little more subtlety , grace or tact . Director Colin Trevorrow ( Jurassic World ) has proven he can handle a small , personal film well with his wonderful feature debut Safety Not Guaranteed . He uses a heavier hand to present this story , but even so , the end result was satisfying to me . <p> Another side to look at , as well , is how would we feel if the story had let the 11-year-old carry out the plan , rather than devising a way to pass the duties off to an adult ? Would that have made things better , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . <p> The Book of Henry is not going to be for everyone , and I 'm certain plenty of you will either not care for it or outright despise it . I still say give it a chance . Who knows with this type of film ? It may just surprise you .
